Texto completo: President Trump's defense team spent more than 10 hours over three days alternately trying to dispute the facts of the impeachment case and going on the political offensive against one of his leading 2020 rivals.
But in the final minutes of the presentation, Trump's lead attorney returned to a subtle, but critically important, subtheme of their argument: Let the voters decide the president's fate.
Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, closed out Tuesday with a break-the-glass strategy designed to steer even the most skeptical of Trump's Republican critics away from calling witnesses or even considering voting to convict the president.
'Most importantly, most importantly,' Cipollone said, explaining what he asked of them, 'to respect and defend the sacred right of every American to vote and to choose their president. The election is only months away. The American people are entitled to choose their president.'
This has always been the ultimate fallback strategy for Trump's lawyers. Even if senators find the president guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, they should not administer Trump the political death penalty because the 2020 campaign has already begun.
So much so that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) bolted once Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. gaveled Tuesday's session shut before 3 p.m., the earliest weekday ending so far, giving her enough time to race to Iowa to campaign ahead of Monday's critical caucus in the fight for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
This line of defense became more critical after Sunday's New York Times report that former national security adviser John Bolton had sent a book manuscript to the White House for review, including allegations that Trump ordered nearly $400-million in security aid to be withheld until Ukraine announced investigations that would benefit the president politically.
What had seemed like a glide path to witness blocking and swift acquittal, perhaps by Saturday, hit a roadblock as GOP senators voiced new concern about hearing what Bolton had to say.
The White House had stonewalled the House probe, denying evidence and witnesses.
On Saturday, in their brief opening remarks, Trump's legal team referred to the effort to remove the president as its own form of 'massive election interference,' the very accusation lodged against Trump for his actions with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
By Monday evening, Cipollone gave a more direct 'let the voters decide' mantra, a position he returned to in his closing remarks Tuesday afternoon.
It almost gave license to GOP senators to, preferably in hushed tones, admit that the president might have done something wrong but that the ultimate jury is the American people, who will cast their ballots in November.
But Cipollone's client " famous for labeling 'perfect' a call to Zelensky that set off this investigation " is not willing to cede an inch of ground when it comes to right and wrong.
He does not want Republicans to admit he did anything wrong in his bid to pressure Zelensky to start investigations into Trump's political rivals, which has left Republicans in an awkward dance outside the Senate chamber.
The anti-Russia hawks have struggled the most trying to explain Trump's delay of $391-million in congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine " in the midst of the fight against Russian aggression, they feared angering a president to whom loyalty among GOP voters is fierce.
By Tuesday, they finally felt a little more free to simply defend the president by saying that nothing he did warrants his removal from office. Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity lawyer and emeritus Harvard law professor, spent an hour Monday evening outlining his belief that nothing Trump had been accused of necessitated his ouster from office.
Citing Dershowitz's discussion of 'corrupt motive,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) explained that any president who is doing something that is constitutionally acceptable " such as leveraging foreign aid for a nation to fight corruption " is within his rights even if the demand is one that will benefit the president personally.
'There may be mixed purposes; one, policy-wise, and the other political,' Cornyn said, paraphrasing Dershowitz's defense.
Does Cornyn acknowledge that Trump's bigger motivation was to influence his own 2020 reelection?
'At best there were mixed motives, that there was a policy decision that had incidental, personal political benefits,' Cornyn said. 'But if that's the standard, then you're going to make impeachment the new normal, and we might as well kiss elections goodbye.'
It was not quite a full admission that Trump did something wrong, but Republicans finally felt that Dershowitz had given them a legal basis for their decisions to block witnesses and ultimately vote to acquit the president.
But, in between their attacks on former vice president Joe Biden's family and relitigating 2016 controversies, his legal team found ways to circle back to their slightly more reasonable position for those Republicans who feel that Trump has acted against U.S. interests in Ukraine.
'At the end of the day, the most important thought is this: This choice belongs to the American people. They will get to make it months from now,' Cipollone said during Monday's closing remarks.
He argued that there was 'no basis' in the facts of the case or the Constitution, but the experienced lawyer understood that a critical bloc of his jury felt uncomfortable with the latest development regarding Bolton.
So, he went to back to the fail-safe answer: 'I would urge you to quickly come to that conclusion so we can go have an election.'
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a hawk on matters related to Russia, appreciated that touch because he felt that the bar for impeaching and removing a president is higher than for federal judges serving lifetime appointments.
'Which has been historically the place on elective office. That's what it was for Johnson,' Lankford said before Tuesday's session started.
In 1868, when Congress was dominated by Republicans, they tried to impeach Andrew Johnson in a highly politicized setting. Just a few Senate votes saved Johnson, who went on to lose the Democratic nomination later that year, as Ulysses S. Grant won the election.
So, knowing the vast majority of GOP votes were in his pocket, Cipollone ended his pitch Tuesday by aiming at those few wavering Republicans and possibly one or two Democrats.
'The American people are entitled to choose their president,' he said. 'Overturning the last election and massively interfering with the upcoming one would cause serious and lasting damage.'

Texto completo: It was the kind of moment a courtroom sketch artist patiently waits for " then pounces upon.
The Senate impeachment trial of President Trump is highly restricted to press " even the limited footage comes from cameras controlled by the Senate. So history is counting on the old-school methods of courtroom artists to capture what we cannot see.
On Jan. 21, that out-of-camera view included Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) seemingly falling asleep for about 15 minutes during the session.
Veteran court artist Art Lien quickly went to work.
'I was looking exactly for something like that,' says Lien, who had 'no doubt' Risch was dozing. (A Risch spokesman told the Wall Street Journal the senator was just listening intently.) 'As I was drawing, his head was sinking lower and lower. I wished I'd started even sooner.'
Because there are no photos of the scene, Lien's image was what made the rounds on social media.
Lien, based in Baltimore, began working for NBC News in 1980, and is covering the trial for the New York Times. He's one of three court artists inside the chamber, along with Virginia-based artist Bill Hennessy, whose clients include CBS and CNN, and Dana Verkouteren, drawing for the Associated Press.
Returning to the chamber takes Lien and Hennessy back to when they covered President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.
Neither artist had been inside the Senate chamber since then. 'It was striking to be back in that building,' Hennessy says, 'and recognize that I'd done a drawing from this angle.'
'I felt like it was my youth,' adds Hennessy, 62, who studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and American University. 'There is a little bit of reminiscing going on. I'm actually sitting in the same seat I did back then.'
The modern era of courtroom sketch artistry launched in the 1960s. Howard Brodie " the 'patron saint' of their profession, Lien says " famously covered the 1964 sentencing of Lee Harvey Oswald murderer Jack Ruby. Lien and Hennessy have often been witnesses to history in more conventional criminal and civil trials, yet Lien says he hopes that his many sketches from inside the Supreme Court " sometimes featured on SCOTUSblog " will stand as his legacy.
Lien, 68, graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art in the 1970s and had only worked one trial before Brodie 'got me my first job for CBS,' pencil in hand inside the Supreme Court and Senate, he says.
Today, much has changed. 'It is a lot more difficult to move around,' Lien says, and there's 'more press.'
Lien says he brings just pens and paper into the chamber; he's not even allowed to bring his small watercolor set past the detectors. 'Maybe it's the metal,' Lien says with a laugh.
From Lien and Hennessy's distant vantage point in the press section of the balcony, on the Republican side, it's challenging to see the politicians closely. 'I'm looking at the top of their heads,' Lien says of many of the senators. He uses a monocular to get a magnified view.
'The most fun I've had is drawing the press, partly because I'm close,' Lien says. 'Although Bernie Sanders is fun to draw because of his body language " hunched over. Everyone knows him. I just wish he would stand up and start talking.'
Verkouteren sits across the way from the others, on the Democrats' side. Because space is tight, she's had to leave her usual rag paper " measuring nearly 2 by 3 feet " at home. Instead, she sets up with smaller paper, brush pen, water-based markers and colored pencils " applying watercolor only after she leaves the room. She also totes erasable FriXion pens for the occasion, because the ability to erase lines while drawing live on deadline, she says, suits 'the way I think and see.'
Verkouteren takes a nonpartisan approach to the trial " 'It's about trying to get that right moment and be fair and never taking sides,' she says " and she finds that Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and White House counsel Pat Cipollone are similarly appealing to render. As physical performers, she says, they 'are very present and very alive.'
Verkouteren, 60, studied at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., and began sketching legal proceedings in the early 1980s, including at the Supreme Court. And one lesson she has learned is to focus on the truth revealed apart from what is being said.
'I enjoy what comes across in faces and body language,' says Verkouteren, who is based in Cabin John, Md.. She seeks the candid aspects of movement, because 'the body doesn't lie.'
In the Senate chamber last week, other members of the press pause to gawk at the sketch artists. They're a curiosity " a symbol of a pre-digital time. 'It's a completely Luddite field,' says New York-based court artist Elizabeth Williams, co-author of 'The Illustrated Courtroom: 50 Years of Court Art.'
Courtroom art enjoyed a heyday half a century ago, and some industry experts say it is a fading art form. 'It's not like it used to be,' says Williams, whose live-sketch subjects include Trump and Paul Manafort. 'One reason is because of all the cameras in courtrooms now. And news budgets have contracted [because] people are getting news from many sources.'
Yet these seasoned artists now have a certain cachet. Decades ago, 'we were looked down upon,' Lien says. 'Now, it's like we're something special. Senate reporters are constantly coming up to us, taking pictures with their cellphones.
'They say: 'You're doing that without Photoshop or anything!' '
Yet unless a sketch goes viral, people beyond the courthouse tend to overlook the role of the artist.
'Americans rarely stop to think about the talent and energy that goes into that three-second pan [across the sketches] on the television evening news, or the image that accompanies the newspaper article,' says Sara Duke, who in 2017 curated the Library of Congress exhibit 'Drawing Justice.' 'But there is a certain amount of genius that goes into rendering a likeness quickly. These images, whether we realize it or not, stay with us " it's how we remember our collective legal past.'
And as this impeachment trial unfolds, it is Lien, Hennessy and Verkouteren who serve as our artistic witnesses to history.
Last week, Lien sketched Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), showing how the politician wears stylish dress shoes but no socks. Burr made the sketch his profile image on Twitter.
That led to another occasional source of revenue for a court artist: A Burr aide, Lien says, 'has asked to buy the original.'

Texto completo: A New York Times journalist was sent spyware linked to Saudi Arabia and embedded in a 2018 text message to his cellphone " the first American journalist known to have been targeted by such malware in what appears to be a growing global threat to journalists, dissidents and human rights activists, according to a new report.
The journalist, Ben Hubbard, learned about the attempted hack of his phone in October 2018, while covering a story about a Saudi dissident in Canada targeted by the same Pegasus spyware, according to Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School, which wrote the report.
The malware was created by an Israeli firm, NSO Group, which is the focus of heightened scrutiny over the alleged use of its products by authoritarian governments to target opponents, the report said.
'The targeting of yet another journalist " in this case at the New York Times " makes it clear that the current regulatory regime for the spyware industry is not working,' the report concludes.
Separately, Citizen Lab, a research organization, identified evidence suggesting that someone deploying NSO Group malware may have been infecting targets while employing a sham Washington Post website in the weeks leading up to and after the killing of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. While the timing overlaps with the killing, the two are not necessarily related, the report states.
'The Washington Post takes digital security seriously, and we work vigilantly and invest heavily to protect our systems and employees,' Kris Coratti, The Post's vice president of communications, said in a statement.
The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. NSO Group said in a statement that the firm last year 'worked closely' with Hubbard on the matter and shared 'conclusive results' with him, suggesting the spyware was not Pegasus. NSO Group called Hubbard's and Citizen Lab's claims 'unsubstantiated.' In a statement, New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said NSO Group did not tell Hubbard 'how it had come to this conclusion' or state for the record 'whether its technology had been used' to target Hubbard's phone.
The news comes in the wake of a U.N. report that asserted with 'medium to high confidence' that the smartphone of Washington Post owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos had been hacked after he received a link to an encrypted video via WhatsApp from Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.
Citizen Lab noted 'there is no overlap' between the timeline of the digital impersonation of The Post and the reported hack of Bezos's phone.
The surveillance technology in question is allegedly sold exclusively to governments for investigations into crime and terrorism, said Ron Deibert, Citizen Lab director. 'What we have found is that companies either are unwilling or unable to control how their government clients use it.'
Hubbard, now the Times's Beirut bureau chief, had written a number of stories about the Saudi government in 2018, revealing in March its use of coercion and abuse to seize the wealth of the kingdom's business elite.
'Efforts to intimidate journalists and potential sources should be of concern to everyone,' Rhoades Ha said in a separate statement.
In June 2018, Hubbard received a text message that read, 'Ben Hubbard and the story of the Saudi royal family,' with a link for a website, Arabnews365.com. That was a month after the malware was sent to Bezos's phone.
In an article in the Times Tuesday, Hubbard said he thought the link was 'fishy,' so he refrained from clicking. In October 2018, he shared an image of the link with the Citizen Lab. 'We are not able to determine whether his phone was successfully infected,' the researchers said in their report.
According to Hubbard, 'An examination of my phone turned up no indications that it had been compromised.' He noted that Citizen Lab researchers concluded he was 'targeted with powerful software sold by NSO Group . . . and deployed by hackers working for Saudi Arabia.'
At the time the text message was sent to Hubbard, the Arabnews365 website was active and was housed on a server known to deploy Pegasus software, and that server was used by an operator the researchers dubbed 'Kingdom,' the report said. Citizen Lab has concluded through earlier investigations that Kingdom is linked to Saudi Arabia.
Citizen Lab revealed in October 2018 that the cellphone of Saudi dissident Omar Abdulaziz, who lives in asylum in Canada, was hacked with Pegasus spyware. The tool is powerful, giving access to the victim's phone camera, text messages, emails and location information. The day after the report was issued, Khashoggi was killed.
Abdulaziz was working on several sensitive projects with Khashoggi, including one to build an online 'army' called 'the bees' inside Saudi Arabia to challenge pro-government trolls on the Internet, The Post reported at the time. Abdulaziz suspected that the Saudis used access to his phone to learn about these activities. 'They had everything,' he told The Post. 'They saw the messages between us. They listened to the calls.'
Abdulaziz is among several individuals and organizations that have sued NSO Group. Abdulaziz charges that the company allowed its product to be used to spy on him. Amnesty International filed suit in Israel asking the defense ministry to halt the sale of NSO spyware.
Facebook, which owns Whats App, sued the firm in October, alleging the company violated federal anti-hacking law when its malware was deployed on more than 1,400 cellphones last year. Citizen Lab, which helped Whats App in its analysis, found that of the devices targeted, at least 100 belonged to human rights advocates, journalists and other members of civil society around the world.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—In six days of arguments on the Senate floor, Democrats and the White House defense team sparred over whether the president abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress—and whether those actions would merit his removal from office.
President Trump's defense team on Tuesday concluded its three days of arguments in the impeachment trial, in which the lawyers sought to rebut Democrats' allegations of wrongdoing by the president and dismiss the investigation as a politically motivated stunt.
Their arguments followed three days of sessions in which Democrats, who sought to persuade senators of the urgent need to remove Mr. Trump—whom they described as a threat to democracy—from office. In one major development after the Democrats finished their arguments, the New York Times revealed that former national-security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book, wrote that Mr. Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations.
Here is a breakdown of the arguments the House Democratic impeachment managers made on key points, and how the Trump team responded:
Ukraine Aid
Impeachment Managers: The Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released in September without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. President Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book. Alan Dershowitz, a member of the Trump legal team, argued that even if the conversation did take place as Mr. Bolton described, it wouldn't amount to an impeachable offense.
July 25 Call
Impeachment Managers: Democrats said the White House sought to cover up a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president—in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son and alleged election interference—by moving the transcript to a classified server typically reserved for the nation's top secrets.
Trump's Defense: Lawyers said the White House wasn't seeking to hide the transcript of the July 25 phone call because it was both preserved on a White House server and, in September, made public. The lawyers also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump didn't link aid to investigations on the call.
Articles of Impeachment
Impeachment Managers: Aside from blocking aid, Democrats said, the president obstructed the impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony sought by House investigators—including that of Mr. Bolton.
Trump's Defense: The president's team argued the articles of impeachment are constitutionally deficient and overly broad. The lawyers also argued that Democrats don't allege that the president committed a crime, which they said is necessary to warrant removal from office. In past impeachments, lawyers—some of whom are now serving on Mr. Trump's team—have argued a crime wasn't necessary to impeach a president.
Trump's Removal From Office
Impeachment Managers: The president poses a national-security threat to the country and, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), an "imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy" and therefore must be removed prior to the 2020 election.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election in less than 10 months and the choice should be left to the voters. The lawyers also countered Democrats' calls for urgency in removing the president from office by noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited a month to turn over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Senate Witnesses
Impeachment Managers: Democrats argued the Senate should call new witnesses—among them Mr. Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney— who could offer first-hand accounts of the president's motivation for holding up aid to Ukraine.
Trump's Defense: The president's team said the House was responsible for collecting testimony and documents, and in voting for the articles of impeachment determined it had enough evidence to warrant the president's removal from office. Therefore there is no need to prolong the trial, they argued.

Over the weekend, the outbreak of a new and virulent strain of coronavirus, which has killed more than 100 people in China and infected more than 4,500 across the world since its discovery in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, arrived in the United States.
At least five cases of individuals sickened with the “2019 novel coronavirus” have been confirmed in the country, with two in Southern California and one each in Illinois, Washington and Arizona. Health officials in Canada announced on Tuesday that a British Columbia man in his 40s who regularly travels to China also has the disease. Another 110 people in 26 states “could” be infected and are “under investigation,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Meanwhile, the first known cases of human-to-human transmission have been documented in Germany and Japan.
And as pictures of empty streets in China and elected officials holding press conferences in facemasks circulate, the virus seems to have spread very far, very quickly. Confirmed cases of the disease nearly doubled overnight from Monday to Tuesday, from 2,800 to 4,500, and there could soon be many more. A plane carrying 240 American citizens out of Wuhan—diplomats stationed at the U.S. Consulate there along with their families—is scheduled to land at Ontario International Airport in Southern California.
Earlier plans to have that plane enter the United States in San Francisco, a more heavily populated city (and, just putting this out here, one of the settings for Contagion ), were scrapped because, well, people are freaked out about the coronavirus, which has infected people in areas as far removed from Wuhan as Germany.
“This is a serious public health threat,” the CDC’s website warned. “The fact that this virus has caused severe illness and sustained person-to-person spread in China is concerning, but it’s unclear how the situation in the United States will unfold at this time.”
So: Should you be freaked out? Probably not, unless you travel to central China, or know someone who has, or have a compromised immune system. Even then, it’s probably wise not to panic.
Officials in San Bernardino County, where Ontario is located, stress that passengers from Wuhan will be screened for the disease in Alaska, where their plane is stopping for refueling before it flies to Ontario, where they’ll be screened a second time. Anyone showing signs of the disease will be quarantined—and, as Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told the Los Angeles Times on Monday, the virus is “not spreading in the community” and the risk for most Americans is low.
What Is the Coronavirus?
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization both note, coronaviruses are a very large and very common “family” of viruses (if “beings” that are just strands of genetic code encased in protein can be called “beings”—really, do lose some of your workday reading about viruses). Most coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses in humans, like the common cold; some recently discovered examples cause very serious illnesses, including SARS.
Where Do They Come From?
Camels and bats, or at least these animals are frequently felled by coronavirus. However, viruses change and mutate, and it appears that several examples have evolved to where they can “jump” from animals to humans, and then infect other humans. This isn’t so rare—this is how swine flu, so named because it originated in pigs, became a thing for humans to freak out about.
The outbreak in Wuhan may have originated in an animal market in that city in December, which is leading to all kinds of very thin, extremely racist theories peddled by dimestore conspiracy theorists that Chinese peoples’ “weird diet” of bats and other creatures Westerners don’t eat is the cause of all this.
But the market may also not be where the virus originated. A paper published Friday in the medical journal The Lancet stated that 13 out of the 41 original cases documented in Wuhan “had no link” to the market, as Science magazine noted. In this analysis, the market is just like an airport or a city or some other mass gathering of people. “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,” Daniel Lucey, a Georgetown University researcher, told Science .
So, as for a definite source of this virus? We still don’t know, and won’t for some time. Anyone proffering theories or accusations with certainty is ignorant, or a con and liar. And really, it doesn’t matter all that much. By now, new and nasty strains of viruses appearing is a thing that happens every couple of years. SARS, swine flu, bird flu and now this. It’s not fun, or common, but you could absolutely call it “normal.”
So What Should I Do?
Unless you’re a public health official or a frequent flier to areas affected, there’s very little you can do. As The New York Times reported, travelers arriving from Wuhan are being screened, and there are no reports of viral transmissions in the U.S. Chinese officials are shuttering tourist sites and closing off avenues of transit, so if you had a big trip or vacation to the country planned, you may be out of luck. Major U.S. companies including Bloomberg, Facebook and General Motors have also banned their employees from visiting China while the epidemic is ongoing, as The New York Times reported.
As for the rest of us? There seem to be other things to worry about, and even if you do contract the virus, all is not lost. The case in Germany involves a 33-year-old man in Bavaria who, officials said, is in “good condition.” Another case in Japan, a man in his 60s, is hospitalized. As the CDC reported, “reported illnesses” from individuals with coronavirus have ranged from “little to no symptoms” to “severely ill and dying.” Symptoms do include fever and respiratory ailments, so if you have these, stay home from work (which you should be doing anyway) and seek medical attention if it seems particularly bad (which you should also be doing; hopefully you have good insurance).

Google will charge for data search warrants

Texto completo: Facing an increasing number of requests for its users' information, Google began charging law enforcement and other government agencies this month for legal demands seeking data such as emails, location-tracking information and search queries.
Google's fees range from $45 for a subpoena and $60 for a wiretap to $245 for a search warrant, according to a notice sent to law enforcement officials and reviewed by The New York Times. The notice also included fees for other legal requests.
A spokesman for Google said the fees were intended in part to help offset the costs of complying with warrants and subpoenas.
Federal law allows companies to charge the government reimbursement fees of this type, but Google's decision is a major change in how it deals with legal requests.
Some Silicon Valley companies have for years forgone such charges, which can be difficult to enforce at a large scale and could give the impression that a company aims to profit from legal searches. But privacy experts support such fees as a deterrent to overbroad surveillance.
Google has tremendous amounts of information on billions of users, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world routinely submit legal requests seeking that data. In the first half of 2019, the company received more than 75,000 requests for data on nearly 165,000 accounts worldwide; 1 in 3 of those requests came from the United States.
Google has previously charged for legal requests. A record from 2008 showed that the company sought reimbursement for a legal request for user data. But a spokesman said that for many years now, the tech firm had not systematically charged for standard legal processes.
The money brought in from the new fees would be inconsequential for Google. Just last week, the valuation of its parent company, Alphabet, topped $1 trillion for the first time. Alphabet is scheduled to report its latest financial results Feb. 3.
The new fees could help recover some of the costs required to fill such a large volume of legal requests, said A1 Gidari, a lawyer who for years represented Google and other technology and telecommunications companies.
The requests have also grown more complicated as tech companies have acquired more data and law enforcement has become more technologically sophisticated.
"None of the services were designed with exfiltrating data for law enforcement in mind," said Gidari, who is now the consulting privacy director at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.
Gidari also said it was good that the fees might result in fewer legal requests to the company. "The actual costs of doing wiretaps and responding to search warrants is high, and when you pass those costs on to the government, it deters from excessive surveillance," he said.
In April, the Times reported that Google had been inundated with a new type of search warrant request, known as geofence searches. Drawing on an enormous Google database called Sensorvault, they provide law enforcement with the opportunity to find suspects and witnesses using location data gleaned from user devices. Those warrants often result in information on dozens or hundreds of devices and require more extensive legal review than other requests.
A Google spokesman said that there was no specific reason the fees were announced this month and that they had been under consideration for some time.
Reports put out by the company show a rise of more than 50% in the number of search warrants received in the first half of 2019 compared with a year earlier. The volume of subpoenas increased about 15%. From last January through June, the company received nearly 13,000 subpoenas and more than 10,000 search warrants from U.S. law enforcement.
Google will not ask for reimbursement in some cases, including child safety investigations and life-threatening emergencies, the spokesman said.
Law enforcement officials said it was too early to know the impact of the fees, which Google's notice said would go into effect mid-January.
Gary Ernsdorff, a senior prosecutor in Washington state, said he was concerned that the charges for search warrants would set a precedent that led more companies to charge for similar requests. That could hamper smaller law enforcement agencies, he said.
"Officers would have to make decisions when to issue warrants based on their budgets," he said.
Ernsdorff said there was a potential silver lining, noting that the time it takes for Google to respond to warrants has significantly increased in the past year. Other law enforcement officers also said the time they had to wait for Google to fulfill legal requests had grown.
"If they are getting revenue from it, maybe this will improve their performance," Ernsdorff said.
Other law enforcement officials said the effects of the reimbursement fees would be minimal.
"I don't see it impacting us too much," said Mark Bruley, a deputy police chief in Minnesota. "We are only using these warrants on major crimes, and their fees seem reasonable."
Telecommunication companies such as Cox and Verizon have charged fees for similar services for years. At least one of Google's biggest peers, Facebook, does not charge for such requests. Microsoft and Twitter said they were legally allowed to request reimbursement for costs but declined to explicitly address whether they charged law enforcement for such requests.

Texto completo: DETROIT - Detroit's former main train station, designed in the Beaux-Arts style by the same architects who created Grand Central Terminal in New York, has tall columns and vaulted ceilings that hint at its past glory.
Yet much of the station is now crumbling, covered in rainbow graffiti and weathered by decades of rain and snow that seeped in through the deteriorating roof.
"Michigan Central Station has long been a symbol of Detroit's vibrancy, and then it became an international symbol of decline," said Detroit's mayor, Mike Duggan.
Now the long-vacant station is getting a new life, thanks to Ford Motor Co., which will transform the depot as well as an adjacent book depository, brass factory and hosiery factory into a 1.2 million-square-foot transportation innovation district.
The new development will house Ford's autonomous vehicle division, among other units. The automaker also plans to lease space to companies working on mobility and transportation projects, such as smart vehicles, infrastructure and parking.
The innovation hub will also have shops, restaurants, art and performance spaces as well as a boutique hotel on the top floors of the 15-story tower rising above the station.
(On Monday, General Motors said it was spending $2.2 billion to refurbish an underused Detroit-area factory to build a series of electric and self-driving vehicles, eventually employing 2,200 people. The plant, which straddles the border between Detroit and the enclave of Hamtramck, is expected to turn out the company's first electric pickup late in 2021 and eventually employ 2,2,00 people, The Associated Press reported.)
Ford's transformation of Michigan Central Station is part of the bigger resurgence of Detroit, a story mirrored in cities, like Pittsburgh and Cleveland, that are trying to reinvent themselves to attract new jobs and residents. These Rust Belt cities, formerly known for their steel production, have struggled since the 1950s as jobs disappeared and residents left en masse.
Many of these turnarounds start in city cores, and transformation is indeed most evident in Detroit's downtown, too. In early 2019, luxury retailer Shinola opened its first hotel there, a 129-room boutique resort that has the feel of a private London club with fireplaces and reading nooks.
The hotel's walls have a palette of cream, camel and "Shinola blue," a shade of navy blue that was derived from a fleck of paint found in a former Singer sewing machine factory, one of the five downtown buildings Shinola occupies.
Behind the hotel is a cobblestone alley lined with shops run by local female entrepreneurs, a beer hall and a Detroit-style fried chicker. joint. This multiuse development was a joint project between Shinola and real estate firm Bedrock, founded by Detroit billionaire Dan Gilbert, whose firm has acquired and developed more than 100 properties in Detroit and Cleveland since 2011.
Across the street from the Shinola Hotel is another BedrocK project, a $1 billion skyscraper being built on the site of the former Hudson's department store that will house e hotel, offices, shops and high-end residences when it opens in 2023.
The transformation of the train station has helped attract other investment throughout Detroit. Duggan said: "Ford has created momentum for other mega projects."
In February, Fiat Chrysler announced a $4.5 billion investment in five Michigan plants, creating about 6,500 jobs in Michigan. Waymo, the self-driving technology company owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, opened its first factory in Detroit in late 2019.
Ford has a long history in Motor City, thanks to its Model T, the first affordable mass-produced automobile, which was made at the company's Piquette Avenue Plant, built in 1904.
Train travel, however, was ki ng in the early 1900s. Michigan Central Station opened in 1913, replacing a station that had burned down. In the station's heyday in the 1940s, more than 4,000 passengers passed through each day.
After World War II, car travel surpassed train travel, and the city faltered over the decades for political and economic reasons, its plight exacerbated by race riots in 1967. The last trains, operated by Amtrak, departed Michigan Central Station in 1988, af:er which the station closed ar d fell into disrepair.
The city hit a low point in 2013 when, billions of dollars in debt, it declared bankruptcy, the largest by a municipality in the United States.
In 2018, Ford announced it would acquire Michigan Central Station and several nearby properties, investing $740 million in the project. Ford began by winterizing, drying out and securing the 640,000-square-foot train station. Now, construction workers are repairing the steel structure and replacing damaged terra cotta, limestone and brick that make up the station's exterior.
Inside, much work is being done on the waiting room, which was modeled on a Roman bathhouse. About 22,000 square feet of Guastavino clay tiles covering three self-supporting arches are being repaired. Five thousand replica tiles have been ordered from a company in Buffalo, New York, that specializes in the tiles and has supplied them for projects such as the Grand Central Oyster Bar.
Ford is also hoping to add coworking spaces and university resources to help foster a startup culture.
The project is modeled after Kendall Square, the neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts, known for its cluster of technology companies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Paula Carethers, Detroit development manager at Ford.
"We want to build a collaborative ecosystem of companies, educators, investors and innovators," she said.
The Ford team has studied closely what has worked in other cities. For instance, one section of the train station is elevated and adjacent to former rail lines.
"For this part, we have looked at images from the High Line in New York for inspiration," Carethers said, referring to the elevated park on the West Side of Manhattan. An elevated skating rink was one idea, she said.
Ford's project is helping revitalize Corktown, Detroit's oldest neighborhood, created by Irish immigrants about one mile west of downtown. But connecting the various pockets of development in Detroit remains a challenge.
"Most people don't realize that Detroit is a very sprawling city," said Thomas Weidenbach, a former adjunct lecturer of American history and political science at the University of Michigan's Dearborn campus. Weidenbach's grandparents were born in Detroit at the turn of the 20th century and raised their family here until the 1970s. "The new prosperity is still uneven," he said.
The city's nearly three-yearold streetcar, called the QLine (after Gilbert's mortgage lending company, Quicken Loans), is a first effort to better connect the downtown with various neighborhoods north of it.
Ensuring the revitalization reaches all residents has been a focus for Duggan, the mayor. While Detroit's unemployment rate fell from more than 20% in 2010 to 3.4% in November, it is still higher among African-Americans, who make up nearly 80% of the city. Detroit also continues to have one of the highest poverty rates in the country, at 33.4%, though that number is down from 39.8% in 2015, according to the Census Bureau.
The growing number of visitors and their influx of cash are helping Detroit rebound. Fourteen million visitors came to the area in 2013, according to the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau, a number that jumped to 19 million in 2019. Detroit has four major-league sports teams, all of which play in the downtown area.

Resumen: Cipollone said Schiff "manufactured a false version" of the July 25 phone call during which Trump suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dig up dirt on Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s well-paid work for a Ukrainian energy company.

Texto completo: Google "fact-check Senate impeachment," and you can read about all the factual errors made by President Donald Trump’s team of lawyers. What about those of the House impeachment managers? Apparently, last week, head prosecutor Adam Schiff and his colleagues could not tell a lie. Or even a half-truth.
Factcheck.org rattles off the White House’s sins. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrongly suggested that Republicans were barred from closed-door depositions conducted by the House Intelligence Committee. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow falsely said that the Trump team was denied "the right to have counsel present at hearings" — when the Trump lawyers declined to participate. Cipollone said Schiff "manufactured a false version" of the July 25 phone call during which Trump suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dig up dirt on Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s well-paid work for a Ukrainian energy company. Wrong, say the arbiters of actuality, because Schiff described his version of the call as "the essence" of Trump’s remarks and later said it was "at least part in parody."
"In 2016, then-candidate Trump implored Russia to hack his opponent’s email account, something that the Russian military agency did only hours later — only hours later," Schiff told the Senate Wednesday. "When the president said, ‘Hey, Russia, if you’re listening,’ they were listening. Only hours later, they hacked his opponent’s campaign."
I found no mention by the big fact-crunchers on what was obvious at the time — Trump was joking. But the fact-checkers don’t seem to care.
Frequently, I go to the fact-checkers. I do not necessarily agree with their conclusions but appreciate the way they explain the claims as they weigh what is accurate and inaccurate and the links they provide so that I can see for myself. But they’re not looking at both sides.
The guardians of the truth also ignore Schiff’s most offensive argument — that Trump was trying to "cheat in the next election." Just how does a presidential candidate cheat in an election? Voter and ballot fraud definitely qualify as cheating, but that’s not the issue here. Failing to live up to one’s campaign promises can’t be cheating — because then all presidents would be cheaters.
Now, I think Trump should not have asked a vulnerable ally to do his 2020 team’s campaign research for him. Here cheating would be persuading Zelenskiy to announce an investigation of the Bidens. If Trump’s belief that the veep tried to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son — when the prosecutor in question wasn’t investigating Hunter Biden — such an announcement would have served to inform voters that underqualified Hunter Biden was paid some $50,000 per month from sketchy Burisma while his father was the face of the Obama administration’s campaign to fight corruption in Ukraine.
Actually, that’s the sort of thing American voters might want to know. So how is that cheating?
Schiff, whom PolitiFact called out last year for falsely stating, "we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower" who reported Trump’s Ukraine dealings to his committee, also has implied that Trump cheated in 2016. "Why don’t you just let him cheat in one more election?" the House Intelligence Committee chairman said during the impeachment hearings.
Wednesday, Schiff told the Senate that Trump had "escaped accountability for Russia meddling" in the 2016 election — which suggests Trump was working with Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller found no coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. And still, Schiff holds Trump accountable. No wonder Trump believes the debunked Russian collusion story was hyped to taint his 2016 victory.
At the final 2016 presidential debate, Trump made headlines when he answered that he was not sure if he would accept the results of the November contest, as he felt that the system had been rigged against him.
The New York Times and rival Hillary Clinton were mortified. "Let’s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy," she said.
Within a year of Trump’s Electoral College win, it was Clinton who did not accept the results. In crediting Russia for Trump’s win, Schiff joins the league of crybaby losers. And now he’s setting the stage for challenging a Trump victory should the president prevail in November.
If you want to get ahead in the Democratic Party, feel free to take down the democratic process. You can do anything, except try to appeal to new voters.

Resumen: Two GOP senators said the explosive revelations in a draft of a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton have bolstered the case for the Senate to hear new testimony in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. In an opening statement on Saturday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone argued that House impeachment managers had failed to prove their case, in part, because they had no firsthand evidence in charging Trump with abuse of power. Other Officials Bolton also wrote that several top cabinet officials had knowledge of Trump’s demands, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr, as well as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, according to the Times.

Texto completo: Two GOP senators said the explosive revelations in a draft of a book by former National Security Adviser John Bolton have bolstered the case for the Senate to hear new testimony in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial.
Senators Susan Collins and Mitt Romney said Monday that a leak about Bolton’s unpublished manuscript has prompted new discussions among Republicans about subpoenaing witnesses.
Trump’s lawyers are set to resume their defense in the impeachment case at 1 p.m. and will be under pressure to address the issue in their arguments, which have centered on the lack of a first-person account of Trump’s actions during the House inquiry.
The disclosure from Bolton that Trump wanted to freeze aid to Ukraine until its government investigated his political rival "strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues," Collins said in a statement.
Romney told reporters at the Capitol that "it’s increasingly apparent that it would be important to hear from John Bolton." However he said he wouldn’t make a final decision until after the conclusion of this phase of the trial.
Bolton’s account of an August conversation with Trump links the withholding of aid to Ukraine to a demand for material to damage his political competitors, the New York Times reported. The disclosure has scrambled the politics of the trial.
The issue of witnesses will be decided once the president’s team finishes its defense and senators get a 16-hour period to question them and the House impeachment managers about their cases, likely at the end of the week.
Bolton’s account in the draft of his book fortifies the two central arguments made by Democrats in the trial: that Trump used the power of his office for political gain and that the senators urgently need to hear from witnesses the president blocked from testifying during the House inquiry.
In an opening statement on Saturday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone argued that House impeachment managers had failed to prove their case, in part, because they had no firsthand evidence in charging Trump with abuse of power. He said the real aim of Democrats was to overturn the 2016 election and interfere in November’s ballot.
Bolton, who left the administration in September in disputes with Trump over policy, has that direct knowledge. He’s one of four current or former administration officials Democrats want to call as witnesses and has said he would testify if subpoenaed. His lawyer said previously that he has information that hasn’t been part of the public record.
‘No Doubt’ "There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president’s defense and therefore must be called as a witness at the impeachment trial of President Trump," the seven House impeachment managers, led by Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, said in a joint statement Sunday night.
He told reporters at the White House Monday that he hadn’t seen the manuscript, "but I can tell you nothing was ever said to John Bolton but I have not seen a manuscript, I guess he’s writing a book."
Bolton’s account challenges one of the "key facts" that Trump attorney Michael Purpura outlined on Saturday: that "not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else."
Trump suggested another reason to prevent Bolton from testifying in a tweet, arguing that it was the job of the House to call Bolton during its impeachment proceeding even though witnesses have been called by the Senate in impeachment proceedings throughout history. "The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify," Trump said. "It is up to them, not up to the Senate!"
Collins and Romney are among at least four GOP senators who have expressed openness to hearing from witnesses, which could extend the trial by weeks, though they haven’t committed to a vote.
No Republicans have yet said that Trump has committed an impeachable offense. With 67 votes required to convict, the president’s acquittal remains all but assured. Still, the more important audience for Bolton’s revelations will be the voting public who will decide in November whether Trump should be re-elected.
The New York Times said Bolton has been circulating a draft of the manuscript to associates and it had been described to the Times by several people. Bolton also sent a draft to the White House as part of the standard review process for books by former administration officials.
In the draft, according to the Times, Bolton wrote that in August the president told him he didn’t want to send $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until the government there turned over material related to former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his potential Democratic challengers, and supporters of Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.
Other Officials Bolton also wrote that several top cabinet officials had knowledge of Trump’s demands, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr, as well as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, according to the Times.
Bolton’s lawyer, Charles Cooper, released a statement that doesn’t directly address the substance of the Times report. He said the manuscript was submitted to the National Security Council’s Records Management Division for standard prepublication security review for classified information on Dec. 30.
Cooper said it was submitted with the "firm belief" that it contained no information that could reasonably be considered classified and that the "contents of Ambassador Bolton’s manuscript will not be reviewed or otherwise disclosed to any persons not regularly involved in that process."
"It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript," he said.
At the heart of the Democrats’ impeachment case is the allegation that Trump took a sudden interest in Ukrainian corruption only after Biden entered the Democratic nomination race in April. They allege that over the ensuing months, Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting sought by the recently elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, while seeking an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.

Texto completo: An explosive leak from former National Security Adviser John Bolton’s unpublished book that says President Donald Trump wanted to freeze aid to Ukraine until its government investigated his political rival threatens to scramble the politics of the impeachment trial and bring new pressure on Republicans to call witnesses.
Bolton’s account in the draft of his book, as described by The New York Times, fortifies the two central arguments made by Democrats in the trial: that Trump used the power of his office for political gain and that the senators urgently need to hear from witnesses the president blocked from testifying during the House inquiry.
The White House pushed back on the disclosure Monday as the president’s lawyers are preparing to deliver the meat of Trump’s defense when the trial reconvenes on at 1 p.m. In an opening statement on Saturday, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone argued that House impeachment managers had failed to prove their case, in part, because they had no firsthand evidence in charging Trump with abuse of power. He said the real aim of Democrats was to overturn the 2016 election and interfere in November’s ballot.
Bolton, who left the administration in September in disputes with Trump over policy, has that direct knowledge. He’s one of four current or former administration officials Democrats want to call as witnesses and has said he would testify if subpoenaed. His lawyer said previously that he has information that hasn’t been part of the public record.
‘No Doubt’ "There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president’s defense and therefore must be called as a witness at the impeachment trial of President Trump," the seven House impeachment managers, led by Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, said in a joint statement Sunday night.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham dismissed Bolton’s leaked account as "just not true" and said Trump "did nothing wrong" in an interview with Fox News on Monday. "The timing of all of this is very, very suspect," she said.
Trump denied the allegations in tweets early Monday, adding that he released aid to Ukraine without any conditions.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book," he wrote.
Bolton’s account challenges one of the "key facts" that Trump attorney Michael Purpura outlined on Saturday: that "not a single witness testified that the president himself said that there was any connection between any investigations and security assistance, a presidential meeting, or anything else."
Trump suggested another reason to prevent Bolton from testifying in another tweet, arguing that it was the job of the House to call Bolton during its impeachment proceeding even though witnesses have been called by the Senate in impeachment proceedings throughout history. "The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify," Trump said. "It is up to them, not up to the Senate!"
It wasn’t immediately clear how much the Bolton revelations could change the dynamic on the question of trial witnesses. Four Republicans would have to defy Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to join with all Democrats to call witnesses at the trial, and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Friday described getting that outcome as a "hard road."
At least four GOP senators have expressed openness to hearing from witnesses, which could extend the trial by weeks, though they haven’t committed to a vote. Three GOP senators — Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — have said they’re considering voting to hear from new witnesses.
No Republicans have yet said that Trump has committed an impeachable offense. With 67 votes required to convict, the president’s acquittal remains all but assured. Still, the more important audience for Bolton’s revelations will be the voting public who will decide in November whether Trump should be reelected.
The New York Times said Bolton has been circulating a draft of the manuscript to associates and it had been described to the Times by several people. Bolton also sent a draft to the White House as part of the standard review process for books by former administration officials.
In the draft, according to the Times, Bolton wrote that in August the president told him he didn’t want to send $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until the government there turned over material related to former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his potential Democratic challengers, and supporters of Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.
Other Officials Bolton also wrote that several top cabinet officials had knowledge of Trump’s demands, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr, as well as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, according to the Times.
Bolton’s lawyer, Charles Cooper, released a statement that doesn’t directly address the substance of the Times report. He said the manuscript was submitted to the National Security Council’s Records Management Division for standard prepublication security review for classified information on Dec. 30.
Cooper said it was submitted with the "firm belief" that it contained no information that could reasonably be considered classified and that the "contents of Ambassador Bolton’s manuscript will not be reviewed or otherwise disclosed to any persons not regularly involved in that process."
"It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript," he said.
At the heart of the Democrats’ impeachment case is the allegation that Trump took a sudden interest in Ukrainian corruption only after Biden entered the Democratic nomination race in April. They allege that over the ensuing months, Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting sought by the recently elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, while seeking an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
President’s Defense Attacking the foundations of the House arguments, Trump’s lawyers said there were good reasons for the president to not trust the assessments by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia was acting alone in interfering in the 2016 election, and for his suspicions regarding corruption in Ukraine.
They also said there was no pressure brought on Ukraine because the aid was released and Zelenskiy got a sought-after meeting with Trump with no investigation announced.
Yet, over the course of their initial presentation, Trump’s legal team didn’t address several core allegations raised by Democrats as part of their argument that Trump abused his power.
For example, the lawyers didn’t discuss Trump’s role in freezing aid to Ukraine, who else was involved in the decision and why it was done. The lawyers also didn’t address why the aid was finally lifted. And they didn’t provide any information or justification as to why Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was leading an effort outside of normal diplomatic channels to pressure Ukraine to announce the investigations.
The aid was released in early September and a meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy at the United Nations was arranged after an uproar over the revelation of an intelligence community whistle-blower’s complaint. The complaint raised alarms about Trump’s July phone call with Zelenskiy and a subsequent decision by White House lawyers to put the record of the conversation in a secure server to restrict access.
As he left an event in Marshalltown, Iowa, Biden said he hadn’t seen the reports about Bolton’s book. "I don’t have any idea what’s in the book," he said, "but if it in fact contradicts Trump, it’s not a surprise."

Texto completo: Google "fact-check Senate impeachment," and you can read about all the factual errors made by President Donald Trump’s team of lawyers. What about those of the House impeachment managers? Apparently, last week, head prosecutor Adam Schiff and his colleagues could not tell a lie. Or even a half-truth.
Factcheck.org rattles off the White House’s sins. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrongly suggested that Republicans were barred from closed-door depositions conducted by the House Intelligence Committee. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow falsely said that the Trump team was denied "the right to have counsel present at hearings" — when the Trump lawyers declined to participate. Cipollone said Schiff "manufactured a false version" of the July 25 phone call during which Trump suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dig up dirt on Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s well-paid work for a Ukrainian energy company. Wrong, say the arbiters of actuality, because Schiff described his version of the call as "the essence" of Trump’s remarks and later said it was "at least part in parody."
"In 2016, then-candidate Trump implored Russia to hack his opponent’s email account, something that the Russian military agency did only hours later — only hours later," Schiff told the Senate Wednesday. "When the president said, ‘Hey, Russia, if you’re listening,’ they were listening. Only hours later, they hacked his opponent’s campaign."
I found no mention by the big fact-crunchers on what was obvious at the time — Trump was joking. But the fact-checkers don’t seem to care.
Frequently, I go to the fact-checkers. I do not necessarily agree with their conclusions but appreciate the way they explain the claims as they weigh what is accurate and inaccurate and the links they provide so that I can see for myself. But they’re not looking at both sides.
The guardians of the truth also ignore Schiff’s most offensive argument — that Trump was trying to "cheat in the next election." Just how does a presidential candidate cheat in an election? Voter and ballot fraud definitely qualify as cheating, but that’s not the issue here. Failing to live up to one’s campaign promises can’t be cheating — because then all presidents would be cheaters.
Now, I think Trump should not have asked a vulnerable ally to do his 2020 team’s campaign research for him. Here cheating would be persuading Zelenskiy to announce an investigation of the Bidens. If Trump’s belief that the veep tried to fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son — when the prosecutor in question wasn’t investigating Hunter Biden — such an announcement would have served to inform voters that underqualified Hunter Biden was paid some $50,000 per month from sketchy Burisma while his father was the face of the Obama administration’s campaign to fight corruption in Ukraine.
Actually, that’s the sort of thing American voters might want to know. So how is that cheating?
Schiff, whom PolitiFact called out last year for falsely stating, "we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower" who reported Trump’s Ukraine dealings to his committee, also has implied that Trump cheated in 2016. "Why don’t you just let him cheat in one more election?" the House Intelligence Committee chairman said during the impeachment hearings.
Wednesday, Schiff told the Senate that Trump had "escaped accountability for Russia meddling" in the 2016 election — which suggests Trump was working with Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller found no coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. And still, Schiff holds Trump accountable. No wonder Trump believes the debunked Russian collusion story was hyped to taint his 2016 victory.
At the final 2016 presidential debate, Trump made headlines when he answered that he was not sure if he would accept the results of the November contest, as he felt that the system had been rigged against him.
The New York Times and rival Hillary Clinton were mortified. "Let’s be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy," she said.
Within a year of Trump’s Electoral College win, it was Clinton who did not accept the results. In crediting Russia for Trump’s win, Schiff joins the league of crybaby losers. And now he’s setting the stage for challenging a Trump victory should the president prevail in November.

Texto completo: Screenings for the coronavirus, which has sickened thousands in China, are underway at Boston's Logan International Airport, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday night.
Michael Patronik, a CDC spokesman, said officials were screening passengers on flights that came from any country that has confirmed coronavirus cases.
He said passengers coming off such flights will be given a questionnaire about their travel history and CDC staff will look for signs of illness in the passengers and take their temperatures.
If a passenger has any symptoms or fever, they will be further evaluated by a CDC public health officer, he said. Sick travelers who are “reasonably believed to have been either infected or exposed" to coronavirus will transferred to a hospital, where they will be placed in isolation and assessed further.
The outbreak of the new virus has killed 132 and infected more than 6,000 on mainland China and elsewhere.
The decision to screen at Logan, New England's largest airport, came as Massachusetts officials prepared to settle on its protocol to address the outbreak.
In the US, the government is monitoring more than 100 people for the illness that has thrown China into crisis.
These are patients from 26 states who suffered respiratory symptoms after traveling to China and whose state health departments sent samples for testing to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Was Massachusetts one of those states? State officials won't say.
In New Hampshire, they will. In a press release Monday, the state's Department of Health and Human Services revealed that two residents were being tested for the virus, and a spokesman named the hospitals where the patients are being kept in isolation.
Connecticut is also choosing transparency. Governor Ned Lamont posted a detailed message about two people who were tested for coronavirus, specifying that one was Wesleyan University student and naming the counties where they live. Both turned out to have the flu.
But when asked about a credible report of a suspected coronavirus case in Massachusetts, the state's Department of Public Health said it will release information only about confirmed cases. And there have been no confirmed cases in the state. (Five have been confirmed nationwide.) Rhode Island's Health Department said it has similar rules in place.
There is widespread inconsistency in states' responses to the coronavirus, but most are at least revealing how many cases are under investigation, said Michael Fraser, chief executive officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials .
“What you're seeing is the fact that we're still so early on with dealing with this outbreak," he said. “We're trying to get states on the same page."
Still, he expressed surprise at Massachusetts' decision to report only confirmed cases. “I don't know why they would do that," he said. “Most states are reporting those numbers."
Massachusetts health officials gave several reasons for their policy on Tuesday. With emerging illnesses, the number and status of people under investigation change frequently. Someone who is appropriate for testing can later be ruled out, and even the criteria for testing can change frequently.
In Rhode Island, Health Department spokesman Joseph Wendelken said the state is providing information on confirmed cases only “to cut down on confusion and to avoid releasing multiple sets of numbers."
The issue of how much to tell the public about coronavirus investigations came up during a phone call that the association held among state health officials on Sunday, Fraser said.
Some said there were many suspected cases, and most if not all will turn out to be the flu; health officials don't want to stir needless anxiety, he said.
Other officials question the public benefit in revealing where the suspected cases are.
And, Fraser noted that releasing too much information can have unintended consequences. For example, people might avoid a hospital that treated a patient, even if all the infection-control protocols are followed. Indeed, the hospital where one of the New Hampshire patients is staying felt it necessary to post on Facebook that there is no risk to patients or visitors.
That patient is a student at The White Mountain School in Bethlehem, who returned from a trip to China on Jan. 6 and came to Littleton Regional Healthcare with mild flu-like symptoms on Jan. 23. The school, a boarding school, also sent a letter to parents detailing the measures it took to protect other students and staff.
But Fraser acknowledged that too much secrecy creates its own anxieties, and said that association would suggest that states release the number of cases under investigation, as the CDC is doing.
The states that have released information varied in how much they gave out. Some merely said cases were under investigation; others named the county where the person lived.
“I think people understand the need for some consistency," Fraser said.
There are other responses state health officials will try to standardize, such as which contacts of a sick person need to be tested — everyone in restaurant where they ate, or just the people at their table? If there's a confirmed case at a university, do you close the whole place or just a single dorm?
Some of those questions will be answered when more is known about how easily the coronavirus is transmitted, and whether people can spread the virus before they have symptoms, he said.
And answers will also come faster in three or four weeks when the states receive kits from the CDC that will enable them to do their own testing for the virus, Fraser said.
Logan is amongseveral American airports where the CDC screenings will take place, according to Patronik. Other airports include those serving the cities of Anchorage, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, El Paso, Honolulu, Houston, Los Angeles. Miami, Minneapolis, New York, Newark, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, and Washington D.C.
A Massachusetts Port Authority spokeswoman could not confirm the CDC screenings were taking place on Tuesday night. Massport oversees Logan. Patronik said he did not know specifically when the screens started at the airport.
Logan sees daily direct flights from Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, according to a Massport spokeswoman.

Texto completo: Fleurish Home in Hamilton bested other more established stores in the region this month in the Home Accents category of a long-running national award ceremony.
There are only three stores — one per region — that receive the award each year at the ARTS Awards Ceremony, held annually by Dallas Market Center and creative home furnishings network ART (Accessories Resource Team).
Fleurish, which opened at 135 Main St. in Hamilton in 2017, was nominated in Home Accents category for the Midwest/Southwest region at the 31st annual ARTS Award. It faced competition from three of its peers: New Orleans-based Eclectic Home, Dallas-based Blue Print and Burr Park, Illinois-based The Design Bar.
Presented each January during the Dallas Total Home & Gift Market, the ARTS Awards is the premier awards program in the nation, honoring the home industry’s top manufacturers, retailers, designers and sales representatives.
Fleurish Home co-owner Debra Campbell said “out of the hundreds of thousands of home decor shops just in our region alone, just being nominated is a huge honor.”

Winning the award during a gala event at the Hilton Anatole Hotel in Dallas Jan. 10 was “an absolutely amazing experience,” Campbell said.
“I honestly didn’t think I would win,” she said. “The other stores are more established and all are very high-end designer boutiques. It feels amazing to be recognized for the hard work and dedication to excellence and innovation in this industry during a time where tremendous sweeping changes are happening continuously.
“I’m so proud to have brought this home for my team and my community.”
Nominations typically arrive in the dozens by those in the industry, then nominees are judged by a panel of five judges on several categories including visual merchandising, marketing, social media, community involvement, philanthropy, employee development and more, according to Sharon Davis, executive director for North Carolina-based ART.
Fleurish Home learned in August that it had had been nominated, but those nominations were not publicly announced until November.
Davis said it was not easy for for Fleurish Home to not only make it through the rigid and thorough nominating and vetting process to be a finalist, but also to win.
“I do remember one of the remarks that one of the judges put on the comments, which was that Fleurish was ‘a true merchant,’” Davis said. “ A lot of these stores have turned into studios and they’re basically not carrying any inventory. You walk in and you’re buying stuff but they have to order it for you, they don’t have it in the back. To have a store that does carry inventory and is a merchant and selling things in a traditional way is pretty extraordinary.”

Here's what we know and don't know about coronavirus

Texto completo: As New Hampshire monitors two possible cases of coronavirus, the risk of the novel infection spreading in Maine is low, according to the director of the state's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, the new coronavirus strain has spread internationally in a few weeks, with the number of confirmed cases rising nearly 60 percent between Monday and Tuesday alone. And the outbreak is happening during what has already been a more intense flu season in Maine that has led to more hospitalizations and deaths than last year.
There is a lot still unknown about the coronavirus as national and global health agencies and experts track the evolving outbreak. And that's part of what makes the infection so worrying to public health authorities trying to limit its spread.
"What makes anything dangerous is you don't know anything about it," said Ronald Corley, director of the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories and a professor of microbiology at Boston University. "It just spilled over into the human population at the end of 2019. We don't know really anything about it. We don't necessarily know what to expect when a person gets the novel coronavirus."
The first coronavirus infections were identified in the city of Wuhan in central China in December 2019. Within weeks, the virus spread across China and to at least 18 other countries, including the U.S. and Canada.
[iframe url="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Kpn1A/1/" height="600" width="400"]
As of Wednesday, 132 people had died from the virus, and the number of confirmed cases had risen to 5,974, with the overwhelming majority in China, The New York Times reported. No international deaths have been reported yet.
Across the U.S., 165 people were being monitored for the coronavirus, the U.S. CDC said Wednesday. Of those, five had confirmed infections, with the majority -- like those in New Hampshire -- still awaiting test results.
[iframe url="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Q2TQk/2/" height="600" width="400"]
But worldwide, the size of the outbreak is likely larger than the number of confirmed cases. A Northeastern University virus spreading estimate puts the size of the outbreak at 26,200 infections. And a transmissibility report by MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London says that each infected person is estimated to have spread the virus to roughly two to three other people by Jan. 18.
In New Hampshire, the two people being monitored developed respiratory symptoms after recent travel to Wuhan. They are in isolation and are undergoing testing, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services .
[image id="2927527" size="full" pos="center" /]
The new coronavirus isn't a specific infection. It is a new strain within the coronavirus family that has caused past global outbreaks.
Coronaviruses can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe infections. They are found in many different species of animals. Some evolve and infect humans, and have affected large numbers of people before, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) -- which infected 8,000 people and killed 800 in 2003 -- and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to the CDC.
There are seven types of coronaviruses that have been known to infect people and cause illnesses. China reported the novel coronavirus, temporarily named the 2019-nCoV, to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.
In a report published Monday, the WHO classified the risk of coronavirus as high globally, and very high in China. It has also published technical guidance for health experts for treating suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV) infections.
Infected people can show a range of flu-like symptoms, but patients without symptoms can also transmit the virus.
Infected people so far have exhibited a range of conditions, from few to no symptoms to severe illness and death. The CDC has listed cough, fever and shortness of breath as known symptoms.
The symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear as soon as two days after exposure or as long as 14 afterward, the CDC estimates based on the incubation period of the MERS coronavirus.
"Individuals that have the coronavirus and the flu virus show very much the same symptoms," Corley said. "That's why [health professionals] are monitoring people carefully because that's the only way to prevent spread. To identify potential contacts, keep them restricted in their movement by quarantining and then waiting until you get the diagnostics on them."
The WHO recommends hand and respiratory hygiene and sound food safety practices as preventative measures for the public.
There is evidence that the new virus has spread from person-to-person contact. However, many early patients in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting an animal-to-person spread, according to the CDC.
"There have been some reports that even asymptomatic people, people who don't have symptoms, can in fact transmit the virus," Corley said. "If you don't have symptoms, it doesn't mean you're not going to pass it on. Being cautious given how quickly this has spread to other countries is probably the best approach."
[image id="2927528" size="full" pos="center" /]
China has implemented travel shutdowns and quarantines, and health organizations across the world are monitoring potential cases.
The Chinese government shut down all modes of transportation from Wuhan, including flights, buses, trains and ferries, to contain the outbreak, The New York Times reported. Last week, cities near Wuhan as well as China's capital, Beijing, announced additional quarantines.
"The primary issue is to limit human-to-human transmission, to reduce secondary infections, especially amongst close contact and particularly in healthcare environments," Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO's head of emergencies, said in an emergency meeting about the novel coronavirus on Jan. 22.
Ryan also said that reducing transmission from animals to humans, identifying the animal source or sources, and limiting exposure to those sources were priorities.

Iowa should never be allowed to go first again

Texto completo: The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary owe their first-in-the-nation status partly to circumstance. Decades ago, Iowa’s caucus was the initial step in a long, complex process that the state used to award delegates, which meant that the voting had to happen early in the year. New Hampshire was mostly trying to save money — by scheduling its primary on the same day as many annual town meetings, which were held before the spring mud season.
But circumstance has not kept Iowa and New Hampshire at the front of the line. An aggressive protection of their own self-interest has.
“We weren’t stupid,” Cliff Larsen, a former chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, once said. New Hampshire passed a law saying its primary always must be the first, and Iowa has been similarly protective.
It’s all worked out very nicely for the two states. A typical voter in Iowa or New Hampshire has up to 20 times more influence than somebody in later-voting states, one study found.
This system has worked out much less well for the other 48 states. They have voluntarily surrendered political influence — and allowed the presidential nominating process to become warped.
I know the usual excuse for Iowa’s and New Hampshire’s special status: That the good people there take extra care in selecting candidates. And many Iowans and New Hampshirites are good people who take their civic duty seriously.
But step back and think about how condescending that explanation is. The residents of New Jersey, New Mexico, Indiana, Louisiana and other late-voting states somehow aren’t sufficiently civic-minded or intelligent to choose their own presidential candidates?
I want to use this moment to point out how bizarre the current system is — and to make a plea: The 2020 cycle should be the last time that Iowa and New Hampshire benefit at the country’s expense.
The strongest part of the case for change, of course, is the racial aspect of the current calendar. Iowa and New Hampshire are among the country’s whitest states.
This matters. Consider that Cory Booker and Kamala Harris were doing as well as Amy Klobuchar in early polls of more diverse states. But Booker and Harris are finished, in no small part because of their struggles in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Or consider that a candidate with strong white support (like Bernie Sanders) could win both Iowa and New Hampshire this year. That would create a media narrative about Joe Biden’s campaign being badly wounded, even though Biden leads among African Americans and Latinos. Those voters, however, are told to wait their turn.
It would not be hard to create a fairer system. One or two smaller states could always go first, with the specific states rotating each cycle. (Many smaller states — like Delaware, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico and Rhode Island — are diverse.) They could immediately be followed by a couple of larger states that are home to major cities.
Obviously, politicians in Iowa and New Hampshire will fight any such change, as they always have. They’ll use lofty language, about how solemnly they take their responsibilities.
Strip away the rhetoric, though, and their argument comes down to this: We’re better than the rest of you, and we deserve special treatment forever.

Texto completo: A multitude of conservative former CNN contributors attacked the network after a segment in which the host and guests mocked President Trump and his supporters.
New York Times columnist and CNN contributor Wajahat Ali and ex-GOP strategist Rick Wilson participated in a panel with Don Lemon on Saturday night. They were discussing the recent fight between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. During an interview, Pompeo screamed at Kelly and demanded she locate Ukraine, the topic of the initial disagreement, on an unlabeled map.
While discussing the confrontation on CNN, Wilson pivoted the conversation to the president's supporters and suggested that Trump supporters wouldn't be able to find Ukraine on a map and that they would label being able to do so as a sign of elitism. Ali and Lemon laughed at Wilson, who used fake a southern accent to sound like a Trump supporter. Ali later chimed in with his own ridicule of Trump backers while Lemon laughed so hard he used a tissue to wipe tears from his eyes.
Pro-Trump former CNN contributors bash network over segment mocking Trump supporters
A number of conservatives, including President Trump himself, decried the network and the segment on social media after it went viral on Monday evening. Some of the network's former contributors chimed in to chide the outlet.
Tweet
Steve Cortes, who was a contributor for the network until earlier this month, tweeted, "The smug political class hates the tens of millions of Americans who comprise our movement. They can cackle and grandstand ... as we build a country based on sovereignty, economic nationalism, and the diffusion of power."
He also took a shot at Ali, calling him a "blatant bigot" stemming from an on-air confrontation between the two earlier this year.
Tweet
Paris Dennard, who faced a suspension from the network amid allegations of sexual harassment, tweeted, "Sad and offensive but not in the least bit surprising," and added, "Doubtful. The problem is they see nothing wrong with this type of blatant bigotry."
Similarly, former CNN contributor Jason Miller, who left the network after a mistress claimed he drugged a different mistress with an abortion pill after finding out she was pregnant, tweeted out the video with the caption, "Wow," while also retweeting a multitude of other people's criticisms.
CNN did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.

Texto completo: White House adviser Ivanka Trump blasted a panel of pundits who appeared on CNN over the weekend and mocked supporters of her father, President Trump.
"You consistently make fun of half the country and then complain that it is divided," the first daughter tweeted Tuesday. "The arrogance, mocking accents and smug ridicule of this nation’s ‘Real Elites’ is disgusting."
Tweet
Appearing on Don Lemon's CNN Tonight over the weekend, panelists Wajahat Ali and Rick Wilson imitated what they believe a typical Trump supporter might sound or think like.
"Donald Trump's the smart one — and y'all elitists are dumb!" said Wilson, an ex-GOP strategist and one of Trump's loudest critics on the Right.
Lemon broke out in laughter as Ali, a columnist at the New York Times, joined in.
"'You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling!'" Ali joked.
"'Your math and your reading! All those lines on the map!'" Wilson continued.
iFrame Object
Wilson also referred to Trump supporters as "the credulous boomer rube demo."
The comment hearkens back to former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling conservatives who spent 2016 supporting then-candidate Trump a "basket of deplorables." Democrats and some media members have accused Trump of polarizing the country and eroding civil discourse. Trump and his defenders, meanwhile, have said his critics are unpatriotic and will oppose him in whatever he does.
In addition to the president's daughter, other Trump allies and members of conservative media blasted the CNN segment as well.

As Bernie Sanders gains in the polls, journalists unleash negative coverage

Texto completo: Independent Sen. and 2020 Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont is polling in first place in Iowa, New Hampshire, and California.
Yet, unlike Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom enjoyed glowing press back when polls showed their respective campaigns gaining traction, Sanders’s success has inspired a deluge of negative press and commentary.
There are both simple and complicated reasons for this.
The simple reasons include that members of the press merely want a different candidate to win the Democratic nomination and that news outlets are more than happy to print whatever juicy drama (see: gossip) competing 2020 campaigns feed reporters.
As Sanders is way, way up in the polls, it only makes sense that competing campaigns would work especially hard to get unflattering stories to reporters. We saw this earlier this month when the Warren campaign fed CNN a dubious story alleging that Sanders claimed in a private conversation in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency.
The more complicated reason is that the Democratic establishment and its allies in the news media are worried a genuine agent of change may win the party’s nomination. There is, therefore, a greater push to flood newsrooms with as many anti-Sanders narratives as possible. Democrats saw what happened to the GOP establishment in 2016 with the rise of President Trump. He remade the Republican Party in his own likeness, casting off entrenched personnel and replacing them with operatives loyal to his populist agenda. It is an act of self-preservation, then, for members of the Democratic establishment to block something similar from happening to them in 2020.
It is like the last Democratic primary all over again for the Vermont senator, having party operatives conspire to thwart his chances at the nomination.
At the Washington Post this week, journalists Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker reported a shocking revelation: Sanders’s supporters use social media to mock and criticize the senator’s opponents.
“Sanders supporters have weaponized Facebook to spread angry memes about his Democratic rivals,” reads the title, adding in the subhead, “Users are using mass-posting technologies to flood Facebook with attacks on Elizabeth Warren and others.”
The New York Times reports elsewhere that Sanders supporters are vicious, mean people. Maybe they'll be calling them "deplorable" soon.
“At the start of his 2020 bid,” the paper reports, “the Vermont senator told his supporters that he condemned bullying. Is it his problem if many don’t seem to listen?”
The report adds that “the power of his internet army has … alarmed Democrats who are familiar with its underside, experienced in ways large and small,” and that “top advisers — and often, Mr. Sanders himself — are acutely aware of the bile spread in his name.”
The article serves mostly to argue that Sanders is responsible for his followers' behavior and that his attempts to reign in his fans do not count because his supporters are still mean and vicious.
Earlier, MSNBC broadcast a segment featuring a so-called body language expert who “proved” Sanders lied when he denied he ever told Warren a woman could not win the presidency.
That moment came, by the way, immediately after CNN sided with Warren in a "he said, she said" leaked to the outlet by the Warren campaign.
The sudden burst of negative coverage for Sanders should not come as too much of a surprise, especially when it comes from excessively pro-Warren journalists and editors at the Washington Post, MSNBC, and CNN. After all, these organizations have tried hard these last few months to keep Warren’s flailing 2020 campaign afloat. It only makes sense that they would come out now with damaging stories against Sanders, as his success comes at Warren's expense.
If you are the sort of person who enjoys watching Sanders get dragged over the coals, I suggest you enjoy it while it lasts. If Sanders wins the Democratic nomination, the press will dutifully go back to its default setting of focusing almost entirely on the Republican presidential candidate. Call it force of habit.

'Fake victimhood': CNN panelists dismiss backlash over segment mocking Trump supporters

Texto completo: Two recent CNN panelists are defending themselves against backlash stemming from a segment in which they mocked President Trump's supporters.
CNN's Don Lemon was joined by New York Times columnist and CNN contributor Wajahat Ali and GOP strategist Rick Wilson over the weekend to discuss the recent feud between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and NPR's Mary Louise Kelly. After an interview last week, Pompeo screamed at Kelly and demanded she locate Ukraine on an unlabeled map.
During the conversation, Wilson pivoted to the president's supporters and suggested they wouldn't be able to find Ukraine on a map and that they would call being able to so a sign of elitism. Ali and Lemon laughed with Wilson, who used fake a southern accent to imitate a Trump supporter. Ali later chimed in on their ridicule of Trump voters, while Lemon laughed.
The two panelists faced strong backlash for depicting the president's supporters as uneducated after the segment went viral on Monday night, but neither appeared remorseful for the clip.
CNN panelists dismiss backlash from segment mocking Trump supporters
Wilson, who has been known for incendiary comments about the president and his supporters, argued that the outrage was "fake" because "the MAGA world wants the freedom to attack, insult, demean, and abuse anyone who doesn’t aggressively worship Donald Trump. They can’t stand anyone who punches back, and hope they can intimidate or shame me."
The strategist, who worked for Evan McMullin's 2016 presidential campaign, continued to attack the president and his supporters, telling the Washington Examiner, "Once again the MAGA tough guy 'f--- your feelings' crowd demonstrates that what really drives them is a grinding social anxiety fueled by a weaponized and monetized outrage machine."
He added, "What set the White House off was that Trump hates being called out for his utter ignorance of the world; all the phony outrage at me is just Trump fundraising grifters milking the MAGA herd for donations."
Tweet
"At the top of the pyramid are the Trump email grifters and Fox News outrage hustlers," he said in another tweet. "They recognize that all that is left inside the Republican Party as an ideology is a hatred of elites and the media. Sorry. No participation trophies here for MAGAs. They hope that they can shield their bad behavior, pathologies, willful ignorance, weaknesses, credulity, nature, and worship of Donald Trump behind a “how dare you talk down to me” anger without response."
Tweet
Wilson later called Trump "an impeached, corrupt scumbag," in response to Ivanka Trump, who called the segment "arrogant" and "disgusting."
Tweet
Ali responded similarly to negative tweets and private messages directed to him. He thanked the president for tweeting a clip from the segment, which Trump captioned, "Don Lemon, the dumbest man on television (with terrible ratings!)."
"Thank you for sharing our clip. Can you please release your school transcripts that will show you're a very stable genius? Also, can you release your taxes and the full transcript of your 'beautiful' phone call with Zelensky? Also, can you locate Bangladesh on a map? #BeBest."
Tweet
"How come no one ever cares about the Women, Immigrants, Black people, Journalists, Democrats, Never Trumper Republicans, Mexicans, Muslims that Trump always mocks and ridicules and threatens with malicious cruelty? Maybe he'll lose because of the rest of us," he added.
Tweet
Ali also tweeted at Wilson, saying he believes the they "'triggered' the 'snowflakes' just by doing a short segment on TV with some levity." He additionally noted that "friends are now concerned about my safety," but said, "I refuse to be intimidated & bullied by bad faith actors who cry fake victimhood, whining about a harmless, silly 30 second clip while endorsing Trump, a cruel vulgarian who debases everyone."
Lemon has not tweeted since the clip went viral. CNN did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.

On Kobe Bryant and Felicia Sonmez: Twitter mobs and cancel culture infect the Washington Post

Texto completo: When the Atlantic hired conservative Kevin Williamson, an angry Twitter mob came after the magazine, citing Williamson's callous comments about abortion. The Atlantic caved to the mob and fired him.
When Daniella Greenbaum posited that actresses could act as though they were transgender (pretending to be what they are not is part of acting after all), an angry Twitter mob came after her. Her employer, Business Insider, caved to the mob and retracted the piece.
The New York Times wrote a literal, factual headline, but it wasn’t sufficiently anti-Trump, and so an angry Twitter mob descended. The New York Times caved to the mob and changed the headline.
Caving to social media mobs is something the editors do. And now, we see that includes Marty Baron, who on Sunday suspended reporter Felicia Sonmez for her tweets, which stirred up an angry mob.
There’s a lot of sensitive stuff in this story, and reasonable people can disagree about almost every element. But those disagreements ought to be able to happen without suspensions or firings.
There’s a question about the propriety of Sonmez’s first tweet, linking to a story about the rape accusation against Kobe Bryant, just hours after his death.
Most people believe that it’s wrong to criticize someone who has just died, particularly if they died young. I don’t agree with most people. I wrote very critical post-mortem columns and editorials about Mario Cuomo and Hugh Hefner. If the recently deceased is a public figure, then naturally praise for the person will pour out into the public. That can trigger, in journalists such as me and Sonmez, a desire to provide some balance to resist a false impression that forms.
I didn’t want everyone thinking that Cuomo had only good or even mostly good effects on U.S. politics. That would be false, and journalists hate it when the lie wins.
On Sunday, though, most of you, like me, felt only sadness, recalling Kobe's greatness as a player, witnessing his devotion as a dad, appreciating his faith as a Catholic, and thinking about his contrition for his very public sin. That explains the outpouring of love and praise for the man on Sunday afternoon.
But some readers may have had different reactions.
Put yourself in the mind of a victim of sexual assault who was checking Twitter on Sunday afternoon. Or at the very least, imagine a woman who suffers years later from an emotionally scarring sexual encounter with a very powerful man that didn’t go the way she wanted. Imagine if that woman, seeing how Kobe settled the civil suit, believes that he had acted as a predator but is now being sanctified. That could make a woman feel like sexual predation simply gets brushed under the rug.
Sonmez, who has spoken publicly about being sexually assaulted, may have felt this.
This is a lot of emotional stretching that I’m asking of the reader, I know. Most of you aren’t journalists, and journalists sometimes have to do things in their jobs that would be considered indecent in normal life. Also, we don’t really know what Sonmez was thinking and feeling. But we should have enough empathy with her to understand why she tweeted very differently in that moment than you or I might have.
Then there are questions about Sonmez’s third tweet, which included the full name of a man who emailed vile insults to her. I don’t think journalists should publicly out even their hate-mailers. If there are real threats, call the police instead of provoking the person. If it’s impotent hate, we have a professional obligation to resist the temptation to ruin the person who is treating us like garbage. It’s not easy, but it’s right.
Marty Baron, according to the New York Times's reporting on this, was unhappy with Sonmez’s tweets. He asked her to stop. Another editor asked her to delete them. She did.
And it should have ended there. But then, the Washington Post suspended her.
Why? Most likely, it was the Twitter mob. Tens of thousands of people were very angry at her and the Washington Post. They were attacking her newspaper. And making it much trickier for the Washington Post, race played a role in this story. Look on Twitter, and you’ll see lots of people upset that a successful black man is being smeared and presumed guilty of charges that were dropped in court.
If Baron and the other honchos felt they were on the wrong side of a racial issue, all while witnessing a barrage of hate tweets at their writer, you could understand why they might have panicked. And if you know how our media works these days, you're not surprised that they folded.

Texto completo: CNN's Don Lemon and two guests on his show are facing backlash after they mocked President Trump's supporters and depicted them as uneducated.
Lemon was joined by New York Times columnist and CNN contributor Wajahat Ali and GOP strategist Rick Wilson during his show Saturday night to discuss the recent feud between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and NPR. Following an interview last week, Pompeo yelled at NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly and demanded she locate Ukraine, the topic of the initial disagreement, on an unlabeled map.
Wilson pivoted the conversation to attack Trump supporters, claiming they wouldn't be able to identify Ukraine.
"[Pompeo] also knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter 'U' and a picture of an actual, physical crane next to it," he stated, eliciting a laugh from Lemon. "He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world. And so, that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience. You know, the credulous boomer rube demo that backs Donald Trump."
Wilson, who has written anti-Trump books, including Everything Trump Touches Dies and Running Against the Devil: A Plot to Save America From Trump — and Democrats From Themselves, then went on to use a heavy Southern accent to impersonate how he believes a Trump supporter speaks, stating, "'Donald Trump's the smart one — and y'all elitists are dumb!'"
"'You elitists with your geography and your maps — and your spelling!'" Ali chimed in, while his fellow guest added, "'Your math and your reading! All those lines on the map!'"
Lemon, who had to wipe his eyes after laughing so hard that he started to cry, said, "That was a good one. I needed that."
The clip went viral on Monday night after former CNN digital producer Steve Krakauer tweeted it, writing, "The arrogance, the dismissiveness, the smug cackling, the accents. If Donald Trump wins re-election this year, I’ll remember this brief CNN segment late one Saturday night in January as the perfect encapsulation for why it happened."

Tweet
Soon after, both Trump and members of his campaign attacked the segment. Trump tweeted that Lemon is "the dumbest man on television" and added that he has "terrible ratings," both of which are insults he's thrown at the anchor previously.
Tweet
"Deplorables. This Deplorable is ready," Trump 2020 campaign director Brad Parscale tweeted, while Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh wrote, "This is a real segment from an actual program on a cable news network that asks to be taken seriously. Not subtle message to huge parts of America: THEY HATE YOU."

Yes, likability really is about sexism

Texto completo: Who would you rather grab a beer with: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or Joe Biden?
If you pick IPA-drinking Sanders or teetotaling Biden over Warren, don't be surprised if the Democratic establishment calls you sexist.
“The issue with Elizabeth Warren isn't likability,” reads a headline in the Guardian, echoing similar defense pieces in Slate, the Atlantic, and the New York Times. “It's sexism.”
The question of “likability,” supposedly a metric for electability, has long been entangled in gender politics. Hillary Clinton was “unlikable,” which, according to some Democrats, was the reason for her political demise. Even President Trump seems to think it contributed to her failure.
“That’s why she lost,” Trump said last week, “nobody liked her.”
Although the supposedly sexist constraints of likability are a convenient excuse for mediocrity, they don’t account for Clinton’s failure. Trump did have one unfair advantage, though. It is true that for women, more so than men, likability matters.
“This likability dimension is a real barrier for women,” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, told Vox last year. “Voters are perfectly willing to vote for a man for executive office that they think is qualified that they don’t like, but they are not willing to vote for a woman they think is qualified that they don’t like.”
New research proves that this is true. According to a study published in The Economic Journal, likability matters among women and among mixed-gender groups but not among men alone. In other words, women want both sexes to be likable, and men want women to be likable, but they don’t care so much about other men.
“Our results hint at the existence of a likeability factor that offers a novel perspective on gender differences in labour market outcomes,” Leonie Gerhards, the paper's lead author, said. “While likeability matters for women in every one of their interactions, it matters for men only if they interact with the opposite sex.”
In short, women always need to be likable, and men only have to worry about it half the time. To Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Tulsi Gabbard, likability is vital. For every other 2020 candidate, not so much.
For men, it can even pay to be unlikable. The fact that Trump is a pompous blowhard has somehow become a point in his favor. Sanders actually benefits from having the unlikable Clinton say, as she did last week, “Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him.” (Cleverly, Sanders shot back, “My wife likes me.”)
If likability matters to female voters, then emphasizing it isn’t sexist (unless you want to run with a narrative about internalized misogyny). It's pragmatic. And from a pragmatic standpoint, Warren and Klobuchar just aren't doing too well.
The failure to seem relatable on the part of these candidates isn’t due to some invisible sexist forces working against them. According to Warren's Instagram, she doesn’t even know how to drink beer like a human being. And Klobuchar is anything but likable according to her long-suffering aides, who have the comb to prove it.
On the other hand, Tulsi Gabbard, a surfer and a push-up champion at the gym, is eminently likable, and her reasons for flailing in the polls have nothing to do with her gender and everything to do with her position as a threat to the Democratic establishment.
Among the male Democrats, Andrew Yang is by far the most likable candidate in the 2020 field. When the New York Times asked candidates about their celebrity crush, a puff question that was more revealing than you’d expect, Yang replied evenly, “I’m a happily married man. I think my wife’s a star, and I’ve got a big crush on her.”
Warren, on the other hand, called Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson "eye candy." That's a level of cringe that has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with being out of touch.
It's a shame that likability matters for women more than it matters for men. But female politicians can also use that to their advantage. However, Democrats such as Clinton and Warren will continue to decry the double standard, not because they cannot surmount it, but because they’re just not that good at playing the game.

Diversity complaints create last-minute distraction for Buttigieg before Iowa

Texto completo: OTTUMWA, Iowa — After a day campaigning in Iowa where potential caucusgoers quizzed him on his inability to connect with minority voters, Pete Buttigieg was forced to respond on Tuesday to twin news stories on how his team has failed to create an inclusive work environment where its nonwhite staff members feel valued and heard.
"We've taken steps that may not be something that is typical or has happened a lot before in presidential campaigns to try to empower staffers at all levels to be able to speak to their experiences to raise concerns and to have these tough conversations, and they are tough in every organization and in our country," he told reporters after a town hall in Ottumwa, Iowa.
The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was referring to initiatives such as training sessions, retreats, follow-up meetings, consultation mechanisms, and surveys that, while a fixture in the corporate world, are not often organized for busy campaigns. He said the reports served as a reminder "of race and the difference all the time on top of doing a job that's already so hard," but he couldn't say how he had acknowledged the issues with aides or whether he would apologize.
"We've got to work much harder to do a better job when making sure that inclusion is a reality, especially in the Trump era," the 38-year-old former mayor added.
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Buttigieg campaign staff had complained about experiencing an “emotional weight,” exacerbated by the feeling they had been hired to meet the team's 40% diversity target. According to documents and recordings, they felt their feedback and ideas weren't being listened to and it had become demoralizing to work for a candidate who continued to struggle with black or Hispanic Democrats such as themselves.
There were also tensions after Buttigieg's fundraising staff overruled their vetting counterparts, planning a donor event with supporter Steve Patton, a then-city attorney who tried to stop the release of a video showing Chicago police shooting Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, in 2014. A public backlash led to the campaign removing Patton as the fundraiser's co-host and returning his contributions.
When pressed on Patton, Buttigieg told reporters on Tuesday that the drama stemmed from "miscommunication."
"As soon as it came to my attention, we acted immediately," he said. "When this took place, we took responsibility to review what happened, fix the problems, and make sure that going forward problems like that wouldn't happen again."
The New York Times story was published the same day as a Wall Street Journal article about a former aide who had vented about the campaign's work culture, perpetuated by “ass-kissers, racists, sexists, power-hungry phonies, everything," in a now-deleted tweet.
Buttigieg's lack of success with minority outreach was perceived to be a national media narrative backed up by polling, but it's filtered down to Iowa Democrats, many of whom are still undecided.
Anecdotes, such as a 2011 clip in which Buttigieg asserts that some lower-income and minority students lag behind in school because they don't have "someone who they know personally who testifies to the value of education" have been latched onto by Black Lives Matter activists, who routinely disrupt his rallies, even a fundraising event.
Yet, in early-voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, which are mostly white, Buttigieg remains in contention to win delegates in what could be a drawn-out nomination fight. In Iowa, he averages 17% support, while in New Hampshire he attracts 14.8% of the vote ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses and Feb. 11 primary, respectively.

Texto completo: The BuzzFeed editor who published unverified and salacious allegations about President Trump's relations with Russians is moving to the New York Times.
Ben Smith released a statement on Tuesday confirming he is leaving BuzzFeed in March, after which the 44-year-old will become a media columnist at the New York Times. His statement mentions Trump and Russia but does not discuss the dossier.
Smith, who joined BuzzFeed in late 2011 after writing for Politico, stirred controversy with the January 2017 decision to publish British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, a 35-page collection of reports about Trump's ties to Russia, including allegations that the Russians had a video of Trump with prostitutes urinating on a bed in a Moscow hotel room.
The dossier circulated among government officials and multiple media outlets, most of which declined to report its contents without verification.
In publishing the dossier, BuzzFeed News acknowledged that it had not confirmed the claims it contained but reasoned that it was publishing the full document "so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the president-elect that have circulated at the highest levels of the US government."
Smith has stood by the decision to present the dossier to the public, even after special counsel Robert Mueller's report undercut elements of Steele's reporting.
“At the time we published it,” he told Vanity Fair in April, “effectively everyone in the country, except for the broad public, had already seen it — intelligence officials, members of the press, politicians, large sections of the Washington chattering class. It had also been briefed to two presidents of the United States. That all stands up incredibly well, and there’s no doubt that this was an extremely important document in American history."
Whether Trump reacts to Smith's career move remains to be seen. He already has a history of calling the New York Times, among other outlets, "fake news."
The emergence of the dossier fueled Trump's criticism of the Justice Department and the FBI, as it played a role in the counterintelligence investigation of his campaign's ties to Russia that ultimately found no criminal conspiracy between the two.
A report released by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz in December criticized the FBI for its reliance on the dossier to obtain warrants for wiretapping onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It revealed that the FBI interviewed Steele's primary Moscow-based source, beginning in January 2017, who "raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele election reporting."
According to a Sunday Times report over the weekend, Rupert Allason, a British author who specializes in espionage under the pen name Nigel West, conducted a forensic analysis of Steele's work that determined there is a "strong possibility that all Steele’s material has been fabricated."
Steele's company, Orbis Business Intelligence, said earlier this week that "much of the dossier has been proven” since 2017. “We stand by the integrity and quality of our work," Orbis said.

Democrats scoff at proposal to read Bolton manuscript in secret

Texto completo: Democrats rejected a proposal by two Republicans to read former national security adviser John Bolton’s unpublished book in a secure area of the Capitol.
“What an absurd proposal,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Tuesday.
Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma said lawmakers should have an opportunity to read Bolton’s manuscript.
In parts of the book that were disclosed to the New York Times, Bolton wrote that Trump wanted to withhold Ukraine security aid until officials there publicly promised an investigation into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Lankford said he wanted to obtain the manuscript to see exactly what Bolton is claiming.
Graham said he agreed with Lankford, adding that the manuscript should be made available in a secure area of the Capitol known as the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility.
“It’s a book,” Schumer said. “There is no reason for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something.”
Schumer accused Republicans of “twisting themselves into a pretzel to avoid the truth,” about the charges against the president, who is accused of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power.
Democrats want to call Bolton as a witness and believe their case is bolstered by “several stunning chapters” of Bolton’s book that have partly leaked to the media.
Lawmakers have not read the manuscript.
Democrats want to summon three witnesses in addition to Bolton and are seeking four sets of Trump administration documents, all related to the decision to withhold Ukraine aid.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told lawmakers Tuesday the trial would run “several hours,” but not as long as Monday's proceedings, which lasted far into the evening.
When the defense concludes, lawmakers will take up to 16 hours to question in writing both the defense team and the House impeachment managers.
Trump is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Jay Sekulow, who is Trump's personal lawyer and leader of his defense team, defended the president's desire to investigate efforts by Democrats to hurt his 2016 presidential campaign by raising the Steele dossier, an unverified opposition research brief paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign that contained salacious charges against the president. It was used by the Justice Department to justify a yearslong federal investigation into Trump's campaign.
"You can't view this case in a vacuum," Sekulow argued. "Put yourselves in his shoes."
Sekulow urged senators to ignore the latest news about Bolton's manuscript. Nobody has seen it, but a source leaking to the New York Times claims Bolton writes that Trump wanted to withhold critical security aid in order to get the government to investigate Democrats, including the Bidens.
"You cannot impeach a president on an unsourced allegation," Sekulow said. "Even if everything in there was true, it does not amount to an impeachable offense."
He urged senators to ignore the string of information coming from the book.
"It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts," Sekulow said of the impeachment trial. "Put yourselves above the fray."
The defense team opened with arguments from lawyer Patrick Philbin.
Philbin told senators the president has a unique level of power to make decisions, not the aides who have come forward to complain about the president’s actions in the House impeachment investigation.
“They are there to provide information and recommendation, not to set policies,” Philbin said.
Philbin also challenged the House impeachment articles for assigning “illicit motives” to Trump’s decision to block aid to Ukraine temporarily.
“Something that they ferret out and decide is wrong, becomes impeachable,” Philbin said. “It’s not standard at all. It ends up becoming infinitely malleable.”

The best argument against Bernie? The Biden-backing Democratic establishment can't make it.

Texto completo: Just days before the 2008 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses, Hillary Clinton led Barack Obama by four points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Obama took the lead, by a few tenths of one percentage point, literally 24 hours before the caucuses. And then he won by nearly eight points.
In retrospect, things were moving very fast in Iowa in those final days before the voting. And now, we are again days away from an Iowa Democratic caucus. Things might be moving in ways we don't know.
Four candidates have held the lead at various times in the Iowa race. Joe Biden led from the start until the third week in September last year. Then Elizabeth Warren took over and led until mid-November. Then it was Pete Buttigieg's turn; he led until the first week in January.
This year brought new volatility. First Bernie Sanders led until mid-January. Then Biden led again until January 24. And since then, Sanders has jumped back into the lead.
In the last few days, two candidates -- Sanders and Biden -- seem to be headed up, while the other two -- Warren and Buttigieg -- seem to be headed down. In any event, this seems to be an Iowa caucus in which there is great possibility for last-minute shifts in voter choices. So predictions are useless.
What is undeniable is Democratic establishment nervousness about Sanders. The basic worry is that he is so far to the left that the party might end up nominating the only candidate President Trump can beat.
Just look at some headlines from the last few days:
"Dems tormented over how to stop Bernie." (Politico)
"'Oh my God, Sanders can win': Democrats grapple with Bernie surge in Iowa." (NBC News)
"Worried Democratic Operatives Scramble to Fund a Network to Take Down Bernie Sanders." (Daily Beast)
"Fear of Sanders win growing among Democratic establishment." (Associated Press)
"'Stop Sanders' Democrats Are Agonizing Over His Momentum." (New York Times)
Actually, that last headline, from the Times, was from April 2019. Democrats were agonizing then, and they're still agonizing now.
It is hard to imagine two more different men than Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, but establishment Democrats fear that something could be happening in their party that echoes the events of 2016 for Republicans: A candidate with popular appeal who is dismissed by party leaders manages to build so much support that the establishment cannot deny him the nomination.
It might seem a little odd that Democrats are so worried by a Trump 2016 scenario. After all, Trump won. But it was, of course, a rocky road, and more than a little unpleasant for GOP bigwigs.
So now, Democrats listen when the loser of that race, Hillary Clinton, expresses her apparently undying disdain for Sanders. In an admiring -- aren't they all? -- new documentary on her losing campaign, Clinton says of Sanders: "He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."
In a promotional interview, the Hollywood Reporter asked Clinton if that assessment still holds. "Yes, it does," she answered.
The only problem for establishment figures like Clinton is that Sanders is leading in Iowa. He is leading in New Hampshire. He is in second place in South Carolina. And then, looking down the road a bit, he is leading in the biggest state of them all, California.
The establishment has reason to be worried.
One irrefutable argument the party establishment would have against Sanders is that he is simply too old to be president. He will be 79 years old on Inauguration Day 2021 and will turn 80 within a few months of taking office. That is unprecedented in American history. And, of course, Sanders suffered a heart attack last October.
Trump, the nation's oldest president ever, could serve four more years, and at the end of two full terms still be younger than Sanders would be on the first day of his presidency.
All that would be an effective argument, except that the establishment's preferred candidate, by the same standard, is also too old to be president. Biden will be 78 on Inauguration Day and to some observers' eyes looks less energetic and resilient than Sanders.
The establishment's support of Biden makes it impossible to use the age argument against Sanders. So for now, the party has no good strategy for dealing with its Sanders problem. In a week, the Iowa caucuses will be over, and the problem could be much, much worse.

The View co-host: Trump team used 'racist dog whistle' during impeachment defense

Texto completo: The View host Sunny Hostin accused President Trump's impeachment defense team of racism by bringing up the New York Times's 1619 Project.
"That was just a dog whistle to, you know, a racist dog whistle, quite frankly, to the base," the host claimed Tuesday after the show played a clip of the defense team mentioning the project. Co-host Joy Behar said she thought the defense team brought it up as a "smokescreen" to ignore the charges against Trump.
During the trial, Trump's team called the project an "ahistorical sleight of hand" and said it had been criticized by historical scholars. The reference was made as the team criticized the House impeachment managers' take on the impeachment of former President Andrew Johnson in 1868.
The New York Times unveiled the project back in August, and its goal was to "reframe" American history around the start of slavery. The paper planned to release a series of articles as a part of the project, which so far include essays such as "In order to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation" and "The sugar that saturates the American diet has a barbaric history as the 'white gold' that fueled slavery."
The project's bold claims have caused some to criticize it as being historically inaccurate, calling it an attempt to advance divisive politics.
Last week, Hostin affirmed her support for identity politics while her fellow co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg and Meghan McCain disagreed.

Republicans look for ways to hear Bolton outside of trial

Texto completo: Senate Republicans say they want to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton — but not necessarily at the impeachment trial.
Sen. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina wants Bolton to provide a manuscript for lawmakers to review in a classified setting. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said that Bolton should talk publicly about the claims in the book.
“Just come forward. Tell the public what you know,” Johnson said Tuesday. “I think that actually would be a good thing. Without involving the trial.”
Bolton’s allegations surfaced Sunday night in the New York Times, which printed them after a source who read the manuscript leaked information to the newspaper.
Bolton claims in the book that Trump said he wanted to block security aid to Ukraine until the government promised to investigate the Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Nobody in the Senate has seen the manuscript.
Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, first proposed the idea of giving senators an opportunity to read the manuscript in a classified setting in the Capitol.
Democrats have rejected the proposal.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called it “an absurd proposal” and said there is no reason to put the manuscript in a classified setting “unless you want to hide something.”
The report of Bolton’s allegations jarred Senate Republicans, who were feeling more comfortable with the idea of ending the trial with a vote on the articles later this week.
Now, some Republicans feel pressured to find out more about Bolton’s claims.
Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitt Romney of Utah, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said they want to hear from Bolton.
Romney said the book manuscript won’t be enough for him.
“I’d like to hear from John Bolton,” Romney told reporters Tuesday.
Murkowski said senators will "have to figure out," how to learn more about Bolton's charges.
The GOP senators will begin meeting Tuesday to discuss their plan.
The trial resumes on Wednesday with the first eight of the allotted 16 hours of time dedicated to written questions and answers.
By Friday, senators will have to vote on whether to call witnesses or proceed with votes on whether to convict the president of the two impeachment articles.
Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican of South Dakota, said it’s not clear how many of the 53 Senate Republicans will vote for witnesses.
It would require a vote of 51 senators to agree to call new witnesses and documents.
“It could be 50, or it could be 53,” Rounds said. “We really haven’t sat down and asked anybody to do that.”
Graham doesn’t support calling witnesses and warned that if the Senate votes to do so, it will have to include testimony from a long list of people sought by the GOP.
“If you call John Bolton, we are calling everybody. We are not just going to call one witness,” Graham said.
He told the Washington Examiner that the list would include Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, among others.
As for Bolton, Graham said, “They should have called him in the House,” during its portion of the impeachment proceedings.
Graham's prediction on a big group of witnesses may be an effort to warn the GOP away from voting to have them at all.
Republicans control the majority and can, without any Democrats, vote to end the trial and vote to acquit the president.
A conviction is all but impossible since it would take 67 votes — that's 20 Republicans, assuming all 45 Democrats and both independents voted to remove the president.
Republicans say they don't believe there is any way the Senate would simply call Bolton as a witness without calling many others, and the trial would go on indefinitely.
"I just worry once you go down that path of opening the door," Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, said. "It’s going to be a floodgate."

Alan Dershowitz: Warren 'mischaracterized' my impeachment argument

Texto completo: Alan Dershowitz, one of President Trump's defense lawyers in the Senate impeachment trial, shot back at Sen. Elizabeth Warren after she accused him of providing an "unsupported" legal argument on Monday.
"His characterization of the law simply is unsupported," Warren said of Dershowitz. "He is a criminal law professor who stood in the well of the Senate and talked about how law never inquires into intent and that we should not be using the president's intent as part of understanding impeachment."
Dershowitz, who supported the impeachment and removal of President Bill Clinton, said it is Warren, a fellow former Harvard law professor, who does not understand constitutional law.
"This says more about Warren than it does about me," Dershowitz said. "She also willfully mischaracterized what I said, claiming that I spoke about 'intent.' I challenge her to find that word anywhere in my presentation. I talked about the difficulty of discerning mixed motives."
Tweet

During his remarks before the Senate on Monday, Dershowitz argued that what Democrats have accused Trump of doing does not amount to an impeachable offense.

"If the president, any president, were to have done what the Times reported about the content of the Bolton manuscript, that would not constitute an impeachable offense," he said.

The New York Times reported late Sunday evening that former Trump national security adviser John Bolton alleges in a new book that Trump told him he wanted to continue a temporary freeze on military aid to Ukraine while his associates worked to dig up dirt on his political rivals.

Democrats said that was an abuse of power and warrants Trump's removal from office.

"You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words like 'quid pro quo' and 'personal benefit,'" Dershowitz, who was brought on to Trump's legal team to interpret the Constitution for the president's benefit, said.
Warren, who is a leading candidate in the Democratic primary, echoed an argument House impeachment managers made last week: Trump intended to use his power as president to achieve a personal goal.
"Criminal law is all about intent," Warren said. "Mens rea is the heart of criminal law. That's the very basis of it. So, it makes his whole presentation just nonsensical. I truly could not follow it."
Tweet
Dershowitz dismissed the senator from Massachusetts, accusing her of being intellectually dishonest.
"If Warren knew anything about criminal law she would understand the distinction between motives — which are not elements of crime — and intent, which is," he said. "It’s the responsibility of presidential candidates to have a better understanding of the law."

GOP senator: I don’t need to hear John Bolton testify in Senate impeachment trial

Texto completo: John Bolton is now at the center of the Senate impeachment trial.
The New York Times reported on an unpublished manuscript of the former national security adviser's book, to be released in March, in which Bolton writes President Trump told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in aid to Ukraine until officials helped with investigations into Democrats, namely Joe and Hunter Biden.
However, none of this seems to faze Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican.
On the podcast Hashing it Out, Cramer said that he doesn’t need to hear Bolton testify.
“I don’t think it’s very much new information,” Cramer said. “I really don’t.”
He continued. “Even if it’s all true, exactly in the worst-case scenario as John Bolton may put it, it doesn’t really change the facts much, if at all. For me, I also don’t think I’d really learn anything new from him, because we already know that the president was concerned about Biden’s role, when Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, and a possible corrupt activity in Ukraine. So, if it’s further proof of it, so what? We already know about it.”
Even as some of his Republican colleagues, such as Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski, feel the pressure to vote in favor of allowing witnesses to testify, Cramer said he feels no pressure, even after the Bolton revelation.
Cramer also said that dragging out the Senate impeachment trial will damage and divide the country further than it already has. However, on a political level, he added that Trump’s impeachment will hurt Democrats more in the long run.
“People understandably are very protective of their power that they have in our exceptional system of an electoral republic,” Cramer said. “When the power of the people is substituted for the power of the partisan House of Representatives, I think they take that rather seriously, and they ought to.” iFrame Object

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton and Attorney General William Barr never discussed concerns about President Trump granting “personal favors” to autocratic leaders or having “undue influence” on investigations, according to the Justice Department.
The denial follows the leak of details about Bolton’s book manuscript, which alleges he told Barr he had concerns about the president’s relationships with the leaders of Turkey and China. Barr then told Bolton he was worried Trump created the appearance that he had sway over independent investigations, according to the New York Times.
A Justice Department spokeswoman said late Monday that the report describing the conversation “grossly mischaracterizes” what the two men discussed.
“There was no discussion of ‘personal favors’ or ‘undue influence’ on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr state that the president’s conversations with foreign leaders was improper,” spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “If this is truly what Mr. Bolton has written, then it seems he is attributing to Attorney General Barr his own current views — views with which Attorney General Barr does not agree."
Bolton submitted the draft of his book, The Room Where it Happened, to the White House’s National Security Council nearly a month ago for review. The book is set to be published March 17.
The former national security adviser and his publisher denied sharing the manuscript with the New York Times, which also reported that Bolton alleged Trump conditioned aid to Ukraine on the country investigating his political rival Joe Biden.

William B. Taylor: Yes, Secretary Pompeo, Americans should care about Ukraine

Texto completo: As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in Kyiv later this week, he has reportedly asked, “Do Americans care about Ukraine?”
Here’s why the answer should be yes: Ukraine is defending itself and the West against Russian attack. If Ukraine succeeds, we succeed. The relationship between the United States and Ukraine is key to our national security, and Americans should care about Ukraine.
Russia is fighting a hybrid war against Ukraine, Europe and the United States. This war has many components: armed military aggression, energy supply, cyber attacks, disinformation and election interference. On each of these battlegrounds, Ukraine is the front line.
For the last seven months, I represented the United States in Ukraine and regularly visited the front line of the military conflict. After its occupation of Crimea, Russia sent its army, security forces, undercover agents, weapons, funding and political instruction into Ukraine’s southeastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, a region known as the Donbas. The 280-mile line of contact between Russian-led forces and Ukrainian forces has stabilized but has not gone quiet.
To the contrary, the front line in the Donbas region marks the only shooting war in Europe. Every week Russian-led forces kill Ukrainian soldiers — and take casualties in return. During the 12 hours of my last visit, in November, a Ukrainian soldier was killed and another wounded. Since the Russians invaded in 2014, 14,000 Ukrainians have died in this war.
The United States and our allies support Ukraine in this war by providing the Ukrainian armed forces with weapons, training and support. American security assistance to Ukraine regularly receives broad, bipartisan support in Congress; the importance of that assistance to Ukraine — and to U.S. national security — is not at issue.
On the energy battlefield, the Kremlin is trying to bypass Ukraine and increase German and European dependence on Russia by spending billions on an unnecessary underwater natural gas pipeline, a political project without economic justification. In another show of bipartisan political support for Ukraine, Congress late last year passed sanctions on companies attempting to complete the pipeline, forcing a significant delay in the project.
Russia’s hybrid war is also an information war. Starting at home, Russian media is dominated by the state, leading its citizens to believe they are under threat from a hostile West and convincing them that President Vladimir Putin protects them from corrupt enemies. Russia’s trolls and internet hackers target Ukrainian, European and American political and social fault lines, exaggerating differences and fomenting dissension. They seek to weaken Western alliances, undermine confidence in democratic institutions, and turn citizens against citizens. We and other NATO allies are working with Ukraine to counter this malign influence.
The Russians interfered in our elections in 2016 — but not before interfering in Ukraine’s elections in 2014, and Britain’s Brexit referendum earlier in 2016. Because Ukraine is the front line, we assisted the Ukrainian central election commission in its preparations for their 2019 elections to defend against further Russian interference. Their efforts, with our assistance, successfully frustrated Russian attacks.
But the Russian challenge is even broader than hybrid warfare. The Kremlin is attacking the rules that have guided relations among nations since World War II, rules that kept the peace among major European powers for 70 years. With their invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Mr. Putin trashed those rules, spurned international consensus, violated the treaties and principles that even previous Russian and Soviet leaders had respected — even in the breach.
Mr. Putin seems to want to return to the law of the jungle that characterized relations among nations for centuries before 1945, where powerful nations dominated and invaded less powerful nations, where nations established spheres of influence that oppressed neighbors, leading to war and suffering. That was how the Russian Empire and Soviet Union conducted international relations — dominate, control and absorb neighboring lands. A return to jungle rules threatens not just Ukraine and the United States, but global stability itself.
Until Russia withdraws from Ukraine — both Donbas and Crimea — and recognizes that Ukraine is an independent, sovereign nation, other nations cannot be secure. Until Russia recommits to a rules-based international order, Western nations are in jeopardy. Ukraine is the front line.
In an even broader sense, Russia’s attack on Ukraine and the West is an attack on democracy. The question of how nations govern themselves — democracy versus autocracy — is being fought out among and within nations. Russia, China, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Syria — all are autocracies, all are unfree. In the contest between democracies and autocracies, the contest between freedom and unfreedom, Ukraine is the front line.
To support Ukraine means to support a young democracy, fighting to regain sovereignty over its internationally recognized borders. It is to support a nation that has broken from its troubled past to embrace European and Western values and that seeks to join European and North Atlantic institutions, to defeat post-Soviet corruption, and to give its citizens the chance to prosper in a normal country.
To support Ukraine is to support a rules-based international order that enabled major powers in Europe to avoid war for seven decades. It is to support democracy over autocracy. It is to support freedom over unfreedom. Most Americans do.

Paul Krugman: At Davos, Greta vs. the greedy grifters

Texto completo: I’ve never been a fan of Davos, that annual gathering of the rich and fatuous. One virtue of the pageant of preening and self-importance, however, is that it brings out the worst in some people, leading them to say things that reveal their vileness for all to see.
And so it was for Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary. First, Mnuchin doubled down on his claim that the 2017 tax cut will pay for itself — just days after his own department confirmed that the budget deficit in 2019 was more than $1 trillion, 75% higher than it was in 2016.
Then he sneered at Greta Thunberg, the young climate activist, suggesting that she go study economics before calling for an end to investment in fossil fuels.
Well, unearned arrogance is a Trump administration hallmark — witness Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, claiming that a respected national security reporter couldn’t find Ukraine on a map. So it may not surprise you to learn that Mnuchin was talking nonsense and that Thunberg almost certainly has it right.
One can only surmise that Mnuchin slept through his undergraduate economics classes. Otherwise he would know that every, and I mean every, major Econ 101 textbook argues for government regulation or taxation of activities that pollute the environment, because otherwise neither producers nor consumers have an incentive to take the damage inflicted by this pollution into account.
And burning fossil fuels is a huge source of environmental damage, not just from climate change but also from local air pollution, which is a major health hazard we don’t do nearly enough to limit.
The International Monetary Fund makes regular estimates of worldwide subsidies to fossil fuels — subsidies that partly take the form of tax breaks and outright cash grants, but mainly involve not holding the industry accountable for the indirect costs it imposes. In 2017 it put these subsidies at $5.2 trillion; yes, that’s trillion with a “T.” For the U.S., the subsidies amounted to $649 billion, which is about $3 million for every worker employed in the extraction of coal, oil and gas.
Without these subsidies, it’s hard to imagine that anyone would still be investing in fossil fuels.
But maybe Mnuchin thinks that the IMF should also take some courses in economics — along with the thousands of economists, including every living former Federal Reserve chair, dozens of Nobel laureates, and chief economists from both Democratic and Republican administrations, who signed an open letter calling for taxes on emissions of greenhouse gases.
In short, Greta Thunberg may be only 17, but her views are much closer to the consensus of the economics profession than those of the guy clinging to the zombie idea that tax cuts pay for themselves.
But could the economics consensus be wrong? Yes, but probably because it isn’t hard enough on fossil fuels.
On one side, a number of experts argue that standard models underestimate the risks of climate change, both because they don’t account for its disruptive effects and because they don’t put enough weight on the possibility of total catastrophe.
On the other side, estimates of the cost of reducing emissions tend to understate the role of innovation. Even modest incentives for expanded use of renewable energy led to a spectacular fall in prices over the past decade.
I still often find people — both right-wingers and climate activists — asserting that sharply reducing emissions would require a big decline in GDP. Everything we know, however, says that this is wrong, that we can decarbonize while continuing to achieve robust growth.
Given all this, however, why are people like Mnuchin and his boss Trump so adamantly pro-fossil fuel and anti-environmentalist?
Part of the answer, I believe, is that conservatives don’t want to admit that government action is ever justified. Once you concede that the government can do good by protecting the environment, people might start thinking that it can guarantee affordable health care, too.
The bigger issue, however, is sheer greed.
Given the scale of subsidies we give to fossil fuels, the industry as a whole should be regarded as a gigantic grift. It makes money by ripping off everyone else, to some extent through direct taxpayer subsidies, to a greater extent by shunting the true costs of its operations off onto innocent bystanders.
And let’s be clear: Many of those “costs” take the form of sickness and death, because that’s what local air pollution causes. Other costs take the form of “natural” disasters like the burning of Australia, which increasingly bear the signature of climate change.
In a sane world we’d be trying to shut this grift down. But the grifters — which overwhelmingly means corporations and investors, since little of that $3-million-per-worker subsidy trickles down to the workers themselves — have bought themselves a lot of political influence.
And so people like Mnuchin claim not to see anything wrong with industries whose profits depend almost entirely on hurting people. Maybe he should take a course in economics — and another one in ethics.

Texto completo: The idea of America that most of us have come to embrace — that of a functioning democracy responsible and responsive to its citizens who are entitled to vote and whose votes are equal — is lost. In fact, it may never have existed in that way at all. And the trends in society are now toward the worse rather than the better.
The founders of this country never intended for everyone to vote, and they didn’t even include a right to vote in the Constitution. Instead they let voting default to the states, which erected their own barriers to the ballot. As such, the right to vote has expanded and contracted over time.
In the beginning, generally speaking, property-owning white men were the only people allowed to vote. That franchise has expanded over time to include all white men, black men, women and so forth. But, there remain efforts to restrict access to the ballot, particularly for black and brown people in this country.
This rash of new restrictions seems to have been ignited by the election of Barack Obama, America’s first black president. As the Brennan Center for Justice has pointed out, “After the 2010 election, state lawmakers nationwide started introducing hundreds of harsh measures making it harder to vote.” As the center documented:
“Overall, 25 states have put in place new restrictions since then — 15 states have more restrictive voter ID laws in place (including six states with strict photo ID requirements), 12 have laws making it harder for citizens to register (and stay registered), 10 made it more difficult to vote early or absentee, and three took action to make it harder to restore voting rights for people with past criminal convictions.”
In fact the idea of “one person, one vote” wasn’t fully invoked in the United States until the 1960s, when Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the decision for Reynolds v. Sims in 1964: “The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing — one person, one vote.”
Furthermore, big money from corporations and candidates themselves is corrupting the process and wielding outsize influence on voters’ choices.
In the 1960 presidential campaign, John Kennedy came under attack for spending what his competitor Hubert Humphrey thought an unseemly amount on a political campaign. As CBS reported:
“Humphrey called Kennedy’s campaign ‘the most highly financed, the most plush, the most extravagant in the history of politics in the U.S.’ At that point, Kennedy had spent $72,000 (about $575,000, in today’s dollars) on radio, TV and mailers in Wisconsin.”
Kennedy defended himself by pointing out that “President Eisenhower’s campaign in 1952, when costs were lower, was $2,500,000.” That was still only about $20 million in today’s value.
Compare that to the nearly $1 billion Donald Trump raised in 2016 and the nearly $1.5 billion raised by Hillary Clinton.
And, the outside spending — political spending by outside groups, excluding party committees — has skyrocketed in the last couple of decades. From 1990 to 2002, it rarely broke the million-dollar mark, according to OpenSecrets.org. In 2016, it reached $178 million.
This is to say nothing of how Russia’s political influence campaign exposed just how vulnerable individual Americans were to being manipulated by misinformation.
Our electoral process has become corrupted, with politicians seeking to block some from the ballot and plutocrats seeking to beguile those who would vote.
Now, with the Trump impeachment, we are seeing that the structure of government is also showing signs of fracture.
There has been no doubt, since the White House released the quasitranscript of the phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, that Trump had been engaged in a corrupt act when trying to pressure the Ukrainians to announce an investigation of the Bidens. Indeed, this month, the Government Accountability Office determined that Trump broke the law when withholding funds to Ukraine as part of his pressure campaign.
Then, Trump did everything within his power to conceal what he had done when the House of Representatives launched its impeachment investigation.
Now, Senate Republicans stand poised to cement in precedent, by way of an acquittal, that the president who thought himself king, who considers himself above the law, is in fact above the law. Oaths be damned. Constitution be damned.
An acquittal will say to the world, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the checks and balances built into the Constitution are fatally flawed and unworkable, that they are compromised to the partisanship and therefore unworkable and worthless.
The Senate will be saying to America that corruption is an acceptable feature of the executive branch. This will be another devastating blow to electoral confidence and to trust in government.
Everything from who can vote, how they vote, who influences that vote, who is elected by that vote and who is accountable having been voted in, is broken.
American, as an idea, as a representative democracy with the power ultimately vested in the people and accountable to the people, is vanishing like a vapor.

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin appealed to Republicans on Monday to call President Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial.
The call from Baldwin and other Senate Democrats for testimony comes after new reports claiming Bolton has firsthand knowledge of Trump's alleged offenses.
The New York Times reported Sunday on a draft of Bolton's book in which he says the president told him he wanted to continue withholding security aid for Ukraine until the country's top officials announced investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
"The American people simply want the facts, they want the truth," Baldwin told reporters. "In order to provide them that, the Senate must support testimony from relevant witnesses with firsthand knowledge about President Trump's conduct. John Bolton has that."
Trump was the subject of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats who alleged he withheld military aid and a much sought-after White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy unless Zelenskiy announced an investigation into the Bidens and a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the hacking of Democratic servers in 2016.
The Republican-controlled Senate is set to determine whether Trump should be removed from office for abuse of power for pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens as Trump withheld military aid to the country, and for obstructing the House investigation.
Bolton was asked to testify as part of the House's impeachment inquiry but refused to appear for a deposition. He later said he would appear if subpoenaed. The president's defense team has claimed Democrats could not produce a single witness to produce firsthand knowledge that Trump linked aid for Ukraine to investigations of Democrats.
On Monday, Baldwin said Bolton's testimony could constitute direct evidence of abuse of power. She also said it would confirm the account former ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland told U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, that aid to Ukraine was tied to Trump's request to have the Eastern European nation undertake investigations related to the 2016 U.S. elections.
Johnson has said Trump, in a phone call with him, rejected the notion he made the military aid contingent on investigations.
When asked whether Johnson himself should testify, Baldwin nodded in agreement with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, who said Democrats don't want senators to testify, only eyewitnesses to the president's actions.
According to reporting by The New York Times, the manuscript details a previously reported May 23 meeting where top advisers and Johnson briefed the president about their trip to Kyiv for Zelenskiy's inauguration.
Trump "railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Mr. Bolton," The Times reported.
In a previous statement, Johnson claimed he "did not recall in any meeting or discussion with the president ... any discussion of any specific case of corruption in the 2016 election."
"One of them's not telling the truth," Baldwin said.
A Johnson spokesman said Johnson stands by his statement regarding his interactions with Trump and will decide on witnesses once the Senate has heard all the initial arguments.
Johnson last week signaled he would vote for Trump's acquittal.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Hours after a bombshell report led some Republican senators, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, to consider a deal for witnesses in President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial, the White House defense team on Monday turned their focus to Hunter Biden.
Mr. Trump's defense lawyers argued Mr. Biden defied long-standing conflict of interest and corruption concerns when he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating that company.
The lawyers sought to show senators that Mr. Trump's interest that Ukraine announce an investigation into Burisma for corruption was - rather than targeting the son of a political opponent - rooted in legitimate concerns.
"What was Hunter Biden doing at Burisma in exchange for millions of dollars?" asked Eric Herschmann, an attorney for Mr. Trump. "Nobody has ever investigated why."
Hunter Biden had few, if any, qualifications to oversee operations at an oil and gas firm, Mr. Herschmann added. "He did have one qualification: He was the son of the vice president of the United States," he said.
Monday's presentations were praised by many Senate Republicans who spoke with reporters during breaks in the trial. Yet the defense team's tactics added another wrinkle in a looming battle this week over whether to call witnesses and issue subpoenas for documents.
Support for witnesses grew after a report in The New York Times on Sunday. The Times reported a draft copy of an upcoming book from John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, stated the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.
Mr. Trump's hold on that military aid, along with delaying a coveted White House meeting, was at the center of the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last September. The House voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
House Democrats asserted Mr. Trump betrayed U.S. national security interests by pressuring the American ally to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. The former vice president is running for the Democratic nomination to face Mr. Trump in November.
Democrats have been calling for Mr. Bolton to testify for months. Mr. Bolton - who left the Trump administration days before the surfacing of the whistleblower report that sparked the impeachment inquiry - has direct knowledge of the president's motivations in Ukraine, Democrats have argued.
Setting the ground rules for the trial last week, Senate Republicans voted down Senate Democrats' numerous attempts to call any witnesses until both sides presented arguments and senators finished a round of questioning.
Mr. Bolton's draft manuscript, which was not independently viewed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, appeared to sway some key Republican senators on Monday. Four Republican senators would have to join the 47 Senate Democrats in approving a measure.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement Monday that Mr. Bolton's disclosure"strengthens the case" for the Senate to call witnesses.
"I've always said that I was likely to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial," Ms. Collins stated. She added she would make a final decision later.
Another key senator, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said it's "increasingly likely" Republican senators would vote to call witnesses. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are also coming under pressure.
Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, tweeted at all four Republican senators that "it's time to keep faith with the American people and call for witnesses."
Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey floated the idea of a "one-for-one" deal on witnesses, meaning Democrats could call Mr. Bolton and Republicans could choose a witness to call. The proposal was first reported by The Washington Post.
Mr. Toomey's office declined to comment on the report. In a statement Monday, Mr. Toomey said he "will make a determination regarding the need for additional witnesses - including Ambassador John Bolton - after the president's lawyers make their presentation and senators have had a chance to pose questions."
If Republicans wind up calling witnesses, Hunter Biden could be the focus.
White House lawyers on Monday laid out years of news reports - and some witness testimony from the House impeachment proceedings - that questioned the appearance of Hunter Biden's board seat while Burisma was under investigation for money laundering and other crimes.
Pam Bondi, an attorney for Mr. Trump, showed the testimony of one witness, a diplomat who has served during the Obama and Trump administrations, who raised concerns to the former vice president's office in a February 2015 phone call.
George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators he told the office Hunter Biden's role "could create the perception of a conflict of interest." The Ukrainian oligarch who owned Burisma "stood out for his self-dealings," Mr. Kent testified.
"Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest," Ms. Bondi said.
After the presentation, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Mr. Trump was "entirely justified" in pushing Ukraine to investigate Burisma. Though Mr. Cruz does not think witnesses are necessary, he said, "at a minimum, the most important witness for the Senate to hear from is now Hunter Biden."
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said "we will decide Friday on witnesses" and that it could "be a group of individuals."
Other Republicans suggested the whistleblower could be called.
If Senate goes down the road of calling witnesses, "you gotta go all the way to the end," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who has advised the president's impeachment defense. "And that would be to call the whistleblower that started this whole thing."
Though the news surrounding Mr. Bolton's book commanded the media spotlight, White House lawyers on Monday largely ignored it.
Kenneth Starr, who led the investigation that spurred the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, lectured senators for more than an hour that this impeachment inquiry is unprecedentedly unfair, in part because House Democrats did not allege Mr. Trump committed a crime.
Mr. Starr, now an attorney for Mr. Trump, said senators should weigh the unusual partisan nature of Mr. Trump's impeachment proceedings and the "grave disruption" an impeachment would bring in an election year.
The Senate "would do well to guide the nation to return to our country's traditions when presidential impeachment was truly a measure of last resort," Mr. Starr said.
Senate Democrats said Mr. Starr, by arguing senators should be impartial, inadvertently made their case for more information.
"The president's lawyers continue to make the case for witnesses and documents," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "What's a court without witnesses and documents?"
"The case for witnesses became ever stronger last night," Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., in a video posted to Twitter during a trial break he recorded with his Senate floor neighbors, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.
"I feel like we're in an alternative universe sitting in there," Ms. Klobuchar said, saying there are "game-changing revelations" in Mr. Bolton's manuscript.

To the Editor:
Re "Bolton's Account Fuels Senate Push to Call Witnesses" (front page, Jan. 28):
Let's do some simple math here. John Bolton's "tell all" manuscript was provided to the White House on Dec. 30. The members of the legal team representing this president were certain to have either read it or were briefed upon its contents, yet weeks later they marched into the Senate trial and continued along their merry way lying in front of the entire nation.
Are there four G.O.P. senators with a spine?
Steve Himmelman
Chicago
To the Editor:
When I read that "a handful of Republicans appeared to be moving closer to joining Democrats in a vote to subpoena Mr. Bolton," I cannot help but wonder what would happen if a large bloc of Republican senators chose not to march in lock step with everything Trump. We keep hearing about four possible Republicans who might breach the barriers. Where are those others who reportedly have contempt for President Trump? Could Mr. Trump and Mitch McConnell inflict damage on, say, 20 or more senators?
There is an Ethiopian proverb that states, "When spiders unite, they can tie down a lion."

Re "John Roberts Can Call Witnesses to Trump's Trial. Will He?," by Neal K. Katyal, Joshua A. Geltzer and Mickey Edwards (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 27):
If Chief Justice John Roberts can call witnesses in the impeachment trial, rather than calling John Bolton, why not call Donald Trump to the witness stand?

Bail Reform in New York
To the Editor:
Re "New York's New Bail Laws Harm Public Safety" (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 23):
The New York City police commissioner, Dermot Shea, has joined the chorus of people stoking fear about recent reforms that correct our unjust money bail system.
Contrary to his belief, New York does have an over-incarceration problem. For decades, the Police Department's "broken windows" policing tactics have funneled hundreds of thousands of innocent people, particularly young men of color, into the criminal legal system. The scales of justice have been tipped heavily in favor of the rich, who have been able to buy their freedom while poor people have languished in jail for years.
Commissioner Shea also calls for judges to hold people in jail based on a guess as to who might commit a future crime; this encourages fear and bias to drive critical decisions about a person's life.
Like the commissioner, we want New Yorkers to thrive and feel safe. But a knee-jerk, lock-'em-up approach will not prevent crime. Instead of incarcerating people who are merely accused of a crime, we need to prioritize community investments in education, housing, rehabilitation and our mental health systems to truly make our communities safe.

Texto completo: A core element of President Donald Trump's defense against removal from office has been that the abuse-of-power charge is based on "hearsay" — that the impeachment managers failed to produce any inner-sanctum testimony proving the president held up military aid to Ukraine in a bid to extort dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden.
“Anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations," deputy White House counsel Michael Purpura argued to the Senate on Monday.
Enter John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser.
What John Bolton's book says
According to a New York Times report Sunday, Bolton has written a book manuscript that says Trump clearly stated Ukraine would not receive $391 million in taxpayer-funded military aid until officials there assisted with investigations of Democrats, including the Bidens.
The president denied this linkage. His lawyers, in presenting their defense this week, all but ignored it: “It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued Tuesday.
But the senators sitting in judgment of the president have an obligation to do more than close their eyes and cover their ears to new evidence.
SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN: Democrats already rolled their dice on witnesses
REP. ANDY BIGGS: GOP senators shouldn't bail out sinking case
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was well on his way to engineering a "trial" that races to acquittal without so much as a single witness being called. While expedient for Trump, that would be laughable to most Americans who know what a trial should look like.
Bolton is a conservative who has had a foreign policy role in every GOP administration since President Ronald Reagan's. He has said that he is ready to testify in response to a subpoena. If Senate Republicans reject a firsthand account from him, they will demonstrate that they are more interested in covering up Trump’s behavior than in doing impartial justice.
The House impeachment managers assembled a strong, if largely circumstantial, case that Trump abused the power of his office with his extortion demand of Ukraine. More definitively, the president obstructed congressional investigators by blocking testimony and documents.
Trump blocked aides from testifying
With Trump preventing his closest advisers from testifying during the impeachment proceedings late last year, senators have an obligation at the trial to summon people like Bolton and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, among others.
But McConnell and the vast majority of his caucus seemed ready to forgo witnesses, arguing that they were under no duty to go on a "fishing expedition. " Now there's a preview of what Bolton would say, and it goes to the heart of the allegations against Trump.
Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-vote majority in the 100-member Senate, are considering their next move, and this is where the Democrats could grease the skids by laying out a deal with Republicans to allow prosecutors and defense lawyers to call relevant witnesses of their choice.
True, that might result in a subpoena for Hunter Biden, who worked for a scandal-marred Ukrainian energy company. (Did he show poor judgment? Sure. Should Trump be trying to outsource his opposition research to a foreign government? Absolutely not. ) But if a compromise would allow Bolton and others to testify, it would serve the public's interest.
This impeachment trial — only the third in U. S. history — is much more than just a proceeding before the Senate. It's a vehicle for the American people to judge their president's character and conduct. For that, witnesses are imperative.
Bolton's book is slated for publication in March. To pass on the chance to thoroughly question and cross-examine him, under oath, would be a loss to history and expose these historic proceedings as a farce.

Texto completo: Fotis Dulos, principal sospechoso en la desaparición en mayo de su esposa Jennifer en Connecticut, intentó suicidarse en su casa hoy, cuando debía presentarse en el tribunal para una audiencia de libertad bajo fianza, informó la policía.
La policía y los paramédicos se apresuraron a su casa de Farmington, donde inicialmente se dijo que Dulos (52) había sido declarado muerto en la escena, según New York Times y Hartford Courant.
Más tarde se informó que había sido hospitalizado en grave condición.
El abogado de Dulos, Norm Pattis, le dijo a New York Post que su cliente intentó envenenarse con monóxido de carbono.
Dulos había estado en libertad con una fianza de $6 millones de dólares desde el 9 de enero mientras esperaba juicio por asesinato y secuestro por la desaparición de su esposa y madre de sus cinco hijos.
Jennifer (50) desapareció el pasado 24 de mayo. Su esposo debía presentarse en el Tribunal Superior de Stamford para una audiencia de fianza, que estaba en duda porque la aseguradora que lo respaldaba, Palmetto Surety Company, había expresado su preocupación por la garantía que se había presentado.
Dulos, un constructor de casas de lujo, está acusado de matar a Jennifer en su casa, meter su cuerpo en su Chevrolet Suburban y conducir al parque Waveny de New Canaan. El cuerpo no ha sido encontrado.
La ex novia de Dulos, la hispana Michelle Troconis, está acusada de conspirar con él en el asesinato.
Un tercer acusado, el abogado Kent Mawhinney, un amigo de Dulos, fue acusado de conspiración en el caso y está detenido por cargos de conspiración.

Texto completo: Fotis Dulos, principal sospechoso en la desaparición en mayo de su esposa Jennifer en Connecticut, intentó suicidarse en su casa hoy, cuando debía presentarse en el tribunal para una audiencia de libertad bajo fianza, informó la policía.
La policía y los paramédicos se apresuraron a su casa de Farmington, donde inicialmente se dijo que Dulos (52) había sido declarado muerto en la escena, según New York Times y Hartford Courant.
Más tarde se informó que había sido hospitalizado en grave condición.
El abogado de Dulos, Norm Pattis, le dijo a New York Post que su cliente intentó envenenarse con monóxido de carbono.
Dulos había estado en libertad con una fianza de $6 millones de dólares desde el 9 de enero mientras esperaba juicio por asesinato y secuestro por la desaparición de su esposa y madre de sus cinco hijos.
Jennifer (50) desapareció el pasado 24 de mayo. Su esposo debía presentarse en el Tribunal Superior de Stamford para una audiencia de fianza, que estaba en duda porque la aseguradora que lo respaldaba, Palmetto Surety Company, había expresado su preocupación por la garantía que se había presentado.
Dulos, un constructor de casas de lujo, está acusado de matar a Jennifer en su casa, meter su cuerpo en su Chevrolet Suburban y conducir al parque Waveny de New Canaan. El cuerpo no ha sido encontrado.
La ex novia de Dulos, la hispana Michelle Troconis, está acusada de conspirar con él en el asesinato.
Un tercer acusado, el abogado Kent Mawhinney, un amigo de Dulos, fue acusado de conspiración en el caso y está detenido por cargos de conspiración.

Douthat: Impeachment’s curious partisan reversal

Texto completo: In the debate over whether Donald Trump deserves impeachment, a curious partisan reversal has taken place. Trump’s opponents are suddenly constitutional originalists, seeking to ground their case for impeachment in 18th-century history and founding-era rhetoric. Meanwhile, his most persuasive defenders are more likely to invoke a kind of living constitutionalism, in which the limited, sporadic way that impeachment has been actually used over the centuries matters more than what the founders contemplated.
Thus the House Democrats’ brief for impeachment is studded with 18th-century quotes to prove that “high crimes and misdemeanors” covers all manner of corrupt uses of official power, easily encompassing Trump’s sordid behavior with Ukraine. And legal scholars have rushed to point out that in the English tradition the founders drew upon, the impeachment power was used for what legal historian Frank Bowman III calls “a striking array of abuses of office,” not just a few specific crimes.
Skeptics of the impeachment push, meanwhile, have pointed to the striking absence of presidential impeachments across the republic’s subsequent history. Did James Madison favor an expansive understanding of the impeachment clause? Maybe so, but as an editor of his papers pointed out in the Washington Post, as president, Madison engaged in a dodgy, Trumpian scheme to use State Department money to buy documents purporting to prove his Federalist opponents were conniving with London; the Federalists cried foul, but there wasn’t even the beginning of an impeachment proceeding.
As with Madison, the anti-impeachment argument goes, so with most presidencies since. Yes, impeachment in theory covers all manner of sins. But though presidents have hardly been shy about pushing the limits of their power, impeachment in practice requires supermajorities and national consensus, which is why only one president in all our history has been pressured into resignation, and none have been removed.
In a New York Times op-ed last week, Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law Houston argued that this narrowing of the impeachment power reflects the difficulty of defining when politicized machinations shade into the abuse of power. Allowing that Trump is particularly crude about it, all presidents conflate their own political self-interest with the national interest — and so deciding when a president crosses the line and betrays his office is almost always a task best left up to the voters.
Both the strengths and limits of Blackman’s argument are distilled in one of his historical examples: Lyndon Johnson’s appointment of Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark’s son Ramsey Clark as attorney general, part of a maneuver to induce Clark’s resignation so that Johnson could then appoint the first African American justice and consolidate African American support.
This is a useful example because it’s been apparent for a while that Trump doesn’t want to be an American Mussolini so much as he wants to be a less legislatively minded LBJ — meaning that his conception of the presidency belongs to the middle of the 20th century, when a casual corruption was more commonplace, and presidents routinely used their powers to spy on political opponents (as LBJ did to Barry Goldwater) or undermine them, enable their private appetites (cough, JFK) and cover up their scandals. In this sense, Trump’s conduct is indeed more historically normal than the twilight-of-the-republic rhetoric of his impeachers would suggest. But this defense weakens when you consider that post-Watergate America very clearly tried to establish rules against precisely the sort of behavior that was normal for JFK and LBJ.
How well those norms have held is a matter for debate, but there’s a reasonable case that presidents have been constrained by them. Bill Clinton’s presidential priapism was less egregious than John F. Kennedy’s, and he got impeached for it; no modern president has imitated the Kennedy seraglio. The FBI’s misconduct in its investigation of the Trump campaign was still nothing like the FBI’s misconduct under J. Edgar Hoover. And despite Trump’s nepotistic impulses, even he hasn’t yet imitated Kennedy’s elevation of his own brother as attorney general.
So the more modest case for Trump’s impeachment isn’t that it upholds a standard that’s been honored since the founding. It’s that after Richard Nixon we made an effort to limit the space for presidents to abuse their power, such limits are good things, and letting Trump get away with his Ukraine maneuver would be a form of backsliding — one that would encourage further abuses from a presidency whose direct power over policy now arguably exceeds its powers in any era in the past.
And since Trump presumably will not be removed, in practice we’re testing a more modest argument still: that whether it’s perjury or a “perfect phone call” with Ukraine, impeachment-without-removal can function like an act of censure, a punishment that restrains misbehaving presidents without actually removing them.
As a system, this obviously pleases nobody. But in the debate I’ve just sketched it does offer something to both sides. The power to define and condemn an abuse of power rests with the Congress, as Madison and Alexander Hamilton imagined. But how severely to punish the offender will usually be — as it will be this November — for the voters to decide.

Art Museum plans complaint line and training

Texto completo: The Philadelphia Museum of Art soon will have an anonymous system in place for staff to report sexual-harassment and discrimination complaints, and a museum-wide training program covering harassment, discrimination, and anti-bias issues is planned to begin next month, according to several people who attended all-staff meetings Monday.
The meetings, regularly scheduled affairs designed to keep employees abreast of museum policies and news, were devoted entirely to issues related to fallout from a Jan. 10 New York Times article that detailed the complaints of several women concerning the behavior of Joshua R. Helmer, 31, who worked as a middle manager at the museum for several years before leaving in 2018.
Helmer subsequently was named head of the Erie Art Museum and departed that position in the wake of the Times article. In that article, several women alleged that Helmer pursued relationships with them while holding out possibilities for professional opportunities.
A lawyer for Helmer, Paul John Susko, said Monday that he was declining to comment for now.
To accommodate the staff at Monday's meetings, Leslie Ann Miller, president of the museum's board of trustees, led two sessions at which she was joined by Nancy Brennan, head of the museum's human resources department. The museum declined a request from The Inquirer to attend the meetings, and staff members were not allotted the opportunity to ask questions.
According to staff members in attendance, Brennan said the museum will offer two days of on-site, one-on-one counseling sessions, available to all employees, beginning Tuesday. Throughout February, attendees said, the museum also will offer nine sessions encouraging conversations on workplace issues. The sessions will be facilitated by the Anti-Oppression and Resource Training Alliance (AORTA).
A spokesperson for the museum confirmed the programs announced to the staff Monday.
Several who attended the sessions said that the harassment training and anonymous reporting system are welcome and even long overdue.
"It was really heartening to hear that our senior management agrees" with the immediate need for such action, said Sarah Shaw, an employee of the department of education.
Museum educator Adam Rizzo noted that concrete actions - such as the counseling sessions and third-party reporting - represent positive movement but come months too late.
"This isn't new information, this is information that's newly being acted on," Rizzo said after the meetings.
Neither Brennan nor Miller, attendees said, could provide details of a promised outside "cultural assessment" of the museum, discussed by museum director and CEO Timothy Rub at an all-staff meeting last week and at small departmental sessions prior to that.
Rub had said details of the assessment would be forthcoming at Monday's meetings. They were not, according to staffers in attendance.
A small group of board members is considering proposals for the assessment. What its scope should be, who could best conduct it, and for what purpose are questions still to be answered, according to staffers. Miller said that she would be joined by museum board members Ajay Raju, Jennifer Rice, Romulo L. Diaz Jr., Mary Patterson McPherson, and Zoe Pappas in reviewing options for the assessment. She characterized the group as diverse.
According to attendees, the museum hopes to select a third-party reporting hotline vendor by the end of the week. Brennan reportedly said that the human resources department will make its offices more accessible and private.
"So far, between the department meetings and the [all-staff meeting] last week, this is the most we've heard in terms of concrete steps," said Shaw. "I'm appreciative of any concrete steps, but I wonder why they are taken only in reaction to bad press."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will arrive at the New Jersey Shore on Tuesday for a campaign rally in Democrat-turned-Republican Jeff Van Drew's district, at a moment of political uncertainty for both Trump and his new ally.
One is enduring only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history, a proceeding rocked Sunday by new revelations from a one-time ally. The other is still trying to find his footing in a new party. Both face challenging reelections in November.
On Sunday, Trump saw one of his key impeachment defenses undermined when the New York Times reported that his former national security adviser, John Bolton, wrote in an unpublished manuscript that Trump directly tied the withholding of military aid for Ukraine to whether the country aided in investigations of his political rivals. That increased the political pressure on Republicans to have Bolton testify in what has so far been a speedy impeachment trial free of witnesses or new evidence.
Just two days before that, the strength of Van Drew's newfound loyalty to the president was called into question with the emergence of a voicemail he left for a voter. "I haven't voted for him, I didn't support him, I will not vote for him," Van Drew said of Trump in the Nov. 30 message, just three weeks before he defected to the GOP and pledged the president his "undying support."
Meanwhile, on Monday, Wildwood was jumping. A line of more than 1,500 people stretched for several blocks from the doors of the town's convention center, hoping to guarantee themselves a seat. It was a jovial crowd, a sort of MAGA tailgate.
All of it could make for an unpredictable Tuesday down the Shore. While Van Drew was still scheduled to ride with Trump on Air Force One to Wildwood and speak at the event, it remains to be seen if a president known for demanding fierce loyalty from Republicans will voice full-throated support for him when the moment arrives.
"It will be an attempt for [Van Drew] to demonstrate to his new colleagues that he is respected by the president and has the ability to deliver him to their district for a major event," said John Farmer, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "I see it primarily as an attempt to shore up Van Drew's status as a Republican."
In many ways, personal support for Trump has become the new dividing line in Washington, more than any specific policy issue - a reality hammered home during the ongoing impeachment trial. Republicans who have vocally criticized the president's behavior have been drummed out of the party, despite conservative voting records. Van Drew, one of the only Democrats to oppose impeachment, saw that stance effectively end his political future in his longtime party.
Similarly, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan had a voting record that won praise from top conservative groups in Washington. But his days in the GOP were numbered after he called for impeaching Trump in May. He left the party a few months later and is now an independent.
In Van Drew's case, opposition to impeachment overwhelmed everything else, and his support among Democrats plummeted. Because of impeachment, and more broadly because of his stance on Trump, he is now a Republican.
And since Van Drew's party switch in December, he's had to contend with criticism from both sides. Democrats are furious at the betrayal, while local Republicans have been skeptical of his conservative bona fides. He has voted with Trump only 7% of the time since taking office, according to a tally by the website FiveThirtyEight. He has a 100% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
But even though Van Drew's path to reelection remained precarious, he received a welcome sign of the strength of Trump's support in the Republican Party on Monday. David Richter, a millionaire construction executive who was seen as the GOP front-runner in the district before Van Drew switched parties, said he would switch districts and run against freshman Democrat Andy Kim instead. Another Republican challenger, Brian Fitzherbert, dropped out of the race Friday.
"Having the president fully endorse [Van Drew] and embrace him, it just doesn't make sense for me to continue in this race," Richter said. "I have endorsed Jeff Van Drew and will support his re-election campaign."
Wildwood was awakening from its usual winter slumber Monday afternoon. Pubs were organizing rally watch parties. RV's with Trump signs were parked at the Walmart in nearby Rio Grande, and Trump rally regulars were camped out near the Convention Center as early as Sunday.
"We've been nonstop," said Nancy DelPizzo of Toms River, N.J., who was selling Trump merchandise out of an RV in the Walmart lot.
Trump merchandise stands popped up, transforming summer beachwear shops into political souvenir shops, and Trump banners were hung from motel decks.
People took video selfies with a helicopter making practice landings near Wildwood High School behind them, and protesters held sign-making workshops. Throngs of counter-protesters are expected Tuesday, as Trump's appearance has unified some 30 different anti-Trump groups and four Democratic candidates running in the primary to face Van Drew. One event will feature Martin Luther King III, eldest son of the late civil rights leader.
This will be the first time a sitting president has campaigned in New Jersey's 2nd Congressional District since President George H.W. Bush visited Vineland in October 1992. In the fall of 1984, President Ronald Reagan stopped in Hammonton during his reelection travels. And President Theodore Roosevelt made brief "whistle stop" remarks there.
Police have cautioned about big crowds and long lines. The ticketed rally allows admission on a first-come, first-served basis.

Texto completo: No one can say the members of Oprah's Book Club won't have plenty to talk about at their next meeting.
About the same time, just a week ago, that Oprah Winfrey announced Jeanine Cummins' novel American Dirt as the latest book to receive her seal of approval, things started to get complicated.
Cummins' tale - about a Mexican bookstore owner and her young son fleeing Acapulco for the U.S. after their entire family is massacred by a drug cartel - has been on more than a dozen lists of most-anticipated books.
It was enthusiastically blurbed by best-selling authors John Grisham, Stephen King, and Ann Patchett, as well as by Mexican American novelist and poet Sandra Cisneros (The House on Mango Street), who called it "the great novel of Las Americas," and Dominican American novelist and poet Julia Alvarez (In the Time of the Butterflies), who declared it a "dazzling accomplishment."
So what's the problem?
Not everyone was so dazzled, including writer Myriam Gurba, who, in a piece for the site Tropics of Meta, wrote that American Dirt, by a white writer with a Puerto Rican grandmother, belonged to "the great American tradition of . . . appropriating genius works by people of color; slapping a coat of mayonesa on them to make palatable to taste buds estados-unidenses; and repackaging them for mass racially 'color-blind' consumption."
On Twitter, Gurba posted a picture of a stack of alternative reading, including Signs Preceding the End of the World, by Yuri Herrera; The Book of Unknown Americans, by Cristina Henriquez; and I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter, by Erika L. Snchez, urging her followers to instead "read something told in our own voices."
New York Times book critic Parul Sehgal, in a more measured, but possibly more devastating takedown, wrote that Cummins' book "feels conspicuously like the work of an outsider."
Sehgal's concern went beyond identity, though. A couple of samples:
"I found myself flinching as I read, not from the perils the characters face, but from the mauling the English language receives."
"The heroes grow only more heroic, the villains more villainous. The children sound like tiny prophets."
Ouch. OK, what does Cummins have to say?
In an interview with NPR's Rachel Martin after the controversy broke, Cummins said that "not everyone has to love my book, you know? I endeavored to be incredibly culturally sensitive. I did the work. I did five years of research. The whole intention in my heart when I wrote this book was to try to upend the traditional stereotypes that I saw being very prevalent in our national dialogue."
Asked if she was aware of her "cultural blind spots as a white woman," Cummins told Martin that she was as aware of them "as I could be," adding, "I certainly centered them in my mind as I was writing.
"One of the things that I find deeply distressing and disappointing about the current tenor of this conversation is how, in the court of public opinion, I am the white lady now in this narrative. The fact is that I am a white person. I am a citizen of the United States. I am a person who has a very privileged life. I am also Puerto Rican. And . . . that fact has been attacked and sidelined by people who, frankly, are attempting to police my identity."
How's all this going to work out for Oprah?
It's not the first time that trying to share her love of reading with the world has caused the media mogul some headaches. There was the time she picked James Frey's A Million Little Pieces for the book club, only to later find out that the work he'd presented as a memoir was closer to fiction. (She did get a memorable second show out of that one, though, when she confronted Frey.)
And then there was the time she chose Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections, and Franzen failed to leap at the honor.
"Instead of rallying to Mr. Franzen," noted the New York Times, "most of the literary world took her side, deriding him as arrogant and ungrateful."
So let's not worry about Oprah.
How's the book doing?
On Friday, it ranked No. 3 among books sold by Amazon. By Monday afternoon, it had dropped to No. 9, though it was listed as No. 2 in "Hispanic American Literature & Fiction."
But the controversy hasn't yet run its course. On Monday, Cummins' publisher canceled an appearance and signing at a bookstore in Pasadena, Calif., that was scheduled for Tuesday night, the latest in a string of cancellations, reported the Los Angeles Times.
Salma Hayek took to Instagram to apologize for promoting American Dirt without having read it. "In the description of the book I learned that it was the story of a Mexican woman, so I rushed into sharing my excitement with you," wrote the Mexican actress.
Where does Oprah's Book Club meet these days, anyway?
Once a popular segment on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the book club's latest home is Apple TV+, where subscribers can stream the first two episodes, featuring Ta-Nehisi Coates' novel The Water Dancer and Elizabeth Strout's Olive, Again. Bring your own wine.

Texto completo: BY ERIC TUCKER, ZEKE MILLER and LISA MASCARO
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's lawyers mostly brushed past a leaked excerpt from John Bolton's new book and focused instead on historical arguments for acquittal.
Trump's legal team on Monday, including high-profile attorneys Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz, launched a wide-ranging historical, legal and political attack on the entire impeachment process. They said there was no basis to remove him from office, defended his actions as appropriate and assailed former Vice President Joe Biden, who is campaigning for the Democratic nomination to oppose Trump in November.
Ken Starr, whose independent counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton resulted in his impeachment - Clinton was acquitted by the Senate - bemoaned what he said was an "age of impeachment."
Impeachment, he said, requires both an actual crime and a "genuine national consensus" that the president must go. Neither exists here, Starr said.
"It's filled with acrimony and it divides the country like nothing else," Starr said of impeachment. "Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment understand that in a deep and personal way."
Dershowitz - the final speaker of the evening -
Argued that impeachable
Offenses require criminal-like conduct, a view debated widely among legal scholars. He said that even if Bolton's allegations are true, the president still would not have committed an impeachable offense.
"Purely non-criminal conduct, including abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, are outside the range of impeachable offenses," Dershowitz said.
Former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi focused particular attention on Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukraine gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration's diplomatic dealings with Kyiv.
She argued that Trump had legitimate reasons to be suspicious of the younger Biden's business dealings and concerned about corruption in Ukraine and that, in any event, he ultimately released the aid without Ukraine committing to investigations.
Democrats say Trump did so only after a whistleblower submitted a complaint about the situation, an allegation Trump's defense vigorously disputed.
Trump has sought to
Implicate the Bidens in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Though anti-corruption advocates have raised concerns, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son, although Obama administration officials raised conflict of interest concerns at the time about Hunter Biden's position.
Even as defense lawyers laid out their case as planned, it was clear that Bolton's book had scrambled the debate over whether to seek witnesses. Bolton writes that Trump told him he wanted to withhold security aid from Ukraine until it helped him with investigations. Trump's legal team has insisted otherwise, and Trump tweeted Monday that he never told Bolton such a thing.
Republican senators face a pivotal moment. Pressure is mounting for at least four to buck GOP leaders and form a bipartisan majority to force the issue. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority.
"John Bolton's relevance to our decision has become increasingly clear," GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, of Utah, said. Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, said she has always wanted "the opportunity for witnesses" and the report about Bolton's book "strengthens the case."
At a private GOP lunch, Romney made the case for calling Bolton, according to a person unauthorized to discuss the meeting and granted anonymity.
Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, of Pennsylvania, said if Trump's former national security adviser is called, they will demand reciprocity to hear from at least one of their witnesses. Some Republicans want to call the Bidens.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared unmoved by Bolton's book. His message at the lunch, said Indiana GOP Sen. Mike Braun, was, "Take a deep breath, and let's take one step at a time."
The president's team wraps its opening arguments today.
While Democrats say Bolton's revelations are reminiscent of the Watergate drip of new information, Republicans are counting on concerns subsiding by the time senators are asked to vote. They are being told that if there is agreement to summon Bolton, the White House will resist, claiming executive privilege. That would launch a weeks-long court battle that could drag out the impeachment trial, a scenario some GOP senators would rather avoid.
Trump and his lawyers have argued repeatedly that Democrats are using impeachment to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office.
Trump tweeted for viewers to tune in to the "hoax," advertising the trial's start time.
Some in the White House had hoped the legal team would steer away from the Bidens but acknowledged the Bolton revelations contributed to the decision to stay focused on the family. They worry about squandering what good will they have earned with the Senate, where Biden served for decades.
Democrats, meanwhile, say Trump's refusal to allow administration officials to testify only reinforces that the White House is hiding evidence. The White House has had Bolton's manuscript for about a month, according to a letter from Bolton's attorney.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: "We're all staring a White House cover-up in the face."
Rep. Adam Schiff, who leads the House prosecution team, called Bolton's account a test for the senators sitting as jurors.
"I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment," Schiff said on CNN.
Bolton's account was first reported by The New York Times and was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the manuscript on the condition of anonymity. "The Room Where It Happened; A White House Memoir" is to be released March 17.
Trump denied Bolton's claims in tweets Monday.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said. "If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
Joe Biden, campaigning in Iowa, said he sees no reason for testimony by him or his son.
"I have nothing to defend. This is all a game, even if they bring me up," he told reporters. "What is there to defend? This is all - the reason he's being impeached is because he tried to get a government to smear me and they wouldn't. Come on."
Trump said people could look at transcripts of his call with Ukrainian President Zelinskiy to see there was no pressure for investigations to get the aid. In that call, Trump asked Zelinskiy to "do us a favor" with the investigations as he was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to the U.S. ally at war with Russia.
Trump falsely claimed Monday that the Democrat-controlled House "never even asked John Bolton to testify." Democrats did ask Bolton to testify, but he didn't show up for his deposition. They later declined to subpoena Bolton, as they had others, because he threatened to sue, which is the legal right of Cabinet-level officials, which could have led to a prolonged court battle.
Eventual acquittal is likely in a Senate where a two-thirds majority vote would be needed for conviction
Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.

The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - A single paper copy in a nondescript envelope arrived at the White House on Dec. 30. Four weeks later, news of John Bolton's book manuscript about his time as President Donald Trump's national security adviser has exploded into public view.
The book contains an account of an August conversation in which Bolton says Trump told him that he wanted to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid from Ukraine until it helped him with investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
The account immediately gave Democrats new fuel in their pursuit of sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses, a question expected to be taken up later this week.
Within hours of the first report, a pre-order link was posted for "The Room Where It Happened; A White House Memoir." The homage to the song from the smash Broadway hit "Hamilton" is styled cheekily inside an oval on the image of the book cover released late Sunday.
Bolton's acrimonious departure from the White House came a day before Trump released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11. Since leaving his post, Bolton has avoided publicly commenting on his time in the administration, instead quietly writing the 528-page book, which is set to be published on March 17.
Despite its delivery to the National Security Council last month for pre-publication review, the book's contents were kept to a relatively small circle in the White House. Such reviews are standard for the works of former officials with security clearances.
National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said Monday that "No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript." Still, officials said the White House counsel's office was briefed on some of the substantive claims.
"The problem with John (testifying) is it's a national security problem," Trump told reporters in Davos, Switzerland, last week. "He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country?"
On Monday, Trump called Bolton's claim "false." Further, the president and his allies seized on the timing of the revelations about the book to allege that Bolton was seeking to boost his book sales.
"It's really pretty remarkable that the leak to the NYTimes about the alleged contents of John Bolton's book coincided precisely with the pre-order page going live on Amazon," tweeted Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh. "It's almost as if it were intended to boost sales."
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News, the leak came a day after the Trump team delivered arguments before the Senate on Saturday: "And then suddenly, this manuscript has magically appeared in the hands of The New York Times, making very, very big claims."
She noted that Bolton used the same literary agent as former FBI director James Comey and "Anonymous," the Trump administration official who wrote a critical 2018 New York Times op-ed and a book.
In a joint statement, Simon & Schuster, Bolton and his literary agency Javelin rejected the White House claims.
"Ambassador John Bolton, Simon & Schuster, and Javelin Literary categorically state that there was absolutely no coordination with the New York Times or anyone else regarding the appearance of information about his book, THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED, at online booksellers," they said. "Any assertion to the contrary is unfounded speculation."
Meanwhile, the book remains enmeshed in the review process over the manuscript's use of direct quotes and other material from meetings and foreign leader discussions, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to speak on the record.
The White House has requested that Bolton remove material it considers classified, the person said. In a statement Sunday, Bolton's attorney, Charles J. Cooper, said it is his and Bolton's "firm belief that the manuscript contained no information that could reasonably be considered classified."

Texto completo: PRESIDENT Donald Trump will arrive at the New Jersey Shore on Tuesday for a campaign rally in Democrat-turned-Republican Jeff Van Drew's district, at a moment of political uncertainty for both Trump and his new ally.
One is enduring only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history, a proceeding rocked Sunday by new revelations from a one-time ally. The other is still trying to find his footing in a new party. Both face challenging reelections in November.
On Sunday, Trump saw one of his key impeachment defenses undermined when the New York Times reported that his former national security adviser, John Bolton, wrote in an unpublished manuscript that Trump directly tied the withholding of military aid for Ukraine to whether the country aided in investigations of his political rivals. That increased the political pressure on Republicans to have Bolton testify in what has so far been a speedy impeachment trial free of witnesses or new evidence.
Just two days before that, the strength of Van Drew's newfound loyalty to the president was called into question with the emergence of a voicemail he left for a voter. "I haven't voted for him, I didn't support him, I will not vote for him," Van Drew said of Trump in the Nov. 30 message, just three weeks before he defected to the GOP and pledged the president his "undying support."
Meanwhile, on Monday, Wildwood was jumping. A line of more than 1,500 people stretched for several blocks from the doors of the town's convention center, hoping to guarantee themselves a seat. It was a jovial crowd, a sort of MAGA tailgate.
All of it could make for an unpredictable Tuesday down the Shore. While Van Drew was still scheduled to ride with Trump on Air Force One to Wildwood and speak at the event, it remains to be seen if a president known for demanding fierce loyalty from Republicans will voice full-throated support for him when the moment arrives.
"It will be an attempt for [Van Drew] to demonstrate to his new colleagues that he is respected by the president and has the ability to deliver him to their district for a major event," said John Farmer, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "I see it primarily as an attempt to shore up Van Drew's status as a Republican."
In many ways, personal support for Trump has become the new dividing line in Washington, more than any specific policy issue - a reality hammered home during the ongoing impeachment trial. Republicans who have vocally criticized the president's behavior have been drummed out of the party, despite conservative voting records. Van Drew, one of the only Democrats to oppose impeachment, saw that stance effectively end his political future in his longtime party.
Similarly, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan had a voting record that won praise from top conservative groups in Washington. But his days in the GOP were numbered after he called for impeaching Trump in May. He left the party a few months later and is now an independent.
In Van Drew's case, opposition to impeachment overwhelmed everything else, and his support among Democrats plummeted. Because of impeachment, and more broadly because of his stance on Trump, he is now a Republican.
And since Van Drew's party switch in December, he's had to contend with criticism from both sides. Democrats are furious at the betrayal, while local Republicans have been skeptical of his conservative bona fides. He has voted with Trump only 7% of the time since taking office, according to a tally by the website FiveThirtyEight. He has a 100% rating from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
But even though Van Drew's path to reelection remained precarious, he received a welcome sign of the strength of Trump's support in the Republican Party on Monday. David Richter, a millionaire construction executive who was seen as the GOP front-runner in the district before Van Drew switched parties, said he would switch districts and run against freshman Democrat Andy Kim instead. Another Republican challenger, Brian Fitzherbert, dropped out of the race Friday.
"Having the president fully endorse [Van Drew] and embrace him, it just doesn't make sense for me to continue in this race," Richter said. "I have endorsed Jeff Van Drew and will support his re-election campaign."
Wildwood was awakening from its usual winter slumber Monday afternoon. Pubs were organizing rally watch parties. RV's with Trump signs were parked at the Walmart in nearby Rio Grande, and Trump rally regulars were camped out near the Convention Center as early as Sunday.
"We've been nonstop," said Nancy DelPizzo of Toms River, N.J., who was selling Trump merchandise out of an RV in the Walmart lot.
Trump merchandise stands popped up, transforming summer beachwear shops into political souvenir shops, and Trump banners were hung from motel decks.
People took video selfies with a helicopter making practice landings near Wildwood High School behind them, and protesters held sign-making workshops. Throngs of counter-protesters are expected Tuesday, as Trump's appearance has unified some 30 different anti-Trump groups and four Democratic candidates running in the primary to face Van Drew. One event will feature Martin Luther King III, eldest son of the late civil rights leader.
This will be the first time a sitting president has campaigned in New Jersey's 2nd Congressional District since President George H.W. Bush visited Vineland in October 1992. In the fall of 1984, President Ronald Reagan stopped in Hammonton during his reelection travels. And President Theodore Roosevelt made brief "whistle stop" remarks there.
Police have cautioned about big crowds and long lines. The ticketed rally allows admission on a first-come, first-served basis.

Texto completo: Mike Roddy prefers to watch women’s basketball. 
He and his wife Nancy drove almost three hours from their home in Mason City on Sunday to watch the University of Iowa’s women’s basketball team play Michigan State on their home court in Iowa City. The Hawkeyes are in the middle of the second-longest active home game winning streak in women’s Division I basketball, and they’ve been breaking attendance records. 
Women share the ball instead of showing off – they “play the game as it’s meant to be played,” says Mr. Roddy. “It’s a skills game for them.”  
“That’s the same reason Amy will be better,” says his wife, referring to Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whom the Roddys plan to support in next Monday’s Iowa caucuses. “She has the skills.” 
The Roddys aren’t alone in their belief that a woman may possess the best skill set to be president. Senator Klobuchar and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have won some of the most coveted editorial board endorsements this cycle – The Quad-City Times and New Hampshire Union Leader for Ms. Klobuchar, and The Des Moines Register for Senator Warren. The New York Times, unable to decide, gave its nod to both of them.
Yet as is the case with basketball, much of the attention and money has seemed to flow to the men. After leading in the polls for a time this fall, Ms. Warren has slipped into fourth place in most surveys, while Ms. Klobuchar, despite showing hints of momentum, is even further behind.
In interviews, dozens of Democrats in Iowa cite electability, or the ability to beat President Donald Trump, as their top priority. And for many, that criteria seems to be steering them toward a male candidate – a way of thinking that experts on women in politics characterize as both unsubstantiated and a self-fulfilling prophecy.
“In an era of Trump, we’re particularly vulnerable to that sort of narrative,” says Christina Reynolds, vice president of communications at Emily’s List, a political action committee that works to elect pro-choice Democratic women to office. Ms. Reynolds points out that the Democrats have already made history by having not one but two women who are considered viable at this point in the cycle. “I think what’s particularly impressive about what Senator Klobuchar and Senator Warren have done is they have pushed past that. They are still in there fighting.”
At the same time, many women voters, particularly younger ones, say gender simply isn’t a primary factor in their decision. While they’re glad to have women in the running, they say they’re less motivated by symbolism or identity than by the candidates’ platforms – which, they say, is actually a sign of progress.
“It seems normal that a woman is running for president,” says Maggie Smith, a performing arts student at Iowa State University, who’s waiting to hear Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders speak in Ames with her friend and fellow student Joselyn Carrillo. They both like Ms. Warren, and Ms. Carrillo, an environmental studies student, muses about how empowering it would be to have a female president. But both plan to support Mr. Sanders when they caucus for the first time next week.
“Maybe that’s improvement, you know? That it’s coming down to the issues,” says Ms. Smith. 
How much of a hurdle? Going into the 2020 presidential cycle, a female Democratic nominee seemed like a strong if not likely possibility. Women’s political activism had skyrocketed, with millions of women pouring into the streets in 2017 for the Women’s March, estimated to be the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history. The 2018 midterm elections saw a record number of Democratic women entering the U.S. House of Representatives, and the 2020 Democratic presidential field featured a record number of female candidates. 
Since then, however, the road to the White House for women has seemed increasingly paved with obstacles. Two promising female candidates – California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand – were forced to drop out before the voting even began, after failing to gain traction.
Electability has long been a concern surrounding women, says Ms. Reynolds, even though statistically female politicians win their races at the same rate as men. And for many voters, those concerns seemed to grow in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 loss.
Despite the fact that Mrs. Clinton actually won the popular vote, and despite the fact that the Democratic Party’s sample size of previous female presidential nominees is exactly one, many Democratic voters say they’re worried that gender could be the difference between winning and losing.
“When Hillary lost so abruptly, it knocked the wind out of everybody,” says Jenni Yenger, a retired school secretary, at a rally for former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in Fort Dodge. “I think Democrats would pull more for a woman [in 2020] if things weren’t so dire. I want to see a woman president, but not at the expense of losing to Trump.” 
Although she likes Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Yenger has concluded she’ll probably caucus for former Vice President Joe Biden because she “feels safer” with his chances of beating Mr. Trump. 
“If I could vote with my heart, I’d vote for Amy [Klobuchar] or Yang,” echoes Lisa Etzel, waiting in line in below-freezing temperatures to see Mr. Sanders in Ames, Iowa. “But I’m caucusing for Biden. I’m voting for who can beat Trump.”  
Both Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar have, at various times, tried to tackle the electability issue head-on – attempting to turn it into an advantage. Ms. Klobuchar talks repeatedly about how, in her last election, she won 42 counties that had voted for President Trump.
At a house party in Johnston, Iowa, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig says she was able to defeat a male incumbent in 2018 in part because Ms. Klobuchar was running at the top of the ticket. “If you can win in my district, you can win the Electoral College,” Representative Craig told a living room full of a dozen or so Iowa Democrats. “It’s really good to have Amy Klobuchar on the ticket in my kind of district.”
Similarly, at the last Democratic debate in Des Moines, Ms. Warren pointedly noted that “the only people on this stage who have won every single election that they’ve been in are women: Amy and me.”
“Can we just address it right here? Women win,” said Ms. Warren to a cheering crowd of voters in a middle school gym Sunday morning in Davenport. “We know that women candidates have been outperforming male candidates since Donald Trump got elected.” 
‘She stands on her record’ Yet Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren have had to walk a fine line when it comes to making gender a part of their campaigns. Many voters don’t like it when female candidates “play the woman card,” notes Kelly Winfrey, a professor at Iowa State University and research coordinator at its Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics.
At a “hot dish” house party in Newton, Iowa, on Friday, Ms. Klobuchar’s daughter Abigail Bessler tells the Monitor that when her mother first ran for Senate, “she didn’t say, ‘Vote for me because I’m a woman.’” Ms. Bessler was campaigning on her mother’s behalf while the senator was stuck in Washington for President Trump’s impeachment trial. 
“She stands on her record,” says Ms. Bessler, “and that’s what she’s doing now.”
At other times, Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren have highlighted what they see as a double standard for female candidates. Ms. Warren made headlines recently when she claimed that Mr. Sanders had told her he believed that a woman could not win the White House.
Ms. Klobuchar spoke candidly in December about voters being far more willing to give male candidates a pass when it comes to experience, in a pointed dig at Mr. Buttigieg.
“They haven’t been afraid to call it out, and I think that bluntness has been good,” says Professor Winfrey. 
Still, for some Democratic voters, the idea of a woman president is a strong motivating factor. Mabe Wassell drove across the river from Illinois to see Ms. Warren speak in Davenport.
“I worry about anyone going against Trump, but [Warren] has the gravitas to do it,” she says.
Sitting beneath a plaque honoring Phebe Sudlow, who became the first female superintendent of a public school in the United States, Ms. Wassell recalls taking a bus full of her nieces and grandnieces to Washington for the Women’s March.
“I’m rock solid for Elizabeth because I want to see a woman president in my lifetime,” says Ms. Wassell. “That’s okay if that’s not a priority for anyone else. It is for me.”

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump’s defense team continued to attack the Democrats’ case for impeachment Monday, the key question turned to whether revelations in a forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton would convince enough Republicans to agree to call witnesses in the trial, a move that could prolong the proceedings into next week or beyond.
Republicans began the second of their allotted three days of arguments Monday in the hopes of ending the historic trial by Friday and avoid having it overlap with Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. Ending the trial early would also allow four Democratic senators who are running for president to return to Iowa in time for Monday’s caucuses.
But details of Bolton’s book, first reported Sunday by The New York Times, threatened to derail those plans and put Republicans on the defensive. In the book, Bolton reportedly says Trump personally told him that he hoped to continue to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine until the country announced investigations into political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
More: Senate impeachment trial: Fact-checking opening arguments of Trump's defense team
The House impeachment managers and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said Bolton's reported claims directly contradict key elements of Trump's defense and that a fair trial requires his testimony.
Trump denied Bolton's account in a tweet Monday and later in front of reporters at the White House. He and his defense team have argued that he withheld aid to get Ukraine to address its longstanding corruption issues and that it was unrelated to his desire for Ukraine’s president to announce an investigation into Biden.
“There was no linkage between investigations and security assistance or meeting on the July 25 call, the Ukrainians said there was no quid-pro-quo,” Mike Purpura, a deputy counsel to the president who is defending him in the trial, argued before the Senate. He did not mention Bolton, nor did any of his counterparts during the first several hours of the defense team's presentation.
“The House managers’ record reflects that anyone who spoke with the president said that the President made clear that there was no linkage” with aid and investigations, Purpura argued.
More: Trump impeachment audiences range from one president to millions of voters
Bolton was not a part of the House impeachment inquiry. Democrats from both the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees considered subpoenaing him but decided against it for fear that it would spark a lengthy court fight that would keep the impeachment from moving forward. Bolton followed a presidential directive not to testify voluntarily.
While Purpura and his colleagues argued their case Monday, at least two GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, said they may be open to calling witnesses in the trial so that they can hear from Bolton. At least two more Republicans would need to agree in order to reach the 51 votes necessary to include testimony from witnesses in the trial.
“I think it’s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton," Romney told MSNBC.
A potential swing vote, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said she was “curious about what Ambassador Bolton has to say. ” (Bolton served as ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration. )
Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said he believed several more Republicans would join Collins and Romney.
But Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the chamber’s newest member who took the seat in January despite concerns among some Republicans that she’s not conservative enough, attacked Romney for suggesting additional witnesses should be called.
In a tweet, Loeffler accused Romney of working to "appease the left by calling witnesses who will slander the @realdonaldtrump. "
Democrats had failed to make their case, Loeffler argued, so "The circus is over. It's time to move on. "
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. , said the Bolton revelations were reminiscent of the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
"It happened with Kavanaugh with so-called bombshells," said Barrasso, noting it was important to first "hear the case, let's hear the questions, then we'll make a decision. "
When pressed on whether the Bolton revelations were new, Barrasso questioned whether the timing was "an effort to generate interest in a book,” a charge Bolton and his publisher dismissed as "unfounded speculation. "
Meanwhile, on Monday, Ken Starr, a private lawyer representing Trump in the Senate trial, urged senators to step back from an “age of impeachment” with three presidential inquiries in 50 years by rejecting the partisan investigation.
Starr, who investigated former President Bill Clinton, which led to his impeachment but not his removal from office, said impeachment is traditionally built upon the accusations of crimes. Starr said the two impeached presidents, Clinton 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, along with the inquiry against Richard Nixon in 1974, all alleged crimes.
“Like war, impeachment is hell, or at least presidential impeachment is hell," Starr said. "Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment, including members of this body, full well understand that a president impeachment is tantamount to domestic war. "
House Democrats have argued that bribery and extortion are implied in the articles of impeachment accusing Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine aid, but Starr argued that articles against Trump don’t allege specific crimes.
Starr also voiced concern that impeachment had become too frequent a political weapon against the president of an opposing party.
“Instead of a once-in-a-century phenomenon, which it had been, presidential impeachment has become a weapon to be wielded against one’s political opponent,” Starr said.
Some conservative defenders of Trump criticized Starr’s presentation as too dry.
“This defense needs a little less Atticus Finch and a little more Miss Universe,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. , referring to the lawyer in the classic novel “To Kill a Mockingbird. ”
The day began with the Senate chaplain, retired Rear Adm. Barry Black, mentioning his gratefulness for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts’ birthday.
“Thank you for giving our chief justice another birthday,” Black said, as Roberts smiled.

Texto completo: Sen. Tim Kaine was so taken aback when President Donald Trump's defense attorney Robert Ray criticized a New York Times series about the history of slavery during his presentation in the Senate impeachment trial that he later confronted Ray about the remarks.
"To me, it seemed like an ad hominem attack on people trying to get at the roots of the effects of slavery in the United States," the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee told USA TODAY. "And it did not bear at all on the impeachment or anything else. "
Ray made the remarks during his argument that the articles of impeachment passed in the House against Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress were illegitimate because they were not based on a violation of thelaw.
He criticized a passage from the House Judiciary Committee’s impeachment inquiry report, which argued the 1868 impeachment of President Andrew Johnson was not motivated by his violation of the Tenure of Office Act, "but on his illegitimate use of power to undermine Reconstruction and subordinate Africa-Americans following the Civil War. "
Ray said the argument was an "ahistorical sleight of hand worthy only of The New York Times recent 1619 series," referring to an interactive project on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first African slaves in what would become the United States.
Who's who on Trump's legal team: Patrick Cipollone, Jay Sekulow, Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, Pam Bondi
In December, The New Times Magazine published a letter from five historians who said the project contained factual errors. Two of those professors, James McPherson and Sean Wilentz, are from Princeton. In response, the magazine's editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein wrote, "we disagree with their claim that our project contains significant factual errors and is driven by ideology rather than historical understanding. "
Ray's comments about the slavery project caused Kaine to throw his hands up in the air in a giant shrug before leaning back in his chair and shaking his head as he looked up at the ceiling.

The Backstory: Confronting the heartbreaking history of 1619
Kaine said that as a Democratic senator from Virginia, where that first landing occurred in 1619, and the co-sponsor of a bill commemorating the anniversary, he found it both "puzzling" and "offensive. "
"I actually went over to Robert Ray after and I said, 'Hey, I didn't get that. Why were you doing that?'" Kaine said.
Ray responded that the project was "too politically correct," according to Kaine.
"What does that have to do with the articles of impeachment?" he asked. "I was stunned by it. "

Texto completo: LANSING, Mich. – An Iranian student traveling to East Lansing, Michigan, to start his first week at Michigan State University was forced by federal agents to return to his home country.
Alireza Yazdani Esfidajani, 27, was detained by U. S. Customs and Border Protection agents at Detroit Metro Airport on Sunday afternoon. He was placed on a flight back to Tehran on Monday afternoon.
Esfidajani was accepted as a Michigan State graduate student and scheduled to start this week, university spokesperson Emily Guerrant said. He was to officially enroll when he arrived on campus.
He has a valid student visa and planned to pursue a Ph. D. at Michigan State, his attorney Ghazal Nicole Mehrani said. Sunday was his first time in the USA. He spent it in CBP custody, partially at Monroe County's jail, where he was held from about 1 a. m. to noon Monday.
A visa does not guarantee entry to the USA, according to an emailed statement from a CBP spokesperson.
"On January 26, Alireza Yazdani Esfidajani applied for entry into the United States, and was later deemed inadmissible, at which time he withdrew his application for admission into the United States," the statement says. "The traveler was not arrested, rather held until a return flight could be arranged to his place of departure. "

The statement did not identify a reason agents denied Yazdani admission into the USA.
Esfidajani told Mehrani and attorney Bradley Maze that federal agents pressured him to sign a form withdrawing his application. Customs agents "pushed him, and they asked questions and questions," then recommended he sign the form, Mehrani said.
"If he has signed a withdrawal of application, there's pretty much no legal remedies," she said.

Professor: Student's removal part of trend toward restricted travel
The New York Times reported at least 16 Iranian students were detained by customs officials at American airports despite securing visas from the State Department allowing them to study in the USA.
Deporting or pressuring Iranian students to leave is part of a trend restricting travel from the Middle East country, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University.
He pointed to the travel ban in 2017 limiting travel from Muslim-majority countries and the increasing tensions between U. S. and Iranian forces after a U. S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in December.
"In the broader contexts, it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran," he said.
The State Department thoroughly screens applicants' backgrounds before it issues visas, a process that can take months, Yale-Loehr said.
“Obviously, there can be new facts that come to light between the time a person is issued a visa overseas and when they arrive in the United States that may justify [why] they may not be able to enter, but many times, it seems to be antagonism toward Iranians that prompts [customs] officials to go overboard to try to find excuses to prevent them from entering," he said.
MSU leaders welcome international students
The university worked with the student's attorneys and contacted federal officials about the situation. Guerrant issued a statement Monday describing the university's commitment to international students enrolled at MSU.
"We want international students to know we value and welcome them to our campus, and we are committed to global engagement, educating international students and collaborating with partners across the world in higher education efforts," she said. "MSU's international students make tremendous contributions to fueling discoveries and scholarship. Global leadership can only be maintained if talented people from across the globe are encouraged to come here to study and work. "
The MSU Graduate Employees Union spread the word about Esfidajani's case and asked federal officials to intervene, Chief Information Officer Darren Incorvaia said.
"We see it as our job to stand up for graduate students at Michigan State specifically but also across the country,” he said. “Whether it’s something that directly is involved with their employment or not, we’re still going to stand up and voice our concerns when things like this happen, especially when, in this case, it directly affects our community. "
BBC reporter Bahman Kalbasi reported the student's detention on Twitter on Sunday night.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – John Bolton, a former Fox News commentator, had senior roles in three Republican administrations before beginning his tumultuous tenure as President Donald Trump's national security adviser.
Now, Bolton has a new title: Conservative target.
Since The New York Times reported that Bolton's soon-to-be-published book alleges Trump demanded Ukraine investigate Democrats in exchange for foreign aid, the reaction from the president and his allies has been fierce. They denounced Bolton as an opportunist, looking to cash in through a book airing unflattering details amid the Senate impeachment trial.
"I've repeatedly called him 'Book Deal Bolton,' " said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign official and conservative podcast co-host.
People "feel betrayed by John Bolton," Miller said.
Trump slammed Bolton's book on Twitter Wednesday, calling it "nasty & untrue" and said that if he had listened to his former aide's national security advice, "we would be in World War Six by now. "
Kelly backs Bolton: Former Trump chief of staff backs Bolton in Ukraine dispute
Some of Bolton’s associates downplayed the GOP rift over his forthcoming book, "The Room Where It Happened. " Several predicted that even if Bolton were to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, he would try to limit the damage to his former boss.
But others who know the outspoken national security hawk insist that he is comfortable with controversy and will stand his ground. Bolton, they said, may be more concerned about his legacy than remaining loyal to Trump.
"I know John Bolton to be a man of integrity, true to his word and possessing an extraordinary memory," said Thomas Boyd, a friend and former Bolton deputy who said he could not speak to the accuracy of the Times' report on Bolton's book. "But I will say that John would never make something up on a matter of such importance. "
'He's used to this'
Bolton's memoir alleges Trump told him he wanted to freeze nearly $400 million in Ukraine aid until officials in Kyiv opened an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Times. The revelation undermines a central Trump defense – that the money was withheld over concerns about corruption in Ukraine, rather than to pressure Kyiv to investigate the president's political rival.
The disclosure about the book has added to calls for witnesses at the impeachment trial and put new pressure on Republican senators.
While the White House and Trump's allies sought to marginalize Bolton, people who know the veteran of Washington knife fights likely expected the blowback.
Fred Fleitz, who worked for Bolton, called on his former boss to pull the book – at least until after the November presidential election.
In an interview with USA TODAY, Fleitz described Bolton as a man of principle who will stand up for what he believes.
"I think he's used to this," he said.
Book slammed as 'rancid, corrupt'
Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs, a Trump ally, described Bolton's book as "a rancid, corrupt, absolutely disgusting move. " Tucker Carlson, a Fox News host, called the manuscript a "betrayal. " When Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said he would be open to calling Bolton as a witness in the impeachment trial, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga. , claimed in a tweet that her colleague wants "to appease the left. "
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , a member of the president’s impeachment defense team, said the leak was a gift to Democrats.
“Some have suggested that it was to sell more books. Some have suggested that indeed the leak was designed to create chaos,” he said. “What we do know is that this is a pattern that my Democrat colleagues have embarked on when it was over in the House, and they continue to leak out things, trying to change it and change the narrative. ”
Bolton's long-standing ties with conservatives have muddied the response and left some Republicans uncertain how to proceed. Democrats said Bolton's book should compel the Senate to hear from Bolton as a witness. Some Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , indicated they may be open to that idea.
Evidence or not: Trump lawyer says Bolton manuscript 'inadmissable'
Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and another Trump ally, considers Bolton a friend. Bolton served on the group's board for years, Schlapp said, and was a regular speaker at its high-profile annual conference.
Schlapp questioned the accuracy of the leak and said he will withhold judgment until he can read Bolton's book himself. The memoir is scheduled to publish in March.
"I think John is wise enough to realize that doing anything in a political sense to help elect Bernie Sanders would be very regrettable," Schlapp said. "I don't believe that's his intention. When we hear from John Bolton, I believe he will reiterate his support for this president. "
Senate reaction mixed
Most Senate Republicans have tread cautiously around the Bolton report, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , acknowledged blindsided lawmakers.
Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla. , said he was “disappointed” by Bolton's book and his offer to testify but won't "say anything disparaging about it because he's a good friend for a long period of time. "
When reporters asked Sen. Pat Toomey what he thought of Bolton – who has given heavily to his campaign – the Pennsylvania Republican hurried past them without responding.
Bolton, 71, established himself as a savvy Washington operator and aligned himself with the party's foreign policy hawks long before Trump entered the political scene. Trump tapped him to be his third national security adviser in 2018 after Bolton became a regular fixture on Fox News, espousing a get-tough view on Iran that aligned closely with the president's promise to unwind the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Tehran.
But Trump and Bolton read from different playbooks on North Korea and Russia, in particular, on which the president adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessors. Trump campaigned on withdrawing the United States from “endless wars,” while Bolton had long embraced a more aggressive, interventionist foreign policy agenda.
Those differences spilled into public view in September, when Trump said he fired Bolton but Bolton said he left on his own.
'Not out for revenge'
Some Bolton associates disagreed with the White House's characterization of his motives.
“John Bolton is not out for revenge,” said Mark Groombridge, who worked with Bolton for years at the State Department and outside government. “Bolton’s primary motivation is to advance his vision of national security. ”
Groombridge predicted Bolton would limit his direct attacks on Trump.
“There’s no way his testimony or his book will cast the president in a favorable light,” Groombridge predicted. “I think he will portray him as undisciplined, impulsive, and he’ll chastise him for not listening to what Bolton considered sound advice. "
If he provided the Senate with testimony that led to Trump’s removal from office, “he would be a pariah forever,” Groombridge said. That is unlikely to happen because "Bolton still wants to be a player in the GOP," he said.
John Yoo, a former colleague who has written several papers with Bolton, agreed that Bolton isn't driven by revenge.
"You’ll see people in the media suggest he’s settling scores. That is not John’s motivation,” said Yoo, a law professor at the University of California-Berkeley School of Law.
He said Bolton “is a believer in making sure history has a record of all the things he saw. ”

Texto completo: SARASOTA, Fla. — President Donald Trump is denying that he told former National Security Adviser John Bolton he wanted to withhold military aid from Ukraine until the country launched investigations into Joe Biden and his son, allegations that Bolton levies in his new book, according to news reports.
But one of Trump’s former top aides told a Sarasota crowd Monday evening that if the reporting on what Bolton wrote is accurate, he believes Bolton.
“If John Bolton says that in the book I believe John Bolton,” said retired Gen. John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff for 18 months.
Kelly spoke Monday at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall as part of the Ringling College Library Association Town Hall lecture series. The general worked with Bolton during his time as chief of staff, which ended in early 2019. Kelly said Bolton is an honest person.
“Every single time I was with him . . . he always gave the president the unvarnished truth,” Kelly said of Bolton, who has become a figure of intense interest in the impeachment inquiry.

According to the New York Times, Bolton writes in a new book that Trump personally told him he did not want to release nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine until the country investigated Democrats, including the former vice president and his son.
The House impeached Trump last year, alleging the president abused his power by leveraging the military aid to try and benefit himself politically.
Trump denies ever tying to the aid to the investigations.
“I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,” Trump tweeted recently, adding: “If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. ”
Asked about the passages in Bolton’s book — which has yet to be released — that appear to reinforce the impeachment allegations, Kelly said Monday evening that “John’s an honest guy. He’s a man of integrity and great character, so we’ll see what happens. ”
There are growing calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, something GOP leaders have resisted. Kelly said he supports calling witnesses during the trial.

“I mean half of Americans think this process is purely political and shouldn’t be happening but since it is happening the majority of Americans would like to hear the whole story,” Kelly said.
“So I think if there are people that could contribute to this, either innocence or guilt . . . I think they should be heard,” Kelly said, adding: “I think some of the conversations seem to me to be very inappropriate but I wasn’t there. But there are people that were there that ought to be heard from. ”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department denied a claim he had expressed concerns about President Donald Trump's conduct with world leaders, details that were reported Monday in The New York Times.
The Times reported that former national security adviser John Bolton says in an unpublished book manuscript that he had a conversation with Barr in which Bolton expressed concerns Trump was granting "personal favors" to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Times report says Barr "was worried" Trump "created the appearance that he had undue influence" over investigations into companies based in those countries.
But a Justice Department spokeswoman said Bolton's characterization of Barr's remarks was inaccurate.
"While the Department of Justice has not reviewed Mr. Bolton’s manuscript, the New York Times’ account of this conversation grossly mischaracterizes what Attorney General Barr and Mr. Bolton discussed," the Justice Department's Kerri Kupec said in a statement early Tuesday.
The Times cited a draft of an unpublished manuscript of Bolton's book that had been given to the White House for review. The Times also said anonymous "people familiar with the manuscript" described what it said.
Bolton's book, according to The Times, says Barr raised concerns about Trump's conversations with Xi before lifting the tough penalties imposed on the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE for violating U. S. sanctions on Iran. The state-owned company had been banned from doing business with U. S. companies. But after a request from Xi, Trump reduced the penalty to a $1 billion fine in 2018.
Trump's decision to reduce that penalty sparked criticism from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and led to a bipartisan effort in the Senate to block the move. At the time, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N. Y. , said that by reducing the penalty, Trump was "helping make China great again. "
The Times report on Bolton's book said Barr also referred to a conversation Trump had with Erdogan about an investigation into the Turkish state-owned Halkbank. U. S. officials were investigating the bank on suspicion of money laundering and fraud in an alleged multibillion-dollar scheme to evade sanctions on Iran.
Erdogan personally lobbied Trump to intervene in the case, The Times and Bloomberg reported. According to Bloomberg, Trump told Erdogan in an April phone call that he would have Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin look into it.
Erdogan's lobbying proved unsuccessful, and in October federal prosecutors in New York issued a six-count indictment against Halkbank. That same month, the Trump administration imposed temporary sanctions on Turkey amid the uproar over Erdogan's attacks on Kurds across the Syrian border, which followed Trump's abrupt decision to pull U. S. troops out of the region.
"There was no discussion of 'personal favors' or 'undue influence' on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr state that the President’s conversations with foreign leaders (were) improper," Kupec said. "If this is truly what Mr. Bolton has written, then it seems he is attributing to Attorney General Barr his own current views – views with which Attorney General Barr does not agree. "

During his time in the Trump administration, Bolton – a fierce advocate for an aggressive U. S. foreign policy – often clashed with the president. Trump has sought to limit U. S. military intervention regarding Turkey, China, North Korea and Iran.
Since Bolton's acrimonious exit from the administration in September, he has become a key figure in Trump's impeachment on allegations he withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure that country into conducting investigations for personal political gain.
Bolton followed the White House directive for administration officials not to testify in the House impeachment inquiry. But in a statement explaining his decision not to voluntarily appear before the investigating committees, his lawyer Charles Cooper indicated Bolton had direct knowledge related to the allegations.
After the House impeached the president, Bolton changed his stance and said earlier this month that he was prepared to testify in the Senate trial if he were subpoenaed.
The Senate debate over whether to call Bolton and other witnesses to testify intensified this week after the Times reported Sunday that in his book manuscript, Bolton says that Trump told him in August the aid was tied to the investigations. That contradicts key elements of Trump's defense.
Bolton’s reported discussions with Barr, as outlined by the Times account, raises new questions about the attorney general and his knowledge about Trump’s alleged pressure campaign in Ukraine.
In Sunday's report, The Times said that after Trump’s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Bolton went to Barr to express concerns about Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the so-called shadow foreign policy the lawyer was pressing in Ukraine.
According to The Times, Bolton claims in his book he told Barr the president had mentioned Barr on the call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Justice Department denied that Barr learned of the call from Bolton, maintaining that the attorney general had been informed of the call in mid-August.
A summary of the Trump-Zelensky call showed Trump told Zelensky that Barr would follow up with him.
When a summary of the Trump-Zelensky call was released in September, the Justice Department said in a statement: "The president has not asked the attorney general to contact Ukraine – on this or any other matter. The attorney general has not communicated with Ukraine – on this or any other subject. Nor has the attorney general discussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudy Giuliani. "
On Monday, Trump sharply denied telling Bolton he was linking the aid to the investigations.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham implied during a Fox News interview that Bolton and his publisher told The Times about the book's contents in an orchestrated effort to boost sales.
In a statement, Bolton and his publishers insisted there was "absolutely no coordination with The New York Times or anyone else regarding the appearance of information about his book. "
Cooper said his client gave the White House a copy of the manuscript for security review on Dec. 30 and said The Times report showed the "review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript. "
National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said Monday that only NSC staff and no other White House personnel had seen the manuscript.
"The Times does not discuss its sources, but I should point out that no one has questioned the accuracy of our report," said Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times.

Texto completo: Americans and the men and women who represent them in the U.S. Senate need to hear sworn testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton.
The Republican effort to block witness testimony and critical evidence from being presented in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is indefensible, even more so now that the nation has learned that the manuscript of an upcoming book written by Bolton and leaked to the New York Times directly contradicts the narrative presented by the president's defenders.
The manuscript was sent to the White House for a standard national-security review on Dec. 30. Since then, the White House has been aware of its explosive contents, including that Trump told Bolton the freeze on $391 million in security assistance for a U.S. ally defending itself against Russian aggression would remain in place unless or until Ukrainian officials launched a public investigation into a domestic political rival.
Bolton also alleges that other key administration figures were dishonest in their dealings. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Bolton wrote, privately admitted that then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was not corrupt, contradicting Trump's personal attorney; that Attorney General William Barr knew about the president's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier than he has indicated; and that acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was present for one of Trump's phone calls about Yovanovitch with the president's personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, despite Mulvaney's claims otherwise.
Trump has disputed Bolton's claims in a series of (what else?) tweets, some of which contain falsehoods, including that the House had not sought to interview Bolton. It did, Bolton said no, and the House -- fearing a long legal fight -- did not subpoena him. Trump also tweeted that "if John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book," a pathetic defense that some senators seemed to coalesce around on Monday as they reeled from the revelations.
Let's remember that the Senate, as is its constitutional duty, is conducting a trial. What kind of jurors, in any venue, wouldn't want, indeed demand, relevant testimony and evidence in order to fairly adjudicate a case? In the Trump trial, those senators committed to protecting and defending the president at all costs aren't interested in the truth.
The Bolton book is just the latest example. The Senate should also be reviewing the recently released recording from Giuliani associate Lev Parnas (whom Trump falsely claimed he did not know) that shows the president saying of Yovanovitch, "Get rid of her."
The title of Bolton's book, "The Room Where it Happened," is also the name of a song in the musical "Hamilton" that references insider access affecting political decisions.
Bolton was in the room where it happened. Senators, and the country, should hear from him, under oath. Only the truth will honor and uphold the constitutional principles that Alexander Hamilton and his fellow Founding Fathers gifted to the nation.

CNN and Ignorance; Laughs all around as they miss the Ukraine story.

Texto completo: CNN is arousing the ire of conservatives for a segment in which a network host and two political pundits giggle as they make fun of the alleged ignorance of Donald Trump and his voters. The odd exchange obscures how little the CNN guys know about the story they're supposed to be covering.
According to a CNN transcript , the network's Don Lemon opened a recent program by talking about the "great oratory" of House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D.Calif.).
Then Mr. Lemon criticized Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for his handling of a dispute with National Public Radio's Mary Louse Kelly about Ukraine. According to Mr. Lemon, the NPR reporter "pressed Pompeo over whether he owed former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology."
Mr. Lemon then invited comment from two CNN regulars named Rick Wilson and Wajahat Ali. Much laughter ensued on the set as the CNN pundits took turns pretending to be Trump voters. Here's an excerpt from the transcript:
WILSON: [Mr. Pompeo] also knows deep in his heart that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter U and a picture of an actual physical crane next to it. He knows that this is, you know, an administration defined by ignorance of the world, and so that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience, you know, credulous boomer rube demo that back Donald Trump, that wants to think that Donald Trump's a smart one, and y'all -- y'all elitists are dumb.
ALI: You elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling even though --
WILSON: Your math, your reading.
ALI: Yes, your reading, you know. Your geography knowing other countries. Sipping your latte.
WILSON: All those lines on the map.
ALI: Only them elitists know where Ukraine is. Sorry. I apologize.
LEMON: Oh my God.
ALI: But you know what -- it was Rick's fault. I blame Rick.
LEMON: Oh my God.
ALI: But in all honesty --
WILSON: Blame Rick, why not.
ALI: -- you know what NPR should do.
LEMON: Sorry, hold on. Wait, wait. Give me a second. Hold on. Hold on. That was good. Sorry. Rick, that was a good one. I needed that. OK, so listen let's go back to business here.
The discussion surely must have been insulting to non-leftist viewers who clicked on CNN or—more likely—were simply stuck in the terminal awaiting a boarding announcement. But ironically the program also exposed a gap in CNN's coverage.
This column will go out on a limb and say that even regular CNN viewers don't look to any of the three segment participants for deep knowledge of Ukraine. A quick review of recent history demonstrates why it would be preposterous for the former ambassador to expect an apology.
And the three gents who were so successful in amusing themselves aren't the only people at CNN who've been missing the story. The network has largely accepted the narrative from Rep. Schiff casting the former Ambassador Yovanovitch as the heroic defender of Ukraine as it faces the Russian bear. The record suggests the President should consider apologizing to Ukraine for waiting so long to fire her.
The credulous CNN reported in November:
Marie Yovanovitch, the former US envoy to Ukraine, offered a powerful and impassioned defense of the work the US foreign service in the face of attacks from the President of the United States and his allies and minimal public defense from the secretary of state.
Contrasting the "perception that diplomats lead a comfortable life throwing dinner parties in fancy homes," Yovanovitch described her own tenure in the foreign service: moving 13 times, serving in five hardship posts, getting caught in crossfire in Russia.
She also offered a cutting criticism of the State Department's failure to defend her against smears, including from President Trump.
When Ms. Yovanovitch was nominated to serve as ambassador toward the end of the Obama administration, the Ukrainians were looking for help to defend themselves against—not smears—but the Russian military which had occupied large parts of their country in 2014, killed thousands of their people and was abusing countless others. Ukraine needed weapons.
According to a New York Times report last year from Glenn Thrush and Kenneth Vogel, the Ukrainians' need for weapons to defend themselves was well known for years, even at the highest levels of the U.S. government:
When Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2014, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pressed President Barack Obama to take decisive action, and fast, to make Moscow "pay in blood and money" for its aggression. The president, a Biden aide recalled, was having none of it.
Mr. Biden worked Mr. Obama during their weekly private lunches, imploring him to increase lethal aid, backing a push to ship FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kiev. The president flatly rejected the idea and dispatched him to the region as an emissary, cautioning him "about not overpromising to the Ukrainian government," Mr. Biden would later write in a memoir.
Appearing before the Senate in 2016, Ms. Yovanovitch perfectly toed the Obama line, so much so that senators from both parties wondered aloud if the U.S. was being too tough on a country under constant pressure from its aggressive Russian neighbor.
Even while acknowledging that the Russians were not honoring cease-fire agreements and that "We are, in fact, seeing a spike in military activity in the region," Ms. Yovanovitch never mentioned the critical need for weapons. Instead, she simply pronounced that the Russian violence was "a great concern."
While ignoring the military hardware necessary for Ukraine's defense, Ms. Yovanovitch then went through a list of policy reforms the U.S. was demanding of the embattled country.
Sen. Christopher Murphy (D., Conn.) said, "I worry sometimes that we are asking the Ukrainians to make economic reforms in the middle of an invasion that are simply unrealistic given the very fact that the Russians are occupying territory and attacking along the front lines in order to create an economic crisis that Ukraine can't dig itself out from under... I sometimes think that it is patently ridiculous that we are asking them to do something that is impossible in the face of invasion."
One can only imagine how worried the Ukrainians must have been—and not just sometimes.
Fortunately for them, a few months later the U.S. elected a new President who provided the critical weapons Mr. Obama never would.

Texto completo: Ben Smith, the founding editor of BuzzFeed News, said on Tuesday he is leaving the company, where he helped turn a startup best known for whimsical online quizzes and listicles into a formidable news organization.
Mr. Smith, a veteran of Politico and the New York Daily News, was hired in 2012 to create a news division for BuzzFeed. He said in a memo to staff that he would be joining the New York Times as a media columnist.
"The notion that BuzzFeed could play a major role in shaping global news, and the news business—from tweets to streaming shows—sounded crazy in 2012. Now it's just a fact, the product most of all of your hard work, creativity, aggressiveness, and judgement," he wrote.
Mr. Smith, 43 years old, built a newsroom of more than 200 journalists with bureaus across the world. In 2018, BuzzFeed News' staff was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for international reporting for stories on numerous assassinations of enemies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the United Kingdom and United States.
BuzzFeed has sometimes found itself at the center of controversy, most notably for Mr. Smith's decision to publish an unsubstantiated dossier about President Donald Trump in relation to his alleged activities in Russia. Mr. Smith staunchly defended the decision, arguing that without the dossier, Americans would have found it difficult to understand the government probes that followed.
The BuzzFeed news division has faced the same pressures as all digital publishers in recent years, as making money via online advertising sales became more challenging. The news unit is a financial drag on BuzzFeed, with growth primarily coming from areas such as e-commerce, entertainment and video programming. Last year, BuzzFeed ended the year slightly in the red , but news was the only unprofitable division.
BuzzFeed's news unit suffered deep staffing cuts in 2019 that also affected other parts of the company.
Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed's founder and chief executive, called Mr. Smith "a leader, a mentor, and an inspiration to countless journalists."
"BuzzFeed News has grown from a digital news startup to a world-class, global news organization in less than a decade" Mr. Peretti wrote in a note to staff.
The company said it would begin a search to replace Mr. Smith.

Honolulu airport to start screening for coronavirus

Texto completo: The Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu will begin screening passengers from Wuhan, China, for the coronavirus, a quarantine staff member confirmed today.
Honolulu is one of 20 airports nationally with permanent quarantine stations. A staff member at the station said it is among the airports chosen to screen passengers. However, Honolulu airport does not have any direct flights from Wuhan, China, according to Tim Sakahara, director of communications for the state Department of Transportation.
Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news briefing today that passengers would be screened at 20 ports of entry, the New York Times reported.
The CDC recommended Monday that travelers avoid all nonessential travel to any part of China, and not only the outbreak’s epicenter, Wuhan.
Chinese officials have shut down transportation in and out of Wuhan and 17 other cities in Hubei province.

Texto completo: Don Lemon is setting the record straight on a CNN clip that angered President Donald Trump.
The clip shows Lemon and two guests weighing in on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and NPR host Mary Louise Kelly's Ukraine discussion. The anchor called Pompeo's suggestion that Kelly couldn't find the country on a map a "petty attempt to put her down. "
Author Rick Wilson concurred: "He also knows, deep in his heart, that Donald Trump couldn't find Ukraine on a map if you had the letter 'U' and a picture of an actual, physical crane," he said. "He knows that this is an administration defined by ignorance of the world. So that's partly him playing to their base and playing to their audience: the credulous boomer rube demo. "
Wilson and fellow guest Wajahat Ali, a New York Times and CNN contributor, traded quips in Southern accents, pretending to be Trump supporters slamming "you elitists with your geography and your maps and your spelling," Ali joked.
"Your math and your readin'," Wilson added. Lemon laughed and wiped tears from his eyes.
"Sorry, hold on, wait," the host interjected through chuckles. "Give me a second, hold on. That was good, sorry. That was a good one. I needed that. "
Trump responded Tuesday to the clip, dubbing Lemon "the dumbest man on television (with terrible ratings!). "
His daughter Ivanka chimed in, slamming the "arrogance, mocking accents and smug ridicule of this nation’s ‘Real Elites. ’ "
"You consistently make fun of half the country and then complain that it is divided," she said.
At the start of Tuesday's episode of "CNN Tonight With Don Lemon," the TV anchor clarified that he wasn't mocking Trump's conservative supporters, merely laughing at a joke.
"During an interview on Saturday night, one of my guests said something that made me laugh" he said. "And while in the moment I found that joke humorous, I didn’t catch everything that was said. Just to make this perfectly clear, I was laughing at the joke and not at any group of people. "
Lemon added that he doesn't "believe in belittling people, belittling anyone … for who they are, what they believe or where they’re from" despite political differences.
"It's personally important for me to address this," Lemon said.

Lemon wasn't the only one who caught flak for the clip.
Ali, who was featured in the video, tweeted Tuesday that his friends were "concerned about my safety" after the president shared the clip.
"I refuse to be intimidated and bullied by bad faith actors who cry fake victimhood, whining about a harmless, silly 30 second clip while endorsing Trump, a cruel vulgarian who debases everyone," he wrote.
Wilson didn't mince words either: He slammed the "fake outrage" surrounding the clip, claiming "the MAGA world wants the freedom to attack, insult, demean, and abuse anyone who doesn't aggressively worship Donald Trump. "
"They can't stand anyone who punches back, and hope they can intimidate or shame me," he said.
Previously: Trump slams Don Lemon as 'dumbest man on television' over debate question
This isn't the first time the president has referred to Lemon as "the dumbest man on television" or referred to his show's ratings to insult him.
In July, Trump criticized the TV host in a series of tweets after Lemon asked a question during a Democratic debate that described Trump as bigoted.
"What do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president's bigotry?" Lemon asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
"CNN’s Don Lemon, the dumbest man on television, insinuated last night while asking a debate 'question' that I was a racist, when in fact I am 'the least racist person in the world. ' Perhaps someone should explain to Don that he is supposed to be neutral, unbiased & fair,. . . . . " he tweeted.
In a follow-up tweet, Trump continued, ". . . . or is he too dumb (stupid} to understand that. No wonder CNN’s ratings (MSNBC’s also) have gone down the tubes – and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom. Don’t hold your breath!"
More: Don Lemon jests that the 'very, very intense' Chris Cuomo eats 'steroids and tequila'
In May, Trump mocked CNN's Chris Cuomo for "record low" ratings and labeled Lemon "the dumbest man on television. "
"Wow! CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN, record lows. People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies. Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon!" Trump tweeted.
And in August 2018, Trump called NBA star LeBron James and Lemon dumb after James criticized the president in an interview with Lemon on CNN.
“Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,” Trump tweeted. “He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!”

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Fotis Dulos, initially reported dead from an apparent suicide, may still be clinging to life at the UConn Health center.
Fotis Dulos, 52, was found unresponsive in the garage of his 4 Jefferson Crossing home in Farmington on Tuesday. It is believed he tried to poison himself with carbon monoxide, the New York Times reported.
Attorney Norm Pattis, who represents Fotis Dulos, said his client was found with a pulse but could not breathe on his own. Paramedics performed CPR at the scene, but he was later taken to the UConn medical center.
He is reportedly being kept alive on life support, according to sources.
“This is a shocking and truly sad day. My heart goes out to his children and his family. It’s just a horrible day,” Pattis said.
State police would not comment on Tuesday’s incident.
Fotis Dulos was expected to appear at state Superior Court in Stamford at noon Tuesday for an emergency bond hearing.

According to sources, the insurance company, Palmetto Surety Corporation, might not be able to support the high bond for murder, felony murder and first-degree kidnapping charges in the May 24 death and disappearance of Jennifer Dulos.
He was set to appear before Judge Gary White, who could have revoked his bond and sent back to jail until the insurance was sorted out, according to sources.
Last week, White ordered Fotis Dulos to be on strict home confinement after State’s Attorney Richard Colangelo said he removed items from a memorial for his estranged wife that was set up near his home.
White, who was filling in for Judge John Blawie, threatened to double the bond amount if Fotis Dulos violated the terms of his release again, pointing out he was previously warned about the battery running too low on the electronic device that is monitoring his movements.
This month, 469 pages of search warrants in the case were unsealed for the first time since the investigation began eight months ago.
The documents outline how police believe Fotis Dulos, 52, and his former girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, 45, and his close friend and former lawyer, Kent Mawhinney, 54, allegedly conspired to kill Jennifer Dulos and clean up the crime.
Fotis Dulos and Troconis were charged last year with two counts of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. On the same day Fotis Dulos was charged with murder this month, Troconis and Mawhinney were charged with conspiracy to commit murder.
Troconis has been released on house arrest on $1.5 million bond, while Mawhinney remains jailed in lieu of $2 million bond.
According to arrest warrants, Jennifer Dulos was last seen on a neighbor’s security camera at 8:05 a.m. May 24, returning to her Welles Lane home after dropping off her children at a nearby school.
Police believe Fotis Dulos was “lying in wait” and attacked her in the garage, the warrants indicate.
Fotis Dulos and Troconis were caught on video that night in Hartford dumping bags that were later determined to contain Jennifer Dulos’ blood and clothing, according to arrest warrants.
Jennifer Dulos’ blood was also found on the seat of a pickup truck belonging to an employee of Fotis Dulos, according to arrest warrants. Police say Fotis Dulos used the truck on the day his wife was killed, arrest warrants said.
The search warrants revealed that Fotis Dulos’ 2015 black Chevrolet Suburban was was spotted on a residential security camera parked on Thurton Drive, a dead-end street about 600 feet from the backyard of Jennifer Dulos’ home.
Police took 19 swabs from that vehicle, including ones from what appeared to be “bloodlike” stains, the warrants said.
Troconis and Mawhinney are each due in court on Feb. 20.
Attorney Andrew Bowman, who represents Troconis, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Lee Gold, who represents Mawhinney, also could not be reached.

Texto completo: Americans naturally want any war they fight to end with a win. This issue made headlines recently when The Washington Post, reporting on a new book on the Trump presidency, portrayed the president ranting about Afghanistan at a July 2017 meeting on U. S. global strategy. He reportedly told the assembled, “You don’t know how to win any more” and called senior military leaders “a bunch of dopes and babies. ”
This alleged version of the president’s leadership style is at odds with the measured, carefully calibrated speech he gave on Afghanistan a month later. The most important policy change he introduced was moving away from an emphasis on nation-building and towards what he called "principled realism. " "We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live, or how to govern their own complex society," he said. “We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists. ” The president also gave a “clear definition” of what victory entailed: “attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge. ” Building a western-style Afghanistan is not a realistic condition for victory, nor is it a proper objective for a war.
The beginning of this war was justified
The United States went to Afghanistan for the right reasons, to bring terrible retribution to the perpetrators of the September 11, 2001 attacks. George W. Bush’s response was well conceived and expertly executed. In weeks, Kabul and Kandahar had fallen, Osama bin Laden was on the run and a new Afghan government was being established.
The United States might have declared victory in early 2002. But the focus had shifted to fostering stability and security in Afghanistan, to the “nation-building” program President Trump rejects. The idea was to attack the root causes that allowed extremism to flourish. This involved supporting the growth of Afghan democracy and civil society, training and equipping Afghan armed forces, building infrastructure, promoting education, eradicating trade in illicit drugs and other such classic counterinsurgency efforts. Conditions improved to the point where in June 2005 then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi could say “the war in Afghanistan is over. ”
But fighting continued, and President Bush was never inclined to set a leave date for Afghanistan anyway. When Barack Obama took office, there were over 30,000 troops still in-country. Obama pushed troop levels up to 100,000 by the middle of 2010, seeking to recreate the success of the Bush administration’s “surge” counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq. Costs and casualties jumped as well. But Afghanistan was too different from Iraq to replicate the favorable results, and by the end of his second term, Obama had reduced U. S. troop levels by 90%, down to under 10,000. Numbers have increased by a few thousand at most under President Trump, but compared to 2010, most of the Afghan troop pullout has already happened. And while conditions on the ground are not significantly better, they are not markedly worse either.
Afghanistan peace process: 2020 presidential hopefuls owe Afghan women their support
So what keeps us in Afghanistan? Maybe it is inertia. The war does not often make headlines, and the public is barely aware of it. The conflict costs around $50 billion annually, a fraction over 1% of the 4. 4 trillion in total Federal outlays Military fatalities peaked at 710 in 2010 during the Obama surge, but since 2015, they have averaged less than 21 per year — which is still 21 too many.
What happens to Afghanistan once we're gone?
There is also the nagging question of what happens after we leave. No one wants to take the political hit of seeing the black-turbaned Taliban returning to rule in Kabul, especially after we claim we won. The 2011 troop pullout in Iraq is the relevant example, helping create conditions for the rise of ISIS and requiring U. S. troops to return to Iraq and also move into Syria .
Yet President Trump dealt with the ISIS crisis. He was criticized when he declared a win after leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed and his caliphate’s territory was overrun. New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, who praised the president’s strategy, said the achievement was soft-pedaled because “it does not fit into the narrative of Trumpian disaster in which our journalistic entities are all invested. ” But what else does victory look like?
A clear plan for Afghanistan: 5,000 troops for five years
Fear of a resurgent Taliban is not enough reason to keep thousands of U. S. combat troops in Afghanistan on an endless mission. The Trump administration could pull out all assets but a core group of special operators and intelligence teams, add the Taliban to the list of designated terrorist organizations and reserve the right to intervene again should a new danger emerge. Meanwhile, we could continue to give materiel and advisory support to the Afghan government, help broker peace and trade deals and monitor the situation for signs of critical danger. U. S. efforts would continue, but the war would be over, and compared to conditions in Afghanistan before our troops showed up in 2001, we could call it a win.

Susan Collins and Mitt Romney could get their way on Trump impeachment witnesses

Texto completo: Good morning from Augusta. We're continuing to collect responses from readers on the issues that matter to them in 2020 election coverage, so please take this survey if you haven't already.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: "Happy pigs are better pigs," said Joe Brown, an Orland farmer raising heritage pigs descended from pigs originally from the Swanville farm of Jerry Ireland, who now faces 13 charges of animal cruelty. "Low-stress pigs is kind of my goal." 
What we're watching today
A former Trump adviser's manuscript may have changed the Republican-led Senate's calculus on impeachment trial witnesses. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has said from the beginning of the trial that she will likely support witnesses after both sides have made their arguments, but it hasn't been fully clear which Republicans might join her aside from Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whom Politico reports is leading a push for witnesses in the Republican conference.
That might be changing after a New York Times story on Sunday night revealed details of former White House national security adviser John Bolton's book, where he reportedly wrote that President Donald Trump had asked to withhold military aid to Ukraine pending investigations into Democrats. 
Collins said Monday that the report "strengthens the case for witnesses." A few Republican senators who hadn't previously spoken publicly in favor of witnesses, such as Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, now seem more open, the Times reported, while others, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee remained noncommittal Monday.
Maine's junior senator, independent Angus King, was optimistic that enough senators would favor calling witnesses, saying in an interview with NPR on Monday afternoon that he expects five or 10 Republicans to cross the aisle to bring in Bolton. What happens after that and how long the trial could stretch on are unclear.
The Maine politics top 3
-- "Maine lawmakers push to clear waitlists for people with intellectual disabilities. The state sees another way." Caitlin Andrews, Bangor Daily News: "Clearing waitlists for adults with developmental disabilities seeking services in Maine could cost up to $80 million a year, but doing so within the current system is not the path the administration of Gov. Janet Mills wants to take amid a legislative push."
-- "In Maine, Mike Bloomberg says he'll back Democrat over Susan Collins despite past support," Jessica Piper, BDN: "Bloomberg, who first won election as New York's mayor as a Republican in the early 2000s and became a Democrat in 2018, was a supporter of Maine's Republican senator, giving her maximum donations during her 2008 and 2014 re-election races. After her 2018 vote for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Collins is one of Democrats' top targets in 2020."
-- "Regulators will finish their CMP investigation Thursday. Here are 9 things to know," Josh Keefe BDN: "Earlier this month, the commission staff issued a report with recommendations that the three commissioners will use to inform their Thursday decision. In the report, the staff determined that there is no 'systemic' issue with the system that is causing high bills. But despite this finding, the commission staff also recommended the commissioners force CMP to perform additional testing of SmartCare. It's a finding that has left some customers confused: If the system works, why would it need more testing?"
Democratic groups target Collins on the airwaves
-- Two Democratic organizations have bought TV ads across the state urging Collins to support witnesses in the impeachment trial. Majority Forward, a dark-money group with ties to Senate Democratic leaders, is spending more than $200,000 in Maine through the first few weeks of February, according to filings with the Federal Communications Commission. It's part of a five-state push, with the group also targeting senators facing re-election in 2020 in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina. A second liberal advocacy group, MoveOn, is spending at least a few thousand dollars to run an ad with similar messaging this week.
High court action
-- The chief justice of Maine's high court will address the Legislature on Tuesday ahead of a busy week of confirmation hearing. The speech from Chief Justice Leigh I. Saufley will precede hearings for two Superior Court nominees in the Legislature's Judiciary Committee -- District Court Judge Stephen Nelson of Houlton and Falmouth attorney Thomas McKeon. On Thursday, Mills' first two high-court nominees -- Superior Court Justice Andrew M. Horton and Kennebunk attorney Catherine Connors -- will get confirmation hearings Thursday.
The committee today will also preside over active retired justice confirmation hearings for two Maine judges: Roland Cole, who started Maine's first drug court, and Nancy Mills, who worked to improve how Maine court handle cases involving defendants with mental illness. Both retired in December after around 30 years of service. Here's your soundtrack.

Texto completo: The University of North Florida is opening its doors to one of the most influential women of the century who has left a profound legacy in politics and business on a national and global scale.

First female secretary of state. New-York Times bestselling author. Professor at Georgetown University. These are just a few successes that describe Madeleine Albright, who has led an impressive and extensive career within the U.S. government.

Albright has demonstrated a ceaseless motivation to change the world in her fight for democracy, the empowerment of women and other humanitarian efforts.

"Over the course of her illustrious career, Secretary Albright has addressed critical issues and played a crucial leadership role in shaping national decisions, both in the United Nations and as secretary of state," said Trina Medarev, executive director and CEO of the World Affairs Council of Jacksonville, which is co-hosting her upcoming lecture at UNF.

"She has been at the center of the marriage of force and diplomacy, particularly in bringing peace to the Balkans, standing up to dictators in Russia and around the world and bringing women to the table in forging peace," Medarev said.

On Feb. 5, Albright will reflect on her political experience and will discuss her new book, "Hell and Other Destinations." The event at the UNF Arena begins at 7 p.m.

Attendees are required to reserve free e-tickets on the Distinguished Voices Lecture Series website or by calling (904) 620-2117.

"A Conversation with Madeleine Albright" is part of the the Presidential Lecture Series supported by the UNF Foundation and the World Affairs Council's Global Issues Evenings. UNF President David Szymanski will join Albright on the stage as the host.

"She is not only one of

our country's finest diplomats, but also an inspirational voice for human rights, especially women's rights, around the world," Szymanski said.

Albright began her career as chief legislative assistant for U.S. Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, and from 1989 to 1992 she worked as the president for the Center for National Policy.

In 1993, she notably served in the United Nations as the U.S. permanent representative for four years while being a member of former President Bill Clinton's Cabinet.

In 1997, Albright made history by becoming the first female secretary of state and was dubbed the highest-ranking woman the U.S. government had ever seen.

In 2009 the secretary general of NATO, Fogh Rasmussen, asked Albright if she would chair a group of experts who were developing new strategic concepts for NATO.

To this day, Albright continues to acquire more accolades in her professional journey.

At Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, she works as a professor, specializing in diplomacy. She also is the chairwoman for several firms, including the Albright Stonebridge Group and Albright Capital Management LLC, that work in global strategy and emerging markets. On top of this, she is the president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation and has a seat in the National Democratic Institute.

She also has a membership on the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Policy Board and the Board of the Aspen Institute.

Albright's 2018 book, "Facism: A Warning," discusses the pressing matter of facism emerging across the world and the specific factors contributing to this trend. The book topped The New York Times bestseller list.

While Albright will not be having a book signing at the UNF event, she will be talking about "Hell and Other Destinations," scheduled to hit stores in April. This memoir captures the later part of her career when she left office as secretary of state and the projects she has been involved in over the last 20 years.

She also authored five other books on the New York Times bestselling list -- her autobiography, "Madam Secretary: A Memoir" (2003); "The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God and World Affairs" (2006); "Memo to the President: How We Can Restore America's Reputation and Leadership" (2008); "Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box" (2009); and "Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance and War, 1937-1948" (2012).

The UNF Presidential Lecture Series started 20 years ago in order to bring inspiring world leaders to the students and residents of the Jacksonville area.

The World Affairs Council of Jacksonville, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, has the mission of raising awareness of world affairs prevailing today along with providing public programs and other opportunities Northeast Florida residents.

Where does Kobe Bryant rank among the NBA's greatest players?

Texto completo: It's been more than 48 hours since we learned the tragic news about Kobe Bryant, his daughter, and the seven other souls on the doomed helicopter in Calabasas, Calif.
Hopefully it's not too early to take a stab at assessing Kobe's place in basketball history.
Kobe was not the greatest basketball player of all time. But he's in this observer's top 10, alongside Wilt Chamberlain, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Shaquille O'Neal, and Oscar Robertson.
Bryant was the best player of his generation, a perfectly sculpted bridge between Michael and LeBron. Today's young adults who grew up thinking Ken Griffey Jr. was better than Willie Mays — because they never saw Willie Mays — might tell you that Kobe was better than Michael or Magic. Maybe because they never saw Michael or Magic.
Related: Kobe Bryant didn't intend to coach basketball after retiring. His daughter changed his mind
Here in Boston, we saw Kobe come through town once a year for 20 years. We also had two Kobe clashes in the Finals, with the Celtics beating LA in six games in 2008 (Paul Pierce was Finals MVP) and Kobe getting his revenge in LA in a seventh game in 2010.
So where does Kobe fit?
These discussions are perfectly arbitrary talk radio/barroom arguments. They are part of the fun of being a sports fan. You say Joe DiMaggio, I say Ted Williams. A kid in high school in 2020 says Mike Trout.
Some of it is quantifiable. Kobe is the fourth-leading scorer in NBA history. He is second in All-Star appearances (18), won five championships, was MVP once, and averaged 25 points per game. He also was named to the All-Defensive team 12 times, second-most in league history.
Related: For Kobe Bryant, basketball wasn't just a vocation, it was an outlet for his genius
There is much about every player's game that cannot be measured. Kobe invented himself as the Black Mamba. We can't put a ranking on his sheer ruthlessness. He could put a dagger into your team like nobody else. He was the best NBA player when the sport truly became global, when professional basketball was uniquely popularized by social media.
In some circles, this made Kobe as big as Michael Jordan. And you can probably find folks who'd rank Kobe as the best basketball player of all time.
The magnitude of Kobe in star-driven Los Angeles is impossible for us to know, but his sudden death Sunday has shaken that community like nothing since the passing of Michael Jackson. Tuesday's New York Times correctly headlined Bryant “The Face of the NBA's Worldwide Popularity."
But what about Kobe's basketball skills? And his place in NBA lore?
Related: Recounting Kobe Bryant's most memorable Boston moments
I've been watching the NBA game since 1962 and am mindful that it's difficult to compare a point guard like Bob Cousy with a point guard like Kyrie Irving. The sport has dramatically changed.
Since the turn of the century, Jordan has been closest thing to a consensus No. 1 in the “best ever" argument.
Not with me. I've always been a Chamberlain guy.
I had a conversation about this with Bird when Bird was at the height of his (three-time) MVP powers in the mid 1980s. I asked Bird about “best ever."
“I can answer that," said Larry. “That's easy. Wilt Chamberlain averaged 50 points. Bill Russell won 11 championships. It's right there in the record books."
Those records remain. Wilt still holds 72 NBA records. He forced rule changes. He never came out of a game. He was 7 feet 1 inch with the muscular build of LeBron. He was never surrounded by Hall of Famers the way Russell was. Wilt didn't have the rings of Russell or Michael, but on sheer size, strength, and skill, Chamberlain remains the greatest basketball player who ever lived.
Look it up. Do the math. When you average 50 points over a full season, it means you have to get 70 in the game after you are “held" to 30 in order to maintain your average.
Give Kobe this: Scoring 81 points, which Bryant did in a win over the Raptors in 2006, came with a far greater degree of difficulty than Wilt's low-post, free-throw-filled 100-point game in Hershey, Pa., during the Kennedy Administration. Different game, for sure.
Related: Kobe Bryant was a generation's fiercest competitor. In retirement, he became so much more
In my book, LeBron is the second-best basketball player of all time, barely ahead of Jordan. LeBron is a 6-9 force who wins championships, MVPs, scoring titles, and this year will lead the league in assists. He is bigger and stronger than MJ. He's also a better rebounder and passer. He's already played 20 percent more games than Michael and he's still playing at an MVP level.
There is no “starting five" in my ranking, only a top five. This is positionless basketball. A disproportionate number of “best ever" players are centers. So after Wilt, LeBron, and Michael, I have to include Russell and Kareem in the pentagon of hoop prowess. Which gives us three centers in the top five.
Kobe makes it into my second five, alongside Magic, Bird, Shaq, and Robertson (who averaged a triple-double for a full season). Kobe makes this list at the difficult exclusion of Jerry West, Tim Duncan, Elgin Baylor, Hakeem Olajuwon, Bob Cousy, Julius Erving, Dirk Nowitzki, and several of the NBA greats currently playing.
Kobe scored 60 points in the last game of his career in 2016. That beats Williams hitting a home run in his final plate appearance in the big leagues.
While his sport grieves and his life is explored in a nonstop national narrative, Kobe Bryant's basketball skills need not be enlarged in death. He goes down in history as one of the 10 best players who ever lived.

Coronavirus, impeachment stoke Wall Street paranoia

Texto completo: DETROIT – So what's making the stock market – and maybe even your 401(k) – a bit sick?
Did stocks tumble Monday on news that the much-feared new coronavirus has already killed more than 80 people in China? Or were investors fearful of the possible unleashing of new damaging details in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump?
Take your pick. Wall Street could very well see wild swings in the days ahead regarding developments in both of these major news stories.
The reality is that we've had quite a run up in stock prices, as the Dow broke one record after another in recent weeks. The Dow reached a record 29,348. 10 points on Jan. 17. Any sudden turns or threats along the way here could drive some pullback in stock prices at the very least.
A worse-than-expected turn or shock would create more lasting damage.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 500 points in morning trading and closed at 28,535. 80 points on Monday, down 453. 93 points or 1. 57%.
Michigan has its eye on both of the big headlines.
Michigan is a battleground state for the Trump reelection bid in 2020. On Thursday, Trump will head to Dana Inc. , an auto parts supplier in Warren, to talk up the U. S. Mexico Canada Trade Agreement.
Taxes 2020: When to file and what changes to expect
Successor to Vine: Short-form video app Byte is here, and overrun with spam
This week, Trump's team is out to both downplay the ongoing impeachment trial and an exclusive New York Times report published Monday detailing a claim by former National Security Adviser John Bolton that Trump explicitly linked a freeze on $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine to an investigation of Democrats, including presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joe Biden.
According to The New York Times, an unpublished manuscript by Bolton "presents an outline of what Mr. Bolton might testify to if he is called as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial. "
Wall Street in general has favored many of the economic and tax policies initiated by the Trump administration. Business leaders and owners are far more skeptical and wary for the most part about political promises by Democratic hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders to undo Trump tax cuts among other changes.
Michigan's auto industry must keep its eye on the spread of coronavirus, too, given its interest and manufacturing operations in China.
David Whiston, equity strategist tracking U. S. Autos for Morningstar Research Services, said it's difficult to predict the exact impact of the coronavirus on the auto industry because no one knows how long the epidemic will last.
"Any automaker with meaningful China results will take a hit and GM is one of the biggest firms in the market," Whiston said.
"Ford is trying to turn around its China operations so this does not help either. "
Whiston noted that the spread of the virus has been happening during the Chinese New Year, when consumers may not be normally buying vehicles in large volume anyway.
"As long as this does not last many months, a sell-off in the stocks is a buying opportunity in my opinion," Whiston said.
Wall Street recognized the risks that GM has in China, and drove GM's stock price down Monday more than Ford.
General Motors stock closed Monday at $33. 41 a share, down 90 cents or 2. 62%
Ford stock closed Monday at $8. 89 a share, down 11 cents or 1. 22%.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles close at $13. 07 a share, down 28 cents or 2. 1%.
Many market watchers aren't expecting the U. S. economy to take a significant hit as a result of the impeachment hearings – since the GOP controls the Senate – or the coronavirus.
Robert Bilkie, CEO of Sigma Investment Counselors in Northville, said he would look for continued weakness in stock prices as the two situations unfold, but in general he views downturns in stock prices at this point as buying opportunities.
Again, though, much will depend on the potential twists ahead.
"Stock investors are nervous about the coronavirus because of the considerable uncertainty over how broadly across the globe it will spread, and how disruptive it will be to the fragile Chinese economy where the virus is already a problem," said Moody's economist Mark Zandi.
Stock prices have had a strong run-up since Trump called a truce in his trade war with China. The theory is that the Chinese economy would be less vulnerable and could rebound.
"The coronavirus threatens to undermine any revival in the Chinese and global economies," Zandi said.
Investors also may react negatively to such news as the coronavirus because stocks have been exceptionally strong of late.
"Stock prices reflect nothing but good news, and the coronavirus is bad news," Zandi said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz is now America’s top podcaster.
“VERDICT,” the daily podcast the Texas Republican records every night after the Senate impeachment trial lets out, was topping the iTunes charts on Monday, beating out wildly popular shows like “The Joe Rogan Experience” and The New York Times’ “The Daily.”
It’s been downloaded more than 500,000 times so far, according to Cruz’s office.
Cruz said it’s an effort to reach people directly.
“Most people don’t have time to turn on C-SPAN and watch 13 hours of impeachment proceedings,” he tweeted on Monday. “The idea of the #Verdict podcast is something easy, that someone can download and listen on the way to work in the morning.”
Cruz has used the platform to defend Trump, his one-time bitter political foe who the House impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
“I don’t think anyone’s mind was changed,” Cruz said on the podcast after the Democrats laid out their case to the Senate last week. “I think anyone who came in as a yes is still a yes and anyone who came in as a no is still a no. I think that’s true for the 100 senators, but I think that’s also true for the people at home.”

Texto completo: Frustrated with online ads?
For several dollars a month, a new service is offering the opportunity to remove ads from your news reading experience and still support the journalists who create the content.
Scroll – a start-up whose investors include USA TODAY owner Gannett, the New York Times and Samsung – debuted its ad-avoiding news service on Tuesday.
Co-founded by Tony Haile, the founding CEO of online metrics tracker Chartbeat, Scroll costs $4. 99 per month after an introductory rate of $2. 49 per month for the first six months. It works with more than 300 sites, and more are being added.
Media analyst Ken Doctor once called it "an iTunes for news. "
Initial participants include USA TODAY, BuzzFeed, Vox, The Atlantic, Business Insider, Slate and The Verge.
When a subscriber is logged into Scroll, they won't see ads of any kind when they visit participating websites on any browser on their phone, tablet or computer.
Scroll keeps 30% of the subscription fee and distributes the other 70% to the participating sites based on which articles users visit.
"Your money is only distributed to the sites you go to and love," Haile said. Scroll's model will provide news sites with substantially more revenue per view than they would otherwise receive from digital ads, he said.
The idea came from a desire to help identify a sustainable business model to support journalism while removing the digital clutter that can annoy readers.
"It’s a future where users don’t get pissed off and journalists don’t get laid off," Haile said. "That’s the dream. "
CEOs of new Gannett: 'Pivot' needed for digital transformation as merger is completed
Gannett invests: USA TODAY owner joins ad-free media platform Scroll as partner
The service, which has been beta testing for the last year, is aimed at providing content that keeps readers coming back instead of running away to avoid ads.
"The future of our industry is going to be based upon our relationship with our audience, how strongly we can build those bonds of affection," Haile said. To sign up for Scroll click here.
To be sure, the $4. 99 fee doesn't get you a subscription to sites with a paywall. But if that paywall allows a metered number of free clicks before payment is required to see more, you won't see any ads on those initial free stories. And if you do have a subscription to the news site, you'll have the extra benefit of no ads.
Asked whether Scroll would consider adding the capability for its users to subscribe directly to news services, Haile said he's had discussions with various sites about the possibility, but there are no plans to add that feature at this time.
For years, the journalism industry has been seeking solutions to replace the print revenue losses that have undermined its finances and led to substantial job cuts.
Other services are also launching services to reduce the effort required for readers to access paid news content.
On Monday, subscription commerce and tech provider Piano launched Piano Frictionless, which uses ApplePay to enable users to purchase limited access to news sources with a scan of their finger or face.
Michael Silberman, senior vice president of strategy for Piano, said the company hopes the service appeals to users who "are interested in a brand but not quite ready to commit to a full subscription. "
"While our clients can use it for subscriptions if they want, we're most excited about the idea that this can replicate the experience of buying a single issue of a magazine or newspaper on the newsstand -- buying 30 days of access for $3. 99, for example," Silberman said in an email.

Texto completo: A leaked draft of John Bolton's forthcoming book shook up President Trump's impeachment trial Monday and prompted even Republican senators to acknowledge the need for Ukraine scheme testimony from the former national security adviser.
Over the weekend, several reports revealed Bolton's yet-to-be-released tell-all, "The Room Where It Happened," contains an account of an August conversation in which Trump explicitly told the ex-national security honcho that he wanted to keep holding up $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine until the country helped him by announcing investigations of Joe Biden and other Democratic rivals.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared unfazed by the Bolton development and didn't comment one way or the other how he viewed it, other than saying through a spokesman that he didn't receive "advance notice" of the draft's existence.
McConnell (R-Ky.), who has so far been able to keep his GOP members in line, suggested at the outset of the trial that he doesn't want to call more witnesses in favor of quickly acquitting Trump of all charges.
Utah Sen. Mitt Romney - who's among a small group of moderate Republicans facing pressure from Democrats to vote in favor of subpoenaing testimony from Bolton - suggested the bombshell manuscript revelations may turn out to be the deciding factor.
"It's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton," Romney told reporters. "I have spoken with others who have opined upon this ... It's important to be able to hear from John Bolton for us to be able to make an impartial judgment."
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, another Republican in the vulnerable moderate camp, echoed Romney's sentiment.
"The reports about John Bolton's book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues," Collins said in a statement.
Ultimately, Senate Democrats need at least four Republicans to break ranks and vote with them in order to authorize subpoenas for Bolton and any other outstanding witnesses or records.
Such a vote is expected later this week, after Trump's legal team wraps up its defense and senators are given a chance to pose questions to both sides.
During Monday's trial session, Trump's attorneys didn't even want to get into the Bolton revelations.
"We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information," top Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said at the outset of the proceeding. "We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all."
Still, the explosive Bolton draft deeply undercuts Team Trump's claim that the president had legitimate policy reasons for holding up the aid, which Ukraine relies on to push back on Russian military aggression.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who's spearheading the quest for more witnesses, speculated fresh evidence will keep coming out even if Republicans refuse to subpoena it.
"This is getting to be a little bit, in this sense maybe, like Watergate. Almost every few days there's another revelation and another revelation and another revelation. And the case gets stronger and stronger," Schumer said.
Speaking at a noon photo opportunity at the White House with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump insisted that the Bolton account was incorrect and that "nothing was said to John."
"Totally false," the president said.
Trump blocked Bolton and several other top administration officials from complying with House requests for testimony as part of an all-out stonewalling campaign that prompted Democrats to draft the second article of impeachment on obstruction of Congress.
Earlier Monday, Trump falsely claimed the House had not tried to secure testimony from Bolton and that Democrats should not be given a second chance to hear him in the Senate.
"The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify," he tweeted incorrectly. "It is up to them, not up to the Senate."
It remains unclear how details of Bolton's book became public. His lawyer denies spilling the beans to The New York Times, which first broke the story.
Bolton submitted a draft of his book to the White House National Security Council for routine vetting after Christmas last year, his lawyer said. That could explain why Trump's defenders ramped up their opposition to any witnesses at the Senate trial around the same time.

McSally quiet on whether she wants Bolton to testify

Texto completo: Sen. Martha McSally has yet to say whether she wants to hear from additional witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
When asked last week, McSally, R-Ariz., berated a CNN reporter as a "liberal hack" and sidestepped answering the question, saying only that she wants to see a "fair" trial.
McSally is facing new pressure to answer the question after new revelations in a forthcoming book from Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, who has direct knowledge about Trump's efforts with Ukraine.
Bolton wrote that Trump wanted to continue to freeze security assistance to Ukraine until officials there launched investigations into 2020 Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son.
The manuscript of Bolton's book was submitted to the White House for review and leaked to The New York Times.
In their opening arguments on Saturday, Trump's defense team said Democrats omitted exculpatory evidence. They said Democrats were trying to reverse the 2016 presidential election and interfere with the 2020 election.
The team began its second day of arguments on Monday as Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah said Bolton's book manuscript strengthens the case for hearing from more witnesses. Four Republican senators would have to join with 47 Democrats to allow additional witnesses to testify.
Through a spokeswoman, McSally declined to say whether she wants to hear from Bolton.
In setting the rules for the trial last week, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., voted with Democrats to access additional witnesses and testimony, including from Bolton.
McSally voted against those efforts. She has said the rules don't "eliminate the possibility of witnesses or documents in the future, if needed."
Bolton, a luminary in Republican foreign policy circles for decades, has supported McSally's political career.
McSally detailed her admiration for Bolton in an April 2018 column published by the Washington Times, after Trump named Bolton his new national security adviser.
"John Bolton is also known for being frank and direct," McSally wrote. "I can relate to and appreciate these qualities. I would hope every adviser to the president on national security issues has these attributes."

Let's hear from McDonogh School graduate John Bolton on Ukraine aid and what Trump said

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Let%27s+hear+from+McDonogh+School+graduate+John+Bolton+on+Ukraine+aid+and+what+Trump+said&amp;author=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=A.12&amp;date=2020-01-28&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Baltimore+Sun&amp;issn=1943-9504&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Asoutheastnews_

Texto completo: Since its founding in 1873 as a "school farm" for disadvantaged city youth, the McDonogh School has made honesty and integrity a core part of its mission. That is as true today - as 13-year-old students are required to sign a pledge promising to "tell the truth in all situations, [and] present work that is truly their own" - as it was in 1966, when the graduating class included a Baltimore firefighter's son named John Robert Bolton.
Standing in contrast is Donald John Trump, the son of privilege who attended the New York Military Academy (Class of 1964), where he lost his rank of captain his senior year (an action classmates attributed to a hazing incident that Mr. Trump has denied). When it's time to decide who is telling the truth, do you go with the Yale Heights native who went on to become Mr. Trump's national security adviser or the serial liar who, according to The Washington Post's most recent tally, has made 16,241 false or misleading statements since taking office?
Is that a trick question? It really isn't. Yet the sad reality is that the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate may soon vote not to hear from Mr. Bolton, or anyone else, as they move forward with President Trump's impeachment trial. Given the weekend's revelation from The New York Times that Mr. Bolton's working book manuscript details how Mr. Trump asked him to continue freezing $391 million in aid to Ukraine until officials in that country agreed to investigate Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, that level of disinterest boggles the mind. Essentially, Mr. Bolton stands as a firsthand witness to the allegations at the center of the impeachment case. And he's ready to spill all - to his readers. How can the Senate possibly turn this opportunity down?
Indeed, how could any Republican loyal to President Trump not want to question Mr. Bolton? Shortly after midnight Monday, Mr. Trump was on Twitter denying he ever told Mr. Bolton that the aid was conditioned to those investigations. "If John Bolton said this," the president tweeted, "it was only to sell a book." He also retweeted criticisms from his usual Fox News allies questioning the timing of the Bolton scoop. But to that, one can only say: So what? So what if the Bolton manuscript was leaked by, gasp, a liberal? If it's not true, shouldn't Republicans relish the opportunity to put the former national security adviser under oath? Shouldn't the administration seek this chance for exoneration? Would it really be preferable to leave these allegations unexplored, unchallenged, uncontradicted?
Make no mistake, we don't endorse Mr. Bolton's politics, his disdain for the United Nations and other international organizations, his hawkishness, his abrasiveness, his contempt for diplomacy. But at least such views are consistent. His dark perspective on geopolitics appears little changed (although how he held his tongue during President Trump's North Korea outreach remains a mystery). But whatever his pattern of behavior from his days touting Barry Goldwater to his McDonogh classmates to his long-held antipathy toward Iran, it doesn't appear to involve blatant lies. Are Americans supposed to trust the word of a president who can't bring himself to be truthful about an Alabama hurricane forecast, the lack of a link between windmill noise and cancer or the place of his father's birth (It was New York, not Germany, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed)? And those are just some of the blandest of Mr. Trump's epic inventory of prevarications.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may want to wrap up his kangaroo court as expeditiously as possible. But refusing to hear the testimony of Mr. Bolton, as well as other firsthand witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, not only exposes the phoniness of these deliberations, it's contrary to his party's own interests, at least if they are serious about restoring credibility in time for the 2020 elections. Whether House Democrats should have subpoenaed Mr. Bolton during their impeachment proceedings - and thus found themselves locked in a court battle over executive privilege - is irrelevant. The nation is paying sufficient attention to understand that something fishy is going on right now.
If, as the Trump legal team claims, the Democrats have produced insufficient evidence, how can Senate Republicans not want to have chat with a McDonogh grad who was in a position to know for certain? Isn't that what any impartial judge would want?

Why Joe Biden is wrong about online free speech, even if it's ugly or manipulative

Texto completo: Facebook is an easy target. The company is criticized by the right for perceived liberal bias and the left for its role in disseminating political falsehoods. And in this election year, the heat is on.
But it wasn’t until this month that we learned former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the presidency, wants to put limits on Facebook and revoke a federal law that the Electronic Frontier Foundation describes as “the most important law protecting free speech online. ” That would be a very big deal.
Understanding what’s at stake may take a little reminiscing. If you were online in the early 1990s, it meant you had a subscription to a private service called CompuServe, Prodigy or America Online. AOL would excitedly advise you, “You’ve got mail. ” It was a time when that sounded like good news rather than a threat.
Our interaction online was pretty limited. Essentially, you could post your views on electronic bulletin boards. And if you insulted someone, it would take some time for that to register, thanks to our 2400-baud modems.
Soon came ever more accessible operating systems and browsers, and an unprecedented blossoming of online communication. We could all share our views in real time on sites hosted by media and technology companies, or on platforms created by a new generation of entrepreneurs.
Rare wisdom from Congress
The marketplace of ideas would grow exponentially online. It was the fulfillment of the ideals of the First Amendment and its promise of free speech for all. But there was a hitch to this exciting development.
If websites provided open access to those who wanted to share their views, what would happen if those posts were lies or libels? Aggrieved parties would sue the companies that allowed the post. The companies couldn’t possibly check every post for accuracy, so they’d be sued out of existence.
In its wisdom (occasionally it happens), Congress passed a law in 1996 to help ensure that this free flow of views would continue: the Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, specifying that sites on the internet would not be held liable for the defamatory posts of others.
First Amendment cop-out: No, Facebook doesn't have to run paid ads peddling the lies of politicians
Picture a country store in a small town where people drop by and talk on the front porch. There will be local gossip, buffoons and braggarts, but the store owner faces no consequences. He’s just providing his porch.
Those who defame others online can still be sued, but the conduits for those views are largely free of liability. Yes, some of that free speech online is ugly and manipulative, but thanks to Section 230, a wealth of speech remains fluid and free. For now.
Facebook has earned criticism
In a December interview published Jan. 17, Biden told The New York Times that Section 230 “should be revoked because (Facebook) is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they know to be false. ”
Facebook has earned a lot of the criticism coming its way. For all of its talk of lofty ideals, it has demonstrated time and again that it’s all about revenue. The company has even refused to review political advertising for falsehoods or bar microtargeting of Facebook users, based on the principle that “people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public. ”
Translation: “We’ll cash their checks and let them lie. You figure it out. ”
Misinformation highway: Massive Facebook influence on public opinion makes its ad policy a serious election threat
There’s certainly merit in revisiting Section 230. We’re a long way from dial-up modems. Even so, the notion that we should revoke a law that keeps the free exchange of ideas flowing all over the world is dangerous.
Yes, we need to fight the onslaught of foreign and domestic hackers and bots intended to mislead Americans, sow divisions and undermine our elections. But we can’t effectively fight those who would undermine American principles by losing sight of them ourselves.

Texto completo: The Super Bowl commercial break has long been a place for comedy and celebrity cameos, for heartwarming snippets and carefully crafted taglines – for entertainment that many fans find more compelling than the game itself.
ADS UP: Meet the director behind more than 50 Super Bowl commercials
Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary who worked as an executive for the NFL, said the campaign ads could have ripple effects on multiple fronts. The NFL would probably rather air "a funny Bud Light or Doritos ad than Donald Trump and Mike Bloomberg," he said. The candidates could face blowback for injecting political divisiveness into the year's biggest sporting event.
"People watch football to escape from things like their job, politics, war in the Middle East, things like that. So it's generally not the place I think politicians traditionally go," Lockhart said. "But neither Donald Trump nor Michael Bloomberg are traditional politicians, so it's not that surprising. "
'A little bit of cat-and-mouse'
Tim Murtaugh, the communication director for Trump's reelection campaign, told USA TODAY Sports in a statement this month that the campaign first talked with Fox last fall about airing an ad during the Super Bowl. (Broadcasting of the game rotates between Fox, NBC and CBS. )
The campaign reserved its time slot in December and paid for the ad "a few weeks ago," Murtaugh said.
The Bloomberg campaign's decision to air its own Super Bowl ad was grounded in one-upmanship. Early news reports indicated that Trump would air a 30-second commercial, so Bloomberg bought 60 seconds. "Mike is taking the fight to Trump," campaign spokesperson Michael Frazier wrote in an email.
Hours after The New York Times reported that Bloomberg purchased the 60-second ad, Trump's campaign said it had also purchased 60 seconds of time.
Lockhart described the ads, at their core, as "a little bit of cat-and-mouse. "
"Once Trump decided to do it, Bloomberg wanted to show that he had the funds and the muscle to do it in an even bigger way," said Lockhart, a CNN contributor and host of a podcast called "Words Matter. " "It may not so much be the content of the ad, but the ability to one-up the president. "
Erika Franklin Fowler, a professor at Wesleyan University who tracks political television advertising, said the exorbitant costs of Super Bowl ads have long kept political candidates away, leading them to opt for local or regional buys. In 2008, for example, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama purchased 30 seconds of advertising time in 24 local markets for $250,000, according to The New York Times.
Bloomberg and Trump are unique, Fowler said, because both have money to burn. Bloomberg spent more than $75 million on TV advertising in the first month of his candidacy alone, according to figures from the Wesleyan Media Project.
"It’s stunning," Fowler said of the New York billionaire's TV spending. "There’s not another word for it. "
Trump has already used his Super Bowl ad to drum up support. His campaign ran ads on Facebook late last week, offering up to 1 million supporters "early viewing access" to its Super Bowl commercial. The Facebook ads attempted to entice supporters to donate by claiming that "the Fake News media will do everything they can to ensure our ad never gets aired. "
'You're in lockstep'
Current and former network executives told USA TODAY Sports that Fox probably had little choice but to allow Bloomberg and Trump to advertise during the Super Bowl, even though the ads might not be warmly received by festive football fans.
"I don’t think anyone, either the league or Fox, was going to tell the president he couldn’t buy an ad," Lockhart said. "And once you’ve told the president he can buy an ad, and Bloomberg wants an ad, you’ve got to sell him an ad. "
For a network such as Fox, there is essentially a two-step approval process for Super Bowl commercials: allowing the advertiser to buy time during the broadcast, and signing off on the content within the ad itself.
Networks will often lean on repeat advertisers with whom they have long-term relationships. First-time Super Bowl buyers – such as the Bloomberg and Trump campaigns – are vetted by the network to ensure they have legitimate interest and the financial means to purchase time.
When the advertiser submits the ad in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, current and former network executives said, it is reviewed by both the NFL and the network. Either party has the right to block specific content that might be lewd, graphic or otherwise violate their policies.
In 2017, for example, 84 Lumber said Fox required the company to remove imagery of a border wall from its commercial. SodaStream claimed its 2014 ad was nixed because it ended with a parting shot at two of the game's longtime advertisers, Coke and Pepsi. And an Airborne commercial in 2005 was banned because it included a glimpse of the late Mickey Rooney's bare bottom.
One senior media executive with direct knowledge of the Super Bowl advertising process said Fox and the NFL would have no viable reason to reject a campaign ad unless it violated either party's broadcast standards.
"When political candidates start inquiring about Super Bowl advertising, it’s not the kind of thing you would keep from your partner at the NFL," said the executive, who was granted anonymity to speak openly about industry practices. "You’re in lockstep. You’re keeping the NFL informed every step of the way. "
Viewers' reactions to the ads could depend in part on the messages they contain. Calkins, the Northwestern professor, said the mere presence of campaign ads during the Super Bowl sends a message of its own.
"Super Bowl ads are very symbolic," Calkins said. "You’re communicating that you care about your business, you’re investing in your brand, you’re willing to spend money. That’s true for the products you see on the Super Bowl, but in this case, it is certainly also true of the candidates. "

Texto completo: The Des Moines Public Library's annual Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) speaker series returns for its 20th anniversary in 2020. The free series aims to connect local audiences with prominent authors.
The library will host six best-selling, award-winning authors for free events this spring.
The 2020 AViD lineup includes the authors of some of the most revered works of fiction and nonfiction in recent years, among them: a National Book Award winner, a 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence Finalist, a Women's Prize for Fiction winner, multiple Kirkus Prize finalists, and the writers behind more than a dozen bestsellers.
"We are thrilled to be able to bring such an impressive group of acclaimed authors to Des Moines this year," Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library Community Engagement Supervisor, said. "These are speakers who are going to entertain, educate, and inspire central Iowans."
The AViD series kicks off once again at the DSM Book Festival March 28, with Tayari Jones. Jones' most recent novel, 2018's "An American Marriage," has sold hundreds of thousands of copies, was awarded the Women's Prize for Fiction and an NAACP Image Award and was chosen as an Oprah Book Club pick. The library is partnering with the Book Festival to bring Jones as a headlining author.
April 9, Hanif Abdurraqib will speak at the Central Library. Last year, he released two books: the poetry collection "A Fortune For Your Disaster" and "Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest." The latter was long-listed for the National Book Award, was a Kirkus Prize finalist and is a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism.
Historical fiction author Kate Quinn will speak at the Central Library April 23. Her 2017 novel, "The Alice Network," was an early Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick and was the third-most requested novel at the Des Moines Public Library in 2019. Her 2019 novel, "The Huntress," was an instant bestseller and named one of the best books of the year by Marie Claire magazine.
British journalist and author Adam Higginbotham visits May 6 to discuss his debut nonfiction book, "Midnight in Chernobyl," at the Central Library. Higginbotham first started investigating the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 2006. The book draws on hundreds of hours of interviews. It was recently named a finalist for the 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence and was named one of the ten best books of 2019 by The New York Times.
Bestselling author and television host Brad Meltzer will visit the Central Library May 14. After years of writing best-selling thriller novels, Meltzer released his first nonfiction book last year, "The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington." His new nonfiction book, "The Lincoln Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill America's 16th President – and Why It Failed," will be released in early May.
AViD concludes with acclaimed author Jacqueline Woodson at Sheslow Auditorium on the Drake University campus May 27. Woodson is a National Book Award winner and four-time finalist, and has served as the Young People's Poet Laureate and National Ambassador for Young People's Literature. Though she's spent most of her illustrious career writing young adult books, her 2019 adult novel, "Red at the Bone," was an instant bestseller and was named one of the Best Books of 2019 by Oprah Magazine. The book is also nominated for an NAACP Image Award.
All AViD events are free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served. Each author will also take part in a question-and-answer session and autograph books. Books will be available for purchase at each event.
With support from the Des Moines Public Library Foundation and other generous donors including Humanities Iowa and the National Endowment for the Humanities, AViD celebrates great reading, great writing, and the pursuit of lifelong learning.

Manuscript offers different account of Johnson's meeting with president

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As Senate Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits through the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, his role as a witness to key events is back in the spotlight.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Johnson's name is mentioned in an unpublished book manuscript written by former White House national security adviser John Bolton.
The headline revelation in the Times report is that according to Bolton, Trump sought to freeze military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump and his legal team have denied that withholding the aid had anything to do with seeking investigations of the president's political opponents.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet early Monday.
The Times also offered a new twist on a previously reported May 23, 2019, meeting with President Trump attended by American envoys and Johnson, who were reporting back on their recent trip toKyiv for the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Times reported that at that meeting, Trump "railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Mr. Bolton."
Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee who has been closely involved in Ukraine affairs, has given a different account of that meeting.
Asked for comment on the story about the Bolton manuscript, a Johnson aide referred the Journal Sentinel to a statement issued by the senator's office last October, which stated:
"Senator Johnson does not recall in any meeting or discussion with the president, or any member of the administration, that the term 'quid pro quo' was ever used. Nor does he recall any discussion of any specific case of corruption in the 2016 election, such as Crowdstrike, the hack of the DNC servers, Hillary Clinton campaign involvement, or Hunter and Joe Biden, during general discussions of corruption, which is endemic throughout Ukraine."
In portraying the president as telling Bolton that he was linking Ukraine aid to investigations of Democrats, the Times account of the Bolton book also presents a sharp contrast with how Johnson has described his own conversations with the president around the same time last summer. Johnson said the president vehemently denied to him linking aid to investigations by Ukraine.
At a press conference Monday, Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin and other Senate Democrats noted the discrepancy. Baldwin said the Bolton account supports what diplomat Gordon Sondland told Johnson last summer, when Sondland reported a link between aid and investigations that could benefit Trump politically.
But it contradicts the flat denial that the president gave to Johnson in a phone call a short while later, according to Johnson's account of their conversation.
"It is my hope that my Republican friends in the Senate would want to have John Bolton testify so that he is under oath and so that we have all the facts," Baldwin said. "It is my hope that my Republican friends would want to know if there is evidence that the president did not tell one of my colleagues the truth. The people of Wisconsin certainly want to know if the president did not tell Sen. Johnson the truth."
Johnson has been an outspoken defender of the president in the impeachment fight, even though he said he disagreed with Trump's decision to withhold the military aid.
The Wisconsin Republican has portrayed the decision to freeze the aid as one that was based on the president's understandable concerns about general corruption in Ukraine.
In a written Nov. 18 account to House Republicans of his firsthand knowledge of events and his communications with Trump, Johnson said Trump's concerns about the aid involved both corruption and Europe's failure to pay its fair share in helping Ukraine.
But Johnson has also gone beyond that in interviews, saying the president's concerns included not just corruption in general but Trump's own conviction that Ukraine played a role in tarnishing him during the 2016 campaign.
"It was corruption overall, generalized, but yeah, no doubt about it, (it was) 'What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?'" Johnson told the Journal Sentinel last fall, recounting the reasons Trump gave him in an August phone call for not releasing the Ukraine aid.
In a November interview, Johnson defended Trump's interest in digging into the 2016 election.
"I understand that the people on the other side of this equation see (Trump's) desire to get out the truth of 2016, and they say he's trying to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel. "I look at that and say he wants to know, 'How did this false narrative about my campaign colluding with Russia, how did all that begin?' And there are certainly rumors that maybe some of that came out of Ukraine."
The idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats has been rejected by numerous U.S. officials, including some who testified in the House impeachment inquiry who say that theory has been promoted by Russia to divert attention from its own election meddling.
According to the new account in the New York Times of the Bolton book draft, Trump complained in the May 2019 meeting attended by Johnson that Ukraine had tried to damage him and mentioned "a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server."
Johnson has said he does not believe there is a DNC server in Ukraine. But he has promoted the idea that Ukraine played a role in damaging Trump during the 2016 election.
"The press likes saying it's all been debunked," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel in November, referring to claims that Ukraine meddled in that election. "The server has been debunked, but so many questions remain unanswered."
The report about the Bolton manuscript has provoked denials from Trump and his defense team as well as mounting calls by Democrats to call Bolton as a witness. Senators are expected to vote in the coming days on whether to hear witnesses, a step that most Republicans are expected to oppose.
Asked if Johnson thinks Bolton should be called to testify, a Johnson spokesman said, "the senator will make a decision on the need for further witnesses after both sides have made their initial arguments before the Senate."
Journal Sentinel reporter Patrick Marley contributed to this report.

Unpaid bills still upset some

Texto completo: When Trump gave up the last of his Atlantic City casino holdings in 2009, it ended any chance that contractors would get paid.
Steve Jenkins says he does not plan to show up at President Donald Trump's rally this week in Wildwood.
But if he made the trek from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Jenkins would bring a bill — for the tens of thousands of dollars he says Trump still owes him.
Of all the troubling accusations that have followed Trump into the White House, there is little talk these days of the trail of unpaid bills he left behind from his days as an Atlantic City casino mogul.
Trump obviously faces far more formidable problems now, including his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. So it's highly unlikely that he will mention his unpaid bills from Atlantic City when he takes the stage Tuesday night at the Wildwoods Convention Center.
But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.
"It's terrible," said Jenkins, who runs Triad Building Specialties. "I can't stand Trump. I think he's nothing but a snake oil salesman."
Jenkins was just 19 when Triad Building Specialties, started by his father in the mid-1970s, got the $300,000 contract to provide guardrails, doors, stalls and paper dispensers for the nearly 300 public bathrooms at the Trump Taj Mahal casino overlooking the Atlantic City beachfront.
It was April 1990. Trump was viewed across the world as a master businessman. His book "Trump: The Art of the Deal," published three years earlier, was still on the bestseller lists.
In Atlantic City, Trump bragged that the Taj Mahal — which he claimed had a price tag of $1.2 billion — was the "eighth wonder of the world." Not only was it considered the largest casino anywhere, it was adorned with crystal chandeliers from Austria, hand-sewn carpets from Britain, Carrara marble from Italy and 70 onion domes that towered over the Atlantic City boardwalk.
But the Taj, as it came to be called, was built on financial sand.
What Trump didn't say was that he financed the Taj with junk bonds. And what he did not tell the scores of contractors who worked on the overly lavish casino was that he could not pay their bills.
Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers.
And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm's co-owner.
"If it was just us, you could understand, but this has been a pattern over his entire career," Jenkins said.
"He's owned so many failed or fraudulent companies over the years. It's staggering to me."
Trump, who once bragged that he was the "King of Debt," owed $70 million to 253 contractors who worked on the Taj and who, in turn, hired thousands of workers.
Some firms sculpted the cement on the Taj's domes and minarets. Others installed the casino's windows and chandeliers. Still others laid the pipes and concrete pavers.
When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren't overcharging.
Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.
That kind of strategy in delaying payment on his bills was not new. In "Trump: The Art of the Deal," he wrote: "You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back."
In this case, Trump took the shirts off the backs of contractors — and emptied their wallets.
Meanwhile, Trump's own wallet seemed as fat as ever. Trump has never said his poor business dealings in Atlantic City hurt his personal finances. In fact, he says he continued to make money from his casinos. "Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me," he told the New York Times in 2016. "The money I took out of there was incredible."
Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. was only a teenager when the news emerged of Trump's failure to pay for the workers at the Taj Mahal. But even today, he said, the subject stirs anger in the city.
"It's still a talking point, anytime his name is brought up," Small said. "It's still a horror story for all of these people. He took advantage of people."
With Trump delaying payments, contractors reached into their pockets to pay their workers and suppliers. In desperation, some contractors eagerly accepted a new offer from Trump: If they would agree to less than they billed, he would pay the lower amounts immediately.
By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed.
He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.
And they were the lucky ones.
An Atlantic City firm that supplied paving stones lost $1.2 million. An Ohio company that made the Taj Mahal's onion domes was shortchanged $2 million. A firm that brought in the Carrara marble from Italy went bankrupt.
Steven Perskie, a former Democratic assemblyman and state senator from Margate, had an appallingly close-up view of Trump's battles with contractors. In 1990, then-Gov. James Florio appointed Perskie to run the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
Perskie, who later became a state Superior Court judge, said "a number of local contractors and suppliers" simply gave up and went out of business.
And when Trump gave up the last of his Atlantic City casino holdings in 2009, it ended any chance that contractors would get paid.
In 2016, when asked by The New York Times in the midst of Trump's presidential campaign for his opinion of the former casino mogul, Perskie thought back to those unpaid contractors and their lingering financial scars.
"When he left Atlantic City, it wasn't, 'Sorry to see you go,'" Perskie said. "It was, 'How fast can you get the hell out of here?'"
Since then, Perskie has refused to discuss Trump. When contacted by NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey about the upcoming rally and the legacy of Trump's unpaid bills in Atlantic City, Perskie declined to comment, citing his concern that he would be targeted for ridicule by Trump supporters.
Others who knew of Trump's financial failings in Atlantic City are not so shy.
"You don't want to hear what I think of Donald Trump," said Marty Rosenberg of Egg Harbor.
Rosenberg's firm, Atlantic Plate and Glass, installed most of the glass and mirrors in the Taj Mahal. But when the casino opened, Trump still owed Rosenberg more than $1.5 million.
What Rosenberg, now 76 and retired, quickly noticed was that Trump had no intention of forking over the money. And with Trump saying he would pay only 33 cents on each dollar he owed, Rosenberg organized the unpaid contractors.
The group then pressured Trump to pay up.
But in the end, most came up short.
Rosenberg had to take out bank loans to pay his bills. He says he also spent hours on the phone begging his suppliers to give him more time.
Eventually, he paid everyone. But he is still bitter about Trump.
And while he says he is a political "independent," he nevertheless volunteered to speak in television ads supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Today, Rosenberg says the way Trump handled his business affairs in Atlantic City "is similar to how he handles the United States."
And with a touch of sarcasm, Rosenberg added: "If ethics and morality have nothing to do with business, then Donald Trump is a very good businessman."
Today, Rosenberg says he does not like to talk about Trump. Rosenberg is fed up. He follows the impeachment hearings.
And he plans to follow the upcoming presidential campaign.
Yet he is still angry at how Trump shortchanged him. He is tempted to present Trump with a bill when the president visits Wildwood for a rally among supporters.
But Rosenberg can't be bothered.
"I don't have anything nice to say about him," Rosenberg said. "I try not to mention his name."

Texto completo: The idea of America that most of us have come to embrace - that of a functioning democracy responsible and responsive to its citizens who are entitled to vote and whose votes are equal - is lost. In fact, it may never have existed in that way at all. And the trends in society are now toward the worse rather than the better.
The founders of this country never intended for everyone to vote, and they didn't even include a right to vote in the Constitution. Instead they let voting default to the states, which erected their own barriers to the ballot. As such, the right to vote has expanded and contracted over time.
In the beginning, generally speaking, property-owning white men were the only people allowed to vote. That franchise has expanded over time to include all white men, black men, women and so forth. But, there remain efforts to restrict access to the ballot, particularly for black and brown people.
This rash of new restrictions seems to have been ignited by the election of Barack Obama, America's first black president. As the Brennan Center for Justice has pointed out, "After the 2010 election, state lawmakers nationwide started introducing hundreds of harsh measures making it harder to vote." As the center documented:
"Overall, 25 states have put in place new restrictions since then - 15 states have more restrictive voter ID laws in place (including six states with strict photo ID requirements), 12 have laws making it harder for citizens to register (and stay registered), 10 made it more difficult to vote early or absentee, and three took action to make it harder to restore voting rights for people with past criminal convictions."
In fact the idea of "one person, one vote" wasn't fully invoked in the United States until the 1960s, when Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the decision for Reynolds v. Sims in 1964: "The conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing - one person, one vote."
Furthermore, big money from corporations and candidates themselves is corrupting the process and wielding outsize influence on voters' choices.
In the 1960 presidential campaign, John Kennedy came under attack for spending what his competitor Hubert Humphrey thought an unseemly amount on a political campaign. As CBS reported:
"Humphrey called Kennedy's campaign 'the most highly financed, the most plush, the most extravagant in the history of politics in the U.S.' At that point, Kennedy had spent $72,000 (about $575,000, in today's dollars) on radio, TV and mailers in Wisconsin."
Kennedy defended himself by pointing out that "President Eisenhower's campaign in 1952, when costs were lower, was $2,500,000." That was still only about $20 million in today's value.
Compare that to the nearly $1 billion Donald Trump raised in 2016 and the nearly $1.5 billion raised by Hillary Clinton.
And, the outside spending - political spending by outside groups, excluding party committees - has skyrocketed in the last couple of decades. From 1990 to 2002, it rarely broke the million-dollar mark, according to OpenSecrets.org. In 2016, it reached $178 million.
This is to say nothing of how Russia's political influence campaign exposed just how vulnerable individual Americans were to being manipulated by misinformation.
Our electoral process has become corrupted, with politicians seeking to block some from the ballot and plutocrats seeking to beguile those who would vote.
Now, with the Trump impeachment, we are seeing that the structure of government is also showing signs of fracture.
There has been no doubt, since the White House released the quasitranscript of the phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, that Trump had been engaged in a corrupt act when trying to pressure the Ukrainians to announce an investigation of the Bidens. Indeed, this month, the Government Accountability Office determined that Trump broke the law when withholding funds to Ukraine as part of his pressure campaign.
Then, Trump did everything within his power to conceal what he had done when the House of Representatives launched its impeachment investigation.
Now, Senate Republicans stand poised to cement in precedent, by way of an acquittal, that the president who thought himself king, who considers himself above the law, is in fact above the law. Oaths be damned. Constitution be damned.
An acquittal will say to the world, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the checks and balances built into the Constitution are fatally flawed and unworkable, that they are compromised to the partisanship and therefore unworkable and worthless.
The Senate will be saying to America that corruption is an acceptable feature of the executive branch. This will be another devastating blow to electoral confidence and to trust in government.
Everything from who can vote, how they vote, who influences that vote, who is elected by that vote and who is accountable having been voted in, is broken.
America, as an idea, as a representative democracy with the power ultimately vested in the people and accountable to the people, is vanishing like a vapor.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As Senate Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits through the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, his role as a witness to key events is back in the spotlight.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Johnson's name is mentioned in an unpublished book manuscript written by former White House national security adviser John Bolton.
The headline revelation in the Times report is that according to Bolton, Trump sought to freeze military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump and his legal team have denied that withholding the aid had anything to do with seeking investigations of the president's political opponents.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet early Monday.
The Times also offered a new twist on a previously reported May 23, 2019, meeting with President Trump attended by American envoys and Johnson, who were reporting back on their recent trip toKyiv for the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Times reported that at that meeting, Trump "railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Mr. Bolton."
Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee who has been closely involved in Ukraine affairs, has given a different account of that meeting.
Asked for comment on the story about the Bolton manuscript, a Johnson aide referred the Journal Sentinel to a statement issued by the senator's office last October, which stated:
"Senator Johnson does not recall in any meeting or discussion with the president, or any member of the administration, that the term 'quid pro quo' was ever used. Nor does he recall any discussion of any specific case of corruption in the 2016 election, such as Crowdstrike, the hack of the DNC servers, Hillary Clinton campaign involvement, or Hunter and Joe Biden, during general discussions of corruption, which is endemic throughout Ukraine."
In portraying the president as telling Bolton that he was linking Ukraine aid to investigations of Democrats, the Times account of the Bolton book also presents a sharp contrast with how Johnson has described his own conversations with the president around the same time last summer. Johnson said the president vehemently denied to him linking aid to investigations by Ukraine.
At a press conference Monday, Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin and other Senate Democrats noted the discrepancy. Baldwin said the Bolton account supports what diplomat Gordon Sondland told Johnson last summer, when Sondland reported a link between aid and investigations that could benefit Trump politically.
But it contradicts the flat denial that the president gave to Johnson in a phone call a short while later, according to Johnson's account of their conversation.
"It is my hope that my Republican friends in the Senate would want to have John Bolton testify so that he is under oath and so that we have all the facts," Baldwin said. "It is my hope that my Republican friends would want to know if there is evidence that the president did not tell one of my colleagues the truth. The people of Wisconsin certainly want to know if the president did not tell Sen. Johnson the truth."
Johnson has been an outspoken defender of the president in the impeachment fight, even though he said he disagreed with Trump's decision to withhold the military aid.
The Wisconsin Republican has portrayed the decision to freeze the aid as one that was based on the president's understandable concerns about general corruption in Ukraine.
In a written Nov. 18 account to House Republicans of his firsthand knowledge of events and his communications with Trump, Johnson said Trump's concerns about the aid involved both corruption and Europe's failure to pay its fair share in helping Ukraine.
But Johnson has also gone beyond that in interviews, saying the president's concerns included not just corruption in general but Trump's own conviction that Ukraine played a role in tarnishing him during the 2016 campaign.
"It was corruption overall, generalized, but yeah, no doubt about it, (it was) 'What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?'" Johnson told the Journal Sentinel last fall, recounting the reasons Trump gave him in an August phone call for not releasing the Ukraine aid.
In a November interview, Johnson defended Trump's interest in digging into the 2016 election.
"I understand that the people on the other side of this equation see (Trump's) desire to get out the truth of 2016, and they say he's trying to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel. "I look at that and say he wants to know, 'How did this false narrative about my campaign colluding with Russia, how did all that begin?' And there are certainly rumors that maybe some of that came out of Ukraine."
The idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats has been rejected by numerous U.S. officials, including some who testified in the House impeachment inquiry who say that theory has been promoted by Russia to divert attention from its own election meddling.
According to the new account in the New York Times of the Bolton book draft, Trump complained in the May 2019 meeting attended by Johnson that Ukraine had tried to damage him and mentioned "a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server."
Johnson has said he does not believe there is a DNC server in Ukraine. But he has promoted the idea that Ukraine played a role in damaging Trump during the 2016 election.
"The press likes saying it's all been debunked," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel in November, referring to claims that Ukraine meddled in that election. "The server has been debunked, but so many questions remain unanswered."
The report about the Bolton manuscript has provoked denials from Trump and his defense team as well as mounting calls by Democrats to call Bolton as a witness. Senators are expected to vote in the coming days on whether to hear witnesses, a step that most Republicans are expected to oppose.
Asked if Johnson thinks Bolton should be called to testify, a Johnson spokesman said, "the senator will make a decision on the need for further witnesses after both sides have made their initial arguments before the Senate."

Asked if Johnson thinks Bolton should be called to testify, a Johnson spokesman said, "the senator will make a decision on the need for further witnesses after both sides have made their initial arguments before the Senate."
Journal Sentinel reporter Patrick Marley contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Michael Sheen has made cardigans dangerous. On the Fox drama "Prodigal Son," he plays Dr. Martin Whitly, also known as The Surgeon, a brilliant Manhattan doctor who is responsible for at least 23 murders, most of them gruesome. Convicted and confined to a psychiatric hospital, he spends his days swathed in a nubbly, oatmeal sweater, playing mind games with his son, Malcolm (Tom Payne), a profiler for the New York Police Department.
Enjoying "Prodigal Son," which returned with its midseason premiere this week, requires a hefty suspension of disbelief surrounding cops, journalism and secure psychiatric facilities. But it offers the grisly pleasures of a murder-of-the-week procedural, as well as Sheen's twinkly, delirious performance. Told that a man has murdered 19 people, he says, "It's what they call a serial killer's dozen," then convulses in a wheezing laugh.
"If you want to feel like a good writer, write a line of dialogue and have Michael Sheen say it," said Sam Sklaver, one of the show's creators. "Because all of a sudden you seem like you're Shakespeare. He's just so, so good."
About 8.7 million weekly viewers across all platforms agree, making "Prodigal Son" the fall's top-rated new broadcast series. Fox has already renewed it for second season.
A Welsh actor who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Sheen dominated the London stage before segueing into movies and scripted series. He combines impeccably average looks with a very un-average intelligence and emotional volatility. On the surface: a protective camouflage of niceness, ordinariness. (On "30 Rock," he played Liz Lemon's "settling soulmate.") Underneath: something darker and weirder. As Sklaver put it, "He's delightfully disturbing."
On a springlike morning several days before the midseason premiere, Sheen, 50, entered a cafe near a location shoot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, having traded Martin's prison scrubs and sweater for a plaid flannel shirt, a clashing tartan scarf and dad jeans. He was relaxed - or maybe that was just the protective camouflage working - and he had the bags under his eyes that are the go-to accessory for the father of a newborn. His daughter with actress Anna Lundberg, Lyra, is nearly 4 months old. He also has a 20-year-old daughter, Lily, with his former partner Kate Beckinsale.
Over a plate of poached eggs and a flat white, Sheen cheerfully discussed the banality of murder and taking psychopathy home, while also revealing a knitwear-related spoiler.

Q: Why do you think we have such a fascination with serial killers?
A: We like to think that they're an aberration, an extreme version of what is possible. And yet, underneath, we know that they're not separate. They are a reflection of us in some way. They're the monsters we don't want to own. We have to integrate them, assimilate them in some way. To turn them into entertainment is one way to do it.

Q: That seems like such a perverse impulse.
A: The alternative is to not engage with it, which would make it more frightening.

Q: In "Prodigal Son," is there some romance around the idea of the killer's being so much smarter than everyone else?
A: Well, I liked the challenge of playing someone who seems very likable, sort of charming. He uses that disguise like animals do: bright colors to lure prey. If you're a hunter, what you want is to be able to disguise yourself as something that will bring your prey to you. And so I came at it from that point of view - maybe this is me just rationalizing with myself, but this is genuinely what I found interesting about it - rather than looking at the character as someone who falls into that trope of the genius serial killer. So it's less about him being smart and more about him being dazzling.

Q: Why does Martin kill?
A: Well, that's what the show is about. He represents himself and what he's done in a totally unreliable way. It's always squalid reasons. It's always furtive, secretive, shameful reasons based on trauma.

Q: So how do you make sure that you're not carrying any of that home from the set?
A: I don't think you can, really. I think that's what you sign up for. I've found that if the subject matter has an innate risk to it, it doesn't matter how you approach it. It will affect you. It works on you. On an unconscious level, it just makes things happen. So you can either go with that and accept that and embrace that or not. But if you don't embrace it, it doesn't mean it's not going to affect you in some way.

Q: Tell me about Martin's cardigan.
A: Well, this is a massive spoiler, but I may have a new cardigan. I know. I was shocked. There is something that happens that means that my old cardigan may get a little spoiled. That cardigan is comfortable and soft and part of his disguise. Yeah, you just want to go up and hug him, don't you? Which means you'd have to cross the line into his cell, which means he's got you!

Q: Is the new one as cozy?
A: I resisted it, but the new one is actually better.

Q: During the midseason premiere, Martin learns that his son has been abducted by another serial killer. How does that affect him?
A: He has a terror of not having control. Which of course is the ultimate challenge for parents: How do you negotiate your child wanting to have more independence from you? So, when his son is now in the hands of someone else, in a way it doesn't matter that it's a serial killer; it's scary for him. It manifests itself is as a panic attack. He may up until that point have thought that he was pretending to love Malcolm, but in that moment, it becomes clear that something else is going on.

Q: That gets to the crux of the show, this question of can you be a bad person and a good father?
A: I'm not interested in that. I think that's sort of slightly meaningless. From an acting point of view, you can't play "good father," you can't play "monster."

Q: Are you a good father?
A: What is a good father? What does that mean? I mean, God knows I don't know. You try your best in the circumstances. You can see that there's a process going on where this little person is trying to find their own feet and yet needs you as well. Negotiating that is very complicated. And that's the struggle, no matter if they're a few months old or in their 20s.

Calif. stars funnel cash to candidates

Texto completo: Presidential contenders are flocking to California to appear at top-dollar fundraisers alongside celebrity supporters, hoping the star power will give them the wattage needed to shine bright come Super Tuesday. Everyone from Leonardo DiCaprio to Mark Ruffalo to Tom Ford has opened their wallets. So who's backing whom?
The Desert Sun examined a list of individual donors from California who contributed $2,800 to presidential candidates from January to September 2019 — the last time candidates filed reports with the FEC.
More than 4,800 Californians contributed $2,800 to presidential campaigns in the first nine months of 2019, the maximum contribution amount FEC rules allow donors to funnel to presidential campaign committees annually.
The crowded field of candidates has fragmented the liberal entertainment industry, most of whom lined up behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama in recent election cycles.
Before her withdrawal from the race, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., received almost 1,300 contributions in California at the $2,800 level, leading the field in her home state. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden amassed 991 and 973 contributions, respectively, at that amount, far more than Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., (154), Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., (131), entrepreneur Andrew Yang (54), businessman Tom Steyer (40) and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., (34).
Each of the candidates drew contributions from notable entertainment industry figures. Aside from Drew Carey, who contributed to former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and "The Simpsons" creator Matt Groening, who gave to author Marianne Williamson, most gave to the now-front runners with many lining up behind Warren and Buttigieg in particular.
Many contributors also didn't exhibit clear preferences in their contributions, preferring instead to hand out $2,800 checks to multiple candidates.
Warren and Sanders have eschewed top-dollar fundraisers this election cycle. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has identified California as a key target, but since he's self-funding his campaign, he hasn't hosted celebrity-dense fundraisers like some of his opponents.
Although he counts few in the entertainment industry among his supporters — with the exceptions of Jon Voight and Kanye West — even President Donald Trump ventured to Los Angeles last year to raise funds for his reelection campaign.
Here's a guide to some of the celebrities and notable Californians financially backing presidential hopefuls ahead of the 2020 election.
Pete Buttigieg Even before he mingled with Rob Reiner and Martin Sheen and maybe even tried some Goop products at Gwyneth Paltrow's Los Angeles home in May, the 38-year-old former mayor had attracted a wealth of celebrity supporters.
Lesbian power couple Ellen DeGeneres and Portia DeRossi each contributed $2,800 to Buttigieg. DeGeneres co-hosted a fundraiser him in July along with actor Sean Hayes. Talk show host Chelsea Handler and actor Jason Bateman also attended, according to NBC News.
DeGeneres, a veteran Democratic donor, isn't the only LGBTQ entertainment industry titan to throw support behind Buttigieg. George Takei, Matthew Bomer, Dustin Lance Black and Jane Lynch also maxxed out in contributions to Mayor Pete in 2019.
Buttigieg has also received max contributions from Kevin Bacon, Ted Danson, Michael J. Fox and Alyssa Milano.
Elizabeth Warren Although Warren and Sanders' "hot mic" incident after the January debate could've been written in a Hollywood writers' room, the Los Angeles donor circuit hasn't figured largely in either of their campaigns.
Scarlett Johansson has contributed to Warren's campaign and told the Hollywood Reporter the Massachusetts senator "was thoughtful and progressive but realistic." Warren has received contributions from Trump foe Rosie O'Donnell as well as actresses Amy Schumer and Amber Tamblyn. She's also gotten cash from John Legend and Chrissy Teigen.
Joe Biden Filmmaker Rob Reiner may have contributed to several candidates, but he's lined up squarely behind Biden. He told entertainment news site The Blast he believes the former vice president has the best chance at unseating Trump.
Many of the notable Californians who've contributed to Biden have also funneled cash to other campaigns.
Former HP CEO Meg Whitman, a longtime Republican activist and 2010 gubernatorial candidate, worked for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, but broke with the Republican Party in 2016 to back former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton against Trump. She endorsed former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa against Gavin Newsom in California's 2018 governor's race and has contributed $2,800 to Biden's bid to be the Democratic Party's 2020 nominee.
Bernie Sanders Sanders has received large contributions from several Hollywood progressives, including actress Shailene Woodley, who in 2016 was arrested while protesting the Keystone XL pipeline in North Dakota; "Dark Waters" actor Mark Ruffalo; and actress Susan Sarandon, who also supported Sanders' 2016 bid and faced criticism for spreading misinformation about voter registration.
'Equal opportunity' donors Many campaign financiers with the resources spread the wealth rather than back one candidate.
Dreamworks' co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, philanthropist Marilyn Katzenberg, have contributed the maximum amount allowed to 14 candidates running in the Democratic presidential primary, including remaining contenders Biden, Warren, Klobuchar and Buttigieg.
Venture capitalist and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has contributed the maximum amount to Warren and Buttigieg and, before their withdrawals, Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.
Television writer and producer Greg Berlanti has contributed to Buttigieg, Harris and Klobuchar. Berlanti, who directed the 2018 coming out film "Love Simon," told Variety it meant a "tremendous amount" to see LGBTQ representation in a presidential race.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has contributed $2,800 to Yang, Gabbard and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Vox Recode reported that Dorsey denied Gabbard's request that he host a fundraiser on her behalf.
Venture capitalist and LinkedIn founder Reed Hoffman has contributed to Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., and Klobuchar, and before their withdrawals, Harris, Inslee, Booker, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.
POM Wonderful and Fiji Water's Lynda Resnick contributed to Bennet, Booker, Klobuchar, Biden and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. Resnick and her husband, Stewart Resnick, own more water rights than any other party in California, including the city of Los Angeles.
Designer and filmmaker Tom Ford contributed to both Biden and Buttigieg, who declined Ford's offer to dress him on the campaign trail, according to the New York Times.
People who backed candidates who've dropped out A lot of celebs lined up behind Harris, their home state senator, and Booker, a longtime Hollywood favorite who's dating Rosario Dawson, before the two dropped out of the race.
Ben Affleck, Michael Douglas, and Leonardo DiCaprio all contributed the maximum amount to both Harris and Booker before both withdrew from the race. Affleck joined up with Katzenberg to host a benefit for Booker in May.
Star Wars director J.J. Abrams, actress Elizabeth Banks and actor Michael Douglas contributed to Harris. DJ Steve Aoki contributed to Booker. Abrams, according to the Los Angeles Times, contributed more than $33,000 to Harris while she campaigned to be California attorney general and U.S. senator.

Bolton manuscript offers new account of Sen. Johnson's meeting with Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As Senate Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits through the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, his role as a witness to key events is back in the spotlight.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Johnson's name is mentioned in an unpublished book manuscript written by former White House national security adviser John Bolton.
The headline revelation in the Times report is that according to Bolton, Trump sought to freeze military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump and his legal team have denied that withholding the aid had anything to do with seeking investigations of the president's political opponents.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet early Monday.
The Times also offered a new twist on a previously reported May 23, 2019, meeting with President Trump attended by American envoys and Johnson, who were reporting back on their recent trip toKyiv for the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Times reported that at that meeting, Trump "railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Mr. Bolton."
Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee who has been closely involved in Ukraine affairs, has given a different account of that meeting.
Asked for comment on the story about the Bolton manuscript, a Johnson aide referred the Journal Sentinel to a statement issued by the senator's office last October, which stated:
"Senator Johnson does not recall in any meeting or discussion with the president, or any member of the administration, that the term 'quid pro quo' was ever used. Nor does he recall any discussion of any specific case of corruption in the 2016 election, such as Crowdstrike, the hack of the DNC servers, Hillary Clinton campaign involvement, or Hunter and Joe Biden, during general discussions of corruption, which is endemic throughout Ukraine."
In portraying the president as telling Bolton that he was linking Ukraine aid to investigations of Democrats, the Times account of the Bolton book also presents a sharp contrast with how Johnson has described his own conversations with the president around the same time last summer. Johnson said the president vehemently denied to him linking aid to investigations by Ukraine.
At a press conference Monday, Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin and other Senate Democrats noted the discrepancy. Baldwin said the Bolton account supports what diplomat Gordon Sondland told Johnson last summer, when Sondland reported a link between aid and investigations that could benefit Trump politically.
But it contradicts the flat denial that the president gave to Johnson in a phone call a short while later, according to Johnson's account of their conversation.
"It is my hope that my Republican friends in the Senate would want to have John Bolton testify so that he is under oath and so that we have all the facts," Baldwin said. "It is my hope that my Republican friends would want to know if there is evidence that the president did not tell one of my colleagues the truth. The people of Wisconsin certainly want to know if the president did not tell Sen. Johnson the truth."
Johnson has been an outspoken defender of the president in the impeachment fight, even though he said he disagreed with Trump's decision to withhold the military aid.
The Wisconsin Republican has portrayed the decision to freeze the aid as one that was based on the president's understandable concerns about general corruption in Ukraine.
In a written Nov. 18 account to House Republicans of his firsthand knowledge of events and his communications with Trump, Johnson said Trump's concerns about the aid involved both corruption and Europe's failure to pay its fair share in helping Ukraine.
But Johnson has also gone beyond that in interviews, saying the president's concerns included not just corruption in general but Trump's own conviction that Ukraine played a role in tarnishing him during the 2016 campaign.
"It was corruption overall, generalized, but yeah, no doubt about it, (it was) 'What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?'" Johnson told the Journal Sentinel last fall, recounting the reasons Trump gave him in an August phone call for not releasing the Ukraine aid.
In a November interview, Johnson defended Trump's interest in digging into the 2016 election.
"I understand that the people on the other side of this equation see (Trump's) desire to get out the truth of 2016, and they say he's trying to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel. "I look at that and say he wants to know, 'How did this false narrative about my campaign colluding with Russia, how did all that begin?' And there are certainly rumors that maybe some of that came out of Ukraine."
The idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats has been rejected by numerous U.S. officials, including some who testified in the House impeachment inquiry who say that theory has been promoted by Russia to divert attention from its own election meddling.
According to the new account in the New York Times of the Bolton book draft, Trump complained in the May 2019 meeting attended by Johnson that Ukraine had tried to damage him and mentioned "a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server."
Johnson has said he does not believe there is a DNC server in Ukraine. But he has promoted the idea that Ukraine played a role in damaging Trump during the 2016 election.
"The press likes saying it's all been debunked," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel in November, referring to claims that Ukraine meddled in that election. "The server has been debunked, but so many questions remain unanswered."
The report about the Bolton manuscript has provoked denials from Trump and his defense team as well as mounting calls by Democrats to call Bolton as a witness. Senators are expected to vote in the coming days on whether to hear witnesses, a step that most Republicans are expected to oppose.
Asked if Johnson thinks Bolton should be called to testify, a Johnson spokesman said, "the senator will make a decision on the need for further witnesses after both sides have made their initial arguments before the Senate."
Journal Sentinel reporter Patrick Marley contributed to this report.

Texto completo: As fresh allegations from former national security adviser John Bolton are increasing pressure on senators to allow witness testimony during the Senate impeachment trial, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey reportedly has discussed a potential agreement on calling a pair of witnesses.
According to The Washington Post, the Pennsylvania Republican expressed an openness to a witness agreement in which Democrats could call one witness and Republicans could call their own witness.
A spokesman for Toomey declined to comment on the report.
In an interview last week, Toomey had said he doesn't see an "automatic presumption" that there must be witnesses in the impeachment trial, arguing that hearing from those individuals should be used to resolve any key disputed facts.
"The criteria is not does the witness have something interesting to say," Toomey said Friday. "The criteria is are they likely to be able to shed definitive light on a disputed issue that is so central to this case that the resolution of it could change my final conclusion?"
That comment came before a New York Times report that Bolton asserts in a yet-to-be-released book that the president told him nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine would be withheld until the country assisted with investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and other Democrats.
Two Republican senators, Mitt Romney, of Utah, and Susan Collins, of Maine, said Monday that Bolton's claims bolster the case for calling trial witnesses.

Texto completo: John Bolton's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, told The New York Times he provided a copy of the book to the Trump administration on Dec. 30 to be reviewed for classified information.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not know that President Donald Trump's administration had a copy of an explosive manuscript by ex-national security adviser John Bolton, a spokesman said.
And Kentucky's longtime senator, who has said he's in "total coordination" with the White House on the impeachment trial, reportedly isn't happy.
The New York Times reported Sunday that in his upcoming book, Bolton says Trump told him he did not want to release military aid to Ukraine until that country helped with investigations that could damage Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Bolton's lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, told The Times he provided a copy of the book to the Trump administration on Dec. 30 to be reviewed for classified information.
A McConnell spokesman told The Courier Journal on Monday that the Senate majority leader "did not have any advance notice" that the National Security Council reportedly had a copy of Bolton's manuscript for weeks.
McConnell was among the Senate Republicans who were "angry at the White House" over the revelations about Bolton's manuscript, according to The Times.
Mere hours before the impeachment trial was set to resume Monday, The Times reported, McConnell and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., privately pressed the president's advisers to explain Bolton's account, which undermines a White House defense of the president and which blindsided several GOP senators, according to people familiar with their thinking.
Trump refuted Bolton's account, tweeting out early Monday morning: "I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens."
CNN's John King said Monday that McConnell is the "leader in the middle of something incredibly delicate who does not like to be blindsided" and that he has questions for the White House.
Behind closed doors for a luncheon Monday, McConnell told his colleagues to "take a deep breath and let's take one step at a time," Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., told reporters.
Meanwhile, McConnell's fellow Kentucky Republican senator, Rand Paul, suggested in an interview with the Washington Examiner on Monday that Bolton was trying to use the attention he's getting as a potential witness to make more money off his forthcoming book.
The state's junior senator called Bolton a "disgruntled, angry man" who should be taken with a grain of salt.
"He wants to sell a book," Paul said of Bolton, according to the Examiner.
Trump's alleged participation in a quid pro quo with Ukraine is at the center of the impeachment trial that began this month in the Senate, and whether to call witnesses — including Bolton — to testify has been a contentious issue.
As Senate majority leader, McConnell has influence over what happens with the trial, and he has expressed skepticism about the need to have additional witness testimony during the proceedings.
McConnell said on Dec. 12 that he would be in "total coordination with the White House counsel" as the impeachment process moved forward. According to The Times, the White House received a copy of the manuscript 18 days later. The House delivered two articles of impeachment to the Senate a little more than two weeks later.
To call witnesses, Democrats need at least four members of the 53-member Republican majority to vote with them. One possible defector, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters Monday that "it's important to be able to hear from John Bolton for us to be able to make an impartial judgment."
"It's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton. ... I have spoken with others who have opined upon this," Romney said.
Another potential swing vote, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement Monday that "the reports about John Bolton's book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As Senate Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits through the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, his role as a witness to key events is back in the spotlight.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Johnson's name is mentioned in an unpublished book manuscript written by former White House national security adviser John Bolton.
The headline revelation in the Times report is that according to Bolton, Trump sought to freeze military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump and his legal team have denied that withholding the aid had anything to do with seeking investigations of the president's political opponents.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet early Monday.
The Times also offered a new twist on a previously reported May 23, 2019, meeting with President Trump attended by American envoys and Johnson, who were reporting back on their recent trip toKyiv for the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Times reported that at that meeting, Trump "railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Mr. Bolton."
Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee who has been closely involved in Ukraine affairs, has given a different account of that meeting.
Asked for comment on the story about the Bolton manuscript, a Johnson aide referred the Journal Sentinel to a statement issued by the senator's office last October, which stated:
"Senator Johnson does not recall in any meeting or discussion with the president, or any member of the administration, that the term 'quid pro quo' was ever used. Nor does he recall any discussion of any specific case of corruption in the 2016 election, such as Crowdstrike, the hack of the DNC servers, Hillary Clinton campaign involvement, or Hunter and Joe Biden, during general discussions of corruption, which is endemic throughout Ukraine."
In portraying the president as telling Bolton that he was linking Ukraine aid to investigations of Democrats, the Times account of the Bolton book also presents a sharp contrast with how Johnson has described his own conversations with the president around the same time last summer. Johnson said the president vehemently denied to him linking aid to investigations by Ukraine.
At a press conference Monday, Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin and other Senate Democrats noted the discrepancy. Baldwin said the Bolton account supports what diplomat Gordon Sondland told Johnson last summer, when Sondland reported a link between aid and investigations that could benefit Trump politically.
But it contradicts the flat denial that the president gave to Johnson in a phone call a short while later, according to Johnson's account of their conversation.
"It is my hope that my Republican friends in the Senate would want to have John Bolton testify so that he is under oath and so that we have all the facts," Baldwin said. "It is my hope that my Republican friends would want to know if there is evidence that the president did not tell one of my colleagues the truth. The people of Wisconsin certainly want to know if the president did not tell Sen. Johnson the truth."
Johnson has been an outspoken defender of the president in the impeachment fight, even though he said he disagreed with Trump's decision to withhold the military aid.
The Wisconsin Republican has portrayed the decision to freeze the aid as one that was based on the president's understandable concerns about general corruption in Ukraine.
In a written Nov. 18 account to House Republicans of his firsthand knowledge of events and his communications with Trump, Johnson said Trump's concerns about the aid involved both corruption and Europe's failure to pay its fair share in helping Ukraine.
But Johnson has also gone beyond that in interviews, saying the president's concerns included not just corruption in general but Trump's own conviction that Ukraine played a role in tarnishing him during the 2016 campaign.
"It was corruption overall, generalized, but yeah, no doubt about it, (it was) 'What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?'" Johnson told the Journal Sentinel last fall, recounting the reasons Trump gave him in an August phone call for not releasing the Ukraine aid.
In a November interview, Johnson defended Trump's interest in digging into the 2016 election.
"I understand that the people on the other side of this equation see (Trump's) desire to get out the truth of 2016, and they say he's trying to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel. "I look at that and say he wants to know, 'How did this false narrative about my campaign colluding with Russia, how did all that begin?' And there are certainly rumors that maybe some of that came out of Ukraine."
The idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats has been rejected by numerous U.S. officials, including some who testified in the House impeachment inquiry who say that theory has been promoted by Russia to divert attention from its own election meddling.
According to the new account in the New York Times of the Bolton book draft, Trump complained in the May 2019 meeting attended by Johnson that Ukraine had tried to damage him and mentioned "a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server."
Johnson has said he does not believe there is a DNC server in Ukraine. But he has promoted the idea that Ukraine played a role in damaging Trump during the 2016 election.
"The press likes saying it's all been debunked," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel in November, referring to claims that Ukraine meddled in that election. "The server has been debunked, but so many questions remain unanswered."
The report about the Bolton manuscript has provoked denials from Trump and his defense team as well as mounting calls by Democrats to call Bolton as a witness. Senators are expected to vote in the coming days on whether to hear witnesses, a step that most Republicans are expected to oppose.
Asked if Johnson thinks Bolton should be called to testify, a Johnson spokesman said, "the senator will make a decision on the need for further witnesses after both sides have made their initial arguments before the Senate."
Journal Sentinel reporter Patrick Marley contributed to this report.

Kobe summoned calm in the face of pressure: That is why we watched

Texto completo: There were the winners, of course. The buzzer-beaters that pop up whenever you type his name in a search engine.
There was the 81-point game and the MVP and the endless All-Star selections, not to mention the championships.
There are the stories of Kobe Bryant's competitiveness, his relentless will, his workout routine, his tolerance of physical pain, and his inquisitiveness about ... well, everything. He won an Oscar for producing an animated short film, for goodness' sake, and he championed women's sports like few iconic male athletes before him.
His off-court legacy was complicated, certainly. He had been charged, with sexual assault in 2003. Those charges were dropped the following year. His on-court legacy was complicated, too, especially his beef with his Hall of Fame Lakers teammate, Shaquille O'Neal, which led to their infamous split, and possibly derailed the chance of future titles.
He played with the heat of a blast furnace. At times, he struggled to find balance in a game that demands five players in concert but often rewards a singular, comet-like force.
He talked about his search for that balance later in life.
"My career — like other things in life — was never perfect," he told The New York Times in an interview about the documentary he produced, "Dear Basketball." "There's beauty in those imperfections, and the last thing I wanted to do was create a film where all the lines were perfect, and all the coloring was perfect."
All of that matters as we remember Bryant.
But that's not fundamentally why we are mourning him today after news broke that he was killed — along with daughter Gianna and seven other people — in a helicopter crash outside Los Angeles on Sunday.
Bryant didn't just transcend basketball. He freed us from the limitations of the human body. He was beautiful to watch. A balletic presence no matter the pressure or expectation.
And though he might not have been an absolute original in his on-court style — he famously studied and mimicked Michael Jordan's repertoire — he played with a grace and fluidity even Jordan didn't possess.
Like Jordan, Bryant stood apart inside a space stuffed with spectacular athleticism. Like Jordan, he showed fearlessness in the tensest of moments.
To summon calm in the face of pressure is part of his legend. That is why we watched.
But in part, too, because when he leaped toward the rim, when he contorted himself midair, when he stopped in an instant, pirouetted in one direction as the defender flailed in another, when he rose up in flawless balance, shoulders always square to the basket, he was showing us a form of physical perfection.
He was showing us what was possible.
This is what our most outsized athletes do: They carry the sense of immortality. And its loss is crushing. Because it reminds us of our own mortality.
No wonder so many congregated Sunday afternoon at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. They wanted to pay respects, yes, but they also wanted to gather in acknowledgment that something gorgeous and true fell from the sky.
Something that liberated us.
Music can have a similar effect, and when we lose a musician, an innovator, an artist too young, we lose someone who gave us voice, who helped explain us to ourselves.
But losing a transcendent athlete still feels different. For they don't really walk among us. They glide. Or float. Or hover. Somewhere between the earth underfoot and the heavens.
We look up because we want to escape, if only for a moment. And because we don't know what's coming next.
In this way, they stretch our imagination.
Bryant did this like few others. All you had to do was watch his majestic stride, to see the spark jumping off his shaved head, to see his eyes, to know that they absorbed the world from a different view.
That vantage point is gone. Way too soon. Just when he was pivoting to a second act, determined to endeavor in new fields with the same ferocity.
Whether it was making movies or coaching his daughter or spreading the essence of what made him combine his otherworldly basketball talent with all of that outsized drive to succeed.
He called it the Mamba mentality. Or maybe we called it that and he adopted it. Whatever its origin, he didn't need the brand.
For in the end, he was simply Kobe. Walking on air for the rest of us.

Texto completo: I too am a stutterer. I can empathize with all the things Chesley Burnett "Sully" Sullenberger III said in his New York Times editorial.
I still stutter occasionally, particularly when I'm trying to make a point or express an opinion.
I know why the press says Biden is hesitant sometimes in the debates. I know what it's like to know what I want to say and also know I will not be able to say it without stuttering.
The hesitation comes from thinking on the fly for another word that you can use in place of the one you know you will stutter over. Biden is to be admired for overcoming his speech problems, not mocked.
— Willis Weldin, Wilmington
To all Republican senators: Now is your chance Now is your best chance to be rid of this person who has corrupted your entire party. You all know what kind of person he is. You all know what he's done and what he will continue to do if not stopped now.
This is probably your last best chance to stand up and join the Democrats to save this great country that you have sworn an oath to protect and to serve.
You don't have to say ahead of time that you're going to vote to remove him ... but when the vote is taken if you will all stand up for this great country and vote to remove him from office, you will be the heroes in this whole sad story.
— Al and Jean Mancino, Wilmington
Amid all the turmoil, the Hotel du Pont shines like a beacon of good At a time when the country is torn between issues of right and left, healthcare, the flag, the Eagles and good and bad weather, it's nice to know the Hotel Du Pont is still here for us all.
My wife and I had the pleasure (compliments of our daughter) of seeing "Jersey Boys" and a two-night stay at the Hotel Du Pont.
What a treat!
We've stayed at quite a few five-star venues, but in my opinion, there is little to compare to the Hotel Du Pont. The staff are polite, knowledgeable about their jobs, and they all seem to be "happy." That translates into a refreshing atmosphere buildingwide.
The rooms are exceptional, clean, spacious and quiet. It's somewhat hard to believe it's downtown Wilmington. Let us not forget the food. Personally, I like the Green Room bar menu and of course the drink selection. There is something there for everyone. I can only hope the name change of the Green Room doesn't affect cuisine too much.
Lastly, the shows and entertainment that the Playhouse has gotten to come to Wilmington over the years have been incredible. We've seen many shows over time, but I think seeing Hall and Oates was the best. That was a fill-in date for them, and I just happened to call at the right time. Great show.
So instead of giving candy and flowers to your loved one, save a buck a day and do a night downtown with your friends at the Du Pont.
— Guy Mazza, Wilmington
Prison officials don't help prisoners; they just burn through tax dollars I have been reading with interest recent reports of our broken prison system.
One absolutely amazing thing I cannot wrap my head around is how we pay millions of dollars for counseling and treatment staff who do nothing to prepare prisoners for their release, or much of anything else.
Instead, we recently used additional tax dollars to hire a former prisoner to stalk the prisons, looking for inmates being released who need assistance. Meanwhile, these prison officials do absolutely nothing except steal my tax dollars.
You can't make this stuff up.

Texto completo: A cult theater project from the '90s has emerged from the rabbit hole. "Alice" is reborn, thanks to students at the Yale School of Drama.
Twenty-seven years ago, the internationally renowned theater artist Robert Wilson invited the maverick singer and songwriter Tom Waits, known for his gravelly voice and skid-row persona, and Wait's wife, writer Kathleen Brennan, to help him create "Alice."
The musical theater project used elements from the children's classic "Alice in Wonderland" to explore the relationship between the book's author Lewis Carroll and the child who inspired him to write the book, Alice Liddell.
Yale School of Drama student Logan Ellis has chosen to stage "Alice" for his thesis project. The directing projects at the YSD are full stagings with large budgets and are open to the public.
"Alice" runs Feb. 1 to 7 at the large Yale University Theater on York Street in New Haven.
"It's a very painful love story," Ellis says, "about how Alice is coping throughout her entire life with a childhood trauma. It's based off of historical speculation that [Carroll] was in love with Alice. It's a direct exploration of pedophilia, alcohol addiction and taboo sexual cultures."
Unlike the Lewis Carroll books it references, this "Alice" is not for young audiences.
"Alice" had its premiere in 1992 in Germany. That original production, which ran for a few months then toured Europe for a couple of years, had a brief New York run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1995. Yale's production is apparently the first version of the show that has originated in the U.S.
The other main collaborator on "Alice" was librettist Paul Schmidt, a respected playwright, translator and actor who worked with some of the greatest experimental theater artists of the 20th century and is also considered one of the greatest American translators of Chekhov and Rimbaud. A 1995 article about "Alice" in the New York Times was titled "Paul Schmidt Works Well With Geniuses."
Shortly after the "Alice" project, Schmidt (who had also taught at Harvard and Cornell) joined the faculty at the Yale School of Drama, where he taught until his death in 1999.
Ellis describes the original "Alice" script as "30 pages of short scenes and lyrics. It doesn't denote the gender of the characters, or the vocal ranges. There are no charts for the musicians; It just says 'we used these instruments.' The music is instrumental in establishing the tone of the show. It's emotional but as a lyrical, demented sense of the world."
Acting student Ilia Isorelýs Paulino, who plays Alice in the show, calls it "a story about a girl who is trying to let go of this very traumatic past. This abuser has shaped and framed her life."
She says there's a lot of movement in the show, and that clowning classes at the school have helped her in "freeing my mind from complications."
Paulino enjoys the openness of the project.
"The script is so full and yet so bare at some point. The spirit and energy of it all is so inviting."
Even among longtime Waits fans, the "Alice" music can be an acquired taste. Ellis was quite familiar with Waits' work, which can range from country songs to drunken piano ballads to industrial noise rock, but Paulino came to "Alice" cold. She sees the idiosyncratic booze-pop idol as "a pessimistic person with a heart of gold."
Waits performed songs from "Alice" at some of his concerts, and in 2002 released an entire "Alice" album, which was very different from the stage version of a decade earlier. For one thing, while Waits sings the songs on the album, in his accustomed raw and raspy style, he did not appear as a performer in the stage show, where the songs are sung in character by a variety of actors.
The songs had to be adapted for the stage, so Ellis brought in a professional music director, Dan Pardo, who has worked locally at the Goodspeed Opera House and on Broadway and whose recent projects include music-directing the Netflix comedy special "John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch."
Pardo sees "Alice" as different in structure and style from the musical theater shows he's usually involved with, and says "it's been fun trying to keep the core Tom Waits sound but find accessible ways to share it."
Besides Pardo's musical arrangements, a full cast, an onstage band and a script, which one German critic deemed "wonderfully poetic and absurd," "Alice" uses projections, sound and lighting effects to create a "big spectacle," Ellis says, blending fantastical images from the "Alice" books with harsh, violent real-life themes.
The result, the director says, is "a simultaneous mash-up of a play, a musical freakshow, a concert, an opera and a dance piece. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity."
ALICE, conceived by Robert Wilson, with libretto by Paul Schmidt and songs by Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan, runs Feb. 1 to 7 at the Yale University Theater, 222 York St., New Haven. Tickets are $25, $15 for students. 203-432-1234, drama.yale.edu.

Texto completo: The Des Moines Public Library's annual Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) speaker series returns for its 20th anniversary in 2020. The free series aims to connect local audiences with prominent authors.
The library will host six best-selling, award-winning authors for free events this spring.
The 2020 AViD lineup includes the authors of some of the most revered works of fiction and nonfiction in recent years, among them: a National Book Award winner, a 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence Finalist, a Women's Prize for Fiction winner, multiple Kirkus Prize finalists, and the writers behind more than a dozen bestsellers.
"We are thrilled to be able to bring such an impressive group of acclaimed authors to Des Moines this year," Tim Paluch, Des Moines Public Library Community Engagement Supervisor, said. "These are speakers who are going to entertain, educate, and inspire central Iowans."
The AViD series kicks off once again at the DSM Book Festival March 28, with Tayari Jones. Jones' most recent novel, 2018's "An American Marriage," has sold hundreds of thousands of copies, was awarded the Women's Prize for Fiction and an NAACP Image Award and was chosen as an Oprah Book Club pick. The library is partnering with the Book Festival to bring Jones as a headlining author.
April 9, Hanif Abdurraqib will speak at the Central Library. Last year, he released two books: the poetry collection "A Fortune For Your Disaster" and "Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to a Tribe Called Quest." The latter was long-listed for the National Book Award, was a Kirkus Prize finalist and is a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism.
Historical fiction author Kate Quinn will speak at the Central Library April 23. Her 2017 novel, "The Alice Network," was an early Reese Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick and was the third-most requested novel at the Des Moines Public Library in 2019. Her 2019 novel, "The Huntress," was an instant bestseller and named one of the best books of the year by Marie Claire magazine.
British journalist and author Adam Higginbotham visits May 6 to discuss his debut nonfiction book, "Midnight in Chernobyl," at the Central Library. Higginbotham first started investigating the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 2006. The book draws on hundreds of hours of interviews. It was recently named a finalist for the 2020 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence and was named one of the ten best books of 2019 by The New York Times.
Bestselling author and television host Brad Meltzer will visit the Central Library May 14. After years of writing best-selling thriller novels, Meltzer released his first nonfiction book last year, "The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington." His new nonfiction book, "The Lincoln Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill America's 16th President – and Why It Failed," will be released in early May.
AViD concludes with acclaimed author Jacqueline Woodson at Sheslow Auditorium on the Drake University campus May 27. Woodson is a National Book Award winner and four-time finalist, and has served as the Young People's Poet Laureate and National Ambassador for Young People's Literature. Though she's spent most of her illustrious career writing young adult books, her 2019 adult novel, "Red at the Bone," was an instant bestseller and was named one of the Best Books of 2019 by Oprah Magazine. The book is also nominated for an NAACP Image Award.
All AViD events are free and open to the public. Seating is first come, first served. Each author will also take part in a question-and-answer session and autograph books. Books will be available for purchase at each event.
With support from the Des Moines Public Library Foundation and other generous donors including Humanities Iowa and the National Endowment for the Humanities, AViD celebrates great reading, great writing, and the pursuit of lifelong learning.

MSU student sent back to Iran

Texto completo: "... it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran."
Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University
An Iranian student traveling to East Lansing to start his first week at Michigan State University was forced by federal agents to return to his home country.
Alireza Yazdani Esfidajani, 27, was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at Detroit Metro Airport on Sunday afternoon. He was placed on a flight back to Tehran on Monday afternoon.
Esfidajani was accepted as a Michigan State graduate student and scheduled to start this week, university spokesperson Emily Guerrant said. He was to officially enroll when he arrived on campus.
He has a valid student visa and planned to pursue a Ph.D. at Michigan State, his attorney Ghazal Nicole Mehrani said. Sunday was his first time in the United States. He spent it in Customs and Border Protection custody, partially at Monroe County's jail, where he was held from about 1 a.m. to noon Monday.
A visa does not guarantee entry to the United States, according to an emailed statement from a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.
"On January 26, Alireza Yazdani Esfidajani applied for entry into the United States, and was later deemed inadmissible, at which time he withdrew his application for admission into the United States," the statement reads. "The traveler was not arrested, rather held until a return flight could be arranged to his place of departure."
The statement did not identify a reason agents denied Yazdani admission into the U.S.
Esfidajani told Mehrani and attorney Bradley Maze that federal agents pressured him to sign a form withdrawing his application. Customs agents "pushed him and they asked questions and questions," then recommended he sign the form, Mehrani said.
"If he has signed a withdrawal of application, there's pretty much no legal remedies," she said.
Immigration law professor: MSU student's removal part of trend toward restricted travel Yazdani's removal from the U.S. follows reports of other Iranian university students' deportations. The New York Times recently reported at least 16 Iranian students had been detained by customs officials at American airports despite securing visas from the State Department allowing them to study in the U.S.
Deporting or pressuring Iranian students to leave the U.S. is part of a trend restricting travel from the Middle East country, said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University.
He pointed to the 2017 travel ban limiting travel from Muslim-majority countries like Iran and the increasing tensions between United States and Iranian forces after the December assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.
"In the broader contexts, it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran," he said.
The State Department thoroughly screens applicants' backgrounds before they issue visas, a process that can take months, Yale-Loehr said.
"Obviously there can be new facts that come to light between the time a person is issued a visa overseas and when they arrive in the United States that may justify (why) they may not be able to enter, but many times it seems to be antagonism toward Iranians that prompts (Customs) officials to go overboard to try to find excuses to prevent them from entering," he said.
MSU leadership, graduate students advocate for detained international student The university has worked with the student's attorneys and contacted federal officials. Guerrant issued a statement Monday describing the university's commitment to international students.
"We want international students to know we value and welcome them to our campus, and we are committed to global engagement, educating international students and collaborating with partners across the world in higher education efforts," she said. "MSU's international students make tremendous contributions to fueling discoveries and scholarship. Global leadership can only be maintained if talented people from across the globe are encouraged to come here to study and work."
Leadership of the MSU Graduate Employees Union is spreading the word about Esfidajani's case and asking federal officials to intervene, Chief Information Officer Darren Incorvaia said.
"We see it as our job to stand up for graduate students at Michigan State specifically, but also across the country," he said.
BBC reporter Bahman Kalbasi reported the student's detention on Twitter on Sunday night.
"... it's just getting harder and harder to come to the United States from Iran."

Texto completo: Steve Jenkins says he does not plan to show up at President Donald Trump's rally today in Wildwood, New Jersey.
But if he made the trek from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Jenkins would bring a bill — for the tens of thousands of dollars he says Trump still owes him.
Of all the troubling accusations that have followed Trump into the White House, there is little talk these days of the trail of unpaid bills he left behind from his days as an Atlantic City casino mogul.
Trump obviously faces far more formidable problems now, including his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. So it's highly unlikely that he will mention his unpaid bills from Atlantic City when he takes the stage at the Wildwoods Convention Center.
But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.
"It's terrible," said Jenkins, who runs Triad Building Specialties. "I can't stand Trump. I think he's nothing but a snake oil salesman."
Jenkins was just 19 when Triad Building Specialties, started by his father in the mid-1970s, got the $300,000 contract to provide guardrails, doors, stalls and paper dispensers for the nearly 300 public bathrooms at the Trump Taj Mahal casino overlooking the Atlantic City beachfront.
It was April 1990. Trump was viewed across the world as a master businessman. His book "Trump: The Art of the Deal," published three years earlier, was still on the bestseller lists.
In Atlantic City, Trump bragged that the Taj Mahal — which he claimed had a price tag of $1.2 billion — was the "eighth wonder of the world." Not only was it considered the largest casino anywhere, it was adorned with crystal chandeliers from Austria, hand-sewn carpets from Britain, Carrara marble from Italy and 70 onion domes that towered over the Atlantic City boardwalk.
But the Taj, as it came to be called, was built on financial sand.
What Trump didn't say was that he financed the Taj with junk bonds. And what he did not tell the scores of contractors who worked on the overly lavish casino was that he could not pay their bills.
Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers. And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm's co-owner.
"If it was just us, you could understand, but this has been a pattern over his entire career," Jenkins said. "He's owned so many failed or fraudulent companies over the years. It's staggering to me."
Trump, who once bragged that he was the "King of Debt," owed $70 million to 253 contractors who worked on the Taj and who, in turn, hired thousands of workers.
Some firms sculpted the cement on the Taj's domes and minarets. Others installed the casino's windows and chandeliers. Still others laid the pipes and concrete pavers.
When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren't overcharging. Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.
That kind of strategy in delaying payment on his bills was not new. In "Trump: The Art of the Deal," he wrote: "You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back."
In this case, Trump took the shirts off the backs of contractors — and emptied their wallets.
Meanwhile, Trump's own wallet seemed as fat as ever. He has never said his poor business dealings in Atlantic City hurt his personal finances. In fact, he says he continued to make money from his casinos. "Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me," Trump told The New York Times in 2016. "The money I took out of there was incredible."
Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. was only a teenager when the news emerged of Trump's failure to pay for the workers at the Taj Mahal. But even today, he said, the subject stirs anger in the city.
"It's still a talking point, anytime his name is brought up," Small said. "It's still a horror story for all of these people. He took advantage of people."
With Trump delaying payments, contractors reached into their pockets to pay their workers and suppliers. In desperation, some contractors eagerly accepted a new offer from Trump: If they would agree to less than they billed, he would pay the lower amounts immediately.
By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed. He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.
And they were the lucky ones.
An Atlantic City firm that supplied paving stones lost $1.2 million. An Ohio company that made the Taj Mahal's onion domes was shortchanged $2 million. A firm that brought in the Carrara marble from Italy went bankrupt.
Steven Perskie, a former Democratic assemblyman and state senator from Margate, had an appallingly close-up view of Trump's battles with contractors. In 1990, then-Gov. James Florio appointed Perskie to run the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
Perskie, who later became a state Superior Court judge, said "a number of local contractors and suppliers" simply gave up and went out of business. And when Trump gave up the last of his Atlantic City casino holdings in 2009, it ended any chance that contractors would get paid.
In 2016, when asked by The New York Times in the midst of Trump's presidential campaign for his opinion of the former casino mogul, Perskie thought back to those unpaid contractors and their lingering financial scars.
"When he left Atlantic City, it wasn't, 'Sorry to see you go,' " Perskie said. "It was, 'How fast can you get the hell out of here?' "
Since then, Perskie has refused to discuss Trump. When contacted by NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey about the upcoming rally and the legacy of Trump's unpaid bills in Atlantic City, Perskie declined to comment, citing his concern that he would be targeted for ridicule by Trump supporters.
Others who knew of Trump's financial failings in Atlantic City are not so shy.
"You don't want to hear what I think of Donald Trump," said Marty Rosenberg of Egg Harbor.
Rosenberg's firm, Atlantic Plate and Glass, installed most of the glass and mirrors in the Taj Mahal. But when the casino opened, Trump still owed Rosenberg more than $1.5 million.
What Rosenberg, now 76 and retired, quickly noticed was that Trump had no intention of forking over the money. And with Trump saying he would pay only 33 cents on each dollar he owed, Rosenberg organized the unpaid contractors.
The group then pressured Trump to pay up. But in the end, most came up short.
Rosenberg had to take out bank loans to pay his bills. He says he also spent hours on the phone begging his suppliers to give him more time.
Eventually, he paid everyone. But he is still bitter about Trump. And while he says he is a political "independent," he nevertheless volunteered to speak in television ads supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Today, Rosenberg says the way Trump handled his business affairs in Atlantic City "is similar to how he handles the United States." And with a touch of sarcasm, Rosenberg added: "If ethics and morality have nothing to do with business, then Donald Trump is a very good businessman."
Today, Rosenberg says he does not like to talk about Trump. Rosenberg is fed up. He follows the impeachment hearings. And he plans to follow the upcoming presidential campaign.
Yet he is still angry at how Trump shortchanged him. He is tempted to present Trump with a bill when the president visits Wildwood for a rally among supporters.
But Rosenberg can't be bothered.
"I don't have anything nice to say about him," Rosenberg said. "I try not to mention his name."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday pushed back against claims made by former National Security Adviser John Bolton in his forthcoming book, amid intensified calls for Bolton to testify at the president's Senate impeachment trial.
Trump in a series of early morning tweets denied telling Bolton that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into his Democratic rivals, a claim Bolton reportedly makes in his tell-all book, according to a New York Times report published Sunday.
Bolton's disclosure on the withheld aid to Ukraine - which undercuts Trump's long-standing assertion that an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and Democrats was never a condition for releasing $391 million in military aid to Ukraine - led congressional Democrats to amplify their calls for Senate Republicans to vote in favor of subpoenaing Bolton and other top White House officials.
Two moderate Senate Republicans - Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah - joined Democrats in calling for Bolton to testify, saying the Times report provided a convincing argument to question Bolton under oath about his firsthand knowledge of Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Bolton has said he is willing to testify before the Senate if subpoenaed.
Romney said it's "increasingly likely" that other Republicans will join the push for Bolton to testify before lawmakers. Senate Democrats need at least four Republican votes to secure the admission of new witnesses and documents in the trial.
"John Bolton's relevance to our decision has become increasingly clear," Romney told reporters on Capitol Hill.
Collins said the report about Bolton's book "strengthens the case" for witness testimony.
Trump's staunchest GOP allies in the Senate seemed less convinced that Bolton's book would be a game-changer, accusing him of solely trying to boost book sales with his revelations. The book, "The Room Where It Happen

Bolton, Trump had some clashes

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton has become a central figure in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the debate over whether senators should subpoena additional witnesses.
After Bolton failed to appear voluntarily before a House impeachment hearing in November, his lawyer Charles Cooper told the investigating committees that his client was "personally involved" in meetings relevant to the inquiry into whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine for political reasons.
On Sunday, news outlets reported that a manuscript for Bolton's upcoming book says Trump explicitly told Bolton he did not want to release the aid until Ukraine helped with investigations related to the 2016 election and Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Because Bolton's reported claim would contradict the president who has insisted the decision to delay the aid was rooted in concerns about corruption, not politics, the news about his book sharply intensified Democrats' demand that he be called to testify.
So who is the man who Democrats say could provide "explosive" information in the impeachment trial?
A fierce and fiery hawk Bolton, 71, is a Yale graduate, lawyer and diplomat who served as President George W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations. He has long advocated an aggressive U.S. foreign policy and the use of American military might, including the right to strike first against potential threats. He was a strong proponent of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and still believes toppling Saddam Hussein was the right move, despite the failure to find weapons of mass destruction and the costly occupation.
After leaving the Bush administration, Bolton espoused his hawkish views as a columnist and Fox News commentator. In that role, he called for preemptive military action against Iran and North Korea. In 2015, he wrote an op-ed that ran in The New York Times titled, "To stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran." And in a 2018 piece in The Wall Street Journal that ran just before he was tapped to become Trump's next national security adviser, he argued it was "perfectly legitimate" for the U.S. to strike North Korea first to take out the threat posed by its nuclear weapons.
He also founded the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC, which aimed to make national security concerns an election issue.
Clashes with Trump on foreign policy Bolton was tapped to replace outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster in March 2018. And from the beginning, the hawkish Bolton clashed with Trump, who sought to disengage the U.S. from military conflicts rather than beginning new ones.
The president and his national security adviser disagreed on a number of key issues, including peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan, withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria and negotiations with North Korea. He also wanted Trump to take more aggressive action against Iran and Venezuela.
Trump said he fired Bolton on Sept. 10 because he "disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions."
But minutes later, Bolton tweeted that he had offered his resignation the night before and Trump had told him, "Let's talk about it tomorrow." And he texted several journalists saying, "Let's be clear I resigned."
Washington Post reporter Robert Costa said Bolton told him, "I will have my say in due course. But I have given you the facts on the resignation. My sole concern is US national security."
After he failed to appear for the House impeachment inquiry in November, Bolton said he would not honor a subpoena unless he was ordered to by a court. Democrats said they did not want to mire the process in a lengthy legal battle and decided not to subpoena him, even after former aides testified he had decried the alleged attempt to leverage military aid to Ukraine as a "drug deal."

Bolton manuscript offers different account of Johnson meeting with Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – As Senate Republican Ron Johnson of Wisconsin sits through the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, his role as a witness to key events is back in the spotlight.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Johnson's name is mentioned in an unpublished book manuscript written by former White House national security adviser John Bolton.
The headline revelation in the Times report is that according to Bolton, Trump sought to freeze military aid to Ukraine until that country investigated Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Trump and his legal team have denied that withholding the aid had anything to do with seeking investigations of the president's political opponents.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet early Monday.
The Times also offered a new twist on a previously reported May 23, 2019, meeting with President Trump attended by American envoys and Johnson, who were reporting back on their recent trip toKyiv for the inauguration of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The Times reported that at that meeting, Trump "railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Mr. Bolton."
Johnson, a member of the Senate foreign relations committee who has been closely involved in Ukraine affairs, has given a different account of that meeting.
Asked for comment on the story about the Bolton manuscript, a Johnson aide referred the Journal Sentinel to a statement issued by the senator's office last October, which stated:
"Senator Johnson does not recall in any meeting or discussion with the president, or any member of the administration, that the term 'quid pro quo' was ever used. Nor does he recall any discussion of any specific case of corruption in the 2016 election, such as Crowdstrike, the hack of the DNC servers, Hillary Clinton campaign involvement, or Hunter and Joe Biden, during general discussions of corruption, which is endemic throughout Ukraine."
In portraying the president as telling Bolton that he was linking Ukraine aid to investigations of Democrats, the Times account of the Bolton book also presents a sharp contrast with how Johnson has described his own conversations with the president around the same time last summer. Johnson said the president vehemently denied to him linking aid to investigations by Ukraine.
At a press conference Monday, Wisconsin's Tammy Baldwin and other Senate Democrats noted the discrepancy. Baldwin said the Bolton account supports what diplomat Gordon Sondland told Johnson last summer, when Sondland reported a link between aid and investigations that could benefit Trump politically.
But it contradicts the flat denial that the president gave to Johnson in a phone call a short while later, according to Johnson's account of their conversation.
"It is my hope that my Republican friends in the Senate would want to have John Bolton testify so that he is under oath and so that we have all the facts," Baldwin said. "It is my hope that my Republican friends would want to know if there is evidence that the president did not tell one of my colleagues the truth. The people of Wisconsin certainly want to know if the president did not tell Sen. Johnson the truth."
Johnson has been an outspoken defender of the president in the impeachment fight, even though he said he disagreed with Trump's decision to withhold the military aid.
The Wisconsin Republican has portrayed the decision to freeze the aid as one that was based on the president's understandable concerns about general corruption in Ukraine.
In a written Nov. 18 account to House Republicans of his firsthand knowledge of events and his communications with Trump, Johnson said Trump's concerns about the aid involved both corruption and Europe's failure to pay its fair share in helping Ukraine.
But Johnson has also gone beyond that in interviews, saying the president's concerns included not just corruption in general but Trump's own conviction that Ukraine played a role in tarnishing him during the 2016 campaign.
"It was corruption overall, generalized, but yeah, no doubt about it, (it was) 'What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?'" Johnson told the Journal Sentinel last fall, recounting the reasons Trump gave him in an August phone call for not releasing the Ukraine aid.
In a November interview, Johnson defended Trump's interest in digging into the 2016 election.
"I understand that the people on the other side of this equation see (Trump's) desire to get out the truth of 2016, and they say he's trying to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel. "I look at that and say he wants to know, 'How did this false narrative about my campaign colluding with Russia, how did all that begin?' And there are certainly rumors that maybe some of that came out of Ukraine."
The idea that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election on behalf of Democrats has been rejected by numerous U.S. officials, including some who testified in the House impeachment inquiry who say that theory has been promoted by Russia to divert attention from its own election meddling.
According to the new account in the New York Times of the Bolton book draft, Trump complained in the May 2019 meeting attended by Johnson that Ukraine had tried to damage him and mentioned "a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server."
Johnson has said he does not believe there is a DNC server in Ukraine. But he has promoted the idea that Ukraine played a role in damaging Trump during the 2016 election.
"The press likes saying it's all been debunked," Johnson told the Journal Sentinel in November, referring to claims that Ukraine meddled in that election. "The server has been debunked, but so many questions remain unanswered."
The report about the Bolton manuscript has provoked denials from Trump and his defense team as well as mounting calls by Democrats to call Bolton as a witness. Senators are expected to vote in the coming days on whether to hear witnesses, a step that most Republicans are expected to oppose.
Asked if Johnson thinks Bolton should be called to testify, a Johnson spokesman said, "the senator will make a decision on the need for further witnesses after both sides have made their initial arguments before the Senate."
Journal Sentinel reporter Patrick Marley contributed to this report.

Did stocks tumble Monday on news that the much-feared new coronavirus has already killed more than 80 people in China? Or were investors fearful of the possible unleashing of new damaging details in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump?
Take your pick. Wall Street could very well see wild swings in the days ahead regarding developments in both of these major news stories.
The reality is that we've had quite a run up in stock prices, as the Dow broke one record after another in recent weeks. The Dow reached a record 29,348.10 points on Jan. 17. Any sudden turns or threats along the way here could drive some pullback in stock prices at the very least.
A worse-than-expected turn or shock would create more lasting damage.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 500 points in morning trading and closed at 28,535.80 points on Monday, down 453.93 points or 1.57%.
Michigan has its eye on both of the big headlines.
Michigan is a battleground state for the Trump reelection bid in 2020. On Thursday, Trump will head to Dana Inc., an auto parts supplier in Warren, to talk up the U.S. Mexico Canada Trade Agreement.
This week, Trump's team is out to both downplay the ongoing impeachment trial and an exclusive New York Times report published Monday detailing a claim by former National Security Adviser John Bolton that Trump explicitly linked a freeze on $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine to an investigation of Democrats, including presidential hopeful and former Vice President Joe Biden.
According to the New York Times, an unpublished manuscript by Bolton "presents an outline of what Mr. Bolton might testify to if he is called as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial."
Wall Street in general has favored many of the economic and tax policies initiated by the Trump administration. Business leaders and owners are far more skeptical and wary for the most part about political promises by Democratic hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders to undo Trump tax cuts among other changes.
Michigan's auto industry must keep its eye on the spread of coronavirus, too, given its interest and manufacturing operations in China.
David Whiston, equity strategist tracking U.S. Autos for Morningstar Research Services, said it's difficult to predict the exact impact of the coronavirus on the auto industry because no one knows how long the epidemic will last.
"Any automaker with meaningful China results will take a hit and GM is one of the biggest firms in the market," Whiston said.
"Ford is trying to turn around its China operations so this does not help either."
Whiston noted that the spread of the virus has been happening during the Chinese New Year, when consumers may not be normally buying vehicles in large volume anyway.
"As long as this does not last many months, a sell-off in the stocks is a buying opportunity in my opinion," Whiston said.
Wall Street recognized the risks that GM has in China, and drove GM's stock price down Monday more than Ford.
General Motors stock closed Monday at $33.41 a share, down 90 cents or 2.62%.
Ford stock closed Monday at $8.89 a share, down 11 cents or 1.22%.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles close at $13.07 a share, down 28 cents or 2.1%.
Many market watchers aren't expecting the U.S. economy to take a significant hit as a result of the impeachment hearings — since the GOP controls the Senate — or the coronavirus.
Robert Bilkie, CEO of Sigma Investment Counselors in Northville, said he would look for continued weakness in stock prices as the two situations unfold but in general he views downturns in stock prices at this point as buying opportunities.
Again, though, much will depend on the potential twists ahead.
"Stock investors are nervous about the coronavirus because of the considerable uncertainty over how broadly across the globe it will spread, and how disruptive it will be to the fragile Chinese economy where the virus is already a problem," said Moody's economist Mark Zandi.
Stock prices have had a strong run-up since Trump called a truce in his trade war with China. The theory is that the Chinese economy would be less vulnerable and could rebound.
"The coronavirus threatens to undermine any revival in the Chinese and global economies," Zandi said.
Investors also may react negatively to such news as the coronavirus because stocks have been exceptionally strong of late.
"Stock prices reflect nothing but good news, and the coronavirus is bad news," Zandi said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's legal defense team on Monday argued that the Senate should acquit because the impeachment articles lack legitimacy after the House tore up their long-standing procedures and dismissed the president's executive privilege.
But missing from the lengthy lectures on the history of impeachment; detailed accountings of evidence House managers failed to disclose; and a focus on Hunter Biden's lucrative post at Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, was the talk of the Capitol: John Bolton's forthcoming book.
Over the entire session, only one of Trump lawyers mentioned the bombshell New York Times report in which the former national security adviser wrote that Trump told him he wanted to withhold security aid to Ukraine until it announced investigations into the Bidens.
Asked by reporters about the Bolton report as they streamed into the Senate chamber for the 1 p.m. trial, many Republicans dodged the questions or dismissed the significance of the former security adviser's account - except for four or five senators that Democrats hope will vote to call witnesses later this week.
Meanwhile, House Democrats sent out a steady stream of refutations of the Trump defense team's case.
Here are highlights from the Senate impeachment trial on Monday.     
'Runaway House'
To knock down the articles of impeachment, Trump's defense turned to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment and acquittal of President Bill Clinton. Starr, who called impeachment "hell," argued that House Democrats failed on abuse of power charges by citing no specific crime. "Will law professors agree with this? No. But with all due respect this is not an academic gathering. You are in court," Starr said. And the obstruction charge failed because House Democrats conducted an unprecedented and illegitimate impeachment inquiry, choosing to "tear asunder their procedures" and to "toss out their own rule book," Starr said. "Here we have tragically for the country ... in Article II of these impeachment articles a runaway House. It is a runaway not only from its long-standing procedures, it is a runaway from the Constitution's demand of fundamental fairness."
Focus on Hunter Biden
Trump's defense team spent two hours arguing that Trump had a good reason to be concerned about then Vice President Joe Biden's forcing out a Ukrainian prosecutor general who had probed Burisma, which gave Biden's son Hunter a lucrative post. Trump lawyer Pam Bondi laid out the news reporting and actions by the United Kingdom and U.S. State Department officials about the appearance of a conflict. Trump lawyer Eric D. Herschmann questioned the fact that Biden was following the policy of the United States and its western allies. "From 2014 to 2017, Vice President Biden claimed to be on a crusade against corruption in the Ukraine," Herschmann said. "But during this whole time what else was happening? His son and his business partner were raking in over $1 million a year for what was regarded as one of the most corrupt Ukrainian companies in the energy sector, owned and controlled by one of the most corrupt oligarchs."  
Dershowitz: Bolton Revelation Irrelevant
The only Trump attorney to mention the Bolton report was Alan Dershowitz, the retired Harvard law professor. "Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense," Dershowitz declared. "You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words like quid pro quo and personal benefits." Dershowitz said that's because the articles of impeachment use standardless and vague terms - "abuse of power" and "obstruction of justice" - instead of actual crimes. That is a position he acknowledged is contrary to the academic consensus that he also took during the Clinton impeachment. But he insisted, "My switch  in attitude  is purely academic and purely nonpartisan."
Defense: Giuliani a bit player
The Trump defense team sought to downplay the role of Rudy Giuliani - the private lawyer Trump referred his diplomats to about Ukraine and urged that nation's president to talk to. And Giuliani has publicly urged Ukraine to investigate the 2016 U.S. election and the Bidens. But Trump lawyer Jane Raskin downplayed Giuliani's role. "So yes, Mayor Giuliani was President Trump's personal attorney, but he was not on a political errand," she said. "He was gathering evidence regarding Ukrainian election interference to defend his client against the false allegations being investigated by special counsel [Robert] Mueller." Raskin questioned why House managers didn't call him as a witness and conclud

U.S. News: Trump and Team Turn Quickly on His Former Aide

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House on Monday took to television, social media and email to discredit accusations from former national security adviser John Bolton that threatened its defense of President Trump. But inside the Senate chamber, where the president's team was making the official case for why he should remain in office, there was scant mention of Mr. Bolton -- or his book.
The double-barreled strategy underscored the challenge facing Mr. Trump's impeachment team of satisfying both a jury of senators -- who are days away from deciding whether to hear from more witnesses, including Mr. Bolton -- and the broader electorate, which will decide in 10 months whether Republicans deserve to keep control of the Senate and whether Mr. Trump merits a second four-year term.
Just after 7:30 a.m., the president directed his Twitter followers to a post that referred to Mr. Bolton as a "rejected neocon." A few minutes later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham was on Fox News suggesting that Mr. Bolton was only trying to make a buck. By noon, the White House rapid-response team had urged Trump supporters via email to defend the president by insisting that none of the reporting in Mr. Bolton's book threatened their defense.
On the Senate floor Monday afternoon and evening, Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's impeachment lawyers told senators the Trump team would focus only on evidence that was already part of the case. "We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all," Mr. Sekulow said,
On Sunday evening, the New York Times reported details of a forthcoming book by Mr. Bolton, a draft of which had been provided to the National Security Council in December for a review of classified information. Mr. Bolton's lawyer confirmed that in the manuscript, Mr. Bolton wrote that the president told him he wanted to freeze foreign aid to Ukraine until the country aided investigations into Democrats.
Mr. Trump denied the conversation ever happened and tweeted: "If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
Details of Mr. Bolton's book caught the White House off-guard, as aides scrambled to piece together what had happened and how to respond. There was no official response for hours.
White House officials said they heard from senators and their aides throughout Sunday evening about Mr. Bolton's book, many of them inquiring how long the White House had known what it alleged.
News of the book left some inside the White House deflated. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump's legal team had been in good spirits about the state of the case and was considering wrapping up arguments a day earlier than expected, according to a person familiar with the team's discussions.
"You know, our team just went on Saturday and in two hours undid all of the hours and hours in 24 hours that the Dems did in the Senate trial," Ms. Grisham told "Fox & Friends" on Monday. "And then suddenly this manuscript has magically appeared in the hands of the New York Times making very, very big claims."
Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, said neither he nor his client were behind the leak. On Sunday, he suggested the NSC was responsible. NSC spokesman John Ullyot said that the draft was under "initial review" and that no White House personnel outside the NSC had reviewed the manuscript.
Mr. Bolton's literary team held an emergency conference call Sunday to discuss the possibility that the book had leaked, people familiar with the matter said. After the Times report, the publisher, Simon & Schuster, decided to announce the book, and posted a link on Amazon, the people said.
The rapid turn on Mr. Bolton, a longtime fixture in conservative circles who spent more than a decade as a Fox News contributor, was a reminder of how officials have struggled to leave administration posts unscathed.
The about-face wasn't lost on Brian Kilmeade, a host of "Fox & Friends," one of the president's favorite shows. While interviewing Ms. Grisham, he began to say, "John Bolton, who's a contributor here and has always been upstanding and very candid, if nothing else, and honest . . ." before being interrupted by co-host Steve Doocy.
"Was," Mr. Doocy corrected him. "Was a contributor."

Main Street: Mitch Derangement Syndrome

Texto completo: Forget Iowa and New Hampshire. On the same day President Trump's legal team began its impeachment defense in the Senate, "Saturday Night Live" offered an insight into the Democratic mood: There's a new villain in town, and his name is Mitch McConnell.
This weekend's show opened with a skit showing the Senate majority leader on a visit to hell along with Trump defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who confers with Satan about strategy. In case the message wasn't clear, later in the show the "Weekend Update" segment flashed Mr. McConnell's photo as the mock news announcer says: "Mitch McConnell, seen here calmly watching an orphanage burn. . ." Subtle.
"Saturday Night Live" is easy to dismiss. But its approach to Mr. McConnell has been copied by supposedly serious people, such as Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame. He's coined a popular new hashtag -- #MidnightMitch -- to characterize Mr. McConnell's role in "a coverup." On Twitter #MidnightMitch has been gleefully picked up by everyone from Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe to Star Trek helmsman George Takei.
"Midnight Mitch" is only the latest in a long line of derogatory nicknames. Earlier examples range from "Cocaine Mitch" to "Moscow Mitch," and are all intended to paint Mr. McConnell as evil. But because they all stem from his opponents' frustration at his successes -- Democrats still can't forgive him for quietly killing Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court -- the real effect is to present Mr. McConnell as some sort of evil genius.
This week will put him to a test. As the weekend opened, it looked as if the Senate's impeachment trial would be wrapped up by this Friday. But on Sunday the New York Times dropped a leak from a forthcoming book by John Bolton, in which the former national security adviser says the president told him he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine until it launched an investigation into possible corruption involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Trump tweeted that he never told Mr. Bolton any such thing. But coming from one of the president's former top advisers, the news makes it harder for Republicans already feeling squeezed to vote against hearing from Mr. Bolton, which will be cast as a vote against learning truth. As a lunch Monday, Mr. McConnell reminded them they don't have to make their decision for a few days.
Now, the issue is more complicated than simply putting Mr. Bolton on the stand. The White House says it will invoke executive privilege, which would tie the trial up in the courts. If Mr. Bolton testifies, Republicans would insist on calling Hunter Biden, or Joe Biden, or maybe Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration aide who raised questions with Mr. Biden about his son's Ukrainian gig.
Which means that the vote on witnesses is also a vote for a much longer trial. How many Senate Democrats -- especially those running for president -- want that?
The irony is that if the Democratic House managers had aimed their impeachment argument at bringing a handful of Republicans moderates to their side, they'd be in a better position now to pressure Mr. McConnell. Instead, they played to a Democratic base that already agreed with them, in the process offending some of those they would need to persuade with talk of how President Trump would have their "heads on pikes" if they were to go against him (Adam Schiff) and how the president is a "dictator" (Jerry Nadler).
Then again, the choice of Mr. Schiff to lead the impeachment was guaranteed to polarize in a Republican Senate. Yet the choice was Nancy Pelosi's.
Less than a year ago, the speaker had declared that "impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country." Then, with her approval, the House impeached Mr. Trump without a single Republican vote.
Perhaps Mrs. Pelosi was simply bowing to the reality that impeachment was what her caucus wanted. But that raises the question why, despite her inability to hold her line, the press treats her as some Machiavellian virtuoso. Meanwhile, Mr. McConnell, who gets few favorable profiles, continues to stymie Mrs. Pelosi by letting much of the legislation she sends over die of neglect, leading her to lash out at what she's called his "Grim Reaper role." In their most recent clash, he clearly bested the speaker when he ended up proceeding with Mr. Trump's trial without any concessions after she made a show of holding back the articles of impeachment.
The Bolton news may force Mr. McConnell to compromise when he prefers to call no witnesses. But it won't change the trial's outcome.
Democrats know that, even as they continue to thump for witnesses. They do so not because they expect Mr. Bolton's testimony to produce the 20 Republican votes needed for conviction but to prepare the party line for when Mr. Trump is acquitted: We wuz robbed by Midnight Mitch and his Trump coverup.
It may be the best of a bad hand. But sneering hashtags, "Saturday Night Live" skits and accusations of coverup only underscore what's really bothering them: that Mr. McConnell somehow always seems to outfox them.

Texto completo: After another flare-up of public protests, the Iranian establishment is working to mend internal rifts that have broken into the open as it faces greater pressure than at any point since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Faced with popular anger over the Iranian military's initial attempt to conceal its accidental Jan. 8 downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet, the government publicly blamed the armed forces for withholding information about the crash for three days. The incident occurred as Iran's air defenses were on high alert hours after an Iranian missile attack on bases in Iraq housing American forces in retaliation for the U.S. killing Jan. 3 of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.
President Hassan Rouhani even threatened to resign if the armed forces didn't take responsibility for shooting down the plane, according to a Western diplomat and an adviser to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Mr. Rouhani's threat to resign was earlier reported in the New York Times.
After a recent Friday prayer led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, broadcast on state television, Mr. Rouhani was caught on camera getting up to leave swiftly after the sermon, a hasty departure many Iranians saw as a sign of disrespect. Before Mr. Khamenei's sermon, a speaker at the mosque had openly accused Mr. Rouhani's government of abetting corruption in Iran.
The public disagreements are small but unusually visible cracks in what has long been an abiding overall unity among factions of the Iranian establishment.
They come amid the Trump administration's campaign of maximum pressure and with parliamentary elections looming next month.
Before the downing of the jet, that policy, a sanctions regime designed to bring Iran to heel, had made Tehran only more assertive and pushed the Iranian leadership to close ranks. Despite popular anger, and even unrest, the establishment knows that, as long as it remains united, the Islamic Republic will likely survive, many experts say, so it will work hard to stay unified.
"Elite fragmentation collapses states; social movements don't," said Kevan Harris, a historical sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Iran has hardened its military posture in response to U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing it to roll back its military footprint in the Middle East. It has doubled down on its support for regional armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. It seized a British tanker in the Persian Gulf, shot down an American drone and, according to the U.S., sabotaged tankers in the Gulf of Oman and conducted a damaging attack on Saudi oil facilities.
Iran has gradually stepped back from its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal -- after the U.S. withdrew in 2018 -- in an attempt to pressure the remaining parties to the accord, specifically France, Germany and the U.K., to provide relief from sanctions.
Some experts say further U.S. pressure will harden the Iranian system's resolve against negotiating a new deal, particularly as Mr. Rouhani's political wiggle room has shrunk as the nuclear deal has edged ever closer to complete breakdown.
"The near-collapse of the nuclear deal and growing threats from the U.S. have vindicated Supreme Leader's narrative that Washington could not be trusted," said Hossein Mousavian, who served in Iranian governments for decades, including as a nuclear negotiator, and is now a visiting scholar at Princeton University.
A renewed surge by hard-liners in Iranian politics will likely come next month as Iranians head to the polls to vote Feb. 21 for members of a new parliament.
To help consolidate conservative forces, the Guardian Council, which vets all candidates and is itself effectively approved by Mr. Khamenei, has already disqualified a large number of reformists and moderates, some of whom serve in the parliament.

Texto completo: A leak from a forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton is scrambling the equation in the impeachment trial of President Trump. But if you really want to know why Mr. Bolton represents such a wild card in this process, it is instructive to look back at the title of a previous book.
"Surrender Is Not an Option" is a book Mr. Bolton wrote in 2008, after serving in the George W. Bush administration. That title aptly describes Mr. Bolton's attitude in his long career in government service and the public eye, in which he has been unafraid of making enemies, willing to take unpopular stands and prepared to fall on his sword over his principles.
President Trump's supporters have long known Mr. Bolton represented the X factor in their push to get a quick acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial over charges the president abused power by coercing Ukraine to open investigations of Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Bolton was inside the White House when the Ukraine maneuvering took place, then left on unhappy terms and made clear along the way he disagreed with how the president handled Ukraine.
The fears in Trump land materialized late Sunday, when the New York Times first reported that the manuscript of a Bolton memoir says the president told Mr. Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold congressionally appropriated military aid for Ukraine until the Ukrainian government helped with investigations of the Bidens.
Mr. Trump promptly denied the assertion. Still, in constructing their defense, the president's supporters have essentially tried to have it both ways in the Ukraine case: They have insisted there was no quid pro quo demand for Biden investigations made while withholding aid from Ukraine, and that it would be entirely proper even if there were. The Trump defense now may feel compelled to lean on the latter argument.
Perhaps more important, the Bolton revelation may compel a few Republican senators to decide that they should hear testimony from the former national security adviser and others before moving to final judgment. That is what the Trump team has been trying hard to avoid; witness testimony would extend the trial and open the door for unpleasant surprises.
Mr. Bolton himself is a potential problem for the president on several fronts. First, he has never been one to back away from controversy, or to be intimidated. In that 2008 book, he wrote simply: "For myself, in or out of government, I have no intention of leaving the firing line."
He is no disgruntled moderate, but rather a man with long standing in the ranks of Republican conservatives. The son of a Baltimore firefighter, he began his life in politics as a supporter of Sen. Barry Goldwater's 1964 conservative presidential candidacy. Later, he publicly lectured liberal classmates during graduation ceremonies at Yale University.
He earned a law degree and worked in the Reagan administration and both Bush administrations, gaining a reputation as an anti-Soviet hawk. Mr. Bolton has dismissed those trying to label him a "neoconservative," insisting he was just a conservative, period.
His reputation among Democrats -- the same Democrats now so eager to hear him testify in the Trump impeachment trial -- was so toxic that President George W. Bush had to slip him into place as the American ambassador to the United Nations while Congress was in recess, because the prospects of his winning Senate confirmation were so dim.
Ironically, Mr. Bolton was controversial precisely because he felt the same disdain for the foreign-policy establishment that Mr. Trump displays. In his book, he writes of a Trump-like distaste for the European Union, calling its approach to global affairs "ever more globalist, statist, bureaucratic, legalistic, and passive (and far too often pacifist), an approach that many on the American left would be delighted to adopt for our country as well."
And he has long openly attacked the State Department bureaucracy, describing it in terms much like those Trump supporters used in criticizing foreign-service officers who testified in impeachment hearings. Mr. Bolton wrote that, at the State Department, "too much of the permanent bureaucracy thinks it is responsible not just for implementing policy, but for setting it, no matter what the president of the moment thinks, certainly not if that president is Republican."
On policy toward Russia and North Korea, Mr. Bolton found his hard-line views at odds with President Trump's. His belief that the U.S. needed to keep up pressure on Moscow by opening the spigots for military aid to Ukraine compelled him to disagree with Mr. Trump's approach.
Now, Mr. Bolton's broader credibility with conservatives, and his career-long tendency to speak his mind no matter what, mean he represents a migraine-headache-in-the-making for the White House.

Texto completo: The report that John Bolton's book draft implicates President Trump more closely to ordering a delay in military aid to Ukraine is hardly a surprise and won't -- and shouldn't -- change the impeachment result. It does, however, complicate the trial task for Republican Senators, and our advice is for Mr. Trump's former national security adviser to tell the public now what he says in his book.
Mr. Trump and his media acolytes are calling Mr. Bolton a mercenary who is merely trying to sell books. Mr. Bolton and his publisher deny it, and there is no evidence beyond assertion to contradict their denial.
Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Chuck Cooper, says he submitted the draft of his client's memoir to the White House for security-clearance screening on Dec. 30. Yet the New York Times account of what the book says about Mr. Trump and Ukraine appears a month later -- on the eve of the Senate vote on witnesses. The timing is Kavanaugh-esque.
Whoever leaked the book's contents wants to use Mr. Bolton to turn the Senate impeachment trial into a larger political drama. But we've known Mr. Bolton long enough to doubt that he'd want to sandbag Republican Senators or the President he worked for. He's a straight-shooter, even if he sometimes aims right between the eyes.
The New York Times's story contains no "bombshells," notwithstanding the media hype. Anyone paying attention, or who has read Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson's Nov. 18 letter to House Members, knows that Mr. Trump mistrusted Ukraine and considered cutting off aid. Anyone who read the rough transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's President knows he wanted an investigation of Hunter and Joe Biden. All Mr. Bolton reportedly adds is news of a conversation in which Mr. Trump made a direct connection between the two that nearly everyone already assumed.
This still isn't close to a high crime or misdemeanor. Mr. Trump's reckless judgment was resisted by his staff and Senators like Mr. Johnson, and the President eventually changed his mind. Ukraine never opened an investigation, the U.S. aid was delivered on time, and Mr. Trump met with Ukraine's President in New York. There was no crime, and Mr. Trump's military support for Ukraine continues to be far more robust than Barack Obama's.
Yet the release of the book's contents puts GOP Senators in a tough political spot. Democrats and the impeachment press say the news is more cause to call Mr. Bolton as a trial witness. Minority leader Chuck Schumer, the never-understated one, said Monday that Republicans who refuse will be engaging in a "coverup."
The Democratic leader doesn't want witnesses any more than Republicans do -- certainly not if one is Hunter Biden. What he wants is for Republicans to do the dirty work of voting down witnesses so he can shout coverup from here to November. The problem for GOP Senators is they have to take the vote on witnesses without knowing what Mr. Bolton might say. If he incriminates Mr. Trump after the trial ends, it could hurt GOP chances of holding the Senate majority this year.
If you want to know what a Trump second term would be like without a GOP House or Senate, think Richard Nixon in 1974. No good judges confirmed, no legislation except on liberal terms, relentless investigation and harassment. The best people remaining would leave the Administration, and the GOP would be set up for a wipeout in 2022 and 2024.
With the news of what's in the book already public, Mr. Bolton can help everyone, including himself, by erasing any doubt about what he knows. He can tell the American public what he wrote -- now, before the Senate votes on witnesses. Lay it all out. Put to rest the "coverup" talking point.
This doesn't require testifying to the Senate. Mr. Bolton could do it in a public statement, a TV interview, or an op-ed in this publication. Our editors are standing by.

Texto completo: When a helicopter crashed in the foggy hills of Southern California on Sunday with basketball star Kobe Bryant on board, the tragedy inspired fans across the country to pay tribute.
They flocked as close as they could get to the smoldering crash site near Calabasas, wearing Los Angeles Lakers gear and with basketballs in hand. They built a shrine of candles and flowers outside Staples Center in Los Angeles, and they brought jerseys to lay outside the gymnasium named for Bryant at his high school outside Philadelphia.
But as the details of the crash became public -- including the news that nine people on board had died -- communities in Southern California began grieving in quieter ways for all of the lives that had also been cut short by the crash.
Authorities have not publicly identified the victims, but family and friends shared their grief in public announcements and posts on social media. The victims included a baseball coach, a pilot, and teenage girls and their parents.
Amid grief for one of the world's best-known athletes, loved ones urged the world to remember the other lives that were "just as important."

Kobe and Gianna Bryant
Kobe Bryant was on his way to coach his daughter's basketball game
Bryant, the retired Lakers basketball star, died in the helicopter crash, along with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna.
The helicopter was on its way from Orange County, where the Bryant family lives, to Bryant's youth basketball academy northwest of Los Angeles.
Bryant, 41, retired in 2016 with five NBA championship rings. He gave himself the nickname the Black Mamba and was known for taking helicopter rides to games at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles to avoid traffic and maximize time at home.
On Sunday, Bryant was on his way to his academy to coach Gianna, the second-oldest of his four daughters with his wife, Vanessa.
Gianna, who went by the nickname "Gigi," was a budding basketball star in her own right and was "hellbent" on playing for the University of Connecticut, and one day, in the WNBA, her father told The Los Angeles Times last year.

John, Keri and Alyssa Altobelli
A college baseball coach died, along with his wife and daughter
John Altobelli, 56, a longtime baseball coach at Orange Coast College, a junior college in Costa Mesa, was among those who died in the crash.
"He truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach," the college's athletic director, Jason Kehler, said in a statement. "The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none -- he treated them like family."
Altobelli's wife, Keri, and daughter Alyssa also died in the crash, the college confirmed. Alyssa played on the same club team as Gianna Bryant, The Los Angeles Times reported.

Sarah and Payton Chester
A mother and daughter were remembered as 'full of mischief and laughter'
Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter who lived in Orange County, also died in the crash, family and friends said.
Todd Schmidt, the principal of the elementary school that Payton had attended in Corona del Mar, confirmed the deaths on Facebook.
The Chesters, he said, were among the "amazing families" at the school: "engaged, supportive, encouraging, and full of mischief and laughter."
"While the world mourns the loss of a dynamic athlete and humanitarian, I mourn the loss of two people just as important," he wrote. "Their impact was just as meaningful, their loss will be just as keenly felt, and our hearts are just as broken."
On Instagram, Riley Chester said he had lost "the most amazing Mother and sister." He posted a series of photographs as a tribute, including one that showed his sister at a basketball gym, smiling and laughing with Bryant.

Christina Mauser
A basketball coach who was a 'beautiful wife and mom' was also killed
Christina Mauser had been a basketball coach and physical education teacher at Harbor Day School in Corona del Mar and had coached Gianna Bryant to a school championship in the fall of 2017.
Her husband, Matthew Mauser, who was also a coach of that team, confirmed her death.
"She was incredibly witty -- funny like nobody you've ever met," Mauser, who used to teach at the school and is a singer in a band, said on the "Today" show Monday.
He said Bryant had hired Mauser to coach for a basketball team at his Mamba Academy and called her the "Mother of Defense" because she was so good at teaching zone defense to the eighth-grade players.
Mauser said he had cuddled in bed with his children as they grieved, and that his 11-year-old daughter had said it was comforting to know that other people were mourning as well.
"We watched 'SportsCenter' for two seconds and everything was about how much everybody was mourning and hurting, and she said it was nice to know that everybody was hurting along with us," he said. "And I know that sounds odd, but it still kind of helps."
The Mausers coached the Harbor Day School eighth-grade girls basketball team when it won its first championship in the fall of 2017, according to issues of Beacon, a biannual magazine run by the school. Gianna Bryant was one of two sixth graders on the team who were playing at a level two years ahead of their class, according to the publication.
Mauser had served as a coach, physical education teacher and eighth-grade adviser for 11 years at the school, according to an announcement in the summer 2018 edition of Beacon that said she and her husband were leaving the school.

Ara Zobayan
A pilot on board had at least 20 years of experience
Ara Zobayan, a pilot, was also among those who died in the crash, according to friends and colleagues.
Zobayan, of Huntington Beach, was a commercial helicopter pilot and certified flight instructor, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. He had been flying aircraft in Southern California for 20 years, records showed. He worked as a helicopter instructor for Group 3 Aviation in Van Nuys, and the company has posted photos of numerous students he has trained to fly helicopters over the years.
One of Zobayan's flight students, Darren Kemp, told The Los Angeles Times that his teacher had been Bryant's private pilot.
"He doesn't let anyone else fly him around but Ara," he said.
As the news spread, friends and fellow pilots posted tributes online. One post by a friend, from a fellow pilot's birthday celebration, showed a group of men, their arms around one another, with Zobayan smiling and dressed up in a collared shirt and tie.
"Who ever would've thought that would be our final beer together," the friend wrote.

Texto completo: Simmons doc at Sundance: Without Oprah or Apple, the Russell Simmons documentary "On the Record" went ahead with its premiere Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival, where the women who came forward with sexual assault allegations against the hip-hop mogul received one of the festival's most roaring receptions. The lead-up to Sundance was especially rocky for "On the Record." Oprah Winfrey, an executive producer, on Jan. 10 withdrew from the film because she felt it needed more reporting. Her exit, which stunned the directors, Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, also meant "On the Record" no longer had a distributor in Apple TV Plus. The documentary is centered on the story of Drew Dixon, a former music executive for Def Jam Recordings, the record label co-founded by Simmons. It chronicles her decision to come forward and go on the record in a 2017 New York Times article, along with numerous other women, in accusing Simmons of harassment and rape.

Texto completo: Are there Las Vegas odds yet on whether former national security adviser John Bolton reveals more in his book than he will in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial?
On Monday, Amazon revealed that Bolton's account of his time in the White House will be published March 17. People who saw drafts of the book told The New York Times that it includes at least one impeachment-related bombshell: Bolton's claim that Trump said he wanted crucial military aid to Ukraine held until the country's new leaders had agreed to open two investigations seen as helpful to Trump's reelection campaign.
The Senate is expected to be done with its quick-and-dirty review of L'Affaire Ukraine well before March 17 -- unless four or more Republicans agree with the Senate minority to call Bolton and other witnesses.
(A bipartisan trio of legal experts argued in The New York Times on Monday that the trial's presiding officer, Chief Justice John Roberts, could subpoena witnesses at the request of either side, and only a two-thirds majority vote could quash such a subpoena. Hmmm.)
Just getting Bolton to testify is only half the battle, though. Trump's team would almost certainly raise objections based on executive privilege, the Supreme Court-endorsed separation-of-powers principle that Congress should not be able to force the administration to reveal what the president and his top advisers discussed. Roberts would rule from the bench on any such motion, and if it's like any other ruling from the presiding officer, it could be overturned by a majority vote.
You could game this out in any number of head-spinning ways. Would a Republican who votes to compel Bolton to testify defy the GOP again to override executive privilege? That would certainly be an easier vote if Roberts ruled that it didn't apply in this circumstance. What are the chances Roberts would do that?
The problem for anyone opposed to hearing Bolton testify, though, is that they'll simply cede the narrative to whatever version Bolton tells in his book. Trump has already taken to Twitter to deny The New York Times' version, of course:
If it's a battle over whom the public will believe, do Republicans really want to bet on Trump?
The more that Senate Republicans outside the Trump orbit signal their willingness not just to call Bolton but also let him testify, the more likely it is that Republicans will pivot toward a different defense strategy: offsetting the impact of any Bolton testimony by summoning one or both of the Bidens. Although many Senate Democrats may recoil at the idea, they don't have the votes to block a unified GOP on that front.

FICO says tweaks to formula will alter scores

Texto completo: Your credit score -- that all-important passport within the financial world -- may be about to change. And it won't necessarily be because of anything you did or didn't do.
Fair Isaac Corp., the company that creates the widely used three-digit FICO score, is tweaking its formula. Consumers in good financial standing should see their scores bounce a bit higher.
But millions of people already in financial distress may experience a fall -- meaning they'll have more trouble getting loans or will pay more for them.
Lenders use FICO scores to judge how likely you are to make timely payments on your loans. But they're also used in lots of other ways and can influence how much you pay for car insurance to whether you'll qualify to rent a new apartment.
The changes don't alter the main ingredients of your score, but they do take a more finely tuned view of certain financial behaviors that indicate signs of financial weakness. For example, consumers who consolidate credit card debt into a personal loan and then run up the balance on their cards again will be judged more severely.
"The new scores reflect nuanced changes in consumer credit trends that we observed from our analysis of millions of credit files," said Dave Shellenberger, vice president of product management at FICO, whose scores range from 300 to 850 (the higher, the better).
FICO adjusts its scores every few years, drawing on consumer behavior and patterns that emerge from the vast trove of data it tracks. This time, the company is offering two new scores, FICO 10 and FICO 10 T, and both differ from the previous formula.
FICO says the new scores will make it easier for lenders to gauge a borrower's risk.
Some of the changes, like carrying a personal loan as well as credit-card debt, affect both new scores.

Off Senate Floor, Trump Team Targets Bolton's Credibility; White House is scrambling to respond to the former aide's book after being caught off guard by its revelations

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The White House on Monday took to television, social media and email to discredit accusations from former national security adviser John Bolton that threatened its defense of President Trump. But inside the Senate chamber, where the president's team was making the official case for why he should remain in office, there was scant mention of Mr. Bolton—or his book.
The double-barreled strategy underscored the challenge facing Mr. Trump's impeachment team of satisfying both a jury of senators—who are days away from deciding whether to end the trial or hear from more witnesses , including Mr. Bolton—and the broader electorate, which will decide in 10 months whether Republicans deserve to keep control of the Senate and whether Mr. Trump merits a second four-year term.
Just after 7:30 a.m., the president directed his Twitter followers to a post that referred to Mr. Bolton as a "rejected neocon." A few minutes later, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham was on Fox News suggesting that Mr. Bolton was only trying to make a buck. By noon, the White House rapid-response team had urged Trump supporters via email to defend the president by insisting that none of the reporting in Mr. Bolton's book threatened their defense.
On the Senate floor Monday afternoon and evening, Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's top impeachment lawyers, told senators that the Trump team would focus only on evidence that was already part of the case. "We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all," Mr. Sekulow said.
Alan Dershowitz, another member of the president's legal team, argued near the end of the day's session that even Mr. Bolton's allegations don't merit impeachment. "Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense," he said.
On Sunday evening, the New York Times reported details of a forthcoming book by Mr. Bolton, a draft of which had been provided to the National Security Council in December for a review of classified information. Mr. Bolton's lawyer confirmed that in the manuscript, Mr. Bolton wrote that the president told him in August that he wanted to freeze foreign aid to Ukraine until the country aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
Mr. Trump denied the conversation ever happened and tweeted, shortly after midnight on Sunday: "If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
Details of Mr. Bolton's book caught the White House off-guard, as aides scrambled late Sunday to piece together what had happened and how to respond. There was no official response for hours.
White House officials said they heard from concerned senators and their aides throughout Sunday evening about Mr. Bolton's book, many of them inquiring how long the White House had known what it alleged.
News of the book left some inside the White House deflated. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump's legal team had been in good spirits about the state of the case and was considering wrapping up arguments a day earlier than expected, according to a person familiar with the team's discussions.
"You know, our team just went on Saturday and in two hours undid all of the hours and hours in 24 hours that the Dems did in the Senate trial," Ms. Grisham told "Fox & Friends" on Monday. "And then suddenly this manuscript has magically appeared in the hands of the New York Times making very, very big claims."
Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, said neither he nor his client were behind the leak. On Sunday, he suggested the NSC was responsible. NSC spokesman John Ullyot on Monday said that the draft was under "initial review" and that no White House personnel outside the NSC had reviewed the manuscript.
Mr. Bolton's literary team held an emergency conference call at about 4:30 p.m. on Sunday to discuss the possibility that the book had leaked, people familiar with the matter said. After the Times report, the publisher, Simon & Schuster, decided to announce the book, and around 7:30 p.m., decided to post a link on Amazon, the people said.
It remains unclear who was aware of the accusations in the draft. John Eisenberg, the White House's top national security lawyer, was aware that the NSC had the manuscript but never saw it and wasn't told what it said, a person close to him said.
Following the president's lead, Trump advisers and allies spent Monday seeking to portray Mr. Bolton as a liar who had leaked the manuscript to boost sales of his book. They also described as suspicious the timing of when the book's details were posted on Amazon.com on Sunday evening, a few hours after the Times report.
"How convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon. What a joke," Republican National Committee rapid-response director Steve Guest wrote in an email.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Bolton said he, his publisher and his agent denied there was any coordination.
The rapid turn on Mr. Bolton, a longtime fixture in conservative circles who spent more than a decade as a Fox News contributor until he joined the Trump administration, was a striking reminder of how officials have struggled to leave Trump administration posts unscathed.
The about-face wasn't lost on Brian Kilmeade, a host of "Fox & Friends," one of the president's favorite shows. While interviewing Ms. Grisham, he began to say, "John Bolton, who's a contributor here and has always been upstanding and very candid, if nothing else, and honest…" before being interrupted by co-host Steve Doocy.
"Was," Mr. Doocy corrected him. "Was a contributor."

Texto completo: The report that John Bolton's book draft implicates President Trump more closely to ordering a delay in military aid to Ukraine is hardly a surprise and won't—and shouldn't—change the impeachment result. It does, however, complicate the trial task for Republican Senators, and our advice is for Mr. Trump's former national security adviser to tell the public now what he says in his book.
Mr. Trump and his media acolytes are calling Mr. Bolton a mercenary who is merely trying to sell books. Mr. Bolton and his publisher deny it, and there is no evidence beyond assertion to contradict their denial.
Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Chuck Cooper, says he submitted the draft of his client's memoir to the White House for security-clearance screening on Dec. 30. Yet the New York Times account of what the book says about Mr. Trump and Ukraine appears a month later—on the eve of the Senate vote on witnesses. The timing is Kavanaugh-esque.
Whoever leaked the book's contents wants to use Mr. Bolton to turn the Senate impeachment trial into a larger political drama. But we've known Mr. Bolton long enough to doubt that he'd want to sandbag Republican Senators or the President he worked for. He's a straight-shooter, even if he sometimes aims right between the eyes.
The New York Times's story contains no "bombshells," notwithstanding the media hype. Anyone paying attention, or who has read Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson's Nov. 18 letter to House Members, knows that Mr. Trump mistrusted Ukraine and considered cutting off aid. Anyone who read the rough transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's President knows he wanted an investigation of Hunter and Joe Biden. All Mr. Bolton reportedly adds is news of a conversation in which Mr. Trump made a direct connection between the two that nearly everyone already assumed.
This still isn't close to a high crime or misdemeanor. Mr. Trump's reckless judgment was resisted by his staff and Senators like Mr. Johnson, and the President eventually changed his mind. Ukraine never opened an investigation, the U.S. aid was delivered on time, and Mr. Trump met with Ukraine's President in New York. There was no crime, and Mr. Trump's military support for Ukraine continues to be far more robust than Barack Obama's.
Yet the release of the book's contents puts GOP Senators in a tough political spot. Democrats and the impeachment press say the news is more cause to call Mr. Bolton as a trial witness. Minority leader Chuck Schumer, the never-understated one, said Monday that Republicans who refuse will be engaging in a "coverup."
The Democratic leader doesn't want witnesses any more than Republicans do—certainly not if one is Hunter Biden. What he wants is for Republicans to do the dirty work of voting down witnesses so he can shout coverup from here to November. The problem for GOP Senators is they have to take the vote on witnesses without knowing what Mr. Bolton might say. If he incriminates Mr. Trump after the trial ends, it could hurt GOP chances of holding the Senate majority this year.
If you want to know what a Trump second term would be like without a GOP House or Senate, think Richard Nixon in 1974. No good judges confirmed, no legislation except on liberal terms, relentless investigation and harassment. The best people remaining would leave the Administration, and the GOP would be set up for a wipeout in 2022 and 2024.
With the news of what's in the book already public, Mr. Bolton can help everyone, including himself, by erasing any doubt about what he knows. He can tell the American public what he wrote—now, before the Senate votes on witnesses. Lay it all out. Put to rest the "coverup" talking point.
This doesn't require testifying to the Senate. Mr. Bolton could do it in a public statement, a TV interview, or an op-ed in this publication. Our editors are standing by.

To the Editor:
Re "Money to Ukraine Tied to Inquiries, Bolton Book Says" (front page, Jan. 27):
Your report of the contents of John Bolton's book is a game changer. The impeachment trial is not the same as a judicial trial in which jurors are instructed not to consider any information that has not been formally received in evidence. Therefore, senator-jurors are free to consider the Times report as evidence against the president, without Mr. Bolton's having actually testified.
If the president's supporters refuse to call Mr. Bolton to testify in person, clearly they are afraid to cross-examine him. Moreover, if they refuse to call other witnesses who might have been able to contradict the accounts in Mr. Bolton's book, the president's team would be tacitly admitting that what Mr. Bolton asserts in his book is true.

Re "John Roberts Can Call Witnesses to Trump's Trial. Will He?," by Neal K. Katyal, Joshua A. Geltzer and Mickey Edwards (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Jan. 27):
Please, Chief Justice Roberts, we implore you! If the majority of Americans, including the majority of Republicans, want witnesses and relevant documents included in the impeachment trial, you can exercise your power to make it happen. Please do this service to the American people!

President Trump has denied knowing Lev Parnas, saying maybe there's a picture of them together because, well, he has his picture taken with a lot of people. Of course, multiple photos of them together have materialized. But now we have a recording of Mr. Trump telling Mr. Parnas and an associate to "take out" the ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.
I'm curious: Is it typical for American presidents to order complete strangers to remove American ambassadors?

Dear Americans,
Listen carefully. If you were to remove the ad hominem attacks in President Trump's defense, what remains?

Re "Key G.O.P. Senators Display Few Hints of Being Swayed" (front page, Jan. 25):
The statements of Republican senators, such as Lindsey Graham, that the Senate proceedings "became mind-numbing after a while" reveal less about the content or persuasiveness of the Democratic managers' arguments than they do about the willfully limited attention spans and closed-mindedness of those same Republican senators.
Tracey Peterson

To the Editor:
Forgive me if I don't think the Republicans' faux outrage over Adam Schiff's "head on a pike" comment is worthy of anything other than contempt. Where has their outrage been over President Trump's attempt to extort the struggling nation of Ukraine, his cozying up to the world's worst dictators, his stroking of white nationalists, and on and on.
Whether or not Mr. Trump made the widely reported "head on a pike" comment, it is well known that he and Mitch McConnell have communicated that same threat to the Republicans in Congress. They all know that if they step out of line, they will be shunned by the party leadership, who will do everything they can to end the political careers of those who chose country over party.
Americans have a long list of things to be outraged about. Mr. Schiff's eloquent closing argument is not one of them.

Texto completo: To viewers, the image underscored the impact on people and the planet. But to the photographer, the focus was just on what to shoot next.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. A photograph that ran in The New York Times, of a house devoured by flames with a kangaroo in the foreground, has come to symbolize the destruction wrought by the wildfires in Australia. Matthew Abbott, a photographer based in Australia, was vacationing with his family the day he accepted an assignment from The Times and took the picture. He recounted how it happened.
On New Year's Eve, I was near a small town called Lake Conjola on the southeast coast of Australia, about three hours south of Sydney. It's a big tourist town. And it was basically the busiest day of the year for that town. I was actually with my family about 45 minutes up the road in another tourist town, Currarong.
At about 10 a.m., I saw these smoke plumes. There were a lot of fires around. But the fire that hit Lake Conjola was one of the biggest. So I headed there on the highway. I was just off the highway when it became clear that this fire was barreling through to the coast. I've been shooting the fires for close to two months now. They're relentless. They only stop once they run out of fuel -- when they hit the ocean.
They were evacuating the area using a road that leads to Lake Conjola. It was mayhem. People were clearly frightened. Some had their possessions with them. I thought, "I've got to get down there." I went down the road and came across an area called Conjola Park. Every house was burning. It was catastrophic. I was just trying to document what I was seeing.
I began to wonder what was happening down the hill at Lake Conjola, about 3 or 4 kilometers away. As I came into town, I noticed that it was not as badly affected as Conjola Park. Here, there was a stretch of about four or five homes. But one home that was in the middle of this main street was engulfed in flames. The neighbors on each side of it were trying to hose down their own houses to stop the fire from spreading. They were using their shirts as masks because there was smoke everywhere.
I moved some garbage bins that were burning and melting. A neighbor moved some bins, too. At that moment, a little after 1 p.m., a power line to the house that was burning fell and nearly hit him. It was then that I saw a group of kangaroos coming up the middle of the road. They were obviously running from another fire. And this one kangaroo, for whatever reason, ran right in front of the fire between me and the house. I reacted and raised the camera so I could compose that one image.
At the time, I remembered thinking to myself, "Yeah got it, good shot," but I never allow myself to get too excited about a photo in the middle of something. I'm always pushing myself and thinking: "What's next, what's next?" A photojournalist is trying to tell the story with pictures, and you need a series of strong images. You're looking to document everything that's happening. So I kept moving.
I went down to the water at Lake Conjola, and I saw over a thousand tourists seeking refuge there. Some had walked out in the water itself.
I've been very lucky to learn from experienced professionals how to read fires and stay safe. It's incredibly important to stay calm and not make any irrational decisions. I wear special, full body protective clothing that's fire retardant. I also have a respirator with air filters. But my face is exposed to the heat, which singes your skin. The worst part? My ears. They get so hot I photograph with my arm up against them when close to the flames. And then you've got the smoke to deal with.
Photographing bushfires is exhausting because your body is in overdrive. You're perspiring, you're constantly drinking, and you're moving quickly and your heart rate is up. A lot of people think the big danger is being burned alive, but you've got to be very careful that you don't injure yourself because of exhaustion.
Other fires in Australia have been more destructive than the fire in that scene that day. What I think people are really picking up on with these fires is the loss of wildlife, much of it native. By some estimates, hundreds of millions of animals have died because of these fires.
Here in Australia, we have a love-hate relationship with the kangaroo. Many people think they're pests. They eat lawns and can be a danger to drivers. But we also love them; they're a symbol of our country. One simple picture summed up the human loss, the loss of property and the impact on the environment.
Although the scene in the photo looks like hell on earth, the other side of the house wasn't burning. The kangaroo in the foreground eventually ran to safety. It didn't die in the fire you see.

Texto completo: Young men who took fish oil supplements had higher sperm counts, a greater sperm volume and larger average testicular size.
Taking fish oil supplements may improve sperm quality in healthy young men, a new analysis suggests.
Researchers studied 1,679 Danish men taking physical examinations for compulsory military service. Their average age was 19, and 98 of them reported taking fish oil supplements during the previous three months.
Compared with those who took none, men who took fish oil supplements for at least 60 days during the previous three months had higher sperm count, a greater proportion of normal sperm cells, higher average semen volume and larger average testicular size. They also had significantly lower follicle-stimulating hormone levels and lower luteinizing hormone levels, both indicators of better testicular function.
There was also a dose-response effect for fish oil: Those who took supplements on more than 60 days had better testicular function that those who took them less often.
The study, in JAMA Network Open, controlled for age, alcohol intake, smoking, sexually transmitted diseases, diet and other factors.
The scientists found no effect among men who took supplements other than fish oil, such as vitamin C, vitamin D or multivitamins.
"This has to be confirmed in other studies," said the lead author, Dr. Tina Kold Jensen of the Copenhagen University Hospital, "but here we found that young healthy men who took supplements had a better sperm count. So I would advise men to take supplements if they don't have a fish-rich diet. It's not dangerous, and may have benefits for cardiovascular health as well."

Texto completo: Hours after an article described an unpublished manuscript by his former national security adviser, President Trump rejected John Bolton's account.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Monday pushed back on a firsthand account from his former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, about tying military aid for a foreign ally to his own personal agenda, as senators consider the president's future in the Oval Office.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Mr. Trump wrote just after midnight, referring to a widely debunked theory that the president had pursued about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.
In an unpublished manuscript of his upcoming book, Mr. Bolton described the White House decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine until he left the White House in September. As national security adviser, Mr. Bolton would have been involved in many of the high-level discussions about Ukraine.
Mr. Bolton's account directly undercuts one of Mr. Trump's defense arguments, that the frozen funding was not connected to his petitioning of Ukraine's leader, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to help him in the 2020 presidential election by announcing an anticorruption investigation into the Bidens.
The new details come at a time when senators approach making a final decision -- possibly by the end of the week -- on whether to allow new evidence and new witnesses, like Mr. Bolton, to be introduced in Mr. Trump's trial in the Senate. Mr. Trump's defense team started presenting his defense on Saturday and has through Tuesday to argue against his removal from office.
"There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president's defense," Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said in a joint statement on Sunday after The New York Times's article about Mr. Bolton's account was published.
Hours after his midnight posts, Mr. Trump falsely stated that the Democrats never asked Mr. Bolton to testify during the House impeachment inquiry last year. Republicans and Mr. Trump's defense team have argued that to call witnesses at this stage in the impeachment proceedings amounts to Democrats telling the Senate to do the work the House did not.
Mr. Trump also falsely claimed that his White House released the critical military aid to Ukraine ahead of schedule.
Democrats have been pushing the Republican-led Senate to allow new witnesses, including possibly Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who played a key role in the Ukraine pressure campaign. There were few signs by the end of last week that any Republicans would vote with Democrats on the matter.
But Mr. Bolton's account about Mr. Trump's motivations for freezing the military aid appeared to further sway at least two Republican senators -- Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- to consider hearing new testimony.
"I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton," Mr. Romney told reporters on Monday.
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the president's biggest supporters in the Senate, said if Democrats call witnesses, Republicans should be able to as well. Republicans have been clamoring to hear from Mr. Biden and his son about their ties to Ukraine, which Mr. Trump has called corrupt.
By Monday morning, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Mr. Graham had pressed the White House for an explanation of Mr. Bolton's account.
Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Bolton's manuscript was provided to the National Security Council and edits to it had not been seen or made by anyone else in the White House.
"That is something that we have kept walled off for obvious reasons," Ms. Grisham said Monday on Fox News. "Just could be a conflict with the trail going on, so it's nothing that I've seen and nothing that I know about in terms of what they would remove for national security."
Fred Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's former chief of staff, called on him in an opinion piece for Fox News to immediately withdraw the book from the publisher.
Mr. Bolton's lawyer blamed the White House for the disclosure of the book's contents, which Mr. Bolton submitted for a standard security review 12 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump. It is possible that the submission of Mr. Bolton's book to the White House deepened desires to keep Mr. Bolton from testifying.
In his manuscript, Mr. Bolton describes an effort that he had made, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, to push Mr. Trump to release the aid. Mr. Bolton said he also spoke with Attorney General William P. Barr about his concerns over the parallel diplomacy with Ukraine led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Barr, whom Mr. Trump mentioned in his July phone call with Mr. Zelensky, has tried to distance himself from Mr. Giuliani and the Ukraine matter.
Bob Driscoll, a lawyer for Mr. Mulvaney, disputed Mr. Bolton's account and said Mr. Bolton was merely trying to sell his book, which is set to be released in mid-March.
Mr. Bolton, who has said he would testify at the Senate trial if he was subpoenaed, wrote in the manuscript that Mr. Pompeo told him privately that there was no basis to criticize the American ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Career diplomats have testified that there was no justification to fire Ms. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani and two of his associates had been pushing Mr. Trump to fire her since the spring of 2018.

Re "Subways Chief Resigns in Feud With Governor" (front page, Jan. 24):
First off, thank you, Andy Byford. After several miserable years of unreliable subway service, my commute has recently become more bearable.
Second, I'm shocked by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's willingness to let Mr. Byford leave. How can one person's ego be allowed to get in the way of something so essential to the quality of life of millions of New Yorkers who use the subways daily?
I am going to miss Mr. Byford and his leadership. I pray that the governor doesn't do anything else to slow down progress.

Texto completo: The Italian conductor Jader Bignamini, 43, will succeed Leonard Slatkin next season.
When heart surgery in 2018 forced the conductor Leonard Slatkin to miss the final concerts of his decade-long tenure as music director of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the ensemble turned to an Italian conductor three decades younger, Jader Bignamini, to step in.
The players and maestro hit it off. So much so that the orchestra announced on Wednesday that Mr. Bignamini, 43, would become its new music director next season, when he begins a six-year contract.
"There was certainly a feeling of 'amore a prima vista,' meaning 'love at first sight,"' Mr. Bignamini said in a statement. Stephen Molina, a bass player who served on the search committee, said that Mr. Bignamini's "immediate connection to the musicians was unique."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Bignamini, who is also the resident conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi, sealed the deal when he returned in October to conduct Mahler's Fourth Symphony, in what had initially been planned as his debut in Detroit.
Choosing a conductor who has been best known for opera -- when he jumped in for Mr. Slatkin in 2018, it was for concert performances of Puccini's "Turandot" -- and who is not yet well known in the United States is something of a risk for this orchestra. The Detroit Symphony started the last decade with a painful strike and has been working to rebuild itself ever since, alongside its struggling city -- in part by stressing accessibility and streaming concerts for free online.
But Mr. Bignamini's star has been rising of late. This season includes his debuts with orchestras in Toronto, Houston, Dallas and Minnesota, the Canadian Opera Company, and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He also tours with the star soprano Anna Netrebko.
Anne Parsons, the president and chief executive officer of the Detroit Symphony, said in a statement that Mr. Bignamini "both embodies and exudes enthusiasm and authenticity, and he has an inspiring vision for building on the musical legacy of the D.S.O., this city, and its community."
Born in Crema, near Milan, Mr. Bignamini was drawn to the clarinet as a child and studied at the conservatory in Piacenza. His opera career has taken off in recent years, with engagements at the Metropolitan Opera, the Vienna State Opera and the Dutch National Opera, among others. When he made his debut at the Met in 2017 leading "Madama Butterfly," Zachary Woolfe wrote in The New York Times that he conducted "with properly Puccinian balances of lushness and forward motion."
Mr. Bignamini, a jazz fan who said he plans to enjoy the jazz scene in his new city, will be back in Detroit this week, conducting Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 1 (with Augustin Hadelich as soloist) and Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique." True to form, the orchestra will stream his concert, free of charge, on Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. at dso.org/live and on Facebook Live.

Texto completo: Fighting has started anew and foreign shipments of arms have resumed, blasting apart attempts by world leaders to broker a truce.
A cease-fire in the Libyan civil war has collapsed and foreign shipments to the combatants have resumed, shredding the work of a conference of world leaders who convened in Berlin just eight days ago.
"Battles are raging on all front lines," Ahmed Mismari, a spokesman for the military forces based in eastern Libya, told reporters over the weekend, according to Reuters.
The United Nations had already warned on Friday of "continued blatant violations of the arms embargo" by unnamed foreign powers who had pledged just days earlier to stop supplying weapons to Libyan clients.
In a statement, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya said, "Over the last 10 days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armored vehicles, advisers and fighters."
"The mission condemns these ongoing violations, which risk plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting," it added.
The end of the cease-fire and the resumption of weapons shipments are grave blows to the United Nations' attempts to resolve the conflict. But they are also setbacks for rival peace efforts by the leaders of Russia and Turkey, important backers of the two warring sides in the Libya fight. The two leaders had attempted to upstage the United Nations by privately negotiating a truce, but they have failed to impose it on their Libyan clients.
Libya has struggled for nearly nine years to shake off the chaos that followed the four-decade rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, toppled in 2011 by an Arab Spring revolt supported by NATO airstrikes. The fighting has shaken world energy markets by threatening access to Libya's large supplies of oil and gas. The mayhem has also turned the country's long Mediterranean coastline into a departure point for tens of thousands of Europe-bound migrants and made its vast deserts a haven for bands of extremists.
The current round of conflict began last April when forces based in eastern Libya and backing the military leader Khalifa Hifter began an assault on the capital, Tripoli. The city is the headquarters of a United Nations-sponsored provisional government, and a coalition of militias based in western Libya has rushed to defend it against Mr. Hifter.
The United Arab Emirates, which sees Mr. Hifter as a strongman who might restore order, has been a major supplier of weaponry to his forces and has sent fighter jets to back him. Analysts following the Libyan war have detected a surge in flights from the United Arab Emirates to Mr. Hifter's territory in recent days, raising questions about whether the Emiratis were supplying him for a new round of fighting.
Russia has also become a major backer of Mr. Hifter. The Kremlin has sent as many as 1,400 mercenaries with the private security company Wagner Group to aid his assault on Tripoli.
On the other side, Turkey has been the main military backer of the forces defending Tripoli. In recent weeks, Ankara has also begun sending hundreds of fighters from Turkish-backed Syrian militias to join the defense of Tripoli, transporting them from one quagmire to another. Officials of the Tripoli government have said that the fighters are Arabic-speaking Turkish nationals from the area near the Syrian border, but recent news reports suggest that the fighters are Syrian-born and may have received Turkish citizenship.
In its statement on Friday, the United Nations mission to Libya said that it "deeply regrets the continued blatant violations of the arms embargo in Libya, even after the commitments made in this regard by concerned countries during the International Conference on Libya in Berlin."
The leaders of both sides of the Libyan fight have said that they continue to uphold the cease-fire. But both have also said that they were retaliating against rivals' attacks.
In reality, sporadic fighting around the outskirts of Tripoli had continued throughout the cease-fire. By the end of the weekend, however, the clashes had escalated.
The United Nations mission said in a statement on Sunday that two missiles had hit the Mitiga International Airport, which serves Tripoli, wounding at least two civilians and damaging buildings. Repeated attacks have often "deprived two million residents in the capital of their only functioning airport," the mission said.
By Monday, fighting had also resumed on another front between the coastal city of Surt, captured in recent weeks by Mr. Hifter's forces, and the city of Misurata, home of the most potent militias defending Tripoli.
A spokesman for Mr. Hifter said his forces near Surt had been forced to respond "after noticeable movements by terrorists in the area." Mr. Hifter customarily uses the term "terrorists" to describe the forces defending Tripoli.

Bolton Worried About an Embrace of Authoritarians by Trump, Book Says

Texto completo: The former national security adviser shared his unease with the attorney general, who cited his own worries about the president's conversations with the leaders of Turkey and China.
WASHINGTON -- John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, privately told Attorney General William P. Barr last year that he had concerns that President Trump was effectively granting personal favors to the autocratic leaders of Turkey and China, according to an unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton.
Mr. Barr responded by pointing to a pair of Justice Department investigations of companies in those countries and said he was worried that Mr. Trump had created the appearance that he had undue influence over what would typically be independent inquiries, according to the manuscript. Backing up his point, Mr. Barr mentioned conversations Mr. Trump had with the leaders, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Xi Jinping of China.
Mr. Bolton's account underscores the fact that the unease about Mr. Trump's seeming embrace of authoritarian leaders, long expressed by experts and his opponents, also existed among some of the senior cabinet officers entrusted by the president to carry out his foreign policy and national security agendas.
Mr. Bolton recounted his discussion with Mr. Barr in a draft of an unpublished book manuscript that he submitted nearly a month ago to the White House for review. People familiar with the manuscript described its contents on the condition of anonymity.
The book also contains an account of Mr. Trump telling Mr. Bolton in August that he wanted to continue freezing $ 391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations of political rivals, The New York Times reported on Sunday. The matter is at the heart of the articles of impeachment against the president.
Early Tuesday, the Justice Department's spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, posted a statement on Twitter disputing aspects of Mr. Bolton's account.
"There was no discussion of 'personal favors' or 'undue influence' on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr state that the President's conversations with foreign leaders was improper," the statement said. "If this is truly what Mr. Bolton has written, then it seems he is attributing to Attorney General Barr his own current views -- views with which Attorney General Barr does not agree."
A spokesman for the National Security Council declined to comment on Mr. Barr's conversations with Mr. Bolton. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Bolton, his publisher and his literary agency said they had not shared the manuscript with The Times.
"There was absolutely no coordination with The New York Times or anyone else regarding the appearance of information about his book, 'The Room Where It Happened,' at online booksellers," Mr. Bolton, Simon & Schuster and Javelin said in a joint statement. "Any assertion to the contrary is unfounded speculation."
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, responded that "The Times does not discuss its sources, but I should point out that no one has questioned the accuracy of our report."
Mr. Bolton wrote in the manuscript that Mr. Barr singled out Mr. Trump's conversations with Mr. Xi about the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE, which agreed in 2017 to plead guilty and pay heavy fines for violating American sanctions on doing business with North Korea, Iran and other countries. A year later, Mr. Trump lifted the sanctions over objections from his own advisers and Republican lawmakers.
Mr. Barr also cited remarks Mr. Trump made to Mr. Erdogan in 2018 about the investigation of Halkbank, Turkey's second-largest state-owned bank. The Justice Department was scrutinizing Halkbank on fraud and money-laundering charges for helping Iran evade sanctions imposed by the Treasury Department.
Mr. Erdogan had been making personal appeals to Mr. Trump to use his authority to halt any additional enforcement against the bank. In 2018, Mr. Erdogan told reporters in Turkey that Mr. Trump had promised to instruct cabinet members to follow through on the matter. The bank had hired a top Republican fund-raiser to lobby the administration on the issue.
For months, it looked as though the unusual lobbying effort might succeed; but in October, the Justice Department indicted the bank for aiding Iran. The charges were seen in part as an attempt by the administration to show that it was taking a tough line on Turkey amid an outcry over Mr. Trump's endorsement of its incursions in Syria.
Mr. Bolton's statements in the book align with other comments he has made since leaving the White House in September. In November, he said in a private speech that none of Mr. Trump's advisers shared the president's views on Turkey and that he believed Mr. Trump adopted a more permissive approach to the country because of his financial ties there, NBC News reported. Mr. Trump's company has a property in Turkey.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised dictators throughout his presidency. Last year, he said, "Where's my favorite dictator?" as he waited to meet with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Mr. Trump's soft spot for authoritarians dates at least to his presidential campaign, when he praised Saddam Hussein for being "good" at killing terrorists and suggested that the world would be better off were Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan dictator who was killed in a violent uprising in 2011, "in charge right now." Mr. Trump then suggested the ouster of both men was ultimately worse for the Middle East because the Islamic State had filled the void.
Mr. Trump declared himself "a big fan" of Mr. Erdogan as they sat side by side in the Oval Office last fall after Mr. Trump cleared the way for Turkish forces to invade Syria, though he warned Mr. Erdogan behind the scenes against the offensive.
Of Mr. Xi, Mr. Trump has been similarly effusive. When the Chinese Communist Party eliminated term limits, allowing Mr. Xi to keep his tenure open-ended, Mr. Trump extolled the outcome.
Mr. Xi had personally asked Mr. Trump to intervene to save ZTE, which was on the brink of collapse because of tough American penalties for sanctions violations.
Lifting the sanctions on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications giant that also serves as a geopolitical pawn for its government, most likely helped Mr. Trump negotiate with Mr. Xi in the trade war between the two countries. But Republican lawmakers and others objected to helping a Chinese company that broke the law and has been accused of posing a national security threat.
Mr. Bolton's reputation for muscular foreign policy was always an odd fit with Mr. Trump, who often threatens excessive force but rarely reacts with it. Mr. Bolton was pleased when Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, that the Obama administration had entered into. Other Trump advisers had urged him against it.
But Mr. Trump's lack of action after Iranian aggression against the United States rankled Mr. Bolton.
Mr. Bolton's book has already netted significant sales. Shortly after the disclosure of its contents on Sunday night, Amazon listed the book for purchase. By Monday evening, it was No. 17 on Amazon's best-seller list.

Texto completo: Since 1956, his jewel box of a club in storied Montmartre has drawn a host of luminaries, turning the proprietor himself into one.
Michou, a flamboyant fixture of the Parisian demimonde who ran France's most celebrated drag cabaret for more than a half-century, died on Sunday night in a hospital in Saint-Mandé, a suburb of Paris. He was 88.
The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said François Deblaye, Michou's press representative. "He hadn't been able to breathe very well for a while," he said. Last year, Michou was treated for colon cancer, which was said to be in remission.
It was in 1956 that Michou -- born Michel Georges Alfred Catty -- opened his tiny jewel box of a nightclub at the foot of Montmartre, the storied Paris neighborhood known for its nightclubs and connection with artists like Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec.
Dressed habitually in blue, with a snowy white coif, manicured fingernails, a perpetually wide smile and a glass of Champagne always in hand, Michou was instantly recognizable in France, in part from his many television appearances. His death was front page news in France.
The Élysée Palace issued an unusually long statement on Monday lamenting his death, saying in part, "The sky above Montmartre will be a little less blue from now on."
In Montmartre he was known for holding free luncheons for elderly residents. Cafes there engraved his name on plaques on his favorite seats, permanently reserving them for him. Local residents often blew kisses at him as he walked to his cabaret from his apartment overlooking Sacre Coeur, the basilica at the heart of Montmartre.
"They call me the 'Blue Prince of Montmartre,"' Michou told The New York Times in an interview last March. (Even his home was decorated entirely in shades of blue, right down to a turquoise toilet seat.) "Around here, I'm treated like a saint."
Prominent politicians, actors and singers were his friends, and his cabaret was lined with photos of him hugging the likes of Sophia Loren and Jacques Chirac, who as president of France had awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's highest order of merit. He was a close friend of first ladies of France, including Brigitte Macron, President Emmanuel Macron's wife, who, like Michou, hailed from Amiens, an industrial town in northern France.
Chez Michou's big draw was a colorful spectacle called "transformiste," featuring a parade of performers in drag impersonating female luminaries of bygone eras, like the diva Maria Callas and Dalida, the Egyptian-born singer and actress from the 1950s. Night after night, the cabaret was packed with visitors from around France and from around the world.
As one of Paris's most famous openly gay performers, Michou left another cultural mark: "He helped open doors to liberate others," François Soustre, a French writer who is the co-author of an autobiography of Michou, told The Times last March.
Michel Georges Alfred Catty was born in June 1931 in Amiens and raised by his mother and a grandmother. At age 19, he wrote, he told his mother he was attracted to men.
"What would you say if I was a homosexual?" he recalled asking her.
She responded, "If you're happy, that's all I care about."
Her support gave Michou confidence to leave Amiens and make his way to Paris, where he settled near the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret. He found work at a cafe on Rue des Martyrs. After befriending the owner, he eventually bought the cafe from her, transforming it into a dinner theater featuring himself and two friends as dancers.
"I did the cooking, the cleaning and the dancing," he said.
Michou famously avoided drinking water, preferring to hydrate himself with up to two bottles of Champagne a day -- a habit that, by his account, once prompted a former first lady, Bernadette Chirac, a close friend, to admonish him.
He replied: "I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs. At least leave me the pleasure of Champagne!"
He is survived by his longtime companion, Erwann Toularastel; a half sister, Micheline; and a niece, Catherine Baudelin.
His last wish was that Chez Michou be shuttered on the day he died, said Mr. Deblaye, his publicist. As of Sunday night, the nightclub remained open, but how long it will continue to operate is uncertain.
Michou had made one thing clear, however. "When I disappear," he told The Times, "I want people to remember this place and say, 'This is where Michou gave people joy."'
His coffin -- a blue one, of course -- was scheduled to be brought to the cabaret on Thursday for people to pay respects, according to his wishes, Mr. Deblaye said. He will be buried in the small St. Vincent cemetery in Montmartre, in a blue tomb.

Texto completo: Scant precedent and gaps in written procedures make the rules for calling witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial debatable.
WASHINGTON -- A potentially pivotal disclosure from a book draft by John R. Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, about the Ukraine affair has heightened the question of whether the Senate will call Mr. Bolton as a witness in the impeachment trial.
But the rules for how a witness might be subpoenaed are murky, with gaps in the written procedures and only a few precedents to look to. It is not clear whether or how many Republican senators would have to be willing to break partisan ranks and vote with Democrats to call witnesses.
What is the clearest way for the Senate to subpoena a witness?
With a 51-vote majority.
Under the special procedures for the Trump impeachment trial that the Senate approved this month, after Mr. Trump's defense team finishes its presentation and there is a period of questions, the Senate will decide whether it wants to hear from witnesses. A motion to hear witness testimony can pass with a simple-majority vote.
Assuming all 47 members of the Democratic caucus stick together, that would require at least four Republican senators to defy Mr. Trump and vote for a motion to subpoena Mr. Bolton. Political observers have focused on Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah as Republicans to watch.
Mr. Trump explicitly linked his holdup of aid to Ukraine to a push for politically beneficial investigations, Mr. Bolton wrote. On Monday, Mr. Romney told reporters that "it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton," and Ms. Collins said on Twitter that the reports about Mr. Bolton's book "strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues."
What if the Senate splits, 50-50?
In theory, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. could decide -- if he wants to be assertive.
When a vote on a motion ends in a tie, the motion fails. But during the first presidential impeachment trial -- the unsuccessful effort to remove Andrew Johnson in 1868 -- Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase twice cast tiebreaking votes on motions as the presiding officer. They both passed. (On a third tie, Mr. Chase abstained, so that motion failed.)
The Senate's general rules for impeachment trials are silent about whether the chief justice may cast tiebreaking votes on procedural motions, and the current version of them -- last revised in 1986 -- still does not address that question. A resolution that the Senate approved this month laying out specific procedures for the Trump trial is also silent about ties.
Some senators in 1868 believed that Chief Justice Chase lacked that power under the Constitution and moved to declare his intervention null. But the Senate voted down the objection, creating a precedent that chief justices do have tiebreaking power in impeachment trials, just as vice presidents have tiebreaking power in votes on legislation and nominations.
To be sure, both of the procedural motions that Chief Justice Chase voted on were far less momentous than calling Mr. Bolton as a witness would be: They involved whether the Senate should take a short break and adjourn for the day.
In the only other presidential impeachment trial -- against Bill Clinton in 1999 -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist cast no tiebreaking votes; the issue never came up.
May Roberts decide on his own, without any vote?
It's unclear.
In an opinion article published Monday by The New York Times, three legal experts declared that he could. They argued that Chief Justice Roberts, as the presiding officer, has unilateral power to subpoena witnesses because a clause in the 1986-era rules for impeachment trials says presiding officers may issue orders on their own.
There are several reasons for caution about this idea. First, even if this interpretation of the rules were correct -- and even if Chief Justice Roberts were willing to subpoena Mr. Bolton on his own, notwithstanding the more limited procedure laid out in the Trump trial resolution -- a subpoena, by itself, would merely compel Mr. Bolton to show up physically.
As the legal experts acknowledged, the 1986 rules also empower a Senate majority to decide that information is irrelevant and should not be admitted as evidence. Thus, Chief Justice Roberts could bring Mr. Bolton to the trial, but a Senate majority could still decline to hear what he has to say. That said, a subpoena from Chief Justice Roberts could increase momentum in favor of testimony.
Second, Chief Justice Roberts might reject the idea that he has the power to subpoena Mr. Bolton unilaterally were House impeachment managers to propose it, said Michael Davidson, who served as the Senate legal counsel -- the chamber's top lawyer -- from 1979 to 1995.
Mr. Davidson said that the Senate parliamentarian would most likely advise Chief Justice Roberts that the two sets of impeachment trial procedures must be read together, and that where they conflict, the more recent and specific rule -- those passed for the Trump trial -- should prevail.
Even if the parliamentarian or Chief Justice Roberts were to say otherwise, Mr. Davidson added, a Senate majority could always vote to override them.
Finally, the opinion article said that changing Senate rules requires a two-thirds supermajority, and the Trump trial resolution fell short. But a simple majority of senators can change its rules, Mr. Davidson said. A two-thirds vote would be required to break any filibuster blocking an up-or-down vote on a rules change, but Democrats did not filibuster the Trump trial resolution.

Texto completo: Manzoor Pashteen and his peaceful protest movement have accused the security forces of extrajudicial killings. Now, he may face charges of conspiring against the state.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The Pakistani authorities on Monday arrested the leader of a civil rights movement who for nearly two years has challenged the country's powerful security forces by demanding they be held accountable for extrajudicial killings and kidnappings, his colleagues said.
The leader, Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen, was arrested in the early hours of Monday morning on five separate charges, including conspiracy and sedition, after giving a speech that officials said was against the Constitution and the state. He was detained in Peshawar, the capital of the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, his colleagues said.
Mr. Pashteen and his movement, widely known by the initials P.T.M., have presented one of the most influential challenges to the military's dominance of Pakistan as it has cracked down on minorities, journalists and other critics in recent years.
While the P.T.M. focused on demanding justice for the country's sizable Pashtun minority, its influence quickly grew larger than the movement itself. The large crowds P.T.M. drew to the streets, and the boldness of its leadership in openly challenging the security forces, inspired other advocates to join in.
Despite Mr. Pashteen's arrest, other P.T.M. leaders have vowed to press on.
"The arrests cannot stop our struggle," said Mohsin Dawar, a parliamentarian and a P.T.M. leader.
Under the five charges, which include sedition and criminal conspiracy, Mr. Pashteen could face up to life in prison. A court in Peshawar on Monday gave Mr. Pashteen 14 days of pretrial detention, according to the local news media.
This is the first time Mr. Pashteen has been arrested since the popular movement began almost two years ago. Although his associates have been arrested and protesters have been intimidated or abused, the authorities had until now avoided going straight at Mr. Pashteen, who has become an influential public figure despite the authorities' efforts to impose a news blackout around P.T.M.'s activities.
Pakistani officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment and made no official statement.
A local security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the unpublicized case, said Mr. Pashteen had been arrested after making "anti-national comments" during a speech in Dera Ismail Khan, south of Peshawar, this month. A copy of the police report, made available to The New York Times, accused Mr. Pashteen of attacking Pakistan's Constitution during his speech and of conspiring against the state and its sovereignty. Mr. Pashteen is also accused of inciting hatred between different Pakistani ethnic groups.
Throughout its struggle, the P.T.M. has accused the security forces of oppressing the country's Pashtun minority by waging communal justice against noncombatants in areas where militant groups operate, and by staging extrajudicial killings or kidnappings.
Though the group has kept to its philosophy of nonviolent protest, the authorities have accused them of trying to violently subvert the state, and of being proxies for Afghanistan and India in trying to undermine the country. P.T.M. officials deny those accusations.

Texto completo: Mr. Collins plans to challenge a fellow Republican, Senator Kelly Loeffler, in this fall's special election for one of Georgia's Senate seats.
WASHINGTON -- Representative Doug Collins, one of the faces of President Trump's impeachment defense, plans to challenge Senator Kelly Loeffler in this fall's special election for one of Georgia's Senate seats, people familiar with his intentions said on Monday.
Mr. Collins's long-expected decision sets the stage for a brutal Republican-on-Republican fight that will put a prominent House conservative known for his defenses of Mr. Trump against a wealthy businesswoman appointed in recent weeks to fill the state's vacant Senate seat. Democrats also see the contest as a potential opportunity to pick up a seat in November.
Mr. Collins is expected to announce his campaign on Tuesday, according to the people familiar with his plans, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
He enters the race with widespread name recognition on the right, having served as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment proceedings and now as a member of Mr. Trump's impeachment defense team.
Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican, passed over Mr. Collins in favor of Ms. Loeffler when he selected a temporary replacement for the retiring Senator Johnny Isakson late last year. He did so despite direct entreaties from Mr. Trump and some of his allies on Mr. Collins's behalf, and their complaints that Ms. Loeffler was not a reliable enough supporter of the president.
Ms. Loeffler, a prominent political donor and political newcomer, has spent the weeks since trying to burnish a conservative record. She did so again on Monday just hours before news of Mr. Collins's campaign surfaced. She attacked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, a Republican to whom she once donated large sums of money, for saying that witnesses should be called in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial.
"After 2 weeks, it's clear that Democrats have no case for impeachment," she wrote on Twitter. "Sadly, my colleague @SenatorRomney wants to appease the left by calling witnesses who will slander the @realDonaldTrump during their 15 minutes of fame. The circus is over. It's time to move on!"
She starts with a significant financial advantage. The senator has said she is willing to pour $ 20 million of her own money into the race.
Ms. Loeffler ignored questions from a reporter in the Capitol on Monday night, and her aides did not respond to a request for comment.
Under the existing rules governing special elections in Georgia, there is no party primary in the race, and both Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Collins could be on a single ballot on Election Day in November along with Democratic candidates. If no candidate won more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote getters would compete in a January 2021 runoff.
The Georgia House of Representatives is considering legislation that would institute party primaries for the contest, a change that could benefit Mr. Collins. Mr. Kemp has threatened to veto it, however.
What gives Republicans some comfort about what could be a messy intraparty fight is that Democrats don't have an obvious candidate to field in the race. A handful of Democrats are already running, including former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman's son, but state and national leaders have made clear they are still recruiting others.
One possibility Democrats in Washington are said to be eyeing: the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the pastor of the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Mr. Collins's decision is a rebuke of Mr. Kemp, the ostensible party leader in Georgia, and of Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who also backs Ms. Loeffler. But it is not much of a political gamble in an era when Mr. Trump's favor or opposition is what shapes Republican politics.
The president has made little secret of his fondness for Mr. Collins. Now, though, Mr. Trump finds himself between a loyal lawmaker and a sitting senator who has the backing of Mr. McConnell and Georgia Republicans like Mr. Kemp who are eager to elevate a woman in an increasingly competitive state.
Some White House officials indicated Monday that Mr. Trump might stay out of the intramural fight. But he has inserted himself in past primaries after a nudge. One of those races was Mr. Kemp's own 2018 primary, when the president endorsed him late in the contest.
But with Republicans finding it harder to keep Georgia in their column, some of the president's advisers are hoping he does not take sides in a race between two candidates who have made clear they will be White House allies.
Mr. Collins's decision to abandon his House seat will also have implications in that chamber. Two close allies of Mr. Trump, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas, are the leading contenders to replace him as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, a coveted post. Both men helped lead Mr. Trump's impeachment defense in the House.

Texto completo: Diplomatic correspondents said the move appeared to retaliate against NPR for an interview that pressed Mr. Pompeo on his role in the Trump administration's shadow foreign policy in Ukraine.
WASHINGTON -- The State Department will not allow NPR's diplomatic correspondent on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's government airplane for an upcoming trip, which includes a stop in Ukraine, following the secretary's extraordinary outburst last week over being questioned about Ukraine during an interview with the network.
Michele Kelemen, who has covered the State Department for nearly two decades, was scheduled to cover Mr. Pompeo's official visit this week to Europe and Central Asia, traveling with the diplomatic delegation.
She was told on Sunday that she would not be allowed to fly as a member of the press pool on the government airplane with Mr. Pompeo. It was not clear how long the ban on her travel with Mr. Pompeo's official delegations might last.
The association of journalists covering the State Department issued a statement on Monday criticizing the action as improper retaliation against NPR.
Journalists who regularly cover the department have "a long tradition of accompanying secretaries of state on their travels and we find it unacceptable to punish an individual member of our association," Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents' Association, said in a statement.
The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
The upcoming trip includes a stop in Kyiv, Ukraine -- the first visit there by Mr. Pompeo since Congress opened impeachment proceedings over accusations that President Trump tried to leverage $ 391 million in security aid to prompt Ukraine to launch an investigation into his political rivals.
Witnesses have said Mr. Pompeo was aware of the scheme and of a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine that undercut his own diplomats there; the secretary of state has insisted he did nothing wrong.
In an interview last Friday, Mr. Pompeo accused Mary Louise Kelly, host of NPR's "All Things Considered," of blindsiding him with questions about his role in the Ukraine controversy, even though she had earlier informed his aides that she would ask him about that country. Ms. Kelly has described a tense exchange after a taped part of the interview. "He asked, 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?' " she said. "He used the F-word in that sentence and many others."
On Saturday, Mr. Pompeo issued an extraordinary response for a senior American government official -- not to mention a diplomat -- by accusing Ms. Kelly of lying to him about the terms of the interview and violating "basic rules of journalism and decency."
"It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity," Mr. Pompeo said.
His reaction has been widely criticized by lawmakers, foreign policy experts and press advocates. Even a Fox News host, Steve Hilton, a self-described big fan of Mr. Pompeo, chided the chief diplomat's "whining" invective.
"For goodness' sakes, Mr. Secretary, don't be such a baby," Mr. Hilton said on Monday. "You should be able to handle tough questions by now. And don't be such a bully."

Texto completo: A factory whose survival was a central issue in last year's 40-day strike will get a $ 2.2 billion infusion for next-generation vehicles.
General Motors said Monday that it was investing $ 2.2 billion in a Detroit plant where it will produce all-electric trucks and sport utility vehicles, fulfilling a key promise made during last year's union negotiations.
The investment will fund upgrades like new machines and tools at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant's paint shop, body shop and general assembly area. The plant had been scheduled to close this month, but was spared in the October deal that ended the longest G.M. strike in half a century.
As part of that agreement, G.M. vowed to commit $ 3 billion to the plant's overhaul. The company says that promise is met by the investment in upgrades and an additional $ 800 million for supplier tooling and related projects.
Once in full operation, the plant will employ more than 2,200 people, the company said. Production is scheduled to begin in late 2021 on an all-electric pickup truck, followed by the Cruise Origin, a six-passenger vehicle that was unveiled last week and is intended for use as a self-driving taxi.
Legacy automakers are in a race with one another and a slew of start-ups and technology companies to capture growing demand for electric vehicles while also preparing for the advent of autonomous vehicles. G.M.'s Cruise Origin, for example, faces competition from Uber and Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google's parent company, Alphabet.
At the same time, that fight over an electric future has helped to reinvigorate the American automotive industry.
In 2018, Ford Motor announced that it had bought Michigan Central Station in Detroit, and would convert the abandoned office tower and train station -- a symbol of the city's decline -- into an urban campus focused on developing businesses that use self-driving cars.
Last year, Fiat Chrysler said it planned to spend $ 4.5 billion to update several Detroit plants, an investment that it said would create 6,500 jobs and allow the company to start making electric versions of its Jeep models if customer demand increased.
As part of an existing joint venture, G.M. and South Korea's LG Chem have invested $ 2.3 billion in a separate plant near Lordstown, Ohio, which will make the battery cells that will power the electric vehicles made at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, the company said. Executives have said that the venture, in the same area where G.M. shut down a plant last year, would create more than 1,100 jobs, with a groundbreaking expected later this year.
In a statement, a G.M. spokesman said the investments announced on Monday were made possible by a state tax credit from the Michigan Economic Growth Authority.
"Over the past decade, the Michigan MEGA has helped enable G.M. to invest more than $ 10 billion in its Michigan facilities," the spokesman, Dan Flores, said.
Last week, the Michigan Strategic Fund, an economic development organization, approved changes to that tax credit, which it said had a remaining value of $ 2.27 billion. The revisions require G.M. to invest at least $ 3.5 billion in the state over the next decade, including at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant.
G.M. has built more than four million vehicles at Detroit-Hamtramck since it opened in 1985, the company said. The Cadillac CT6 and the Chevrolet Impala are produced at the factory, which will be idled at the end of February for several months for renovations.

Texto completo: Why there's a wide split in recent surveys in the state.
With one week to go until the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden finds himself in a seemingly unimaginable position: needing to mobilize older voters who are usually the most consistent voters.
This helps explain why recent polls diverge so much on Mr. Biden's standing in Iowa.
He trailed in the New York Times/Siena College poll of Iowa caucusgoers released Saturday. Yet he very well might have led a Times/Siena poll of a hypothetical Iowa primary, because he had a substantial advantage among Democrats in the survey who regularly turn out in primary elections.
But the Iowa race is a caucus, not a primary. And while analysts know very little about the nature of caucus electorates, there is reason to think that caucuses attract very different kinds of voters.
On the one hand, many regular voters don't participate in caucuses. One-third of people who participated in a recent Iowa Democratic primary -- usually considered all but certain voters -- said they weren't likely to caucus, and these voters backed Mr. Biden by 11 points in the Times/Siena poll. The large number of Democratic primary voters who seem uninterested in attending the Iowa caucuses is all the more surprising given that recent Iowa primary elections for Senate, House, governor or local offices were not particularly competitive and certainly did not attract national attention.
On the other hand, a presidential caucus -- and perhaps especially Bernie Sanders -- draws a large number of voters to the polls who do not vote regularly. As a result, it was Mr. Sanders who led the Times/Siena poll -- by seven points -- despite weakness among regular and consistent voters. His supporters may not vote so often, but he led among those who said they had caucused before, including in 2016. Most important, he led among those who said they would show up next week, and therefore led the poll.
This mismatch -- between the voters who say they will participate in a caucus, and the voters who typically show up in primaries -- may be at the heart of the wide split in recent Iowa polls.
Many pollsters rely, in some way, on past vote history to conduct their surveys. Some pollsters use it to define which voters could be selected to participate in a survey, like a recent Monmouth University poll that selected registered Democrats or independents who turned out in 2018 or in a recent primary, or who registered since 2018. A Neighborhood Research and Media poll was even more limited in its model for who was likely to vote: voters who turned out in either the 2016 or 2018 primary. These polls in Iowa showed Mr. Biden with the lead, and the Times/Siena poll also found Mr. Biden tied or ahead among these groups.
The Times/Siena poll does not use past vote history to define the universe of voters eligible to participate in the caucus poll. Neither do the Ann Selzer/CNN/Des Moines Register or CBS/YouGov polls, which also show Mr. Sanders in the lead.
The question is whether it is reasonable to assume that the caucus electorate is largely confined to these groups of highly regular voters. It's an understandable assumption: Caucuses are very low-turnout elections, and so one might assume they are mainly composed of the most reliable voters. One might even note that the 2018 midterm primaries in Iowa had about the same number of voters as the 2016 Democratic presidential caucus, and suppose they're probably the same people as well.
If that assumption is right, the Times/Siena poll and others showing Mr. Sanders in the lead include many irregular young voters with little chance of actually showing up. Over all, voters over age 65 made up 42 percent of the Iowa primary electorate in 2018, compared with 24 percent in the Times/Siena poll. And in fairness, it is hard to know with certainty either way, given the lack of authoritative public data on the composition of caucus electorates in Iowa or elsewhere.
But there is reason to think caucus electorates are fundamentally different from primaries or even typical elections.
Just consider the actual results of recent caucuses. In both Democratic and Republican contests, they are plainly different from the results of primaries in demographically similar areas, or even in the same states. They tend to favor outsider, activist-backed candidates, including Mr. Sanders. The only plausible explanation for the difference is that low-turnout caucuses tend to attract the sort of highly informed political activists who are passionate enough to sit through a laborious, multi-hour, public caucus and favor ideologically consistent candidates.
One reason for the difference seems to be age. Caucus electorates appear to be fairly young, and primary electorates fairly or even very old. This shouldn't be a huge surprise. The kinds of Democrats who have excelled in caucuses in recent years, like Mr. Sanders and Barack Obama, were backed overwhelmingly by younger voters. The young represented a large share of the caucus electorates in the 2004, 2008 and 2016 entrance polls -- the only publicly available data on the composition of the caucus electorate, even if it's of uncertain quality.
The results of the Times/Siena poll of Iowa also indicate that past caucusgoers are quite different from past primary voters -- at least if you believe our respondents, since we can't prove they actually participated.
Past caucusgoers back Mr. Sanders by four points, even as past primary voters support Mr. Biden. Voters who say they participated in the 2016 Democratic caucus, specifically, back Mr. Sanders by nine points; he's at 25 percent and Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent. These 2016 caucusgoers say they voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Sanders, 49 percent to 46 percent, with 3 percent for Martin O'Malley -- very close to the actual result, perhaps lending credibility to the overall Times/Siena finding.
The poll indicates that caucusgoers are poised to behave differently from the broader electorate yet again in 2020. The Democrats who say they will caucus back Mr. Sanders; those who say they won't attend a caucus back Mr. Biden by a six-point margin.
Mr. Biden's turnout disadvantage persists even among the voters who said they would caucus. In a second likely-voter question -- which asks Democratic caucusgoers to evaluate their likelihood of voting -- Mr. Biden does worst among the voters who say they're "almost certain" to vote, and falls to just 15 percent of the vote. On the other hand, he is at 30 percent among those who said they would caucus but specified in the follow-up question that they were "somewhat" or "less likely" to caucus.
In the Times/Siena poll, younger voters are likelier than older voters to say they will participate in the Democratic caucus. Among registered Democrats, 53 percent of those 18 to 29 said they were "almost certain" or "very likely" to caucus, compared with 35 percent over age 65. It's not because this is just a group of exceptionally high-turnout young people: 58 percent of these same 18-to-29-year-old Democrats turned out in 2018, according to data from the L2 voter file, while 85 percent of the respondents over age 65 were voters in 2018.
Self-reported vote intention is far from perfect; people can mislead pollsters, intentionally or unintentionally. But the finding should be taken seriously. Of the more than 100 pre-election Times/Siena surveys in the last four years, the two Iowa caucus polls stand out as the two cases where self-reported turnout among young voters significantly outpaced that of older voters, and it is not a close call. In the only two other cases where self-reported youth turnout was higher, the samples of young voters were far smaller, and so was the difference.
Of course, there's no guarantee that youth turnout will be so high. But for Mr. Sanders, it might not need to be. He would have led the Times/Siena poll even without any 18-to-29-year-old voters at all. His strength among older voters is enhanced in a caucus setting as well, because even older caucusgoers tend to be more liberal than older Democrats who say they intend to stay home.
If Mr. Biden can mobilize older, regular voters over the next week, it might be a different story.

Texto completo: The new installation of a comedy series is on TBS. And an Israeli documentary is available to rent.
What's on TV
MIRACLE WORKERS: DARK AGES 10:30 p.m. on TBS. This strange comedy starring Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Buscemi is back for a new season, though the only elements that remain the same are the cast. This installment is an anthology, and it poses a contrast to the original "Miracle Workers" series, which was set in heaven with Radcliffe as an angel and Buscemi as God. Now, Radcliffe is Prince Chauncley, the simple-minded son of great tyrant who, as Chauncley points out, could probably benefit from anger-management therapy. The rest of the cast members return as medieval villagers who are trying to navigate life in a time of great ignorance, where, as the one of the characters is taught in school, "The Earth is flat, the devil is real, and that is everything that we know."
What's Streaming
AFTERWARD (2018) Rent on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play and Vudu. The first feature by the Israeli filmmaker Ofra Bloch, this documentary aims to understand where the past and present of Jewish identity collide -- using discussions with Europeans, Palestinians and other Israelis. Bloch, who grew up in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was taught to fear Germans, and many Palestinians she speaks with fear an Israeli occupation. In her interviews, Bloch works to uncover the residual effects of a historical genocide and balance them with modern sentiments of aggression in the Middle East. "But by the end of the documentary," Ken Jaworowski wrote in his review for The New York Times, "she and many of her subjects posit that it's possible to learn from history and to change, and to trust each other a little more." He added, "You can't help but hope they're right."
SPANGLISH (2004) Stream on HBO and Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Adam Sandler stars in this dramatic comedy as John Clasky, alongside Téa Leoni as his wife, Deborah. Paz Vega is Flor, a single mother who, after emigrating from Mexico with her daughter, finds work in the dysfunctional Los Angeles Clasky household despite not knowing any English. This proves to be only a minor issue, as the family's inability to communicate with each other is much harder to overcome than Flor's language barrier. As she settles in, Flor proves to be an indispensable member of the family who teaches the Claskys more about understanding one another than they could have imagined.
HUNTING JONBENÉT'S KILLER: THE UNTOLD STORY Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon. It has been 24 years since JonBenet Ramsey -- a 6-year-old beauty pageant queen -- was found dead in the basement of her family's Boulder, Colo., home, resulting in one of America's most-well-known cold case killings to date. This special presentation with Elizabeth Vargas explores new leads -- including new DNA tests -- and introduces an interview with JonBenet's father, John Ramsey, who had long been a suspect in her death.

Texto completo: While social media praised the N.B.A. star after his death, Felicia Sonmez posted a link to an article on the allegations of sexual assault made against him in 2003.
The Washington Post suspended one of its reporters, Felicia Sonmez, after she posted tweets on Sunday about Kobe Bryant in the hours after his death. Over 200 Post journalists criticized the paper's decision on Monday.
Ms. Sonmez on Sunday posted a link on Twitter to a 2016 Daily Beast article that detailed an allegation of sexual assault made against Mr. Bryant in 2003. Her tweet appeared amid a flood of public tributes to the retired Los Angeles Lakers star, who died earlier that day in a helicopter crash at age 41.
Ms. Sonmez received an email from The Post's executive editor, Martin Baron, at 5:38 p.m., before she was told that she would be placed on leave. The reporter shared the three-sentence email with The New York Times.
"Felicia," Mr. Baron wrote. "A real lack of judgment to tweet this. Please stop. You're hurting this institution by doing this."
The text of Mr. Baron's email was attached to a screen shot of Ms. Sonmez's tweet linking to the Daily Beast article. A spokeswoman for The Post and Mr. Baron did not reply to requests for comment on the email.
Mr. Bryant was arrested in 2003 after a complaint by a hotel employee in Colorado. A charge of felony sexual assault was dropped in 2005, and Mr. Bryant settled with his accuser out of court, saying in a statement that he believed the encounter with the woman was "consensual," although he had come to understand that she did not see it the same way.
Ms. Sonmez's tweet drew a swift backlash from other Twitter users. She followed it with a post about the negative responses she had received.
"Well, THAT was eye-opening," she wrote. "To the 10,000 people (literally) who have commented and emailed me with abuse and death threats, please take a moment and read the story -- which was written (more than three) years ago, and not by me."
Ms. Sonmez also posted what appeared to be a screenshot of an email she had received that used offensive language, called her a lewd name and displayed the sender's full name.
She deleted the three tweets after being told to do so by Tracy Grant, the newspaper's managing editor, but not before other journalists captured them in screen shots.
The Post confirmed the paid suspension on Monday, but didn't specify which of the tweets had prompted it to take action.
"National political reporter Felicia Sonmez was placed on administrative leave while The Post reviews whether tweets about the death of Kobe Bryant violated the Post newsroom's social media policy," Ms. Grant said in a statement. "The tweets displayed poor judgment that undermined the work of her colleagues."
After Ms. Sonmez deleted the tweets on Sunday, she received an email from Ms. Grant acknowledging the threats she had received.
"Thank you for deleting the tweets," Ms. Grant wrote to her in an email that Ms. Sonmez shared with The Times. "You might want to consider a hotel or a friend's place for this evening."
The reaction among Ms. Sonmez's colleagues started to emerge on Monday with a post on Erik Wemple Blog, The Post's media criticism column, and in a letter that was organized by the NewsGuild, the union that represents Post journalists, and signed by more than 200 staff members, including the paper's most prominent reporters.
In his post, Mr. Wemple called the suspension "misguided."
The letter signed by Post journalists, which was addressed to Mr. Baron and Ms. Grant, criticized how the paper handled the matter.
"Felicia received an onslaught of violent messages, including threats that contained her home address, in the wake of a tweet Sunday regarding Kobe Bryant," the letter said. "Instead of protecting and supporting a reporter in the face of abuse, The Post placed her on administrative leave while newsroom leaders review whether she violated the social media policy."
While acknowledging the tragedy of Mr. Bryant's death, the letter went on to note that "we believe it is our responsibility as a news organization to tell the public the whole truth as we know it -- about figures and institutions both popular and unpopular, at moments timely and untimely."
Ms. Sonmez said in an interview that she did not add any commentary of her own to the tweet that included a link to the Daily Beast article.
"Because The Post does have policies governing these things, all I did was tweet out a link to the story," she said. "I didn't think it was my place to provide any further commentary."
When others on social media started sending her messages that called her rude names and made death threats and rape threats, she followed The Post's security protocol by contacting Ms. Grant.
Ms. Grant wrote back, telling her to delete the tweets on Mr. Bryant. By then, Ms. Sonmez said, someone had posted her home address online.
In the many emails she received on Sunday, Ms. Sonmez said she had missed the one from Mr. Baron, adding that she did not read it until the next afternoon.
The debate over when it is appropriate to note the flaws and mistakes of prominent people in the immediate aftermath of their deaths is common on social media. The reaction against Ms. Sonmez's tweets seemed fueled by how the #MeToo movement has complicated the legacies of artists, actors, athletes and other popular figures who have been accused of sexual misconduct.
Mr. Bryant reached a settlement with his accuser in 2005, more than a decade before powerful men including the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, the CBS anchor Charlie Rose and the CBS Corporation chief executive Leslie Moonves left their posts or were ousted from their roles after allegations were made against them.
Ms. Sonmez said she was in The Post's newsroom at the time of her tweets.
"I expected to get some blowback," she said. "I can understand that it would be difficult for people to read that, but it's also difficult, I imagine, for all of the survivors in the country to see these allegations essentially be erased, which is how I felt in those couple of hours in the newsroom."
Ms. Sonmez was one of two women who accused Jonathan Kaiman, a Beijing bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times, of sexual misconduct. After The Los Angeles Times conducted an investigation in 2018, Mr. Kaiman resigned.
The journalist Emily Yoffe wrote an article last year on the accusations against Mr. Kaiman and their repercussions for Reason, a magazine published by the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank. Ms. Sonmez criticized the article for what she described as its omissions and "basic" factual errors. Reason updated the article and appended a note at the end of it to address what it called "three minor matters of fact." Ms. Sonmez posted some of her criticisms on Twitter.
The NewsGuild and The Post's journalists referred to the reporter's personal history in their letter on Monday.
"This is not the first time that The Post has sought to control how Felicia speaks on matters of sexual violence," the letter said. "Felicia herself is a survivor of assault who bravely came forward with her story two years ago."
After saying that The Post had shown an "utter disregard for best practices in supporting survivors of sexual violence," the letter called the paper's social media policy arbitrary and overbroad, adding, "We have repeatedly seen colleagues -- including members of management -- share contentious opinions on social media platforms without sanction. But here a valued colleague is being censured for making a statement of fact."

Texto completo: The Spotted Pig, the Manhattan gastro pub at the center of a sexual harassment scandal that devastated the careers of the celebrated chefs Mario Batali and April Bloomfield, served its last meal Sunday night.
The closing came less than a month after Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, announced that Ken Friedman, the principal owner, had agreed to settle claims of sexual harassment, retaliation and gender discrimination by 11 former employees in a deal that included a share of the restaurant's profits for a decade.
The closing was confirmed Monday by Mr. Friedman, who said in a statement: "For over two years I have done everything possible to keep the Spotted Pig open. I've been working to try to raise funds or sell my shares, in order to save the business, to continue to support our great employees -- many of whom have been with us for over a decade -- so they could keep their jobs and health benefits."
Mr. Friedman said that the closing put 78 full- and part-time employees out of work, but that he had helped many of them find new jobs.
How the closing will affect the settlement is not clear. According to the agreement, the employees were to divide a lump payment of $ 240,000 from Mr. Friedman, then 20 percent of his profits from the Spotted Pig for 10 years. That 20 percent share would include any profits from a sale of the restaurant within that period. (The former employees had pushed for a bigger lump sum, but because Mr. Friedman claimed financial difficulties, they agreed to take a percentage of the restaurant's profits instead.)
The attorney general's office confirmed Monday that the former employees would still be entitled to the cash payout from Mr. Friedman if the business closed outright and was not sold.
Jamie Seet, one of the former employees who joined in the agreement, said she had long suspected that they would not receive any money from the profit-sharing arrangement. "Today, my main feeling is sadness for the people who lost their jobs, and for the end of something that was a big part of my life," she said.
In his statement, Mr. Friedman suggested that his resources were exhausted: "I've spent all my family's savings to keep the Pig open. Sadly, it wasn't enough. We've been unable to raise funds or sell the business, which we needed to do to pay the rent and other debts. The Pig has been running in the red for a long time. And so it must close.
"I love the Spotted Pig and all the staff who helped make it such an iconic place," the statement added. "I'm sorry I did not create a sustainable work environment. Its closing is the saddest thing I've had to face in my professional life. I want to thank our loyal employees and devoted patrons, who have been like family."
The Spotted Pig was a hit among New Yorkers as soon as Mr. Friedman opened it in 2004 with Ms. Bloomfield, and became an international destination when the restaurant won a Michelin star a year after opening. Waits stretched hours for the chance to eat Ms. Bloomfield's famous burger with Roquefort cheese and shoestring fries (priced at $ 29 on Sunday's final dinner menu) and to spot celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Jay-Z as they were whisked upstairs to a private room.
(Jay-Z is an owner of the building.)
"It was like a kids' clubhouse, but with the best food and most beautiful people," said Jessica Steinberg, a writer who said she was a regular there in the early years. "The magic was that when you finally got in, you felt like you belonged there."
Over the past weekend, current and former employees mourned its closing.
"It almost feels like a family member died or something," said Robinson Muir, 32, who started working at the Spotted Pig as a busboy when he was 18 and spent eight years working in the front of the house there and at the Breslin in Manhattan's Ace Hotel, which Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield opened in 2009, and which Ms. Bloomfield still operates as chef.
Mr. Muir and other current and former employees spent much of Sunday texting, posting on social media and commiserating.

"We all kind of grew up there, and it was one of the places I thought would never go away," said Mr. Muir, who has since moved to Seattle, where he works for Microsoft. "Obviously we empathize with the women, and are glad they are getting the justice they deserve, but it's like dealing with abusive parents in a way. You have such mixed and sort of complicated feelings about it."
The claims about working conditions at the Spotted Pig were first reported in a December 2017 article in The New York Times. Immediately, the once-thriving empire of restaurants that Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield built as partners began to disintegrate.
An independent investigation by the attorney general's office found that since the restaurant's opening, Mr. Friedman had created a hostile workplace where female employees were subjected to pervasive sexual harassment by him and by guests of the restaurant, including Mr. Batali. It also found that Ms. Bloomfield and other people in positions of authority did not try to stop the harassment.
Since the Times report appeared, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield have been dissolving their partnership. Ms. Bloomfield still owns 24 percent of the Spotted Pig. All of the seven restaurants they opened together, with the exception of the Breslin, have closed or been sold.
In 2018, the chefs Gabrielle Hamilton and Ashley Merriman, owners of Prune in the East Village, offered to buy part of the Spotted Pig and rebuild it alongside Mr. Friedman as a model workplace for women, an idea that was greeted with heated criticism because Mr. Friedman would continue to receive financial benefit. The two withdrew their offer soon afterward.
Now that the restaurant has closed, some of the former employees who came forward with accounts of harassment and received a settlement are trying to buy what remains of the restaurant -- or work something out with investors and the owners of the building, who are looking to sell it, said one of the women, Trish Nelson.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Hours after a bombshell report led some Republican senators, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, to consider a deal for witnesses in President Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial, the White House defense team on Monday turned their focus to Hunter Biden.
Mr. Trump's defense lawyers argued Mr. Biden defied long-standing conflict of interest and corruption concerns when he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating that company.
The lawyers sought to show senators that Mr. Trump's interest that Ukraine announce an investigation into Burisma for corruption was - rather than targeting the son of a political opponent - rooted in legitimate concerns.
"What was Hunter Biden doing at Burisma in exchange for millions of dollars?" asked Eric Herschmann, an attorney for Mr. Trump. "Nobody has ever investigated why."
Hunter Biden had few, if any, qualifications to oversee operations at an oil and gas firm, Mr. Herschmann added. "He did have one qualification: He was the son of the vice president of the United States," he said.
Monday's presentations were praised by many Senate Republicans who spoke with reporters during breaks in the trial. Yet the defense team's tactics added another wrinkle in a looming battle this week over whether to call witnesses and issue subpoenas for documents.
Support for witnesses grew after a report in The New York Times on Sunday. The Times reported a draft copy of an upcoming book from John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, stated the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.
Mr. Trump's hold on that military aid, along with delaying a coveted White House meeting, was at the center of the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last September. The House voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
House Democrats asserted Mr. Trump betrayed U.S. national security interests by pressuring the American ally to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. The former vice president is running for the Democratic nomination to face Mr. Trump in November.
Democrats have been calling for Mr. Bolton to testify for months. Mr. Bolton - who left the Trump administration days before the surfacing of the whistleblower report that sparked the impeachment inquiry - has direct knowledge of the president's motivations in Ukraine, Democrats have argued.
Setting the ground rules for the trial last week, Senate Republicans voted down Senate Democrats' numerous attempts to call any witnesses until both sides presented arguments and senators finished a round of questioning.
Mr. Bolton's draft manuscript, which was not independently viewed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, appeared to sway some key Republican senators on Monday. Four Republican senators would have to join the 47 Senate Democrats in approving a measure.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement Monday that Mr. Bolton's disclosure"strengthens the case" for the Senate to call witnesses.
"I've always said that I was likely to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial," Ms. Collins stated. She added she would make a final decision later.
Another key senator, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said it's "increasingly likely" Republican senators would vote to call witnesses. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are also coming under pressure.
Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, tweeted at all four Republican senators that "it's time to keep faith with the American people and call for witnesses."
Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey floated the idea of a "one-for-one" deal on witnesses, meaning Democrats could call Mr. Bolton and Republicans could choose a witness to call. The proposal was first reported by The Washington Post.
Mr. Toomey's office declined to comment on the report. In a statement Monday, Mr. Toomey said he "will make a determination regarding the need for additional witnesses - including Ambassador John Bolton - after the president's lawyers make their presentation and senators have had a chance to pose questions."
If Republicans wind up calling witnesses, Hunter Biden could be the focus.
White House lawyers on Monday laid out years of news reports - and some witness testimony from the House impeachment proceedings - that questioned the appearance of Hunter Biden's board seat while Burisma was under investigation for money laundering and other crimes.
Pam Bondi, an attorney for Mr. Trump, showed the testimony of one witness, a diplomat who has served during the Obama and Trump administrations, who raised concerns to the former vice president's office in a February 2015 phone call.
George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators he told the office Hunter Biden's role "could create the perception of a conflict of interest." The Ukrainian oligarch who owned Burisma "stood out for his self-dealings," Mr. Kent testified.
"Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden's involvement agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest," Ms. Bondi said.
After the presentation, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Mr. Trump was "entirely justified" in pushing Ukraine to investigate Burisma. Though Mr. Cruz does not think witnesses are necessary, he said, "at a minimum, the most important witness for the Senate to hear from is now Hunter Biden."
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said "we will decide Friday on witnesses" and that it could "be a group of individuals."
Other Republicans suggested the whistleblower could be called.
If Senate goes down the road of calling witnesses, "you gotta go all the way to the end," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who has advised the president's impeachment defense. "And that would be to call the whistleblower that started this whole thing."
Though the news surrounding Mr. Bolton's book commanded the media spotlight, White House lawyers on Monday largely ignored it.
Kenneth Starr, who led the investigation that spurred the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, lectured senators for more than an hour that this impeachment inquiry is unprecedentedly unfair, in part because House Democrats did not allege Mr. Trump committed a crime.
Mr. Starr, now an attorney for Mr. Trump, said senators should weigh the unusual partisan nature of Mr. Trump's impeachment proceedings and the "grave disruption" an impeachment would bring in an election year.
The Senate "would do well to guide the nation to return to our country's traditions when presidential impeachment was truly a measure of last resort," Mr. Starr said.
Senate Democrats said Mr. Starr, by arguing senators should be impartial, inadvertently made their case for more information.
"The president's lawyers continue to make the case for witnesses and documents," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "What's a court without witnesses and documents?"
"The case for witnesses became ever stronger last night," Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., in a video posted to Twitter during a trial break he recorded with his Senate floor neighbors, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.
"I feel like we're in an alternative universe sitting in there," Ms. Klobuchar said, saying there are "game-changing revelations" in Mr. Bolton's manuscript.

The John Bolton bombshell

Texto completo: In defending President Trump at his Senate impeachment trial, his lawyers have hammered the point that no quid pro quo has been proved -- that the House of Representatives produced no direct evidence that Trump had tied security aid for Ukraine to that country announcing investigations that would benefit him politically.
But no sooner had the lawyers begun making this argument over the weekend than the Bolton bombshell hit. According to a report in the New York Times, Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton has written in a forthcoming book that the president told him in August that he wanted the money frozen until Ukrainian officials promised the investigations he sought, including an inquiry into former Vice President Joe Biden.
The Senate should have demanded Bolton's testimony even before the latest news hit. But this sensational development makes it indispensable. It's simply unacceptable for the Senate, which is deciding whether to remove Trump from office, to deny itself access to information that Bolton is willing to share with people who purchase his book. Republican senators who rush to a vote without calling Bolton -- or other relevant witnesses, such as White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- will be dishonoring their oath to judge the case against Trump impartially.

The House asked Bolton to testify during its impeachment injury, but he refused and the House declined to subpoena his testimony, fearing a protracted court battle. Still, it long has been evident that Bolton could shed crucial light on a question that Trump's defenders have put at the heart of their defense. "Most of the Democrats' witnesses have never spoken to the president at all, let alone about Ukraine security assistance," Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura told the Senate.
Well, here's their chance to hear from someone who did speak to the president. Bolton has made it clear that he has much to say and that he's willing to say it if he is subpoenaed. It would be a miscarriage of justice for the Republicans to turn a deaf ear in their zeal to protect Trump.
The president has denied that there was a quid pro quo; he and his defense team insist that he put the aid on hold because he was concerned about Ukrainian corruption and foreign aid generally. On Monday, Trump also denied telling Bolton that there was any linkage, tweeting: "If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
But it's not news that Bolton might have opposed efforts to press Ukrainians to investigate Trump's political opponents. Fiona Hill, Trump's former national security advisor on Russian and European affairs, testified in the House that Bolton described as a "drug deal" efforts to condition a coveted White House meeting for Volodymyr Zelensky on the Ukrainian leader proceeding with investigations Trump desired. Hill also said that Bolton described Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer and the architect of a shadow U.S. policy on Ukraine, as a "hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up."
If Bolton were subpoenaed, Trump probably would assert a claim of executive privilege. But Bolton's statements seems to leave open the possibility that, like the current and former officials who testified in the House, he would speak his piece despite opposition from the White House.
To reach the majority vote needed to summon Bolton and other witnesses to testify, four Republican senators would have to cross the aisle and vote in favor. But that's what is necessary for the president and the country to receive a full and fair trial. Even before the report about Bolton's book, there was no rational argument for forgoing witness testimony. But protestations by Republicans that witness testimony is unnecessary ring especially hollow now.

Tabloid: Bezos story isn't tied to phone hack

Texto completo: A year ago, the National Enquirer devoted 11-pages to a blockbuster story about the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, and his extramarital affair with former local television host Lauren Sanchez.
The story started a fevered hunt to determine how the tabloid managed to pull off the audacious scoop. That search has involved federal investigators, tabloid techniques and scandal mongering, a private investigation by Bezos and, most recently, a report from the United Nations that asserts that the Amazon founder and chief executive was a target of phone hacking by Saudi Arabia in part because he owns The Washington Post, whose opinion-page coverage of the regime had been critical.
Despite the multipronged investigations, unanswered questions remain about how the Enquirer and parent company AMI obtained the story.
Three people close to AMI, who were not authorized to speak publicly, say that Lauren Sanchez's brother Michael Sanchez " a talent manager in Hollywood who had previously placed stories in AMI publications " is the only source for their report on the Bezos affair. But the Bezos investigation, as echoed by the U.N. report, asserts that it has evidence of a Saudi hack of his phone. The investigation stopped short of connecting the hack of Bezos's phone to the Enquirer report.
Months after the alleged hack, Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was a prominent critic of the Saudi kingdom, was slain at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 by agents of the Saudi government.
The U.N. report, which explained how Bezos's iPhone X was apparently hacked, spurred a spate of news stories last week and a renewed declaration from AMI that its story on Bezos was not based on an international hack but on a much more pedestrian source.
'The single source of our reporting has been well documented,' AMI said in a statement to The Post. 'In September of 2018, Michael Sanchez began providing all materials and information to our reporters. Any suggestion that a third party was involved in or in any way influenced our reporting is false.' The Post has previously reported that Sanchez provided texts to the Enquirer for its reporting on the affair.
Indeed, in October 2018, Michael Sanchez and AMI entered into a nondisclosure agreement 'concerning certain information, photographs and text messages documenting an affair between Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez,' according to three people who have reviewed the agreement. The existence of the contract was first reported by the New York Times. One of those people also confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that federal prosecutors who are investigating whether the Enquirer tried to extort Bezos have reviewed the text messages that Lauren Sanchez allegedly gave to her brother and that he then provided to the tabloid.
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment. A spokesman for Bezos,-Jay-Carney, declined to comment.
Disclosing the identity of an anonymous source is an unusual step for a tabloid, but AMI is under legal pressure to prove that it did not do anything illegal in its reporting on the Bezos affair.
AMI reached a deal with prosecutors in September 2018 in which it admitted to paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to protect Donald Trump from allegations that he had an extramarital affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal. David Pecker, AMI's chief executive, has a long relationship with Trump and has devoted many issues to promoting him and attacking his rivals.
That deal protected the company from prosecution as long as it did not break any law for three years.
After the story on Bezos's personal life, federal prosecutors in New York questioned AMI officials and people around Bezos and Sanchez to determine whether AMI engaged in anything illegal while working on the story.
Meanwhile, Bezos began conducting his own investigation to determine how his texts ended up in the tabloid. A week after the Enquirer's story, Bezos wrote an extraordinary post on the online publishing platform Medium alleging that the Enquirer threatened to publish intimate pictures of him unless he backed off his investigation.
Michael Sanchez declined to comment for this report but referred to a statement he provided to The Post last year, saying that he would not 'dignify' with a response 'baseless smears' that he provided AMI with any of the couple's text messages. He emphatically denied providing explicit photos of Bezos, which so far have not appeared in any publication.
After Bezos's Medium post, AMI's board announced plans to investigate Bezos's claim that he had been the subject of a blackmail attempt by AMI. Subsequently, the company announced a plan to sell the Enquirer to Hudson Media. That deal, announced in April 2019, still has not closed.
The Enquirer's multiple stories on the Bezos affair relied on text messages between Bezos and Sanchez and on candid photos taken from a distance. But in emails to Bezos that the billionaire posted on Medium after the story published, AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard threatened to release intimate photos of Bezos, which he considered extortion and blackmail.
The U.N. report was based in part on an investigation conducted by FTI Consulting, a global business advisory firm hired by Bezos's personal security consultant, Gavin de Becker. The report does not establish a connection between the removal of data from Bezos's phone and the story on his affair, but neither does it definitively rule one out.
De Becker early on accused the Saudis of hacking Bezos's phone. What connection any alleged hacking of Bezos's phone has to the Enquirer articles is still a mystery.
'It's possible that the Saudis hacked Bezos's phone and Michael Sanchez independently got the photos from his sister, and some people were trying to get paid and some people were trying to get Bezos,' said a person with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly about its progress. 'It's not like there's just one explanation.'
Last week at the Sundance Film Festival, Oscar-winning director Bryan Fogel, who previously investigated Russian doping with the film 'Icarus,' unveiled a documentary about the Khashoggi killing called 'The Dissident.'
The film prompted renewed questions about what connection there might be between Khashoggi's death and the tabloid story.
The U.N. report's release, which was reportedly moved up because of the imminent premiere of the film, said that a forensic probe of Bezos's phone conducted by FTI 'suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince [Mohammed bin Salman] in surveillance of Mr. Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia.'
At a meeting of world leaders in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud called the U.N. report 'absurd.' 'The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos's phone is absolutely silly,' the official said.
In a statement released Wednesday with the U.N. report, human rights investigators Agnes Callamard and David Kaye called for the United States and other nations to probe the alleged hacking of Bezos's phone as part of a larger look at what they called 'the continuous, multiyear, direct and personal involvement of the Crown Prince in efforts to target perceived opponents.'

Texto completo: More than a dozen pages allegedly detail exchanges with Trump over Ukraine
Just outside the spacious corner office of the White House national security adviser, aides crowded into a windowless anteroom knew to make themselves small when John Bolton got a summons from President Trump. Bolton, his ubiquitous yellow legal pad in hand, would throw open his door and set off at a gallop.
Once in the Oval Office, Bolton would take copious notes on that pad, at times angering a president known to mistrust note-taking by even his closest aides, according to a former senior administration official.
Leaks from Bolton's soon-to-be-published memoir, in which he alleges a direct link between Trump's withholding of aid to Ukraine and his desire that its government investigate his political rivals, validated the president's suspicions in the eyes of some senior White House officials.
Bolton, who left the White House in September " Trump said he was fired; Bolton said he resigned " did not respond to a question about whether he had used personal notes or official documents in his book.
The manuscript includes more than a dozen pages on Bolton's interactions over Ukraine with Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others, according to one person familiar with the project. In what this person called an 'unflattering' portrait of the president, it also touches on other areas where Bolton is known to have disagreed with Trump policy decisions, including Venezuela and Turkey.
But another former senior official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, said Bolton 'didn't need to have' documents or his own notes from inside the White House, 'since he probably went home every night and wrote about it.'
Noting the rapid completion of Bolton's book, 'I'm convinced he was writing all the time' he served as national security adviser, said this former official, who described Bolton as a nose-to-the-grindstone person who rarely socialized.
The weekend revelations landed like a bombshell in the ongoing Senate impeachment trial over the Ukraine matter, where key Republican lawmakers on Monday indicated they may defy the GOP leadership to support calling Bolton and other witnesses.
People close to Bolton said he wanted to testify, and a spokeswoman denied that he was behind the leak of the book, adding that the National Security Council has had a copy of it since Dec. 30.
Bolton was regularly appalled by what he saw from the president, the people close to him said. He wondered at times if Trump was acting in America's best interest or if he was inspired by nefarious reasons, according to a person familiar with the book.
But among conservative national security experts and media, the focus was less on the accuracy of Bolton's account, or its possible effect on the trial, and more on why he wrote it.
'If he wants to write a book like this, it should come out after the election,' Fred Fleitz said in an interview. Fleitz was the National Security Council's chief of staff for part of Bolton's 17-month White House tenure and a Bolton associate for decades.
'It's natural occasionally for presidential advisers to have a falling out,' said Fleitz, referring to Bolton's departure. 'It's appropriate for the adviser to move on.'
In an opinion column on the Fox News website, Fleitz said he failed to see the need for 'a former national security adviser to publish a tell-all book critical of a president he served,' especially in the midst of a campaign 'that will determine the fate of the country.'
He called on Bolton to withdraw the book " titled 'The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir' " until after the election.
Others were more direct. 'Bolton has sadly reduced himself to nothing more than an unprincipled tool of the Radical Dems and Deep State: And he's sacrificed his integrity to sell a lousy spiteful book, pathetic,' Fox host Lou Dobbs wrote on Twitter about a man who had long been a regular on Dobbs's show.
Giuliani, in a message to The Washington Post, called Bolton a 'backstabber' and said he regretted recommending him to Trump.
Trump, he said, 'never really trusted the Backstabber's judgment. He was right and I was wrong because ironically I supported him for the job.'
White House officials and Trump advisers cast Bolton as a pugnacious figure disliked by many of his colleagues " contemporaneous accounts supported that " who was simply looking for a payday.
'How convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time as preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,' Steve Guest, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said on Twitter. 'What a joke.'
Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, denied in an interview that he or his client had anything to do with the leaked portions of the book, first published Sunday by the New York Times. 'I can tell you unequivocally that we had nothing to do with the leak of any information concerning John's manuscript,' Cooper said.
Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, defended Bolton and bemoaned that 'in the demonization campaign' against him, 'many forget that at the end of the day he was and remains a deeply experienced policy practitioner, with decades of experience over multiple administrations.'
Calling Bolton a 'deeply principled person who . . . has a deep respect for American law and for the Constitution,' Dubowitz said he was certain Bolton was 'not doing this to sell books and not doing this to get revenge because he was fired by the president.'
Dubowitz also said he was 'super torn.'
'I'm not a big fan of these tell-all books. . . . I wonder how good it is for our country when presidents are always going to be looking over their shoulders and behind their backs,' he said.
Another foreign policy expert on the right, who considers himself a friend of Bolton and an admirer of Trump, said he was surprised Bolton took the White House job in the first place.
'When he was announced, I thought, 'Oh, my God, this is never going to work.' The reason is that it's very clear that Bolton and Trump have very different ideas on how foreign policy should be run.'
Bolton, this expert said, is 'an offensive realist' who thinks you 'use power to get power.' Trump, on the other hand, is a 'defensive realist' who 'thinks power is a wasting asset . . . that you only use when you really need to.
'They did work very well on a lot of issues. Then the relationship just kind of broke down. . . . There was clearly a personal animosity there at the end.'

How would you feel if Trump had apologized for his behavior toward Ukraine?

Texto completo: David Brooks, the smart, decent, humble, moderately conservative New York Times columnist, speaking about the impeachment trial in the Senate on the weekly (Mark) “Shields and Brooks” segment of the “PBS NewsHour,” captured (for me at least) one of the things that drives me nuts about the current Oval Office incumbent — namely his insistence on his own perfection in the face of constant evidence of his imperfection.
President Donald Trump, in case you haven’t heard, held up military aid to a struggling U.S. ally, Ukraine, to pressure Ukraine into announcing a bogus investigation of Joe Biden. (Yeah, I know, you’ve heard about it.)
This extortion scheme was bad. Very bad. Perhaps worth impeaching and removing Trump. I would vote to convict Trump for this abuse of his office, and for the contempt of Congress he has shown by the additional coverup activities and assorted lies and his insistence that every Republican elected official toe the line — on pain of political execution and at the cost of their dignity, their honor and their soul — that Trump did absolutely nothing wrong and that the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was “perfect.”
But here’s what Brooks said on PBS:
This is an interesting counterfactual. Suppose they (Senate Republicans) had a president who was a reasonable human being who could say: “I messed up. I apologize. I’ll make it up to Ukraine. But it’s not worth removing me over.”
That was sort of the Clinton approach during his impeachment process.
But Trump has laid down the law, that it’s going to be all or nothing, and that requires a massive denial of reality on the part of all Republicans.
I agree with Brooks. I have shocked some of my liberal friends by saying that if Trump had admitted that he had improperly pressured Zelenskiy, apologized and asked to be forgiven, I might be on the side of censuring Trump but not removing him from office.
Perhaps not, but I would at least see that as a reasonable alternative to the extreme option of removing a president less than a year before the electorate has the option of removing him.
If Trump had done that somewhat less of a dangerous megalo- and ego-maniac thing, acknowledged that he had made a mistake and apologized for it, the idea of leaving his fate up to the voters in 2020 would seem more reasonable.
Brooks didn’t specify this, but, to me, Trump’s refusal to acknowledge that he abused his power, coupled with his (almost completely successful) insistence that all Republicans repeat the ridiculous claim of “perfection,” is more frightening than the original act itself.
The phone call was not “perfect.” It was, in fact, an abuse of the leverage he held over a small, embattled, struggling new democracy and its very admirable young president.
I suppose most politicians lie a bit, or at least dissemble and posture and shave the truth around the edges. That’s not great; it’s a minor disgrace, but it’s normal and survivable for a democracy.
But lying more often than you tell the truth is not normal, and then insisting (successfully!) that every member of one of America’s two major political parties support your lie, repeat your lies, agree that your lies were truths and that your utterances were “perfect” is much, much worse, and much, much more dangerous.

Bombshell book: What we know about John Bolton's allegations about Trump and Ukraine

Resumen: Former national security adviser John Bolton reportedly claims in his book that Trump directly tied military aid to Ukraine to investigations.

Texto completo: In his upcoming book, former national security adviser John Bolton writes that President Donald Trump told him he did not wish to release military aid to Ukraine until that country helped with investigations that could be damaging to Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, according to media reports.
Since the allegations surfaced in September that Trump withheld $391 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine into conducting the probes, the president has insisted the aid was not held up for political purposes. On Monday he sharply denied Bolton's claims reported by The New York Times, Washington Post and the Associated Press.
The Times report has ramped up Democrats' call for additional witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial. The House impeachment managers and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Bolton's reported claims directly contradict key elements of Trump's defense and that a fair trial requires his testimony.
Here is what we know about the book and the reactions to its reported content:
What Bolton says
Citing multiple people who had seen the unpublished manuscript, the New York Times reported that Bolton said Trump told him during a meeting in August that he did not want to release the military aid until Ukraine provided information related to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton and Biden.
The Washington Post reported that two people familiar with the manuscript confirmed the Times' characterization of Bolton's account.
Bolton wrote that Trump remained bitter that some Ukrainian officials openly backed Clinton in 2016, which he conflated with a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani helped stoke his concerns about Ukraine and his animosity toward then-U. S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Bolton said.
Bolton wrote that he, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper unsuccessfully tried to persuade Trump to release the aid on several occasions, according to the Times.
The book, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," is set for publication on March 17, according to Amazon.

"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet early Monday. "In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. "
He repeated his claim that a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows he did not act improperly – though Democrats say the call proves the exact opposite – and retweeted several posts that attacked Bolton's credibility.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Fox News on Monday that "the timing of all this is very, very suspect. "
"The president did nothing wrong, and we stand by exactly what we've been saying all along," Grisham said.
Giuliani also spoke out against Bolton on Twitter.
"There is no way in the world President Trump would say this to John Bolton. It’s a shame that a man will sacrifice his integrity to make a few bucks on a book. No wonder he accomplished so little as National Security Advisor," he wrote.
Democrats insist Bolton be subpoenaed
The manuscript reports ramped up calls from Democrats for the Senate to issue Bolton a subpoena in the impeachment trial.
"There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president’s defense and therefore must be called as a witness at the impeachment trial of President Trump," the seven Democratic House impeachment managers said in a joint statement responding to the report.
"John Bolton has the evidence," Schumer said Sunday in a tweet calling on Republican senators to join Democrats in a vote to allow additional testimony.
Democrats have wanted Bolton to testify since the impeachment inquiry began, but the House committees did not issue him a subpoena after Bolton said he would fight it in court. Democrats claimed the legal battle would delay the impeachment too long. But after the House impeached Trump on articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Bolton said he was "prepared to testify" if the Senate issued him a subpoena.
Will witnesses be called? Handful of key Senate Republicans will determine whether to call witnesses at President Trump's trial
How will the book affect the trial?
After Trump's legal team finishes presenting its case, senators will have 16 hours to submit questions, according to the impeachment rules that were approved last week. At that point, senators will debate whether to call additional witnesses.
It will require a simple majority to approve the issuing of subpoenas. It is unclear whether four Republicans will vote with Democrats to approve such a measure or whether the report about what Bolton has to say might influence their decision. Though a number of Republicans have rejected the idea of issuing subpoenas, arguing that was the House's responsibility, others have signaled they may wish to hear more testimony.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who said she would make her decision on witnesses after both sides had presented their arguments, said in a statement on Monday that reports about Bolton’s book "strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues. "
Utah Sen. Mitt Romney told MSBNC that it’s "increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton. "
The news about Bolton's book did not sway Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, who said Monday it was "the House's job" to put the case together and warned that subpoenaing Bolton "could stretch this out for weeks and months" if the administration asserted executive privilege.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , a staunch Trump supporter who a day earlier said he had already seen "more than enough to make my decision," conceded it could be "important" to know what was in Bolton's manuscript, according to NBC News.

Who saw the manuscript?
Bolton's attorney Charles Cooper said in a statement that they gave the White House a copy of the manuscript for review on Dec. 30, which is common practice when a current or former administration official writes about their tenure.
Cooper blamed the White House for the leak to the Times and said the article shows "the review process corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript. "
But National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said only the NSC had seen the manuscript.
"No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript," he said.
Grisham told Fox News the manuscript had been "kept walled off for obvious reasons. " She said it was suspicious that "this manuscript magically appeared" after Trump's team opened its defense indicates and that the Amazon link then suddenly went up, implying it was an orchestrated effort by the book's publisher.
Bolton and his publishers, Simon & Schuster and Javelin Literary, "categorically" denied any coordination with the Times "or anyone else regarding the appearance of information about his book," in a statement.
"Any assertion to the contrary is unfounded speculation," the statement said.

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton has become a central figure in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump and the debate over whether senators should subpoena additional witnesses.
After Bolton failed to appear voluntarily before a House impeachment hearing in November, his lawyer Charles Cooper told the investigating committees that his client was "personally involved" in meetings relevant to the inquiry into whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine for political reasons.
On Sunday, news outlets reported that a manuscript for Bolton's upcoming book says Trump explicitly told Bolton he did not want to release the aid until Ukraine helped with investigations related to the 2016 election and Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
Because Bolton's reported claim would contradict the president who has insisted the decision to delay the aid was rooted in concerns about corruption, not politics, the news about his book sharply intensified Democrats' demand that he be called to testify.
So who is the man who Democrats say could provide "explosive" information in the impeachment trial?
Bolton's bombshell book: What we know about John Bolton's allegations about Trump and Ukraine
A fierce and fiery hawk
Bolton, 71, is a Yale graduate, lawyer and diplomat who served as President George W. Bush's ambassador to the United Nations.
He has long advocated an aggressive U. S. foreign policy and the use of American military might, including the right to strike first against potential threats. He was a strong proponent of the 2003 U. S. invasion of Iraq and still believes toppling Saddam Hussein was the right move, despite the failure to find weapons of mass destruction and the costly occupation.
After leaving the Bush administration, Bolton espoused his hawkish views as a columnist and Fox News commentator. In that role, he called for preemptive military action against Iran and North Korea.
In 2015, he wrote an op-ed that ran in The New York Times titled, "To stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran. " And in a 2018 piece in The Wall Street Journal that ran just before he was tapped to become Trump's next national security adviser, he argued it was "perfectly legitimate" for the U. S. to strike North Korea first to take out the threat posed by its nuclear weapons.
He also founded the John Bolton PAC and John Bolton Super PAC, which aimed to make national security concerns an election issue.

Clashes with Trump on foreign policy
Bolton was tapped to replace outgoing national security adviser H. R. McMaster in March 2018. And from the beginning, the hawkish Bolton clashed with Trump, who sought to disengage the U. S. from military conflicts rather than beginning new ones.
The president and his national security adviser disagreed on a number of key issues, including peace talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan, withdrawing U. S. troops from Syria and negotiations with North Korea. He also wanted Trump to take more aggressive action against Iran and Venezuela.
The Trump-Bolton breakup was inevitable: Disagreements over Iran, North Korea and more
An acrimonious departure
Trump said he fired Bolton on Sept. 10 because he "disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions. "
But minutes later, Bolton tweeted that he had offered his resignation the night before and Trump had told him, "Let's talk about it tomorrow. " And he texted several journalists saying, "Let's be clear I resigned. "
Washington Post reporter Robert Costa said Bolton told him, "I will have my say in due course. But I have given you the facts on the resignation. My sole concern is US national security. "

Since leaving the Trump White House
After leaving the Trump administration, Bolton returned to his work at the head of his political action committees and announced he would be donating $10,000 to five Republican incumbent reelection campaigns for 2020.
After he failed to appear for the House impeachment inquiry in November, Bolton said he would not honor a subpoena unless he was ordered to by a court. Democrats said they did not want to mire the process in a lengthy legal battle and decided not to subpoena him, even after former aides testified he had decried the alleged attempt to leverage military aid to Ukraine as a "drug deal. "
On Nov. 22, Bolton, who had not tweeted since he disputed the nature of his White House departure, announced that he had "liberated" his Twitter account after being denied access by the White House.
"Out of fear of what I may say?" he wondered.
On Jan. 6, Bolton said in a statement that because it did not appear the legal issues surrounding his testimony would be resolved before the impeachment trial, he decided, "if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify. "

Trump is abusing his tariff power, too

Texto completo: So here’s the story: Donald Trump has abused the powers of his office to threaten a U.S. ally. His threat is probably illegal; his refusal to produce documents about his decision process is definitely illegal. And his claims about the motivation for his actions don’t pass the laugh test.
You probably think I’m talking about Trump’s attempt to pressure Ukraine into producing political dirt on Joe Biden by withholding aid, and the subsequent cover-up — you know, the stuff for which he has been impeached (and that half the country believes should lead to his removal from office).
But there’s another, somewhat similar story: his repeated threats to impose prohibitive tariffs on imports of automobiles from Europe.
Granted, the auto tariff story isn’t as vile as the Ukraine story. But it’s part of the same syndrome: abuse of power, contempt for the rule of law and dishonesty about motivations.
Some background: U.S. tariffs — taxes on imports — are normally set the same way we set other taxes, through legislation that must pass Congress. The law does, however, give the president discretion to impose temporary tariffs under certain circumstances (Section 232).
Until Trump, Section 232 cases were rare. He has, however, used the national security justification for tariffs with abandon and zero regard for plausibility. Canadian aluminum poses a national security risk? Really?
And so, in 2018 the Trump administration announced it was beginning a Section 232 investigation of auto imports, especially from Europe and Japan.
Every trade expert I know considered the notion that German or Japanese cars constitute a threat to national security absurd. Nonetheless, in 2019 a report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports do, indeed, endanger national security.
What was the basis for this conclusion? Well, we don’t actually know — because the Trump administration has refused to release the report.
This stonewalling is clearly illegal. The statute requires that all portions of the Commerce report that don’t contain classified or proprietary information be published in the Federal Register.
Why won’t Trump hand over the document? My guess is, his people are afraid to let anyone see the Commerce report because it’s embarrassingly thin and incompetent.
To be honest, I have some doubts about whether the report even exists. Remember, the Commerce Department is run by Wilbur Ross, whom readers of my colleague Gail Collins voted Trump’s worst Cabinet member — quite a distinction given the competition.
Beyond all that, why does Trump even want to impose tariffs on European cars?
Part of the answer may be that the self-proclaimed Tariff Man still believes that protectionism will revive U.S. manufacturing, even though the evidence says his trade war had the opposite effect.
Beyond that, it appears Trump tried to use the threat of auto tariffs to bludgeon European nations into backing him in his confrontation with Iran. This is, by the way, a clear violation both of U.S. law and international agreements.
Basically, the man in the White House operates on the principle that l’état, c’est Trump. It’s a principle nobody who believes in American ideals should accept.

New John Bolton claim ramps up pressure on GOP to call witnesses

Texto completo: Senate Republicans are recalculating how they will vote on summoning witnesses to President Trump’s impeachment trial following significant allegations from his former national security adviser, John Bolton.
The Senate is expected to vote by Friday on whether to end the trial and vote on two impeachment charges against President Trump or continue with the trial, for weeks, potentially, by calling for new witnesses and documents.
Republicans appeared on the cusp of ending the trial this week, but that all changed late on Sunday when passages of Bolton’s book leaked to the media that seemed to bolster the case by Democrats that Trump sought to use critical security aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.
Republicans said on Monday the new information will change the debate within the GOP conference.
“I don’t think we are going to avoid it,” Sen. Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, told reporters when asked about summoning Bolton as a witness. “We are going to cross that threshold Thursday or Friday.”
Sen. Susan Collins, a key centrist Republican who had been working with other GOP senators to secure the four votes in their party needed to provide a majority for calling witnesses, said the Bolton revelations "strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues.”
Democrats seized on the Bolton claim, revealed in the New York Times, as evidence the GOP cannot ignore as it faces a vote on calling new witnesses.
"It's a bit like Watergate," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said, referring to the investigation that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1973. "Every week, new evidence comes out that is further condemning of the president. Obviously, the revelations in the New York Times strengthen the case for witnesses and documents even more."
The Bolton claims caught the GOP by surprise, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“The leader did not have any advance notice” of the contents of Bolton’s book, a McConnell spokesman said Monday.
Republicans met privately in a room near the Senate chamber before the impeachment trial convened for a seventh day, the second day of defense arguments presented by Trump’s legal team.
Before heading into the trial, McConnell counseled Republicans to continue to listen to the defense before deciding whether to call witnesses.
The defense will conclude by Tuesday, and senators will have 16 hours to ask questions. After that, senators will vote on witnesses.
“There is going to be robust conversation,” Braun said.
Neither Collins nor any other Republican senator has pledged on a vote to call Bolton or other Trump administration officials as witnesses.
Democrats also want to question acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two lower-ranking administration officials.
Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who already expressed a desire to summon witnesses, said the Bolton allegations increased the need for witnesses.
Romney said he believed it would push other Republican lawmakers to agree to witness testimony.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he wants to see Bolton’s manuscript.
Graham rejected calling new witnesses, but, by Monday morning, he said if the Senate decides to call new witnesses, “then, at a minimum, the Senate should allow President Donald Trump to call all relevant witnesses he has requested.”
Trump’s legal team made no mention of John Bolton or his claims about Trump and the security aid, but they warned calling new witnesses would result in the president’s use of executive privilege to block testimony, leading to a court battle and “a new normal” for the Senate’s role in impeachment.
“The proper way is to have the House have to do its investigation,” Patrick Philbin, a member of Trump’s defense team, argued before the Senate on Monday. “It has to be ready to proceed, not transfer the responsibility to this chamber to do the work that hasn’t been done.”

Impeachment defense, Day Two: The Bolton brouhaha

Texto completo: It was entirely predictable that the President Trump impeachment trial would feature a January surprise, and now it has arrived. It came in the form of a New York Times report that former national security adviser John Bolton, in a new book, writes that the president told him that he "wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens."
The words are from the New York Times, not Bolton. Neither the report nor any other has quoted even a word from the Bolton book.
The news jolted the impeachment trial on the second day of the Trump defense, and it gave rise to a dizzying number of questions and scenarios.
The most obvious question is what effect the Bolton book will have on the Democratic push to have Bolton testify in the Senate trial. Democrats asked Bolton to testify before the House Intelligence Committee last October but did not subpoena him or make any effort to compel his testimony. They even withdrew a subpoena for one of Bolton's deputies, claiming that the legal process to enforce a subpoena would take too long.
The Bolton news made it all the more mystifying why the House did not pursue Bolton's testimony. More than three months have passed since it could have issued such a subpoena. The process might be nearly over at this point, with a decision expected soon. And the president would have been given a chance to defend the confidentiality of his relationship with his closest advisers. But the House chose not to act, leaving the issue to Senate Democrats.
The Bolton affair unfolded in a fast-moving series of events:

On the first and most important issue, there is no way to assess what Bolton has written because no one in the public, and that appears to include the news organizations that broke the Bolton story, has read what Bolton has written. What, precisely, did Bolton say, and in what words did he say it? The public is entirely in the dark.
Bolton's lawyer, Washington veteran attorney Chuck Cooper, suggested that Bolton had done everything according to the rules. Cooper said that, on Dec. 30, he sent a copy of the Bolton book to the White House National Security Council for the sole purpose of having it reviewed for possible classified information. Cooper said he had a "firm belief" that the manuscript contained no classified information but sent it to the NSC out of an abundance of caution and also to comply with a nondisclosure agreement Bolton signed when he joined the Trump White House in 2018. Cooper said the Bolton side had behaved properly, but something must have gone awry at the NSC.
"It is clear, regrettably, from the New York Times article published today, that the pre-publication review process has been corrupted," Cooper said in a statement, "and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript."
On the other hand, the New York Times reported that Bolton did more than his lawyer suggested. "Mr. Bolton's explosive account ... was included in drafts of a manuscript he has circulated in recent weeks to close associates," the paper reported. If that is accurate, the Bolton book, or at least a critical part of it, could be all over Washington and beyond. If Bolton sent the book to "close associates," he blew through the confidentiality a president should have with his closest advisers. Of course, if he included such information in a book he hoped to sell to thousands and thousands of customers, well, he really blew through it.
Bolton's side quickly pushed back. His longtime spokeswoman, Sarah Tinsley, told Axios: "[Bolton's] manuscript was transmitted to the White House for pre-publication review by the NSC," she said. "The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period. It was sent over there, to the NSC, several weeks ago."
It was a statement one could read in a nonskeptical way: Neither Bolton nor anyone on his behalf sent the manuscript anywhere, or skeptically: Perhaps Bolton himself didn't send it, but someone acting on his behalf did. One of the darkly amusing things about the whole contretemps was that it involved a bunch of highly skilled lawyers making claims in very, very careful language, so careful that it can be difficult to tell precisely what they are saying. "Because everybody is so sophisticated, it's hard to take any of it at face value," said one lawyer who follows the matter closely.
In any event, team Bolton rejected responsibility for the leak.
Remember, meanwhile, that the public, and that includes the senators hearing the impeachment trial, does not know what Bolton actually wrote. On Monday afternoon, Maggie Haberman, one of the reporters who broke the story for the New York Times, tweeted that Bolton "was not always seen as a reliable narrator by [White House] colleagues." Haberman further characterized the Bolton matter as a "he said, he said" dispute. Whatever the tweet was intended to mean, it did not clarify the situation.
As all that was happening, there was the ongoing question: Did the Trump defense team know what was in Bolton's book? After all, Cooper sent a copy of it to the National Security Council on Dec. 30. Surely in those last four weeks, the defense lawyers would somehow have had a look at it and could prepare to deal with it in their defense, right? Apparently not. On Monday, several sources in and out of the White House said that the book was held closely inside the NSC and that no one else in the White House saw it.
In other words, when the defense lawyers went before the Senate on Saturday and confidently declared that no witness had testified that the president himself ever said there was a connection between investigations, a presidential meeting, and Ukrainian security assistance, they had no idea the Bolton book was just around the corner. So, in a little more than 24 hours, one of their key points blew up in their faces. Of course, that would be true only if the New York Times story accurately portrayed the full meaning and context of what Bolton wrote.
Then there was what was happening on Capitol Hill. One Republican senator said GOP colleagues were unhappy that Bolton had put them in a spot. They had been arguing against calling witnesses to the trial, and then it was revealed that Bolton had already put his account of events on paper. It already exists, right now. It may be spread all over Washington. The cat, in other words, was a long way out of the bag, and now Senate Republicans would have to figure out a way to deal with it.
The usual suspects among wavering Republicans such as Romney, Collins, and Murkowski hinted that they were even more inclined to accept witnesses post-Bolton. And, of course, if Bolton were called to testify, senators would have to have his book, too, to measure his testimony by his written account. One solution, perhaps the only solution, to the problem would be for Bolton to release it all now.
But that argument served to highlight Bolton's financial consideration in the matter. He has a book contract with Simon & Schuster. Both he and the publisher want to sell books. The publication date is March 17. Giving away the whole story for the impeachment trial is probably not a great sales technique, but impeachment is a far more important issue than Bolton's and Simon & Schuster's financial considerations.
When 1 p.m. arrived in the Senate, everyone wanted to know how the Trump legal team would deal with the Bolton news. Would they lead with it? Would they tear up the plan and focus on it? Would they ignore it?
The answer was they would ignore it. At the very beginning of the presentation, defense lawyer Jay Sekulow seemed to be referring, somewhat obliquely, to the controversy when he said, "We deal with transcript evidence. We deal with publicly available information. We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all." And then he moved on to making Trump's case.
In other words: You want us to devote our presentation to a newspaper account that quotes not one word of a book that no one can judge? No way.
Instead, the defense team went ahead with its carefully laid plan for Monday. Part of it was a recreating its strong performance on Saturday. Part was celebrity appearances by Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz. The plan did not include Bolton.
But, offstage, the Bolton argument was raging. Everyone was arguing in the dark, of course. That will not change until the public sees what Bolton wrote.

John Bolton's missing link

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton could be the firsthand witness the Democrats need, according to the New York Times. This qualifier makes Bolton’s testimony relevant to the Senate’s impeachment trial. But in terms of impact, this changes very little.

The New York Times alleges that in Bolton’s new memoir, he says Trump directly tied the Ukrainian military aid freeze to an impending investigation into the Bidens. If this is true, Bolton could be the missing link between the two established facts in the case against Trump. The first fact is that more than $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine was withheld and later released. The White House has denied that the freeze had anything to do with the second fact — that Trump wanted and expected Ukraine to investigate 2016 election meddling and Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings.
If the aid freeze and the investigation were indeed connected, Democrats would have the quid pro quo they need. But this isn’t a bombshell. The House already built its case on the assumption that Trump did deliberately engage in a quid pro quo. Bolton’s affirmation will not persuade the GOP to abandon its line of defense and admit presidential wrongdoing on a level deserving of removal from office.

What’s more: If Democrats suspected Bolton could strengthen their case, they should have subpoenaed him during the House’s impeachment investigation and persisted in their efforts to compel his testimony. It’s worth noting that Bolton’s position has changed — when the House launched its investigation, Bolton said he would testify only if the courts found it necessary. Now, Bolton says he will testify with or without a court order.

Still, the Democrats should have fulfilled their legal responsibility to investigate every single component of this case. Instead, they presented the Senate with two half-baked articles of impeachment, claiming the nature of the allegations against Trump was too urgent to do the thing right. If time was such a concern, then why did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wait to deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate for nearly two months?
Bolton’s missing link makes it all the more clear that the Democratic Party severely fumbled this case by rushing it through the House. Even if Bolton is permitted to testify during the impeachment trial, it’s unlikely his testimony will change the ultimate results. At this point, Senate Republicans are too dug in to reconsider, and the American public is too zoned out to notice.

The most Bolton’s testimony could do is slightly change the vote count. Centrist Sens. Susan Collins and Mitt Romney have already suggested they’ll vote to call Bolton to the Senate, and given their past criticism of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine, it’s likely they could be convinced to vote to convict.

But Democrats need more than two Republican votes to remove Trump from office. The Constitution requires a two-thirds supermajority, which means the Democrats need 66 votes to succeed. Right now, they’re having a tough time securing 51 votes in favor of additional witness testimony.

Bolton’s testimony is important to those who still care about nuance. Unfortunately, both political parties abandoned that long ago. Republicans will almost certainly vote to acquit, Democrats will cry foul play, and Bolton will sell a lot of books. And soon enough, it will be November.

White House says no one outside National Security Council saw Bolton book amid complaints GOP 'blindsided'

Texto completo: Nobody outside the National Security Council had access to an explosive manuscript of John Bolton’s upcoming book that claims President Trump linked aid to Ukraine with a demand that the country investigate Joe Biden, according to a spokesman.
A source familiar with details of the vetting process said the White House has had the manuscript for a month.
The revelations in the text undermine a key defense of Trump in his impeachment trial and prompted Democrats to demand that the former national security adviser appear as a witness.
Four Republicans would have to break ranks and vote with Democrats to call witnesses. GOP leadership sources said last week they were confident they could head off the Democrats’ demand for testimony.
“That’s harder this morning,” said one. “Everyone feels blindsided.”
But a spokesman for the NSC said the manuscript had not been circulated more widely around the White House.
“Ambassador Bolton’s manuscript was submitted to the NSC for prepublication review and has been under initial review by the NSC,” he said. “No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript.”
Tweet
Bolton’s book, The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir, is due to be published on March 17. Its key claims were first reported by the New York Times and confirmed to the Washington Examiner by a source familiar with the text.
Since the manuscript's release, Democrats have stepped up their calls for Bolton to appear.
"Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the president. That starts with Mr. Bolton," the House impeachment managers said in a statement.

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not know the White House possessed an advance copy of John Bolton’s upcoming book.
McConnell told the Washington Examiner on Monday that he "did not have any advance notice" that the White House had a draft copy of the former national security adviser's book, titled, The Room Where It Happened. In a meeting with GOP senators who were "venting angrily to the White House" about a leak of the manuscript, the Kentucky Republican told his colleagues to "take a deep breath, and let’s take one step at a time," according to the New York Times.
Bolton has written a draft of a book describing his time in the Trump administration and turned over an advance copy to the White House National Security Council for officials to comb through for possible national security breaches or to flag sensitive information.
The New York Times reported on Sunday that leaked portions of Bolton's book show the former national security adviser claiming President Trump told him that military aid to Ukraine should not be released until Ukrainian officials agreed to cooperate with investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
Bolton and his publisher have denied leaking the details of the book, while Trump has rejected the claims made in the book.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book," the president tweeted on Monday.

'How much does it cost?': Stephanie Grisham accuses John Bolton of selling out 'potential national security'

Texto completo: White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham accused former national security adviser John Bolton of potentially harming United States national security to sell a book.
Grisham appeared on Fox Business with host Lou Dobbs on Monday and slammed Bolton after details from a draft copy of his forthcoming book leaked, which claimed that President Trump told Bolton that Ukraine would not receive U.S. military aid until Ukrainian officials launched investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
"Here is a man who purports to care about the national security of this country, and to leave the White House and immediately go write a book, it’s really disappointing," Grisham said, referring to Bolton, who left the administration in September.
"I mean, obviously, the information came out with the New York Times last night, and then, a couple hours later, magically, the preorder link was live," Grisham continued. "How much does it cost to sell out potential national security in your country?"
People who had seen the draft copy of Bolton’s book also told the New York Times that Bolton recounted telling Attorney General William Barr he was concerned the president was doing personal favors for the leaders of China and Turkey. After the detail on the Ukraine aid was reported, Bolton and his publisher denied having a hand in the leak.
The former national security adviser sent a copy of his manuscript to the National Security Council in the White House so officials could audit it for potentially sensitive details involving U.S. national security and for classified information. Such audits are routine for former administration officials such as Bolton.
Trump denied the claims on Monday, saying that "if John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."

Mark Levin decries 'cherry-picked' Bolton leak on eve of impeachment defense

Texto completo: Hours before the second day of President Trump's Senate impeachment trial defense began, radio host Mark Levin slammed "cherry-picked leaks" released this weekend from former national security adviser John Bolton's forthcoming memoir, The Room Where It Happened.
"Let me get this straight," Levin tweeted. "John Bolton and his lawyer Chuck Cooper submitted the book manuscript to the [National Security Council] for review, which is notoriously known for leaking, on the eve of the impeachment trial, and they’re now surprised about a cherry-picked leak?"
In passages of the unpublished manuscript released by the New York Times, the former diplomat claimed Trump withheld aid to the Ukrainians in the hopes of securing an investigation into political rival Joe Biden.
The impeachment trial entered its second week today with Trump's defense team set to deliver its second day of arguments. The president's team made light work of its first day of defense, closing arguments after only three hours, drawing a stark contrast with the marathon presentations by Democrats, which lasted well into the night.
Bolton, 71, is considered a key witness for Democrats who believe the former White House insider has information that will bolster their case against the president. Bolton and Trump, 73, had an acrimonious fallout in late 2019, and the two argued openly about whether he resigned or was fired.
The House of Representatives impeached Trump on two articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December.

Texto completo: No matter how many times CNN refers to the new report about John Bolton as a “bombshell,” it doesn’t change that everything we need to know about President Trump, Ukraine, and the delay in foreign aid, we already know and have known for a month.
Calling in Bolton to testify to the Senate that Trump has a long-standing grudge against Ukraine sheds precisely no new light on anything.
The New York Times on Sunday said that it has spoken with people who reviewed the manuscript of Bolton’s forthcoming book about his time as national security adviser in the White House. Without directly quoting a single thing from the manuscript, the New York Times reported this:Key to Mr. Bolton’s account about Ukraine is an exchange during a meeting in August with the president after Mr. Trump returned from vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. Mr. Bolton raised the $391 million in congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine for its war in the country’s east against Russian-backed separatists. Officials had frozen the aid, and a deadline was looming to begin sending it to Kyiv, Mr. Bolton noted. He, Mr. Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper had collectively pressed the president about releasing the aid nearly a dozen times in the preceding weeks after lower-level officials who worked on Ukraine issues began complaining about the holdup, Mr. Bolton wrote. Mr. Trump had effectively rebuffed them, airing his longstanding grievances about Ukraine, which mixed legitimate efforts by some Ukrainians to back his Democratic 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, with unsupported accusations and outright conspiracy theories about the country, a key American ally. Guess what. This information is already part of the public record. The New York Times itself was the one to report it on Dec. 29.
The report from Sunday also said that last year in August, according to Bolton, the president told him that he "preferred" giving no assistance to Ukraine "until" the government there turned over any materials they had about Joe Biden and the country's involvement in the 2016 election.
Wow, that sounds like a quid pro quo! Except there are no quotes in the article to make more clear what it means that Trump “preferred” not sending assistance “until” Ukraine handed over information on Biden and the country’s involvement in the 2016 election.
I would have preferred the New York Times not have reported this story until it contained direct quotes from Bolton’s manuscript. That’s not a quid pro quo. That’s a wish.
Democrats say the new information, if you can call it that, shows why Bolton should testify in the impeachment trial. It doesn't. We already know what he's going to say. The same goes for White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who Democrats also want to testify because he's a "first-hand witness" to events.
But guess what, again, Mulvaney has already given his version of events and taken questions related to it. He did it during his marathon press conference. He said what “drove” the decision to delay the aid to Ukraine was concern over “corruption” (legitimate and true) and that, yes, they did have concerns that if the congressionally approved aid was not spent, they may end up in violation of the impoundment law.
None of these facts are disputed. What’s disputed is the conclusion Democrats are reaching — that a delay in foreign aid for a political reason is worthy of removal from office.
These two things can be true at once: Trump delayed the aid to Ukraine so he could talk to the country’s leader about investigating Joe Biden and the 2016 election, and there is no proof that Ukraine would not have received the aid without committing to the investigation.
The proof is to the contrary. Ukraine has never said it’s investigating Biden or 2016 and yet it received the aid that was approved by Congress.
We know all of this already, and it doesn’t become scarier just because CNN has thrown itself on a “bombshell.”

Alan Dershowitz: John Bolton book allegations against Trump 'would not constitute an impeachable offense'

Texto completo: Harvard professor and Trump legal team member Alan Dershowitz defended the president from claims made in former national security adviser John Bolton's forthcoming book, asserting that the claims would not amount to an impeachable offense even if they are true.
Dershowitz appeared in front of the Senate on Monday to offer the White House team’s first response to allegations reportedly made in Bolton’s tell-all on his time working in the Trump administration. A manuscript of the unpublished book, reported by the New York Times on Sunday, said President Trump told Bolton that Ukraine would not receive military aid until it agreed to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, and his son Hunter Biden, 49.
"If the president, any president, were to have done what the Times reported about the content of the Bolton manuscript, that would not constitute an impeachable offense," Dershowitz said.
"Let me repeat: Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense. That is clear from the history. That is clear from the language of the Constitution," Dershowitz continued. "You cannot turn conduct that is not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using words like 'quid pro quo' and 'personal benefit.'"

Sen. Ted Cruz has argued along similar lines, contending that Trump was justified in asking for investigations into the Bidens in a July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Cruz said that enough evidence of potential corruption between the Bidens and Ukraine has surfaced that Trump's request for investigation was warranted.
During the Obama administration, then-President Barack Obama tapped Biden to oversee U.S. relations with Ukraine. While Biden was leading foreign policy in the region, a Ukrainian energy company hired his son to sit on its board of directors, for which he was paid $50,000 a month.
The younger Biden has a history of drug addiction and abuse and has entered rehab multiple times. In 2014, he was kicked out of the Navy after testing positive for cocaine. He was recently entangled in a paternity suit with an Arkansas woman and former D.C. stripper, and, on Monday, he agreed to pay child support for their baby.

Claiming John Bolton is just another 'deep state' James Comey is absurd

Texto completo: The idea that John Bolton, a lifelong conservative and loyal Republican, is some sort of "deep state" James Comey clone out to sell books by making up stories to damage President Trump is patently absurd.
The New York Times on Sunday reported that Bolton writes in his new book that when he was national security adviser, Trump told him that he wanted to keep security assistance to Ukraine frozen until the government moved forward on investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 campaign. The claim is significant because if Bolton were to testify to that effect, it would be the first time that any official would have said they directly heard Trump tie the aid to the investigations — an issue that is at the heart of the impeachment debate.
When I first read the report, I assumed that Trump's allies would immediately seize on the source of the report and focus their attacks on the New York Times. Yet Trump went directly after Bolton.
"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump tweeted. "In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
Trump retweeted the Federalist's Sean Davis, who argued: "John Bolton is running the exact same revenge playbook against Trump that James Comey used. He’s even using the same agent and leaking to the same reporters. All because he’s mad Trump fired him for leaking and trying to start new wars. It’s so boring and predictable."
Trump also retweeted commentator Lou Dobbs, who teed up the Bolton news with: "Rejected Neocon, Failing NYTimes, Deep State's Last Desperate Act After @POTUS Attorneys Destroy Radical Dems, Schiff and Pelosi Charges."
Of all the defenses that Trump could pull, however, trying to portray Bolton as some sort of sequel to Comey is absurd.
Bolton is a lifelong conservative, having gotten his start in politics volunteering for Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign before he was 16 years old.
Bolton went on to be an outspoken conservative at Yale Law School. In his memoir, Justice Clarence Thomas credits Bolton with pushing him to question his liberal beliefs. "John was known as a conservative while I still thought of myself as being far left of center (when I wasn't just being cynical)," Thomas writes. He explains how Bolton challenged him. During one argument, Bolton said, "Clarence, as a member of a group that has been treated shabbily by the majority in this country, why would you want to give the government more power over your personal life?" Though it didn't instantly make Thomas a conservative, the justice writes, "John's question reverberated in my mind for a long time to come."
Also while at Yale, Bolton co-authored a seminal article for the American Enterprise Institute warning about the threat to freedom posed by excessive regulation of campaign finance. After graduating, he fought in private practice on the side of the First Amendment in the landmark 1976 Supreme Court case on the issue, Buckley v. Valeo.
He went on to serve Ronald Reagan and every Republican president since loyally. And at every point, he was fighting to advance ideological goals, not merely pursue the path of least resistance.
Trying to suggest that Bolton would be seeking the love of the establishment or protecting the deep state is preposterous to anybody who knows anything about his career.
Bolton has consistently fought against the establishment and been pilloried for it. He had to be recess-appointed to the United Nations because of his long record of challenging the institution. "The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories," he once famously quipped. "If it lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference." His tenure at the U.N., cut short as establishment Republicans knifed him, was a daily battle against the ruling class — not just within the United States, but the entire world.
His 2007 book, Surrender Is Not an Option, could serve as a textbook in a class about the dangers of the deep state. In the book, Bolton details how career employees in the State Department undermine Republican administrations and carry out their own foreign policy rather than that of the presidents they are supposed to serve. He complains about how, too often, subject matter experts become advocates for the countries they're working on as opposed to advocates for U.S. policy.
The final argument, that Bolton is just out to sell books, also doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. As with any author, I'm sure Bolton wants to sell as many books as possible. However, he also could have sold a ton of books had he offered a full-throated defense of Trump. That is, had he written a book that said that Trump never told him about tying aid to Ukraine to the investigations and that this is just another example of a witch hunt, he would have been on Fox News and talk radio constantly and would have had a bestseller on his hands. Further, he would have revived his career as a conservative hero and all the money-making opportunities that go along with it.
Assuming the New York Times account is accurate, by writing this book, Bolton is burning bridges with most conservatives knowing the establishment will never accept him.
There are nowhere near 20 Republican votes to oust Trump from office, even with Bolton's account. Trump and his defenders have other arguments at their disposal. But the effort to turn Bolton into some sort of Comey-esque tool of the deep state and establishment is completely ridiculous.

1620: Why the Pilgrims came and what they left

Texto completo: “I think I can see the whole destiny of America contained in the first Puritan who landed on these shores,” wrote Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835.
Back then, it was an almost humdrum observation. Foreigners and Americans took it for granted that the peculiar characteristics of the United States, private property, ornery individualism, devolved government, and, indeed, republicanism, derived from its Protestant origins.
That idea is no longer in fashion. In the 1930s, the U.S. was redefined as “Judeo-Christian” (a word that had previously meant “a Jewish convert to Christianity”). Now that label, too, is considered exclusionary.
Exactly 400 years have passed since the first Puritan landed. Perhaps, as with the New York Times’s 1619 Project (but without its inaccuracies), it is worth reflecting on that foundation.
It is certainly an inspiring story. One hundred and two religious separatists set out from England. Two babies were born en route, one of whom died, along with three of the other passengers. By the time the Mayflower sighted land in 1620, her stores were depleted, her drinking water was rank, and the few animals that had not been devoured were worn out, unable to produce eggs or milk. The settlers knew that their hardships were just starting, but they preferred the risk of starvation to what they saw as the idolatry and superstition of an only half-reformed English church.
One thing we shouldn’t call them, if we want to be accurate, is “Pilgrims.” That label came into use only after 1798. Seventeenth-century Puritans thought of pilgrimages as popish, a medieval lusting after old bones and relics. For them, a pilgrimage was not a literal walk to a shrine, but a personal journey of faith. “Go on pilgrimage unto thine own heart, and there pray,” William Tyndale said.
Those earliest New Englanders were not pilgrims but exiles. Their first exile, to the Dutch town of Leiden, had not worked out. Some were drifting back to England, others assimilating with the Dutch. Their leader, Edward Winslow, feared “to lose our language and our name of English.” So they became exiles a second time, a theme familiar from their Psalms.
They did not choose America as such; they just needed space to make a “New England.” In marked contrast to Spanish and Portuguese colonists, they showed little interest in converting indigenous people. Catholic missionaries worked with feverish speed, convinced that soul by soul, they were saving people from hell. But Puritans, being Calvinists, believed in predestination — the sobering doctrine that, at the beginning of time, God had marked everyone out for either salvation or damnation. That being so, why bother converting anyone?
Like all exiles, they pined for home. Their colony remained tiny until John Winthrop arrived with a larger contingent in 1630 — exiles, again, from a Church of England that was bringing back altar rails, priestly surplices, rich music, and other supposedly Romish practices.
After 1640, though, the situation in Great Britain changed. First, Scottish Presbyterians and then English Puritans took up arms against King Charles I. All manner of outré Protestant sects began to flourish. Some New Englanders rushed across the Atlantic to fight against the king. Others simply drifted back because they could. This part of the story is usually left out but, between 1640 and 1660, more people left New England for the mother country than the other way around (unlike in relatively secular Virginia). Only the return of bishops under Charles II after 1660 revived the Massachusetts colony.
Looking back over those preceding paragraphs, we find a story that is indeed Protestant in its essentials. We see the cussedness of the first colonists, their determination to follow their consciences, their dislike of authority, and, not least, their belief in divine providence — which was to grow, in the New World, into the notion of Manifest Destiny. We see their emphasis they placed on covenants. Winthrop, in his famous "City upon a Hill" sermon, used lawyerly language to convey the idea of a pact with God. “We are entered into covenant with Him for this work. We have taken out a commission. The Lord hath given us leave to draw our own articles.”
The truly extraordinary thing (miraculous, we might almost say) is that those hard-bitten Puritans, who had no interest in religious liberty beyond their own and who harbored a deep fear of Catholicism, eventually created the first society on Earth where there was true pluralism — not just religious toleration, which had existed in many places, but freedom for each denomination to proselytize.
In the end, the logic of separatism, of allowing each man to follow his conscience, made for the open society that Tocqueville’s first Puritan may have foreshadowed, but could not have foreseen. So say it with force in this quadricentennial year: God bless America.

‘Dangerous precedent’: John Bolton’s former chief of staff calls on him to withdraw book

Texto completo: John Bolton’s former chief of staff urged him to reconsider releasing his forthcoming tell-all book about his experience as President Trump’s national security adviser, calling it a “dangerous precedent” that could dissuade future presidents from seeking advice on national security matters.
“Given the importance of protecting a president’s confidential discussions with his senior advisers, I strongly disagree with Bolton’s decision to release the book before the November presidential election and call on him to withdraw it from the publisher immediately,” Fred Fleitz wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News on Monday.
“Presidents must be able to candidly consult with their advisers without worrying they will leak these discussions to the press or obtain high-dollar book contracts to publish them. A book by a former national security adviser ahead of a president’s reelection bid may set a dangerous precedent since it could discourage future presidents from seeking advice from expert advisers on sensitive national security matters,” he argued.
The book, The Room Where it Happened, is set to be published on March 17.
Bolton made at least one bombshell claim in the book, alleging that Trump conditioned aid to Ukraine on the country investigating Joe Biden, the former vice president and a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The revelation undermines the Trump defense team's claim that the freeze on security assistance to Ukraine was separate from the president pressing Kyiv to announce investigations into his political rival.
Fleitz, who was Bolton’s chief of staff at the State Department from 2001 to 2005 and again at the National Security Council in 2018, said his former boss made an “inexplicable” misstep in sending the manuscript to the National Security Council to review during Trump’s impeachment trial.
“Under such circumstances, a leak of the manuscript was all but certain,” he wrote, referring to the New York Times report on the matter.
Fleitz continued: “If a manuscript of this sensitivity was to be published at all, this should happen after the election, not in the spring of 2020. I don’t understand the need for a former National Security Adviser to publish a tell-all book critical of a president he served, especially during a presidential reelection campaign that will determine the fate of the country. There will be a time for Bolton to speak out without appearing to try to tip a presidential election.”

Texto completo: Republican Sen. Rand Paul dismissed claims that former Trump national security adviser John Bolton’s testimony would add anything new to the impeachment case and charged that parts of Bolton's book critical of the president were leaked so he could make more money.
“He’s a disgruntled, angry man who was fired. So you’d have to take him with a grain of salt. He wants to sell a book,” the Kentucky senator told Secrets Monday in comments that echoed those of President Trump.
Paul suggested that the book excerpts leaked to the New York Times were part of a scheme to rally calls that the Senate call witnesses, especially Bolton, which would help the former aide cash in even more on his book, The Room Where It Happened.

Mocking Democrats for calling Trump corrupt, Paul told Secrets: “It's corrupt to use your government testimony to make money, don’t you think? So I think he’s doing this for mercantile reasons. I think you can make a strong argument that he’s ginning up his book. That’s his right, but he’s ginning up his book with the hopes of bringing it in for testimony. He’ll make more money if he testifies. He’ll make a lot more money ... if he gets it out pretty soon.”
Like some other GOP senators, Paul said that Bolton was unlikely to add anything to the impeachment case against Trump over a phone call in which he appeared to delay aid to Ukraine until it investigated corruption at a company former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter consulted for.
“I know what he’s going to say. He’s going to say the president wanted to hold up aid for an investigation into the Bidens,” Paul said. “What’s he going to tell you that you don’t already know?” he added.
And, Paul said, even if the Senate does not vote to hear Bolton, he will probably get a hearing in the House and, “He’ll be happy to come in because he’s just decided that he’s going to sell [lots] of books by coming in to testify.”
Paul also warned that Republicans considering voting with Democrats for witnesses are jeopardizing the political future, noting that they could lose their own GOP voting base.
“They would be better off to have it over politically too because what they don’t understand and what I’ve tried to say through the media is that, if you live in a purple state, sure you need independent voters, but you cannot win without your Republican base. So I really think that if anybody votes for impeachment [conviction] they won’t get their Republican base,” Paul said.
“The question is, will voting for witnesses, which looks like a vote that’s sympathetic to [Rep.] Adam Schiff, [the lead House impeachment manager], is that going to be a vote that the base abandons you over?” Paul asked.

It's not complicated: John Bolton must testify

Texto completo: It isn't complicated. Public interest demands John Bolton testimony at the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.
That's the necessary response to the New York Times report on Sunday — namely, its reporting that Bolton's upcoming book will allege that Trump tied the release of military aid to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelesnky opening investigations into the business dealings of Joe Biden's son, Hunter. If accurately reported — and that does appear to be the case — Bolton's claims undercut the president's defense of his conduct. Trump's legal team says he did not withhold aid in order to extract a politically damaging investigation of his primary rival's family. Bolton apparently says the opposite.
Bolton is thus a critical component of this impeachment trial. As Trump's national security adviser during the withholding of U.S. aid during the spring and summer of 2019, Bolton is exceptionally well placed to know what Trump said and why that aid was withheld. We should recognize as much. And as the Washington Examiner's Susan Ferrechio reports, Republicans are increasingly predisposed to hear Bolton's testimony.
Do not misunderstand me. Bolton is just one individual in an executive branch full of individuals who worked on the Ukraine issue. And by saving his testimony for publication in a multimillion-dollar book deal rather than presenting it early and openly, Bolton has opened himself to challenges that his motive is shaped by profit.
Still, Bolton is a long-serving public official with intimate experience of executive policy.
The views of this former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations are obviously debatable, but his patriotism and intellect are not. Again, Bolton was Trump's No. 1 national security official during the relevant period of the military aid suspension. Bolton is thus well placed to be judged as a credible and first-hand witness to the president's conduct.
Senators can draw their own conclusions from what Bolton may or may not say and weigh that testimony against what others more favorable to the president have said. But to not call Bolton as a witness would be at best an act of political cowardice. At worse, it would be a betrayal of senators' solemn oaths of office.
Compel Bolton to speak before the people, then let senators weigh his words alongside all the other evidence.

John Bolton worried Trump was granting favors to autocratic leaders: Book

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton expressed concern to Attorney General William Barr that President Trump "was effectively granting personal favors" to the leaders of China and Turkey, according to a draft of his forthcoming book.
Drafts of Bolton's unpublished manuscript detailed his worries that last year Trump was giving favors to various autocratic leaders, the New York Times reported on Monday. Barr responded to Bolton's concerns by noting two Justice Department investigations into companies in those countries and "said he was worried that Mr. Trump had created the appearance that he had undue influence over what would typically be independent inquiries."
Barr backed up his point by mentioning conversations the president had with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Chinese President Xi Jinping, including his conversation with Xi about the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE and with Erdogan over the investigation of Halkbank, Turkey’s second-largest state-owned bank.
In 2017, ZTE agreed to plead guilty to violating American sanctions on doing business with North Korea and paid heavy fines. A year later, Trump lifted the sanctions. In 2018, Erdogan asked Trump to halt additional enforcement against the bank, which was being investigated on fraud and money-laundering charges for helping Iran avoid U.S. sanctions. However, the Justice Department later indicted the bank.
The latest leak from Bolton's book, draft copies of which were provided to the White House National Security Council for a review process, comes a day after another leak revealed Bolton also wrote that Trump told him in August that he was withholding nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine until Kyiv assisted with investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump denied telling Bolton that the security aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations in the early hours of Monday morning, tweeting, "If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
The former national security adviser and his publisher Simon & Schuster issued a statement the same day rejecting allegations that they had leaked the manuscript to the New York Times, and his lawyer blamed the leak on a "corrupted" review process.
The "explosive" details from the book caused Democrats to renew their calls for Bolton to testify in Trump's Senate impeachment trial. Meanwhile, Bolton's former chief of staff called on him to reconsider releasing his book, calling it a “dangerous precedent” that could discourage future presidents from seeking advice on national security matters.

America has bigger fish to fry than Ukraine

Texto completo: Do Americans really care about Ukraine? Ordinarily, this would be a strange question to ask. But it has received a bevy of attention this week after the highly publicized off-mic altercation between NPR host Mary Louise Kelly and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. After an interview on Kelly’s show, Pompeo allegedly berated her off the air for her queries about former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. F-bombs were thrown around. And then came the question from Pompeo: “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?”
William Taylor, the two-time U.S. ambassador in Kyiv, decorated combat veteran, and longtime public servant, believes people in the United States do care about Ukraine and the war churning in the country’s eastern region. He thinks if people don’t care, they should.
Writing in the New York Times, Taylor subtly condemned his former boss, Pompeo, repeatedly referring to Ukraine as the “front line” between democracy and Russian authoritarianism. “The Kremlin is attacking the rules that have guided relations among nations since World War II, rules that kept the peace among major European powers for 70 years,” Taylor writes. “To support Ukraine means to support a young democracy, fighting to regain sovereignty over its internationally recognized borders.”
Taylor’s piece is largely a recitation of what we already know about Russian behavior. We already knew, for instance, that Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea Peninsula was illegal. We already knew that without Russia’s military and financial support, the separatists in eastern Ukraine would have likely folded by now. Russian President Vladimir Putin could end this five-year conflict if he withdrew that support. (Newsflash: This isn’t going to happen.) We also knew, courtesy of the U.S. intelligence community and the Mueller report, that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through a sophisticated disinformation campaign.
Nothing Taylor stated in his opinion piece is news. Indeed, the media has been inundated with Russia-related coverage for what feels like an eternity. The question is whether any of this warrants the top-level attention of Americans, many of whom are frankly far more concerned about finding a way to pay for their children's tuition than what Putin has up his sleeve in a country of marginal value.
One can certainly understand and respect where Taylor is coming from. As a top U.S. official in Ukraine, Taylor traveled to the front line in the east and saw with his own eyes just how intense and ingrained the war between Kyiv's and Moscow’s proxies is. Parts of the front line look like replicas of World War I, with both sides huddling in trenches that stretch for miles. Mortars and artillery fly back and forth on a weekly (if not daily) basis, making a mockery of the ceasefire that both sides agreed to in 2015. About 14,000 people have been killed in this conflict, although the figure could be higher.
Yet nowhere in Taylor’s piece does he make a cold-blooded case for why Washington should stick its nose in this conflict. The argument the ambassador makes is an emotional one — and let’s be honest, it’s also steeped in quite a bit of threat inflation. Taylor ties Ukraine’s national security to the hip of U.S. national security, starting with the proposition that a Russian triumph in Ukraine will have lasting, earth-shattering effects on the health of other Western democracies. If Ukraine falls, the civilized world falls with it.
This is the type of rhetoric, while emotionally powerful, that clouds unsentimental debate. It leads to terrible judgment, which in turn leads to even worse mistakes. U.S. history is riddled with examples of where policymakers and political leaders in Washington ran around with their hair on fire: Vietnam 1965, Iraq 2003, and Libya 2011 are the most notable. All three were mired in unsubstantiated theories and assumptions, and all three turned out to be tragically counterproductive.
Nobody is saying Ukraine should be written off. Ukraine is obviously important to the Ukrainians. It’s quite important to the Europeans as well. Nobody wants a frozen conflict on the Eurasian continent.
But let’s put Ukraine in the proper perspective: It’s not a vital U.S. national security interest. If Washington wants to help Kyiv, it can start by working with Germany, France, the European Union, the Ukrainian government, and the Kremlin on a diplomatic exit ramp. The U.S. has bigger fish to fry.

Texto completo: Former national security adviser John Bolton and his publisher denied allegations that they leaked excerpts of his book to the New York Times.
In one portion of Bolton’s upcoming book, The Room Where it Happened, which the paper detailed on Sunday, Bolton claimed that President Trump said he'd refuse to send military aid to Ukraine unless they announced an investigation into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. The previously unknown details undercut the Trump legal team's argument that the president's decision to withhold aid was separate from his plan to push for investigations.
The former U.S. ambassador released a joint statement with Simon & Schuster and Javelin Literary Agency on Monday to quash allegations that they were behind the leak.
"Ambassador John Bolton, Simon & Schuster, and Javelin Literary categorically state that there was absolutely no coordination with the New York Times or anyone else regarding the appearance of information about his book, THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED, at online booksellers," their statement read. "Any assertion to the contrary is unfounded speculation."

The Democratic House impeachment managers who are prosecuting the Senate trial have renewed calls for his testimony and issued a statement arguing that Bolton "directly contradicts the heart of the president's defense and therefore must be called as a witness at the impeachment trial."
“During our impeachment inquiry, the President blocked our request for Mr. Bolton’s testimony. Now we see why. The President knows how devastating his testimony would be, and, according to the report, the White House has had a draft of his manuscript for review. President Trump’s cover-up must come to an end," they wrote. “Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President — that starts with Mr. Bolton."
The president has denied the accusations, saying that if Bolton made the claim, then "it was only to sell a book."

Texto completo: A top Republican called attention to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's warning to President Trump about crossing the intelligence community.
Rep. Andy Biggs recalled a quote by Schumer after details of former national security adviser John Bolton's book, a draft of which was submitted to the National Security Council for a review, leaked to the media, and shook up the impeachment debate over calling witnesses.
"As more leaks & hearsay are ushered into the #ImpeachmentTrial, remember Chuck Schumer's warning about the revenge of the intel community," the Arizona Republican said in a tweet Monday.

He quoted Schumer's suggestion to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in early January 2017 that intelligence officials have ways to strike back after Trump, then the president-elect, alleged there was a delay in his briefing on "so-called Russian hacking."
"Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you," the New York Democrat said after Maddow informed him that intelligence sources told NBC News that the briefing had not actually been delayed.
"So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this," he added.

Biggs, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and a vocal defender of the president, also shared a Breitbart News report that cited a source who said Army Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, a senior ethics lawyer for the National Security Council, is the official in charge of reviewing manuscripts by current and former NSC officials. Vindman is the identical twin brother of Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, another member of the NSC who testified during House impeachment proceedings that he raised national security concerns about Trump's July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
According to a report by the New York Times late Sunday, Bolton wrote in a draft that Trump told him in August that a hold on nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid was tied to his efforts to pressure Kyiv into assisting with investigations into his political rivals, including presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump, who faces two Ukraine-related articles of impeachment, denied telling Bolton that the security aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations.
"If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book," he tweeted just after midnight on Monday.
The report quickly stirred up speculation about who was behind the leak, which broke out during the Senate impeachment trial. Democrats have used the disclosure to push moderate Republican senators to vote in favor of summoning Bolton and other Trump administration officials to testify.
Bolton left the White House in September and announced earlier this month that he was willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial if subpoenaed by lawmakers. Trump signaled that he would block Bolton from testifying, claiming it would be to protect executive privilege for himself and future presidents.
Sarah Tinsley, an adviser to Bolton, said that the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations sent the draft manuscript to the White House weeks ago for a prepublication review by the NSC. "The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period," she said.
Bolton's attorney, Charles Cooper, also released a statement decrying a "corrupted" review process and shared a copy of a cover letter showing the draft was submitted to the NSC's Records Management Division for a standard prepublication security review for classified information on Dec. 30.
On Monday, Bolton and his publisher denied allegations that they leaked excerpts of his book to the New York Times.

HAMBURG, Pa. — For all the gravity of a presidential impeachment trial, Americans don’t seem to be giving it much weight.
As House impeachment managers make their case to remove President Donald Trump from office, voters in several states said in interviews with The Associated Press that they’re only casually following the Senate trial, or avoiding it altogether — too busy to pay close attention, bored of the legal arguments, convinced the outcome is preordained or just plain tired of the whole partisan saga.
Web traffic and TV ratings tell a similar story, with public interest seeming to flag after the House voted last month to impeach a president for only the third time in U.S. history.
“I’ve been watching some really odd stuff just to avoid it,” said Kim Ashford, 50, a court-appointed advocate for foster children from Gilbert, Arizona. “In my circle, everybody’s tired of hearing about it. There’s nobody budging. Let’s just agree to disagree.”
Monica DeMarco, who voted for Trump in 2016 but doesn’t plan to do so again, said she hasn’t watched a single second of the trial, though she’s read a little about it in The New York Times.
“I want to watch something that takes me some place happy,” said DeMarco, 50, who lives near Hamburg, Pennsylvania, and works for a cargo hauler.
“What’s going to happen is going to happen and like the marching ants we are, we’ll go on,” DeMarco said. “Life’s going to go on tomorrow, the sun’s going to come up and we’re going to take care of what’s important in our lives.”
Many Americans are tuning out because they made up their minds about Trump’s impeachment months ago, said Eric Kasper, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In addition, he said, there’s little doubt about the eventual outcome — acquittal by the GOP-controlled Senate — depriving the trial of drama.
“If the story was still unwritten, so to speak, then people would still tune in even if they had personally strong feelings about how they would want it to end,” Kasper said. “It’s the fact that both of those things are the case — a lot of people have made up their minds, and it looks pretty clear what the outcome of this trial is going to be.”
Americans are sharply divided along party lines in their views on impeachment, and most say their positions are firm. Three-quarters say it’s not very likely or not at all likely that the trial will introduce new information that would change their minds, according to a poll this month from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
“I don’t think there’s any possibility of removal, said Montel Herman, 82, of Osage, Iowa, who described himself as a moderate Democrat. “I question whether this is worth it.”

Texto completo: El exasesor de Seguridad Nacional de Donald Trump, John Bolton, asegura en un libro aún no publicado que él mismo advirtió al fiscal general William Barr que el presidente estaba haciendo favores personales a los líderes de China y Turquía .
Bolton recuperó el episodio en el borrador de sus memorias, que publicará próximamente, de acuerdo con personas familiarizadas con el manuscrito que hablaron con The New York Times pero mantuvieron su condición de anonimato.
Bolton supuestamente escribió que Barr respondió que le preocupaba que Trump pudiera haber creado la apariencia de tener una influencia inadecuada sobre las investigaciones que involucran a compañías con sede en China y Turquía durante conversaciones con líderes de ambos países.
No está claro a qué exactamente se referiría Bolton al hablar de “favores personales” pero en los últimos meses, la administración Trump ha recibido críticas por permitir la invasión militar de Turquía en las zonas del norte de Siria en las que había fuerzas turcas que Estados Unidos apoyaba. En este sentido, el Times apunta a que Bolton también estaba preocupado por las conversaciones de Trump con el presidente chino Xi Jinping sobre la empresa de telecomunicaciones ZTE .
En un comunicado conjunto, el propio Bolton y el editor Simon & Schuster dijeron este lunes que ellos no estaban detrás de la filtración del manuscrito de Bolton al Times. Sin embargo, Bolton no ha negado ninguna de las revelaciones que ha hecho el diario neoyorquino.
Esta información llegó mientras el equipo legal de Donald Trump lo estaba defendiendo en el juicio político del Senado. Las afirmaciones de Bolton, que se empezaron a filtrar ayer, han provocado que algunos republicanos clave respalden la petición demócrata de citar al exasesor de Trump como testigo del ‘impeachment’.

Brooks: Six truths show that Biden is stronger than you may think

Texto completo: It was yet another epic failure of political punditry. Go back to the early months of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and read what the consultants and commentators were saying about him: His support is just name recognition; he’ll fade! He’s too old! He’s running a zombie campaign! The party has moved left and he’s out of touch! He voted for the crime bill!
Almost everybody was bearish on Joe. But now look where we are, weeks from actual voting. If the polls are to be believed, Biden will win Iowa; he’ll come in second in New Hampshire; he will easily win Nevada; he will dominate in South Carolina. He’s now tied for the lead in California, and he’s way ahead in Texas.
I don’t know if he’ll win the nomination (both he and Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six months ago thought we’d be.
It’s the 947th consecutive sign that we in the coastal chattering classes have not cured our insularity problem. It’s the 947th case in which we see that every second you spend on Twitter detracts from your knowledge of American politics and that the only cure to this insularity disease is constant travel and interviewing, close attention to state and local data and raw abject humility about the fact that the attitudes and academic degrees that you think make you clever are actually the attitudes and academic degrees that separate you from the real texture of American life.
Biden didn’t just luck into this. He and his team grasped six truths:
— Understand the year you are running in. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running the same basic campaign they would have run in 2012 or 2016. Biden’s campaign is completely focused on the central problem of 2020: that Donald Trump is a steaming hot mess in the middle of national life.
Biden has fixated his campaign on the Trump problem and fighting for the soul of America. Nearly twice as many Democrats say it’s more important to beat Trump than to have a candidate with whom they agree on all issues.
— Understand your party’s core challenge. All around the world parties on the left are losing because they have lost touch with the working class. These parties think they can reconnect with that class by swinging even further left. But Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and Bernie Sanders here are a doctoral student’s idea of a working-class candidate, not an actual working person’s idea of one.
Biden has criticized his own party for losing touch with this class. He emerged from it, is focusing his attention on it and is winning support from it.
— Moderates are still powerful. The Democratic Party is moving left, but about half of Democrats still say they are moderate or conservative. No candidate has ever won a nomination without strong support from these voters, while college-town candidates — Howard Dean, Gary Hart — tend to falter. In every presidential general election that Democrats have won since 1988, they carried moderates by more than 12 percentage points. In every race they have lost, they failed to do that. Biden kept his moderate credentials when many other candidates saw A.O.C. on Twitter and decided to move left.
— Many Democrats resent their own elites. There is a quiet tension between Democrats who wield cultural power and those who don’t. The former are active on social media and clobber the latter — people who say or write the “wrong” thing.
The non-elites tend to feel judged and looked down on by the self-appointed savior class. “Politically correct” has become the phrase people use to define those who use cultural power to enforce ideological conformity. Seventy percent of Democrats who are not on social media say political correctness is a big problem. These are people silently but vehemently reacting against this social reign of terror. Biden communicates affection, not judgment, acceptance, not expulsion.
— Have a better theory of social change. Sanders and Warren imagine they can rally movements of progressive supermajorities to transform American politics. The reality is that if they are elected we’ll be stuck with the same 42%-to-42% stagnant political war we have now.
Biden starts with the understanding that we are a closely divided nation. He understands the elemental fact that if you want to pass laws you have to go through Congress. As Damon Linker pointed out recently in The Week, Biden’s argument is that a center-left congressional coalition is the best we can do under present circumstances. That’s a more realistic theory of change. A beloved legislator like Biden is more likely to transform the political landscape than a down-the-line progressive.
— Connection. Connection. Connection. Many candidates pound the podium and lecture at their rallies. It’s the big leader onstage and the passionate mass of followers down below. Nobody makes an individual connection as well as Biden. In a time when people feel exhausted, isolated and alienated, a candidate who seems normal and emotionally relatable is going to have a lot of appeal.
The ironic fact is that the candidate who can be vulnerable has a surprising power.

Bolton supuestamente escribió que Barr respondió que le preocupaba que Trump pudiera haber creado la apariencia de tener una influencia inadecuada sobre las investigaciones que involucran a compañías con sede en China y Turquía durante conversaciones con líderes de ambos países.
No está claro a qué exactamente se referiría Bolton al hablar de “favores personales” pero en los últimos meses, la administración Trump ha recibido críticas por permitir la invasión militar de Turquía en las zonas del norte de Siria en las que había fuerzas turcas que Estados Unidos apoyaba. En este sentido, el Times apunta a que Bolton también estaba preocupado por las conversaciones de Trump con el presidente chino Xi Jinping sobre la empresa de telecomunicaciones ZTE .
En un comunicado conjunto, el propio Bolton y el editor Simon & Schuster dijeron este lunes que ellos no estaban detrás de la filtración del manuscrito de Bolton al Times. Sin embargo, Bolton no ha negado ninguna de las revelaciones que ha hecho el diario neoyorquino.
Esta información llegó mientras el equipo legal de Donald Trump lo estaba defendiendo en el juicio político del Senado. Las afirmaciones de Bolton, que se empezaron a filtrar ayer, han provocado que algunos republicanos clave respalden la petición demócrata de citar al exasesor de Trump como testigo del ‘impeachment’.

Texto completo: In January 1937, near the end of Franklin Roosevelt’s first term as president, Life magazine published a map of the United States spread over two full pages. The headline read: “What President Roosevelt Did to the Map of the U.S. in Four Years with $6,500,000,000.”
Scattered around the map were dozens of small drawings, each showing a project funded by Roosevelt’s stimulus program. They included the Triborough Bridge, Manhattan’s Midtown tunnels, bridges on Cape Cod, schools in South Carolina, dorms at Texas Tech, the Kansas City Civic Auditorium, the Los Angeles Aqueduct and the Grand Coulee Dam. A few of the drawings summarized broader projects, like “2 U.S. aircraft carriers” and “120 U.S. airports.”
Since taking office in 1933, Roosevelt hadn’t only rescued the country from the Great Depression. He had made sure that the country knew he had rescued it. His projects were big, tangible and unmistakably the work of the federal government. The projects changed how Americans thought about government.
In recent decades, Democrats have too often forgotten this lesson. They have created technocratically elegant policies that quietly improve people’s lives, like tax credits or insurance subsidies. The problem with this approach is that it does little to build popular support for government action.
Put it this way: How many projects can you name from Barack Obama’s stimulus program? Can you name any project or agency that Bill Clinton created?
Clinton and, even more so, Obama, were successful presidents. Yet their administrations were still hindered by a certain naïveté. Officials sometimes tried to perfect policy design while proudly ignoring political impact, as if the two could be separated in a democracy.
Republicans don’t suffer from this naïveté. Again and again, they push policies meant to affect politics, such as campaign finance deregulation, voting restrictions and labor union constraints. Republicans understand a concept that political scientists refer to as “policy feedback” — namely, that policy can influence politics in ways that make future policy changes more or less likely.
In the last several years, policy feedback has finally started getting more attention in progressive circles. And one of the politicians who’s most interested in the subject happens to be running for president: Elizabeth Warren.
While the rest of the Obama administration was pushing a financial reform bill that was impenetrable to most Americans, Warren insisted on an idea with Rooseveltian simplicity. It became the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which tries to protect people from being cheated or deceived by banks.
Warren’s presidential agenda has several other easily understandable ideas, like a $200-a-month increase in Social Security benefits, a price reduction for insulin and other popular drugs, the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student debt and a wealth tax. During a recent interview with her, I mentioned that she seemed to believe that bigger ideas were sometimes easier to accomplish than more modest ones. “I do,” she replied. Big ideas can inspire people; tax credits do not.
I don’t agree with all of Warren’s ideas (see: Medicare for All), but I think she is onto something important here. Creating a new era of progressive change — to take on problems like climate change and extreme inequality — depends on persuading more Americans that government is a force for good.
The best way to improve the image of government is not through soaring speeches by politicians. It’s through a version of the old journalism cliché: Show, don’t tell. “You want people to be able to see the way government is helping them,” Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist, says, “and have a stake in defending it.”
Right now, the government often does the opposite. Many programs are hidden in the tax code, as Suzanne Mettler of Cornell explained in her book “The Submerged State.” Upper-middle-class families receive thousands of dollars from the mortgage-interest deduction without thinking of it as a government benefit. Lower-income families sign up for the earned-income tax credit by visiting a tax preparation company, which can make the benefit appear to come from H&R Block, rather than Uncle Sam.
The Obama stimulus remains the canonical example. Out of a well-intended desire to get Americans to spend more of their stimulus tax cut, the administration snuck the money into people’s paychecks, rather than sending one-time checks (as George W. Bush had done in 2001) that families might have saved.
Economically, it worked. Spending rose, helping to end the financial crisis. Politically, it was a dud. Many Americans gave Obama little credit and voted for Republicans in the 2010 midterms, virtually killing his larger legislative agenda. The stealth tax cut was a smart idea, but it needed to be paired with more salient forms of stimulus, like those projects on the Life Magazine map.
One reason that modern-day Democrats have pursued technocratic policies is the desire to win some Republican votes in Congress. Yet those votes almost never materialize. Today’s Republican Party is too radical. Democrats are then left defending complex programs — like Obamacare’s private exchanges — rather than simple, popular ones — like an expanded Medicare, open to all who want it.
The next Democratic president, whoever it is, shouldn’t repeat this mistake. In climate policy, this would mean putting more emphasis on a green-jobs program than on a hated carbon tax. In education, it could mean creating a “public option” for pre-K. In every area, it also means making sure that government functions well.
Public policy really does have the potential to shape public opinion. Years after Roosevelt created Social Security, one of his advisers suggested to him that funding it with a new tax — the payroll tax — had been a mistake during the depression. Roosevelt responded that the tax transformed the politics of Social Security, making it feel like a savings program rather than welfare.
“I guess you’re right on the economics,” Roosevelt told the adviser. But “those taxes aren’t a matter of economics — they’re straight politics.” As the president explained, “With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program.”

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump told his national security adviser he wanted to maintain a freeze on military assistance to Ukraine until it launched political investigations into his Democratic rivals, according to a report in The New York Times on Sunday.
The newspaper said John Bolton's description of his exchange with Trump appears in drafts of his forthcoming book. The revelation challenges the defense offered up by Trump and his attorneys in his Senate impeachment trial and raises the stakes as the chamber decided this week whether to seek sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses.
Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11, already has told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president's order barring aides from cooperating in the probe. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Sunday night.
Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who has played a prominent role in the Ukraine affair, replied to a request for comment with a text: "I used to like and respect John and tell people they were wrong about how irresponsible he was. I was wrong."
Democrats need at least four Republicans to vote with them to seek witness testimony. Those prospects looked unlikely in recent days and it's unclear if the new revelations about Bolton's book will sway any GOP senators.
Democrats quickly sought to ramp up the pressure on their Republican counterparts.
"John Bolton has the evidence," tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. "It's up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump's actions testify in the Senate trial."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had no immediate comment, according to his office.
The Associated Press has not confirmed the content of Bolton's draft book. A person familiar with the matter told the AP the book had been submitted to the White House for pre-publication review, which is standard for the work of former officials with security clearances. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject.
The book's publisher, Simon & Schuster, declined to comment.
Sarah Tinsley, an adviser to Bolton, said: "The ambassador's manuscript was transmitted to the White House in hard copy several weeks ago for pre-publication review by the NSC. The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period."
Bolton attorney Charles J. Cooper said in a statement that the pre-publication review process had been "corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript."
Democrats accuse Trump of abuse of power in withholding the military assistance to Ukraine to push that country to mount investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukraine gas company, Burisma, while his father was in office.
On Saturday, the president's attorneys said during their opening day of defense arguments that there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden.
The Times also reported that Bolton says he told Attorney General William Barr that he was mentioned by Trump on his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A Justice Department official on Sunday disputed Bolton's account that he had told Barr about the president's call with Zelenskiy but did say that Bolton had called Barr to raise concerns about Giuliani's shadow diplomacy efforts.
Trump on Wednesday told reporters in Davos, Switzerland, that he didn't want Bolton to testify before the Senate.
"The problem with John is it's a national security problem," Trump said. "He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country?"
He added: "It's going to be very hard. It's going to make the job very hard."

Texto completo: BY MICHAEL RUBINKAM and JONATHAN J. COOPER
The Associated Press
HAMBURG, Pa. - For all the gravity of a presidential impeachment trial, Americans don't seem to be giving it much weight.
As House impeachment managers make their case to remove President Donald Trump from office, voters in several states said in interviews with The Associated Press that they're only casually following the Senate trial, or avoiding it altogether - too busy to pay close attention, bored of the legal arguments, convinced the outcome is preordained or just plain tired of the whole partisan saga.
Web traffic and TV ratings tell a similar story, with public interest seeming to flag after the House voted last month to impeach a president for only the third time in U.S. history.
"I've been watching some really odd stuff just to avoid it," said Kim Ashford, 50, a court-appointed advocate for foster children from Gilbert, Ariz. "In my circle, everybody's tired of hearing about it. There's nobody budging. Let's just agree to disagree."
Monica DeMarco, who voted for Trump in 2016 but doesn't plan to do so again, said she hasn't watched a single second of the trial, though she's read a little about it in The New York Times.
"I want to watch something that takes me some place happy," said DeMarco, 50, who lives near Hamburg, Pa., and works for a cargo hauler.
"What's going to happen is going to happen and like the marching ants we are, we'll go on," DeMarco said. "Life's going to go on tomorrow, the sun's going to come up and we're going to take care of what's important in our lives."
Many Americans are tuning out because they made up their minds about Trump's impeachment months ago, said Eric Kasper, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In addition, he said, there's little doubt about the eventual outcome - acquittal by the GOP-controlled Senate - depriving the trial of drama.
"If the story was still unwritten, so to speak, then people would still tune in even if they had personally strong feelings about how they would want it to end," Kasper said. "It's the fact that both of those things are the case - a lot of people have made up their minds, and it looks pretty clear what the outcome of this trial is going to be."
Americans are sharply divided along party lines in their views on impeachment, and most say their positions are firm. Three-quarters say it's not very likely or not at all likely that the trial will introduce new information that would change their minds, according to a poll this month from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
"I don't think there's any possibility of removal, said Montel Herman, 82, of Osage, Iowa, who described himself as a moderate Democrat. "I question whether this is worth it."
Online and on TV, interest has waned since the House launched impeachment hearings into Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
The six major networks drew about 11.8 million viewers on the first day of the Senate trial, when lawmakers debated the rules and argued over documents and witnesses.
Combined viewership plummeted to fewer than 9 million people on the trial's second day, when House Democrats began making their argument to remove Trump from office, according to Nielsen.
By comparison, an estimated 13.8 million people watched the first day of the House impeachment hearings last fall.
"I think it matters. I think we should probably watch it," said Lynn Jackson, 56, a library assistant from San Tan Valley, Ariz. But, she added, "I work all day, and then I get home and I'm cooking, cleaning."
U.S. news sites also have experienced waning impeachment interest.
Around the time of the House impeachment vote last month, stories about impeachment averaged about 20 million page views each day. Last week, impeachment stories drew about 15 million page views daily, according to digital advertising and web tracking company Taboola. Google searches on impeachment have also declined since the House vote.
Interest was a little higher among some of the Democrats lining up to see their party's presidential candidates in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire this weekend. But even those watching closely said they have little doubt the trial will end in acquittal.
"I'm a bit intrigued by it, but it's a foregone conclusion. I had a kid sick kid last week, but that's the only reason I watched for a while. And I fell asleep twice," said Jeremiah Condon, a 38-year-old building contractor from Fort Dodge, Iowa, who attended a campaign event for Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg.
"It's stunning how serious it is, and how little it seems to matter," he said.
Up to this point, the Senate trial has featured evidence and arguments that have already been aired publicly, and it's unclear whether senators will vote to hear from new witnesses that might heighten public interest.
"I'm not going to sit there and watch it word for word," said Paul Faust, 69, an independent from Hamburg who voted for Trump and remains a supporter. "Every day it seems like they're repeating the same thing over and over."
Frank Sprague, chairman of the Claremont School Board in New Hampshire, said he's finding impeachment interesting, but doubts most share his view.
"I think that there's some fatigue around this," Sprague said after an event for Democratic candidate Joe Biden. "The battle lines are drawn, the camps are where they are and some people are in intractable positions, left-right."
Even though Dave Enslow knows how the trial will end, he said it's still important to follow what's happening.
"It's a moment in history," said Enslow, 41, who traveled to Iowa from his home in Seattle to see some of the Democratic candidates in person. "This is a big deal. ... In the political world, I'm not sure it's going to go anywhere, but it's important."

Texto completo: Forget Iowa and New Hampshire. On the same day President Trump's legal team began its impeachment defense in the Senate, "Saturday Night Live" offered an insight into the Democratic mood: There's a new villain in town, and his name is Mitch McConnell.
This weekend's show opened with a skit showing the Senate majority leader on a visit to hell along with Trump defense attorney Alan Dershowitz, who confers with Satan about strategy. In case the message wasn't clear, later in the show the "Weekend Update" segment flashed Mr. McConnell's photo as the mock news announcer says: "Mitch McConnell, seen here calmly watching an orphanage burn . . ." Subtle.
"Saturday Night Live" is easy to dismiss. But its approach to Mr. McConnell has been copied by supposedly serious people, such as Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame. He's coined a popular new hashtag—#MidnightMitch—to characterize Mr. McConnell's role in "a coverup." On Twitter #MidnightMitch has been gleefully picked up by everyone from Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe to Star Trek helmsman George Takei.
"Midnight Mitch" is only the latest in a long line of derogatory nicknames. Earlier examples range from "Cocaine Mitch" to "Moscow Mitch," and are all intended to paint Mr. McConnell as evil. But because they all stem from his opponents' frustration at his successes—Democrats still can't forgive him for quietly killing Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court—the real effect is to present Mr. McConnell as some sort of evil genius.
This week will put him to a test. As the weekend opened, it looked as if the Senate's impeachment trial would be wrapped up by this Friday. But on Sunday the New York Times dropped a leak from a forthcoming book by John Bolton, in which the former national security adviser says the president told him he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine until it launched an investigation into possible corruption involving Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Trump tweeted that he never told Mr. Bolton any such thing. But coming from one of the president's former top advisers, the news makes it harder for Republicans already feeling squeezed to vote against hearing from Mr. Bolton, which will be cast as a vote against learning truth. At a lunch Monday, Mr. McConnell reminded them they don't have to make their decision for a few days.
Now, the issue is more complicated than simply putting Mr. Bolton on the stand. The White House says it will invoke executive privilege, which would tie the trial up in the courts. If Mr. Bolton testifies, Republicans would insist on calling Hunter Biden, or Joe Biden, or maybe Amos Hochstein, the Obama administration aide who raised questions with Mr. Biden about his son's Ukrainian gig.
Which means that the vote on witnesses is also a vote for a much longer trial. How many Senate Democrats—especially those running for president—want that?
The irony is that if the Democratic House managers had aimed their impeachment argument at bringing a handful of Republicans moderates to their side, they'd be in a better position now to pressure Mr. McConnell. Instead, they played to a Democratic base that already agreed with them, in the process offending some of those they would need to persuade with talk of how President Trump would have their "heads on pikes" if they were to go against him (Adam Schiff) and how the president is a "dictator" (Jerry Nadler).
Then again, the choice of Mr. Schiff to lead the impeachment was guaranteed to polarize in a Republican Senate. Yet the choice was Nancy Pelosi's.
Less than a year ago, the speaker had declared that "impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country." Then, with her approval, the House impeached Mr. Trump without a single Republican vote.
Perhaps Mrs. Pelosi was simply bowing to the reality that impeachment was what her caucus wanted. But that raises the question why, despite her inability to hold her line, the press treats her as some Machiavellian virtuoso. Meanwhile, Mr. McConnell, who gets few favorable profiles, continues to stymie Mrs. Pelosi by letting much of the legislation she sends over die of neglect, leading her to lash out at what she's called his "Grim Reaper role." In their most recent clash, he clearly bested the speaker when he ended up proceeding with Mr. Trump's trial without any concessions after she made a show of holding back the articles of impeachment.
The Bolton news may force Mr. McConnell to compromise when he prefers to call no witnesses. But it won't change the trial's outcome.
Democrats know that, even as they continue to thump for witnesses. They do so not because they expect Mr. Bolton's testimony to produce the 20 Republican votes needed for conviction but to prepare the party line for when Mr. Trump is acquitted: We wuz robbed by Midnight Mitch and his Trump coverup.
It may be the best of a bad hand. But sneering hashtags, "Saturday Night Live" skits and accusations of coverup only underscore what's really bothering them: that Mr. McConnell somehow always seems to outfox them.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Pressure is increasing on senators to call John Bolton to testify at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial after the revelation that a draft of a book by the former national security adviser undercuts a key defense argument - that Trump never tied withholding military aid to Ukraine to his demand the country help investigate political rival Joe Biden.
Bolton writes in the forthcoming book that Trump told him he wanted to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid from Ukraine until it helped him with investigations into Biden. Trump's legal team has repeatedly insisted otherwise, and Trump tweeted on Monday that he never told Bolton such a thing.
Republican senators faced a pivotal moment as they arrived on Capitol Hill to resume Trump's trial. Democrats are demanding sworn testimony from Bolton and other key witnesses, and pressure is mounting on at least four Republicans to buck GOP leaders and form a bipartisan majority to force the issue.
“John Bolton's relevance to our decision has become increasingly clear,” GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told reporters. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she has always wanted “the opportunity for witnesses” and the report about Bolton's book “strengthens the case.”
But several GOP senators who met privately with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said nothing had changed. McConnell declined comment.
“Really, there's nothing new here,” said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican. He dismissed the new information as an “effort to sell books.”
Before any vote on witnesses, Trump's legal team was to make its case in depth on Monday, turning to several high-profile attorneys to argue against impeachment.
The team laid out the broad outlines of its defense in a rare Saturday session, at which they accused House Democrats of using the impeachment case to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office.
The White House has had Bolton's manuscript for about a month, and has challenged his use of certain material it considers classified, according to a letter from Bolton's attorney.
Democrats are saying that Trump's refusal to allow administration officials to testify in the impeachment proceeding only reinforces that the White House is hiding evidence.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: “We’re all staring a White House cover-up in the face."
Schumer drew on polls that show the public wants to hear from witnesses. “We want the truth,” he said. “So do the American people.”
Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the House prosecution team, called Bolton's account a test for the senators sitting as jurors.
“I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment,” Schiff said on CNN.
Four Republicans would have to break ranks to join Democrats to call any witnesses, which would extend the trial, which has been expected to conclude fairly rapidly. The Republicans hold a 53-47 Senate majority.
Bolton's account was first reported by The New York Times and was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the manuscript on the condition of anonymity. "The Room Where It Happened; A White House Memoir" is to be released March 17.
John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council that Bolton used to lead, said the manuscript was submitted to the NSC for “pre-publication review” and had been under initial review.
“No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript," he said.
When the Times report went online Sunday night, the seven House Democratic managers immediately called on all senators to insist that Bolton be called as a witness and provide his notes and other relevant documents. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, issued the same call.
Trump denied the claims in a series of tweets early Monday.
“I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said. "If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”
Trump said people could look at transcripts of his call with Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelinskiy to see there was no pressure for such investigations to get the aid. In that call, Trump asked Zelinskiy to “do us a favor” with the investigations as he was withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to the U.S. ally at war with Russia.
Trump falsely claimed Monday that the Democrat-controlled House “never even asked John Bolton to testify." Democrats did ask Bolton to testify, but he didn’t show up for his deposition. They later declined to subpoena Bolton, as they had others, because he threatened to sue, which could lead to a prolonged court battle.
Schiff said Bolton - known to be a copious notetaker - should also provide documents.
Bolton, who sent this book manuscript to the White House for review, is now enmeshed in a legal dispute with the White House over the manuscript's use of direct quotes and other material from meetings and foreign leader discussions. That's according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to speak on the record.
The White House has requested that Bolton remove material it considers classified, the person said, which has the book behind schedule.
Bolton acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11. He has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president's order barring aides from cooperating in the probe.
Eventual acquittal is likely in a Senate where a two-thirds majority vote would be needed for conviction. Still, the White House sees its Senate presentation this week as an opportunity to counter the allegations, defend the powers of the presidency and prevent Trump from being weakened politically ahead of November's election.
Trump faces two articles of impeachment. One accuses him of abusing his power by asking Ukraine to investigate while withholding military aid. The other alleges that Trump obstructed Congress by directing aides to not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.
Monday's presentation was expected to include appearances by Alan Dershowitz, who will argue that impeachable offenses require criminal-like conduct, and Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is also expected to make arguments.
Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.
Once Trump's team concludes, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions of both the House impeachment prosecutors and the president's legal team. Their questions must be in writing, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, will read them aloud.

He also falsely claimed Monday morning that the Democrat-controlled House “never even asked John Bolton to testify."

“Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President - that starts with Mr. Bolton," the impeachment managers said in a statement.
First, though, Trump's legal team will begin laying out its case in depth, turning to several high-profile attorneys to argue against impeachment.
The lawyers revealed the broad outlines of their defense in a rare but truncated Saturday session, at which they accused House Democrats of using the impeachment case to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office.
The legal team is expected to pick up on that theme and also dive into areas that received negligible attention during the Democrats' presentation, including the now-concluded investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.
Acquittal is likely in a Senate where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, with a two-thirds vote needed for conviction. Still, they see an opportunity to counter the allegations, defend the powers of the presidency and prevent Trump from being weakened politically ahead of November's election.
Trump faces two articles of impeachment. One accuses him of abusing his power by asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his Democratic rival, while his administration withheld hundreds of millions of dollars from the country. The other alleges that Trump obstructed Congress by directing aides to not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.
The legal team will portray Trump as having been harassed by investigations from federal agents - and Democrats - since he took office and will seize on the FBI's recent acknowledgment of surveillance errors during the Russia probe. The lawyers have already hinted that they will focus attention on Biden just as he campaigns for a first-place finish in next week's Iowa caucuses.
Monday's presentation is expected to include appearances by Alan Dershowitz, who will argue that impeachable offenses require criminal-like conduct, and Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is also expected to make arguments.
Many legal scholars reject Dershowitz's arguments, saying the Founding Fathers meant for impeachable offenses to incorporate a broad range of conduct by presidents. Dershowitz told The Associated Press last week that he understood that some critics thought his argument was “bonkers” but encouraged them to listen nonetheless.
Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.
On Saturday, the president's attorneys said there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden. They also accused Democrats of omitting information that was favorable to Trump's case.
Once Trump's team concludes, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions of both the House impeachment prosecutors and the president's legal team. Their questions must be in writing, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, will read them aloud.
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters Saturday that Republicans expected to get together on Monday to start formulating a list of questions.
Trump on Monday objected to the idea of calling Bolton, insisting it was up to the House, “not up to the Senate!” to hear witnesses, even though the Senate has that right and is likely to consider the question of witnesses this week.
An attempt to call either probably would lead to a showdown with the White House, which claims both men have “absolute immunity” from being called to testify before the Senate, even in an impeachment trial.

The White House has requested that Bolton remove material it considers classified, the person said, which has the book behind schedule.
Bolton acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11. He has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president's order barring aides from cooperating in the probe.
“Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President - that starts with Mr. Bolton," the impeachment managers said in a statement.
First, though, Trump's legal team will begin laying out its case in depth, turning to several high-profile attorneys to argue against impeachment.
The lawyers revealed the broad outlines of their defense in a rare but truncated Saturday session, at which they accused House Democrats of using the impeachment case to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office.
The legal team is expected to pick up on that theme and also dive into areas that received negligible attention during the Democrats' presentation, including the now-concluded investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.
Acquittal is likely in a Senate where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, with a two-thirds vote needed for conviction. Still, they see an opportunity to counter the allegations, defend the powers of the presidency and prevent Trump from being weakened politically ahead of November's election.
Trump faces two articles of impeachment. One accuses him of abusing his power by asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, his Democratic rival, while his administration withheld hundreds of millions of dollars from the country. The other alleges that Trump obstructed Congress by directing aides to not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.
The legal team will portray Trump as having been harassed by investigations from federal agents - and Democrats - since he took office and will seize on the FBI's recent acknowledgment of surveillance errors during the Russia probe. The lawyers have already hinted that they will focus attention on Biden just as he campaigns for a first-place finish in next week's Iowa caucuses.
Monday's presentation is expected to include appearances by Alan Dershowitz, who will argue that impeachable offenses require criminal-like conduct, and Ken Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation that led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is also expected to make arguments.
Many legal scholars reject Dershowitz's arguments, saying the Founding Fathers meant for impeachable offenses to incorporate a broad range of conduct by presidents. Dershowitz told The Associated Press last week that he understood that some critics thought his argument was “bonkers” but encouraged them to listen nonetheless.
Democrats argued their side of the impeachment case for three days last week, warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election.
On Saturday, the president's attorneys said there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden. They also accused Democrats of omitting information that was favorable to Trump's case.
Once Trump's team concludes, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions of both the House impeachment prosecutors and the president's legal team. Their questions must be in writing, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the trial, will read them aloud.
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told reporters Saturday that Republicans expected to get together on Monday to start formulating a list of questions.
Trump on Monday objected to the idea of calling Bolton, insisting it was up to the House, “not up to the Senate!” to hear witnesses, even though the Senate has that right and is likely to consider the question of witnesses this week.
An attempt to call either probably would lead to a showdown with the White House, which claims both men have “absolute immunity” from being called to testify before the Senate, even in an impeachment trial.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - The stakes over witness testimony at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial are rising now that a draft of a book from former national security adviser John Bolton appears to undercut a key defense argument - that Trump never tied withholding of aid to Ukraine to a demand the country investigate rival Joe Biden..
Bolton writes in the forthcoming book that Trump told him that he wanted to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in security aid from Ukraine until it helped him with investigations into Biden. Trump's legal team has repeatedly insisted otherwise.
On Monday, a person familiar with the case said the White House has had Bolton's manuscript for at least a month, and has challenged his use of certain material it considers classified.
The account immediately gave Democrats new fuel in their pursuit of sworn testimony from Bolton and other witnesses, a question expected to be taken up later this week by the Republican-led Senate. The trial resumes Monday afternoon with arguments from Trump's defense team.
Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the House impeachment inquiry, called Bolton's account a test for the senators sitting as jurors in Trump's impeachment trial.
“I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment,” Schiff said Monday on CNN.
Four Republicans would have to break ranks to join Democrats to call any witnesses, which would extend the trial for an undetermined amount of time.
Bolton's account was first reported by The New York Times and was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the manuscript on the condition of anonymity to discuss the book, “The Room Where It Happened; A White House Memoir," ahead of its release March 17.
John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council that Bolton used to lead, said the manuscript was submitted to the NSC for “pre-publication review” and had been under initial review.
“No White House personnel outside NSC have reviewed the manuscript," he said.
When the Times report went online Sunday night, the seven House Democratic managers immediately called on all senators to insist that Bolton be called as a witness and provide his notes and other relevant documents. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, issued the same call.
Trump denied the claims in a series of tweets early Monday. “I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," Trump said in a tweet. "In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.” Trump said people could look at transcripts of his call and statements by Ukraine President Vlodymyr Zelinskiy that there was no pressure for such investigations to get the aid.
He also falsely claimed Monday morning that the Democrat-controlled House “never even asked John Bolton to testify." In fact, Democrats did ask Bolton to testify, but he didn’t show up for his deposition. They later declined to subpoena Bolton, as they had others, because he threatened to sue, which could lead to a prolonged court battle.
Bolton, who sent the manuscript to the White House for review, is now enmeshed in a legal dispute with the White House over the manuscript's use of direct quotes and other material from meetings and foreign leader discussions.

Wesleyan University student tests negative for coronavirus

Texto completo: MIDDLETOWN — The Centers for Disease Control reported Monday the Wesleyan University student who was being monitored for coronavirus negative over the weekend did not contract the illness.
The student is doing well, according to university spokesperson Lauren Rubenstein.
There are no confirmed cases in Connecticut, Av Harris, director of communication for the state Department of Public Health, said Sunday.
A high school student from China at Yale University in New Haven, who was participating in the Yale Model United Nations conference on campus, tested positive for influenza type A, the state department of health said in a press release. As officials await those test results, the person remains in isolation.
Rubenstein, director of media and public relations at Wesleyan, said Saturday the student who recently traveled in Asia was suffering from a fever and cough, and was in isolation until test results were returned Monday.
“We didn’t want to treat this lightly,” Middletown Mayor Ben Florsheim said Monday afternoon.
Dr. Tom McLarney, medical director of the Wesleyan Davison Health Center, send out a campus-wide email Monday morning.
“Please take common-sense steps to prevent the spread of illness during this cold and flu season. This includes not sharing drinks; coughing into the crook of one’s arm rather than the hand; and frequently using hand sanitizer or washing hands in soap and water for 20 seconds.” McLarney said.
“If you have a cough and fever, and have recently been to China or have been exposed to a person with known coronavirus, please seek immediate medical attention. We will continue to monitor this global health situation, but there is no need for alarm,” he added.
“I appreciate there’s been concern nationwide, and these kinds of things shake people up when it hits close to home. In this case, I’m happy everything happened like it should. The student was right in seeking medical attention,” he said. “The CDC wanted to do the test out of an abundance of caution.”
Florsheim said he hopes the individual gets well soon. “I feel back for the student in the middle of this.”
“It’s not the disease itself that can be dangerous, it’s the complications from it. There’s no risk of it here,” he added.
So far, coronavirus has infected at least 2,800 people in China and killed 81, various media outlets have reported, including The Washington Post.
China extended the Lunar New Year holiday in response to the epidemic. Of the nearly 3,000 people who have so far contracted the disease, the vast majority live in China, according to the New York Times.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. It spreads among humans through coughing and sneezing. Laboratory tests are needed to confirm diagnosis. Symptoms can occur as quickly as two days to two weeks.
Harris said symptoms are similar to those ranging from the common cold to the flu. They include headache, coughs, runny nose, sore throat, fever and a general feeling of malaise. There is no vaccine and no approved drugs to fight the disease.

Why Michael Bloomberg is placing Maine over Iowa and New Hampshire in presidential race

Texto completo: QUOTE OF THE DAY: "The likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft -- it just doesn't happen," said Kurt Deetz, a pilot who used to fly Kobe Bryant, on the possibility that the helicopter the basketball legend was flying in failed Sunday when it crashed in California, killing Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others. The investigation of the crash is centered on foggy weather that grounded other choppers.
What we're watching today
This billionaire Democratic presidential hopeful is the only one prioritizing Maine more than the early-voting states. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire media executive running a late and extravagant bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, will be in Maine on Monday afternoon to have coffee with local leaders in Portland and open a campaign office in Scarborough ahead of the March 3 primary.
There's a simple reason why Bloomberg will be in Maine -- often neglected in primary politics -- instead of early-voting Iowa or New Hampshire: He kicked off his campaign in November while not contesting those early states in favor of quickly organizing in more than 30 other states behind an unprecedented quarter-billion dollars in advertising.
Bloomberg is likely best-known in Maine for the failed 2016 referendum to expand background checks to private gun sales and transfers. The group he founded, Everytown for Gun Safety, dumped millions into a slick campaign only to be upset by underdog gun-rights groups.
That issue wasn't mentioned in a Bangor Daily News OpEd from former U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud, the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee who got high marks from the National Rifle Association at times in his career, in explaining his endorsement of Bloomberg last week. The two will hit the trail together in southern Maine today.
The Maine politics top 3
-- "A new vaccine law will be on the Maine ballot. 'Big Pharma' is opponents' villain," Jessica Piper, Bangor Daily News: "It may be savvy politics in a state wracked by the opioid crisis, but the pharmaceutical money that has often poured into political campaigns in Maine hasn't played a significant role in the referendum so far. Supporters of the law say it's because the issue is about public health."
-- "State's rush to judgment almost took this boy from his family," Eric Russell, Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, "[Jaxen Steimlosk's] case illustrates what can happen to parents of a child with complex, undiagnosed medical problems whose doctors can't agree on treatment. Most states, including Maine, do not separate instances of medical child abuse from all child abuse, so there is no accurate way of knowing how often these types of investigations happen, but experts say parents like Cassie [Steimlosk], who are proactive in trying to get answers, are often the first to spur suspicion."
-- "China deal might not bail out lobster industry this New Year," Patrick Whittle, Associated Press: "American seafood exporters are optimistic that a new trade deal with China will allow them to claw back into one of the world's biggest markets for lobster, but help might not have arrived in time for the biggest day on the calendar."
Impeachment resumes, with new calls for witnesses
-- The president's lawyers will resume their defense in the impeachment trial this afternoon -- but they might be overshadowed. The New York Times reported Sunday evening that former White House national security adviser John Bolton wrote in a draft of his book set to be published in March that President Donald Trump said he wanted to keep military aid to Ukraine frozen until the country helped with his investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden.
The news is likely to amplify calls for the Senate to bring in Bolton as a witness in the impeachment trial. The former national security adviser said earlier this month that he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate, though the White House has indicated at times that it would try to block Bolton's testimony.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who has been one of the most closely watched senators in Washington over the past few weeks, has said that she will likely support calling witnesses in the trial, though she has not named specific individuals. Collins' office didn't respond to a request for comment Sunday night on the Bolton revelation.
Meanwhile, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told the Associated Press over the weekend that he hasn't fully made up his mind on either article of impeachment, but he said an acquittal would be "the largest transfer of power from the Congress to the executive in the history of the country," citing the president's ability so far to refuse to cooperate with congressional investigations.
Marijuana, ATVs and waitlists on the State House docket
-- A task force's recommendations that some of the state's ATV trails have size and weight limits is sure to draw attention today. A presentation on that long-standing issue is planned for this morning in the Cross building. Across the way, a bevy of marijuana related bills -- from product testing to allowing marijuana to be delivered -- will grab attention as the state is just over a month away from recreational sales going live. At noon, Sen. Rebecca Millett, D-Cape Elizabeth, will hold a press conference on a bill that aims to eliminate waitlists for home and community based services for adults. Here's your soundtrack.
Correction
An item in Friday's Daily Brief misstated the amount of an affordable housing tax credit being proposed in a bill by Assistant House Majority Leader Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford. It is $80 million over eight years.

Texto completo: Phillip Milano just wants to start a conversation.

Milano, a former Times-Union editor now living in the south of Spain, has published a series of short books that tackle sticky questions that have probably occurred to all of us, even if we were afraid to ask them out loud.

The "Why Are They Like That?" books are based on an online forum Milano has operated since 1998. The books are short -- mostly 40 pages or fewer -- but tackle many of the topics that plague society today. The 12-book series includes books about blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians, gay men, lesbians, men, women, rich and poor, religion, disabled people and young and old.

Milano said he feels people need to talk things out now more than ever.

"I'm kind of worried about the way things are going right now," he said last week in a phone interview. "The level of prejudice and racism that's going on right now, and the level of hypersensitivity, is scary."

The books are compiled from questions submitted to an online forum Milano runs at DareToAks.com. For more than 20 years, Milano has been taking questions, then finding experts to answer them.

"It really is kind of one of the godfathers of internet

forums," Milano said. "It prestaged Facebook by at least six or seven years. The idea was to bring people together to communicate and learn from each other in social ways."

Over the years, the forum has had more than 10 million visitors and 50,000 postings. He's been interviewe by the New York Times and papers in Finland, Scotland and London. "It was a wild ride there for a while," he said. "It was crazy."

Pretty much no topic is off-limits. The forum tackled sexual topics, scatalogical ones, race issues and discussions of religion, and now the books do the same.

"I'm an equal-opportunity offender," Milano said. "To me, there should never be any boundaries, unless you're coming from a position of hate."

You won't find the books in stores. They are sold through amazon.com, which prints them on demand. They are also available in Kindle format. Prices range from $3.49-$6.99.

"I wanted to kind of assemble everything in one place," he said. "It's been a very digital project but I also wanted something a person could hold in their hand."

Milano, who said he spoke with more than 20,000 college students over the years, said he'd love to see the books make their way into college classrooms to start discussions.

"I don't expect that suddenly I'm going to get rich, but It would be great if it could reach a younger audience," he said.

"I feel for them, I really do. It would be difficult to be coming up in the workforce today, worrying about what you can say and who you might offend."

Texto completo: A leak from a forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton is scrambling the equation in the impeachment trial of President Trump. But if you really want to know why Mr. Bolton represents such a wild card in this process, it is instructive to look back at the title of a previous book.
"Surrender Is Not an Option" is a book Mr. Bolton wrote in 2008, after serving in the George W. Bush administration. That title aptly describes Mr. Bolton's attitude in his long career in government service and the public eye, in which he has been unafraid of making enemies, willing to take unpopular stands on and prepared to fall on his sword over his principles.
President Trump's supporters have long known Mr. Bolton represented the X factor in their push to get a quick acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial over charges the president abused power by coercing Ukraine to open investigations of Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Bolton was inside the White House when the Ukraine maneuvering took place, then left on unhappy terms and made clear along the way he disagreed with how the president handled Ukraine.
The fears in Trump land materialized late Sunday, when the New York Times first reported that the manuscript of a forthcoming Bolton memoir says the president told Mr. Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold congressionally appropriated military aid for Ukraine until the Ukrainian government helped with investigations of the Bidens.
Mr. Trump promptly denied the assertion . Still, in constructing their defense, the president's supporters have essentially tried to have it both ways in the Ukraine case: They have insisted there was no quid pro quo demand for Biden investigations made while withholding aid from Ukraine, and that it would be entirely proper even if there were. The Trump defense now may feel compelled to lean on the latter argument.
Perhaps more important, the Bolton revelation may compel a few Republican Senators to decide that they should hear testimony from the former national security adviser and others before moving to final judgment. That is what the Trump team has been trying hard to avoid; witness testimony would extend the trial and open the door for unpleasant surprises.
Mr. Bolton himself is a potential problem for the president on several fronts. First, he has never been one to back away from controversy, or to be intimidated. In that 2008 book, he wrote simply: "For myself, in or out of government, I have no intention of leaving the firing line."
He is no disgruntled moderate, but rather a man with long standing in the ranks of Republican conservatives. The son of a Baltimore firefighter, he began his life in politics as a supporter of Sen. Barry Goldwater's 1964 conservative presidential candidacy. Later, he publicly lectured liberal classmates during graduation ceremonies at Yale University.
He earned a law degree and worked in the Reagan administration and both Bush administrations, earning a reputation as an anti-Soviet hawk. Mr. Bolton has dismissed those trying to label him a "neoconservative," insisting he was just a conservative, period.
His reputation among Democrats—the same Democrats now so eager to hear him testify in the Trump impeachment trial—was so toxic that President George W. Bush had to slip him into place as the American ambassador to the United Nations while Congress was in recess , because the prospects of his winning Senate confirmation were so dim.
Ironically, Mr. Bolton was controversial precisely because he felt the same disdain for the foreign-policy establishment that Mr. Trump displays. In his book, he writes of a Trump-like distaste for the European Union, calling its approach to global affairs "ever more globalist, statist, bureaucratic, legalistic, and passive (and far too often pacifist), an approach that many on the American left would be delighted to adopt for our country as well."
And he has long openly attacked the State Department bureaucracy, in which he once worked, describing it in terms much like those Trump supporters used in criticizing foreign-service officers who testified in impeachment hearings. Mr. Bolton wrote that, at the State Department, "too much of the permanent bureaucracy thinks it is responsible not just for implementing policy, but for setting it, no matter what the president of the moment thinks, certainly not if that president is Republican."
On policy toward Russia and North Korea, though, Mr. Bolton found his hardline views at odds with President Trump's positions. His belief the U.S. needed to keep up pressure on Moscow by opening the spigots for military aid to Ukraine compelled him to disagree with Mr. Trump's approach.
Now, Mr. Bolton's broader credibility with conservatives, and his career-long tendency to speak his mind no matter what, mean he represents a migraine headache-in-the-making for the White House.

Texto completo: A new White House video lauds President Donald Trump for accomplishments he’s made during his time in office, opening with a clip from his 2017 inauguration address before flashing a montage of photos overlaid with words describing his achievements as president.
A number of the video’s stated achievements are accurate, but we also found several claims that were false, misleading or lacking some context.
Claim: Lowered drug prices
When Trump said in May 2019 that “drug prices are coming down,” we rated that Mostly False. The White House pointed to the Consumer Price Index for drugs, and using one particular time period, there was a small decline. But that index leaves out the actual prices people pay, and it only covers retail drugs, about three-fourths of all prescriptions.
Beyond those limitations, the latest numbers for that very index show drug prices rising by about 3.9% in December 2019.
Other ways to measure drug prices show that thousands of drugs have seen prices go up, while only about 100 have seen prices fall.
Claim: Largest tax cuts and reforms in history
Trump says this often, but it’s False. Trump is referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which is projected to cut about $1.5 trillion in taxes over 10 years, or about $150 billion a year.
Several bills since the 1980s have provided larger tax cuts, according to a Treasury Department list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of the gross domestic product.
In inflation-adjusted dollars, the 2017 tax bill is the fourth-largest since 1940. And as a percentage of GDP, it ranks seventh.
Claim: Destroyed ISIS
This is misleading. While ISIS’s land holdings have been depleted, the group still poses a legitimate threat around the world, despite what Trump says.
According to data we analyzed, ISIS controlled about 89% less territory at the start of 2018 that it did at the beginning of Trump’s presidency. This map from the Congressional Research Service shows the extent of lost ISIS territory through August 2018.
But even if the organization’s land holdings have been largely dismantled, ISIS itself has not been destroyed. Experts told us ISIS is still capable of carrying out attacks across the globe, and the New York Times reported in August that the group has as many as 18,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria.
Claim: Rebuilt the military
The Trump administration has increased military spending, but rebuilding the military would require new equipment that can take years to build and develop.
Only a portion of the Trump administration’s military spending has gone toward what would be considered a rebuild under any reasonable definition of the term.
The administration’s scaled-up defense spending has helped make troops and equipment more ready for combat, said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. But overall, Trump’s claim of a total rebuild is “hyperbole.”
“Most weapons are the same as before,” O’Hanlon said. “There is more continuity than change in defense policy from Obama to Trump.”
According to an index of the military’s strength by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the military currently receives a grade of “marginal.”
“The active component of the U.S. military is two-thirds the size it should be, operates equipment that is older than should be the case, and is burdened by readiness levels that are problematic,” the report concluded.
Claim: No. 1 energy producer in the world
The United States is the world’s top producer of oil and natural gas. But this is not a new feat.
The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012 and the top natural gas producer for years. Both achievements happened before Trump took over the White House, but that hasn’t stopped Trump and his allies from giving him the credit.
Claim: Created 7+ million jobs
This is largely accurate, with the exact number of new jobs depending on how you count.
Total nonfarm employment has grown by nearly 6.7 million since Trump took office in January 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But using Trump’s November 2016 election date as the baseline, Trump has added about 7.15 million new jobs.
As FactCheck.org noted, Trump’s job growth continued a string of consecutive monthly gains in overall employment that started under President Barack Obama in October 2010.

Has an editorial endorsement ever decided how you'd vote?

Texto completo: For something that everyone agrees doesn't matter much, the New York Times' endorsement of two candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination sure generated a big buzz.
Political analysts, serious journalists and activists on both sides of the partisan divide offered expert insights on what impact the Times' editorial endorsement of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar might have on the Iowa caucuses next month. There were wide-ranging opinions about not only the merits of the two candidates, but whether it was a cop-out for such a prestigious journal as the Times not to make one choice.
How they did it was really interesting. The editors released video of their roundtable discussions and recaps of what candidates said in interviews with the board. Members of the editorial board went on TV talk shows to discuss how they arrived at their split decision.
The written editorial was long and ponderous, explaining why the Times didn't pick any of the men running and exploring pros and cons of the Warren and Klobuchar candidacies.
Basically, it came down to recognizing that the Democratic Party has moved substantially to the left, and deciding how far the editors wanted to follow that movement. That left Warren, the more liberal of plausible contenders, and Klobuchar, a more moderate candidate with appeal in those Midwest states that tipped the balance to President Trump three years ago.
"Both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration," the editorial said. "If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it. That's why we're endorsing the most effective advocates for each approach."
Wow, that's a straddle to give Hamlet a headache. Traditional new ideas. Moderate radicalism. John Kennedy's New Frontier and Warren Harding's "return to normalcy."
Coverage of the Times endorsement competed for attention with events of Martin Luther King Jr. Day observances, the Second Amendment rally at the Virginia statehouse and — oh, yeah — trial preparations for an impeachment of the president. And one little detail mentioned again and again was that newspaper endorsements don't matter much any more. If they ever did.
That comes as no surprise to those of us working in newsrooms. For years, we've heard readers complain about endorsements — either their candidate didn't get chosen, or they think an editorial pick shows bias in news coverage, or they just don't like being told how to vote.
Well, newspapers — not even the haughty Times — aren't telling you how to vote. They're expressing their own opinions. A lot of people say they use newspaper endorsements as a guide for who will not get their votes. Well, that's their editorial opinion. The First Amendment is for you, too.
You may not believe it, but political endorsements don't influence news coverage. Reporters and editorial writers (and columnists) have separate and distinct duties. And if your favorites didn't get endorsed, you can always write letters to the paper and give another side. Florida used to have a "right to reply" law, which fairly shouted its unconstitutionality, requiring papers to print any response a spurned candidate submitted in response to an editorial choice.
Former Tallahassee Democrat publisher Skip Foster ended candidate endorsements several years ago. The paper has no plans to start again, since Skip left recently. Foster said it's better for a news organization to discuss issues and events, not people.
"Endorsing injects us into a political process where we ought to be completely Switzerland," he said. "The benefit of the endorsement is outweighed by the harm of getting us out of our objective place."
But then, we're not the New York Times.
That one is an endorsement with real prestige, one all candidates covet, one that can change minds. You could even say Walter Mondale and Mike Dukakis would never have been president, if they hadn't had the editorial endorsement of the New Yor...
OK, bad example.

Trump visit stirs memories of unpaid bills in Atlantic City

Texto completo: Steve Jenkins says he does not plan to show up at President Donald Trump's rally this week in Wildwood.
But if he made the trek from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Jenkins would bring a bill — for the tens of thousands of dollars he says Trump still owes him.
Of all the troubling accusations that have followed Trump into the White House, there is little talk these days of the trail of unpaid bills he left behind from his days as an Atlantic City casino mogul.
Trump obviously faces far more formidable problems now, including his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. So it's highly unlikely that he will mention his unpaid bills from Atlantic City when he takes the stage Tuesday night at the Wildwoods Convention Center.
But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.
"It's terrible," said Jenkins, who runs Triad Building Specialties. "I can't stand Trump. I think he's nothing but a snake oil salesman."
Jenkins was just 19 when Triad Building Specialties, started by his father in the mid-1970s, got the $300,000 contract to provide guardrails, doors, stalls and paper dispensers for the nearly 300 public bathrooms at the Trump Taj Mahal casino overlooking the Atlantic City beachfront.
It was April 1990. Trump was viewed across the world as a master businessman. His book "Trump: The Art of the Deal," published three years earlier, was still on the bestseller lists.
In Atlantic City, Trump bragged that the Taj Mahal — which he claimed had a price tag of $1.2 billion — was the "eighth wonder of the world." Not only was it considered the largest casino anywhere, it was adorned with crystal chandeliers from Austria, hand-sewn carpets from Britain, Carrara marble from Italy and 70 onion domes that towered over the Atlantic City boardwalk.
But the Taj, as it came to be called, was built on financial sand.
What Trump didn't say was that he financed the Taj with junk bonds. And what he did not tell the scores of contractors who worked on the overly lavish casino was that he could not pay their bills.
Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers. And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm's co-owner.
"If it was just us, you could understand, but this has been a pattern over his entire career," Jenkins said. "He's owned so many failed or fraudulent companies over the years. It's staggering to me."
Trump, who once bragged that he was the "King of Debt," owed $70 million to 253 contractors who worked on the Taj and who, in turn, hired thousands of workers.
Some firms sculpted the cement on the Taj's domes and minarets. Others installed the casino's windows and chandeliers. Still others laid the pipes and concrete pavers.
When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren't overcharging. Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.
That kind of strategy in delaying payment on his bills was not new. In "Trump: The Art of the Deal," he wrote: "You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back."
In this case, Trump took the shirts off the backs of contractors — and emptied their wallets.
Meanwhile, Trump's own wallet seemed as fat as ever. Trump has never said his poor business dealings in Atlantic City hurt his personal finances. In fact, he says he continued to make money from his casinos. "Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me," he told the New York Times in 2016. "The money I took out of there was incredible."
Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. was only a teenager when the news emerged of Trump's failure to pay for the workers at the Taj Mahal. But even today, he said, the subject stirs anger in the city.
"It's still a talking point, anytime his name is brought up," Small said. "It's still a horror story for all of these people. He took advantage of people."
With Trump delaying payments, contractors reached into their pockets to pay their workers and suppliers. In desperation, some contractors eagerly accepted a new offer from Trump: If they would agree to less than they billed, he would pay the lower amounts immediately.
By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed. He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.
And they were the lucky ones.
An Atlantic City firm that supplied paving stones lost $1.2 million. An Ohio company that made the Taj Mahal's onion domes was shortchanged $2 million. A firm that brought in the Carrara marble from Italy went bankrupt.
Steven Perskie, a former Democratic assemblyman and state senator from Margate, had an appallingly close-up view of Trump's battles with contractors. In 1990, then-Gov. James Florio appointed Perskie to run the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
Perskie, who later became a state Superior Court judge, said "a number of local contractors and suppliers" simply gave up and went out of business. And when Trump gave up the last of his Atlantic City casino holdings in 2009, it ended any chance that contractors would get paid.
In 2016, when asked by The New York Times in the midst of Trump's presidential campaign for his opinion of the former casino mogul, Perskie thought back to those unpaid contractors and their lingering financial scars.
"When he left Atlantic City, it wasn't, 'Sorry to see you go,'" Perskie said. "It was, 'How fast can you get the hell out of here?'"
Since then, Perskie has refused to discuss Trump. When contacted by NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey about the upcoming rally and the legacy of Trump's unpaid bills in Atlantic City, Perskie declined to comment, citing his concern that he would be targeted for ridicule by Trump supporters.
Others who knew of Trump's financial failings in Atlantic City are not so shy.
"You don't want to hear what I think of Donald Trump," said Marty Rosenberg of Egg Harbor.
Rosenberg's firm, Atlantic Plate and Glass, installed most of the glass and mirrors in the Taj Mahal. But when the casino opened, Trump still owed Rosenberg more than $1.5 million.
What Rosenberg, now 76 and retired, quickly noticed was that Trump had no intention of forking over the money. And with Trump saying he would pay only 33 cents on each dollar he owed, Rosenberg organized the unpaid contractors.
The group then pressured Trump to pay up. But in the end, most came up short.
Rosenberg had to take out bank loans to pay his bills. He says he also spent hours on the phone begging his suppliers to give him more time.
Eventually, he paid everyone. But he is still bitter about Trump. And while he says he is a political "independent," he nevertheless volunteered to speak in television ads supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. Today, Rosenberg says the way Trump handled his business affairs in Atlantic City "is similar to how he handles the United States." And with a touch of sarcasm, Rosenberg added: "If ethics and morality have nothing to do with business, then Donald Trump is a very good businessman."
Today, Rosenberg says he does not like to talk about Trump. Rosenberg is fed up. He follows the impeachment hearings. And he plans to follow the upcoming presidential campaign.
Yet he is still angry at how Trump shortchanged him. He is tempted to present Trump with a bill when the president visits Wildwood for a rally among supporters. But Rosenberg can't be bothered.
"I don't have anything nice to say about him," Rosenberg said. "I try not to mention his name."

Texto completo: There were the winners, of course. The buzzer-beaters that pop up whenever you type his name in a search engine.
There was the 81-point game and the MVP and the endless All-Star selections, not to mention the championships.
There are the stories of Kobe Bryant's competitiveness, his relentless will, his workout routine, his tolerance of physical pain, and his inquisitiveness about ... well, everything. He won an Oscar for producing an animated short film, for goodness' sake, and he championed women's sports like few iconic male athletes before him.
His off-court legacy was complicated, certainly. He had been charged, with sexual assault in 2003. Those charges were dropped the following year. His on-court legacy was complicated, too, especially his beef with his Hall of Fame Lakers teammate, Shaquille O'Neal, which led to their infamous split, and possibly derailed the chance of future titles.
He played with the heat of a blast furnace. At times, he struggled to find balance in a game that demands five players in concert but often rewards a singular, comet-like force.
He talked about his search for that balance later in life.
"My career — like other things in life — was never perfect," he told The New York Times in an interview about the documentary he produced, "Dear Basketball." "There's beauty in those imperfections, and the last thing I wanted to do was create a film where all the lines were perfect, and all the coloring was perfect."
All of that matters as we remember Bryant.
But that's not fundamentally why we are mourning him today after news broke that he was killed — along with daughter Gianna and seven other people — in a helicopter crash outside Los Angeles on Sunday.
Bryant didn't just transcend basketball. He freed us from the limitations of the human body. He was beautiful to watch. A balletic presence no matter the pressure or expectation.
And though he might not have been an absolute original in his on-court style — he famously studied and mimicked Michael Jordan's repertoire — he played with a grace and fluidity even Jordan didn't possess.
Like Jordan, Bryant stood apart inside a space stuffed with spectacular athleticism. Like Jordan, he showed fearlessness in the tensest of moments.
To summon calm in the face of pressure is part of his legend. That is why we watched.
But in part, too, because when he leaped toward the rim, when he contorted himself midair, when he stopped in an instant, pirouetted in one direction as the defender flailed in another, when he rose up in flawless balance, shoulders always square to the basket, he was showing us a form of physical perfection.
He was showing us what was possible.
This is what our most outsized athletes do: They carry the sense of immortality. And its loss is crushing. Because it reminds us of our own mortality.
No wonder so many congregated Sunday afternoon at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. They wanted to pay respects, yes, but they also wanted to gather in acknowledgment that something gorgeous and true fell from the sky.
Something that liberated us.
Music can have a similar effect, and when we lose a musician, an innovator, an artist too young, we lose someone who gave us voice, who helped explain us to ourselves.
But losing a transcendent athlete still feels different. For they don't really walk among us. They glide. Or float. Or hover. Somewhere between the earth underfoot and the heavens.
We look up because we want to escape, if only for a moment. And because we don't know what's coming next.
In this way, they stretch our imagination.
Bryant did this like few others. All you had to do was watch his majestic stride, to see the spark jumping off his shaved head, to see his eyes, to know that they absorbed the world from a different view.
That vantage point is gone. Way too soon. Just when he was pivoting to a second act, determined to endeavor in new fields with the same ferocity.
Whether it was making movies or coaching his daughter or spreading the essence of what made him combine his otherworldly basketball talent with all of that outsized drive to succeed.
He called it the Mamba mentality. Or maybe we called it that and he adopted it. Whatever its origin, he didn't need the brand.
For in the end, he was simply Kobe. Walking on air for the rest of us.

Trump visit stirs memories of unpaid bills in Atlantic City

Texto completo: Steve Jenkins says he does not plan to show up at President Donald Trump's rally this week in Wildwood.
But if he made the trek from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Jenkins would bring a bill — for the tens of thousands of dollars he says Trump still owes him.
Of all the troubling accusations that have followed Trump into the White House, there is little talk these days of the trail of unpaid bills he left behind from his days as an Atlantic City casino mogul.
Trump obviously faces far more formidable problems now, including his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. So it's highly unlikely that he will mention his unpaid bills from Atlantic City when he takes the stage Tuesday night at the Wildwoods Convention Center.
But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.
"It's terrible," said Jenkins, who runs Triad Building Specialties. "I can't stand Trump. I think he's nothing but a snake oil salesman."
Jenkins was just 19 when Triad Building Specialties, started by his father in the mid-1970s, got the $300,000 contract to provide guardrails, doors, stalls and paper dispensers for the nearly 300 public bathrooms at the Trump Taj Mahal casino overlooking the Atlantic City beachfront.
It was April 1990. Trump was viewed across the world as a master businessman. His book "Trump: The Art of the Deal," published three years earlier, was still on the bestseller lists.
In Atlantic City, Trump bragged that the Taj Mahal — which he claimed had a price tag of $1.2 billion — was the "eighth wonder of the world." Not only was it considered the largest casino anywhere, it was adorned with crystal chandeliers from Austria, hand-sewn carpets from Britain, Carrara marble from Italy and 70 onion domes that towered over the Atlantic City boardwalk.
But the Taj, as it came to be called, was built on financial sand.
What Trump didn't say was that he financed the Taj with junk bonds. And what he did not tell the scores of contractors who worked on the overly lavish casino was that he could not pay their bills.
Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers. And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm's co-owner.
"If it was just us, you could understand, but this has been a pattern over his entire career," Jenkins said. "He's owned so many failed or fraudulent companies over the years. It's staggering to me."
Trump, who once bragged that he was the "King of Debt," owed $70 million to 253 contractors who worked on the Taj and who, in turn, hired thousands of workers.
Some firms sculpted the cement on the Taj's domes and minarets. Others installed the casino's windows and chandeliers. Still others laid the pipes and concrete pavers.
When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren't overcharging. Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.
That kind of strategy in delaying payment on his bills was not new. In "Trump: The Art of the Deal," he wrote: "You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back."
In this case, Trump took the shirts off the backs of contractors — and emptied their wallets.
Meanwhile, Trump's own wallet seemed as fat as ever. Trump has never said his poor business dealings in Atlantic City hurt his personal finances. In fact, he says he continued to make money from his casinos. "Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me," he told the New York Times in 2016. "The money I took out of there was incredible."
Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. was only a teenager when the news emerged of Trump's failure to pay for the workers at the Taj Mahal. But even today, he said, the subject stirs anger in the city.
"It's still a talking point, anytime his name is brought up," Small said. "It's still a horror story for all of these people. He took advantage of people."
With Trump delaying payments, contractors reached into their pockets to pay their workers and suppliers. In desperation, some contractors eagerly accepted a new offer from Trump: If they would agree to less than they billed, he would pay the lower amounts immediately.
By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed. He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.
And they were the lucky ones.
An Atlantic City firm that supplied paving stones lost $1.2 million. An Ohio company that made the Taj Mahal's onion domes was shortchanged $2 million. A firm that brought in the Carrara marble from Italy went bankrupt.
Steven Perskie, a former Democratic assemblyman and state senator from Margate, had an appallingly close-up view of Trump's battles with contractors. In 1990, then-Gov. James Florio appointed Perskie to run the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
Perskie, who later became a state Superior Court judge, said "a number of local contractors and suppliers" simply gave up and went out of business. And when Trump gave up the last of his Atlantic City casino holdings in 2009, it ended any chance that contractors would get paid.

"When he left Atlantic City, it wasn't, 'Sorry to see you go,'" Perskie said. "It was, 'How fast can you get the hell out of here?'"
Since then, Perskie has refused to discuss Trump.

Texto completo: Joe Biden "positions himself as a safer choice while the other three contenders fight it out below him."
David Paleologos
Suffolk's Political Research Center
One week before the opening Iowa caucuses, former Vice President Joe Biden leads a fluid Democratic field, a new Suffolk University/USA TODAY Network Poll of the state finds.
In the survey taken Thursday through Sunday, Biden was backed by 25% of likely Democratic caucusgoers, ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 19%; former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 18%; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 13%; and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar at 6%.
But an additional 13% were undecided, and 45% of those with a preference said it was still possible they might change their minds. That underscores the possibility of more shifts in a state where Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have each been ahead in one poll or another in recent months.
The Iowa outcome typically narrows the presidential field – costing also-runs the funds and standing to continue their campaigns – while providing a burst of momentum for the winner heading into the New Hampshire primary and other contests that follow.
"Joe Biden continues to lead because the number one issue of caucusgoers is to defeat Donald Trump," said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center. The former vice president "positions himself as a safer choice while the other three contenders fight it out below him."
Trump's impeachment trial may have reinforced the focus of Democratic voters on electability.
Two-thirds of those polled said they have watched at least some of the trial that began last week.
In the end, 77% predicted the Senate won't convict the president and remove him from office.
Even so, they didn't view the impeachment proceedings as a waste of time. Seventy-one percent said the trial was "important" even if Trump was acquitted. Nearly 1 in 4, 23%, said the impeachment proceedings had made them more likely to participate in the caucuses, a sign that it may be energizing Democratic-leaning voters.
By 57%-31%, those surveyed said that "in their gut" they thought Trump would be defeated for reelection.
Asked which issue was most important to them, nearly four in 10 said "defeating Donald Trump," almost double the 21% who identified health care.
Only climate change also was cited by double digits, at 12%.
Most Biden supporters, 51%, called defeating Trump their top priority, compared with 34% of Sanders supporters and 29% of Warren supporters. Sanders led among voters who cited health care as their top issue.
Warren and Klobuchar led among those who named climate change.
The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers, taken by landline and cellphone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.
The support for Warren and Sanders was the most solid; about 6 in 10 of their backers said their minds were firmly made up.
In contrast, a majority of Buttigieg and Klobuchar supporters said it was possible they would change their minds. Biden supporters by 53%-43% said their minds were made up.
Nearly two-thirds of the fieldwork for the poll was completed before The Des Moines Register announced its endorsement of Warren Saturday evening, a factor that could boost her standing in the state.
The Suffolk/USA TODAY Poll, taken Jan. 23-26, is the most current in a string of recent Iowa polls. A New York Times/Siena poll taken Jan. 20-23 showed Sanders leading at 25%, Buttigieg at 18% and Biden at 17%. A CBS News/YouGov poll taken Jan. 16-23 put showed Sanders at 26%, Biden at 25%.
The differing results could reflect changes in public sentiment or simply the effects of the margins of errors in polls.
In the new poll, entrepreneur Andrew Yang was at 3%, environmental activist Tom Steyer at 2% and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at 1%.
Biden did best among the oldest voters; 41% of those 65 and older supported him; Warren was second with just 11%. Sanders did best among the youngest voters; 33% of those 35 and under backed the Vermont senator; Buttigieg was second at 18%. Biden led among voters who said they were moderates; Sanders led among those who identified themselves as liberal or very liberal.
Meanwhile, there was some reassuring news for Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar and Michael Bennet – candidates whose day jobs as U.S. senators have required them to spend the campaign's final push sitting in the Senate chamber for Trump's trial rather than campaigning in Iowa. Eighty-eight percent said the senators' absences wouldn't affect their vote. Still, 5% agreed with the statement, "I expect candidates to be in Iowa to earn my vote."
Joe Biden "positions himself as a safer choice while the other three contenders fight it out below him."

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump holds a rally in Wildwood on Tuesday, he will be surrounded by cellphones, webcams and giant screens.
That wasn't the case the last time a president visited Cape May County.
But then again, it was the 1890s.
Benjamin Harrison was reportedly the most recent presidential visitor in the county that will host Trump this week.
Trump will be the first sitting president in Wildwood — a location chosen because it's in the district of U.S. Rep Jeff Van Drew, who recently switched to the Republican party.
But in the 1800s, neighboring Cape May was a big summertime draw for Harrison and a number of other presidents.
Most of them stayed at Congress Hall, which Harrison made his "summer White House."
"By the middle of the 19th century, Cape May had become a booming holiday destination, rivaling Saratoga and Newport for popularity," the Congress Hall website noted.
While Trump is coming to Cape May County to campaign, previous presidents sought seaside relaxation. Here's a look at their time at the shore:
Franklin Pierce, 1855 Many find the ocean air restorative, and that was apparently what lured President Franklin Pierce and his wife, Jane.
A July 5, 1855, article in the Pittsfield Sun reported "President Pierce and Mrs. Pierce are on a visit to Cape Island, N.J., for the health of the latter. They arrived there from Washington on Thursday."
Cape Island was renamed Cape May in 1869.
James Buchanan, 1867 Health concerns also brought former President James Buchanan to the shore.
"His health, we regret to say, is quite feeble," reported an Aug. 25, 1867, New York Times article.
"He is suffering from extreme debility, the effect of a bilious attack which occurred on his return from Cape May, where he has been passing some weeks," the article added.
His trip apparently ended on a better note, with the article noting "he was decidedly better yesterday."
Buchanan would only live until the following summer but the shore trip apparently brought short-term relief.
Ulysses S. Grant, 1873-75 Grant made four visits to Cape May with his wife, Julia, in the summer of 1873, staying at Congress Hall.
In July 1875, Grant arrived in Cape May aboard a U.S. revenue cutter along with dignitaries who included a judge, governor and general.
The visit was quite a big deal, reported the New York Times.
"Their arrival was announced by the booming of cannon and demonstrations of enthusiasm. The distinguished visitors will witness the grand regatta, which promises to congregate more people than ever previously assembled on the island."
Chester Arthur, 1883 Forget fighting shore traffic. Arthur traveled to Cape May by presidential yacht, the USS Despatch.
"After being ceremoniously escorted along the beach front, now Beach Avenue, the President was welcomed at the Stockton Hotel by the strains of 'Hail to the Chief,' played by Hassler's orchestra and the Weccacoe Band," according to the nearly century-old book "South Jersey: A History 1664-1924."
A local newspaper article added that on July 23, the night of his arrival, Arthur "managed to shake hands with upwards of 2,500 people."
Afterwards, the president met with "a few gentlemen who desired to see him socially."
"He said that he was greatly pleased with Cape May," the New York Times reported.
Benjamin Harrison, 1889-91 Even presidents like having a buddy with a shore house. For Harrison, it was famous Philadelphia retailer and Postmaster General John Wanamaker.
First lady Caroline Harrison and her family were guests at Wanamaker's Cape May cottage in June 1889; the president also paid a visit during that time, according to a 1974 Cape May newspaper article.
The next summer, the Harrisons stayed in a new shore cottage, a $10,000 gift from Wanamaker and William McLean, editor of the Philadelphia Public Ledger (An 1890 New York Times article noted that the president later paid for the home).
In the summer of 1891, Harrison spent all but one week of the summer season at Congress Hall, the "summer White House."
While the president found the shore a conducive environment for work, his wife enjoyed the leisure activities.
Caroline Harrison "was probably the most powerful and biggest booster of Cape May County in history," the 1974 article said.
"Mrs. Harrison was caught up in the social life of the shore and often took carriage rides through the area."
The shore was an escape from the scrutiny the couple faced at the White House, the article noted: "Cape residents did respect the privacy of President and Mrs. Harrison and did fend off the hordes of reporters that swarmed over the area."

Texto completo: The Environmental Protection Agency has made it easier for cities to keep dumping raw sewage into rivers by letting them delay or otherwise change federally imposed fixes to their sewer systems, according to interviews with local officials, water utilities and their lobbyists.
Cities have long complained about the cost of meeting federal requirements to upgrade aging sewer systems, many of which release untreated waste directly into waterways during heavy rains - a problem that climate change worsens as rainstorms intensify.
These complaints have gained new traction with the Trump administration, which has been more willing to renegotiate the agreements that dictate how, and how quickly, cities must overhaul their sewers.
The actions are the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to roll back nearly 95 environmental rules that it has said are too costly for industry or taxpayers. That list grew last week when the administration stripped clean-water protections from wetlands, streams and other waterways.
"When you walk into the current EPA, as a local government, you're not treated as evil," said Paul Calamita, a lawyer who represents cities seeking to change their agreements. "Which we'd gotten, quite frankly, from prior administrations."
Cities that said they are renegotiating their sewage agreements with the agency include Cleveland; Seattle; Kansas City, Missouri; South Bend, Indiana; and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Other cities, including Pittsburgh; Louisville, Kentucky; and St. Louis have already concluded talks for new terms.
The scale of many of the upgrades required by prior administrations is enormous.
Washington, D.C., which is considering whether to renegotiate its own deal with the EPA, is currently drilling the second of three mammoth tunnels designed for one thing: to hold 190 million gallons of untreated sewage and stormwater. The tunnels will be used when the city's aging sewer system is overwhelmed so that untreated wastewater doesn't flow into the Anacostia River as it now does - 15 to 20 times a year.
While officials in many of these cities praise the Trump administration's flexibility, environmentalists said that the changes threaten safety by allowing pathogens and chemicals to keep flowing into rivers and along beaches and back up into streets or basements during storms.
"This trend is yet another example of the administration's deregulatory agenda threatening our natural resources and public health," said Becky Hammer, deputy director for federal water policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "If cities face genuine cost concerns, there are other methods to maintain affordability while still keeping sewage out of our lakes and rivers."
Since the start of the Trump administration, the EPA has undertaken rollbacks of dozens of environmental regulations, including limits on the use of pollutants near streams and wetlands, on toxic emissions from industrial facilities and on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.
Asked to comment on the EPA's increased willingness to let cities keep releasing sewage, Michael Abboud, a spokesman for the EPA, said in a statement that the agency "has consistently stated that it hopes to achieve full compliance" with the law.
Modern federal rules outlaw the release of raw sewage. But older cities across the Northeast and Midwest have older sewer systems designed to carry sewage and rainwater in the same pipes. When rain overwhelms those systems, untreated sewage gets released into local waterways.
Climate change has worsened the problem, causing systems to overflow more often.
Starting in the 1990s, the EPA, along with the Department of Justice, began entering agreements that let cities like these avoid fines by committing to detailed plans for reducing or eliminating overflows. Those agreements, called consent decrees and approved by judges, impose rigid timelines for the work.
Under past administrations, the EPA would sometimes let cities modify these deals, according to Cynthia Giles, who led the agency's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance under President Barack Obama.
But the bar was high, she said, citing the example of a major unforeseen disaster that made timely compliance too difficult.
"A consent decree is not the opening bid of a negotiation," said Giles, now a guest fellow at Harvard Law School. "It's a legally binding commitment that is ordered by a federal court."

Bolton: Trump tied aid to probes In book, ex-adviser says Ukraine funds linked to inquiries

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump told his national security adviser in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens, according to an unpublished manuscript by the former adviser, John Bolton.
The president's statement as described by Bolton could undercut a key element of his impeachment defense: that the holdup in aid was separate from Trump's requests that Ukraine announce investigations into his perceived enemies, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had worked for a Ukrainian energy firm while his father was in office.
Bolton's explosive account of the matter at the center of Trump's impeachment trial, the third in American history, was included in drafts of a manuscript he has circulated in recent weeks to close associates. He also sent a draft to the White House for a standard review process for some current and former administration officials who write books.
Multiple people described Bolton's account of the Ukraine affair.
The book presents an outline of what Bolton might testify to if he is called as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial, the people said. The White House could use the prepublication review process, which has no set time frame, to delay or even kill the book's publication or omit key passages.
Over dozens of pages, Bolton described how the Ukraine affair unfolded over several months until he departed the White House in September. He described not only the president's private disparagement of Ukraine but also new details about senior Cabinet officials who have publicly tried to sidestep involvement.
For example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged privately that there was no basis to claims by the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt and believed Giuliani may have been acting on behalf of other clients, Bolton wrote.
Bolton also said that after the president's July phone call with the president of Ukraine, he raised with Attorney General William Barr his concerns about Giuliani, who was pursuing a shadow Ukraine policy encouraged by the president, and told Barr that the president had mentioned him on the call. A spokeswoman for Barr denied that he learned of the call from Bolton; the Justice Department has said he learned about it only in mid-August.
And the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was present for at least one phone call where the president and Giuliani discussed the ambassador, Bolton wrote. Mulvaney has told associates he would always step away when the president spoke with his lawyer to protect their attorney-client privilege.
During a previously reported May 23 meeting where top advisers and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., briefed him about their trip to Kyiv for the inauguration of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump railed about Ukraine trying to damage him and mentioned a conspiracy theory about a hacked Democratic server, according to Bolton.
The White House did not provide responses to questions about Bolton's assertions, and representatives for Johnson, Pompeo and Mulvaney did not respond to emails and calls seeking comment Sunday afternoon.
Bolton's lawyer blamed the White House for the disclosure of the book's contents. "It is clear, regrettably, from the New York Times article published today that the pre-publication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript," the lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, said Sunday night.
He said he provided a copy of the book to the White House on Dec. 30 - 12 days after Trump was impeached - to be reviewed for classified information, though, he said, Bolton believed it contained none.
The submission to the White House may have given Trump's aides and lawyers direct insight into what Bolton would say if he were called to testify at Trump's impeachment trial. It also intensified concerns among some of his advisers that they needed to block Bolton from testifying, according to two people familiar with their concerns.
The White House has ordered Bolton and other key officials with firsthand knowledge of Trump's dealings not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Bolton said in a statement this month that he would testify if subpoenaed.
In recent days, some White House officials have described Bolton as a disgruntled former employee, and have said he took notes that he should have left behind when he departed the administration.
Trump told reporters last week that he did not want Bolton to testify and said that even if he simply spoke out publicly, he could damage national security.
"The problem with John is it's a national security problem," Trump said at a news conference in Davos, Switzerland. "He knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive?"
"It's going to make the job very hard," he added.

Kobe's post-NBA life was just blossoming

Texto completo: Editor's note: This story was written prior to Kobe Bryant's death on Sunday.
COSTA MESA, Calif. – In a previous life, Kobe Bryant mostly just cared about specific hardware.
He had spent 20 years in a Lakers jersey collecting five NBA championship trophies, two Finals MVP honors and one regular season MVP award. When he sat in a room of his production studio recently, though, Bryant turned his head toward something he considered more meaningful. He stared at the Oscar, Sports Emmy and Annie Award that he won for his short film, "Dear Basketball."
"They're at the top for me," Bryant said in a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY Sports. "It's not something that was expected. As a kid, you kind of have the goal of winning championships and all these sorts of things. Being in the industry that I'm in now? It wasn't something that was thought of me winning an Oscar."
What was expected? Consider what Bryant experienced on his NBA farewell tour during his final season with the Lakers in 2015-16. Teammates, team officials and opponents did not just shower Bryant with praise. Some of them also shared their misgivings.
"'I don't know what you want to do when you retire,'" Bryant recited. "'You're going to go through a state of depression. You're going to have an identity crisis.' These are all things that were said to me because people were genuinely concerned."
Nearly four years later, 41-year-old Bryant seems just fine. He founded Granity Studios, a multimedia company that has produced an ESPN+ series that analyzes professional athletes' performances ("Detail") and a No. 1-ranked kids and family podcast that teaches life lessons through melodies and sports ("The Punies"). He partnered with director Glen Keane and Academy Award-winning composer John Williams to produce "Dear Basketball", which was based on a poem he wrote to announce his retirement. Bryant has overseen the publication of three sports fantasy children's books, and a fourth – "The Wizenard Series: Season One" – hits shelves March 31.
The second in the Wizenard Series comes on the heels of his first book, which landed on the The New York Times' bestseller list. His other collaborations include: "The Wizenard Series: Training Camp" (by Wesley King), "Legacy of the Queen" (by Annie Matthew) and "Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof" (by Ivy Claire). Bryant worked with longtime NBA photographer Andy Bernstein on "The Mamba Mentality," a photographic coffee-table book filled with Bryant's insights on his craft.
Instead of displaying NBA-related memorabilia, Bryant's workspace features shelves of his published work, other biographies and fantasy novels. As Claire said, "Sometimes, I forget he's Kobe Bryant. To me, he's just a guy with a bunch of book ideas."
King, who also wrote the new Wizenard book, sees similarities in Bryant's work ethic. "He's approaching this in the same manner with the same passion as he did with basketball," King said. "That's not necessarily the case with a lot of other athletes. Some have put out books but have been more hands off. But he's in the trenches and wants to work on every sentence possible."
Bryant still has informal conversations with Lakers' controlling owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka, LeBron James and young player Kyle Kuzma. He attended two games this season and attracted attention from NBA stars and fans alike. Yet Bryant maintained he has "zero" involvement with his former team and has higher aspirations than chasing nostalgia.
Bryant has overseen his storytelling company that has 12 full-time employees and various contractors. He opened two training facilities dubbed the "Mamba Sports Academy" in Thousand Oaks and Redondo Beach. And he has coached his second-oldest daughter's AAU basketball team, naturally called "The Mambas."
"I had a strong level of belief that Kobe would thrive after his playing days were over," Pelinka wrote in an email to USA TODAY Sports. "It was simple to see this because Kobe is one who truly lives in the moment. He gets zero value from reminiscing on past accomplishments. It's all about making the most of the current day."
Bryant showed signs his post-basketball career would play out this way.
Over two decades ago, Bryant took creative writing classes at Lower Merion High School from Jeanne Mastriano. She considered Bryant a "charismatic storyteller" when the class spoke to preschoolers or wrote short stories. Bryant admittedly winged a story his senior year to a group of kindergartners about how his laundry came to life after ignoring his mom's countless pleas to clean his room. During the writing prompts, Bryant learned how to beat the clock in a different setting.
"I was hoping he would coach. I was hoping I could watch him with the Lakers," Mastriano admitted. "But it makes a lot of sense he would take a bold leap like this. It's not easy, which is going to get him salivating."
When Pelinka worked as Bryant's agent, Bryant said he once told Pelinka he would win an Oscar. Even if Bryant considered the conversation to be a "pie in the sky thing," his prediction was not that outlandish.
Though he did not read much during his childhood, Bryant became an avid fan of "Harry Potter," "Star Wars" and Disney movies. He read biographies to learn what made accomplished people tick. He watched movies to study character development and story arc. While nursing three consecutive season-ending injuries before his final year, Bryant brainstormed project ideas. That led to Bryant overseeing "Muse," a Showtime documentary that detailed his successes and failures during his career.
"You got to do what you love to do," Bryant said. "I love telling stories. I love inspiring kids or providing them with tools that are going to help them."
Bryant rarely watched NBA games after he retired. He only did so if a player asked him to review film. Otherwise, he spent most of his time on his projects or with his family.
That changed last year when his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, wanted to watch NBA League Pass almost every evening. Bryant took her to two Lakers games this season so she could see James and Anthony Davis, Atlanta's Trae Young and Dallas' Luka Doncic.
After predicting he would not have the patience to coach NBA players, Bryant has shown remarkable patience while coaching Gianna's AAU team the past two years.
"Coaching youth sports is so important to take very seriously because you're helping the emotional (development) of young kids," Bryant said. "So it's understanding not to be overcritical and understanding that (there) are going to be mistakes."

But if he made the trek from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Jenkins would bring a bill — for the tens of thousands of dollars he says Trump still owes him.
Of all the troubling accusations that have followed Trump into the White House, there is little talk these days of the trail of unpaid bills he left behind from his days as an Atlantic City casino mogul.
Trump obviously faces far more formidable problems now, including his impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate. So it's highly unlikely that he will mention his unpaid bills from Atlantic City when he takes the stage Tuesday night at the Wildwoods Convention Center.
But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.
"It's terrible," said Jenkins, who runs Triad Building Specialties. "I can't stand Trump. I think he's nothing but a snake oil salesman."
Jenkins was just 19 when Triad Building Specialties, started by his father in the mid-1970s, got the $300,000 contract to provide guardrails, doors, stalls and paper dispensers for the nearly 300 public bathrooms at the Trump Taj Mahal casino overlooking the Atlantic City beachfront. It was April 1990. Trump was viewed across the world as a master businessman. His book "Trump: The Art of the Deal," published three years earlier, was still on the bestseller lists.
In Atlantic City, Trump bragged that the Taj Mahal — which he claimed had a price tag of $1.2 billion — was the "eighth wonder of the world." Not only was it considered the largest casino anywhere, it was adorned with crystal chandeliers from Austria, hand-sewn carpets from Britain, Carrara marble from Italy and 70 onion domes that towered over the Atlantic City boardwalk.
But the Taj, as it came to be called, was built on financial sand. What Trump didn't say was that he financed the Taj with junk bonds. And what he did not tell the scores of contractors who worked on the overly lavish casino was that he could not pay their bills.
Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers. And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm's co-owner.
"If it was just us, you could understand, but this has been a pattern over his entire career," Jenkins said. "He's owned so many failed or fraudulent companies over the years. It's staggering to me."
Trump, who once bragged that he was the "King of Debt," owed $70 million to 253 contractors who worked on the Taj and who, in turn, hired thousands of workers. Some firms sculpted the cement on the Taj's domes and minarets. Others installed the casino's windows and chandeliers. Still others laid the pipes and concrete pavers.
When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren't overcharging. Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.
That kind of strategy in delaying payment on his bills was not new. In "Trump: The Art of the Deal," he wrote: "You have to be very rough and very tough with most contractors or they'll take the shirt right off your back."
In this case, Trump took the shirts off the backs of contractors — and emptied their wallets.
Meanwhile, Trump's own wallet seemed as fat as ever. He has never said his poor business dealings in Atlantic City hurt his personal finances. In fact, he says he continued to make money from his casinos. "Atlantic City fueled a lot of growth for me," Trump told The New York Times in 2016. "The money I took out of there was incredible."
Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. was only a teenager when the news emerged of Trump's failure to pay for the workers at the Taj Mahal. But even today, he said, the subject stirs anger in the city.
"It's still a talking point, anytime his name is brought up," Small said. "It's still a horror story for all of these people. He took advantage of people."
With Trump delaying payments, contractors reached into their pockets to pay their workers and suppliers. In desperation, some contractors eagerly accepted a new offer from Trump: If they would agree to less than they billed, he would pay the lower amounts immediately.
By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed. He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.
And they were the lucky ones.
An Atlantic City firm that supplied paving stones lost $1.2 million. An Ohio company that made the Taj Mahal's onion domes was shortchanged $2 million. A firm that brought in the Carrara marble from Italy went bankrupt.
Steven Perskie, a former Democratic assemblyman and state senator from Margate, had an appallingly close-up view of Trump's battles with contractors. In 1990, then-Gov. James Florio appointed Perskie to run the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
Perskie, who later became a state Superior Court judge, said "a number of local contractors and suppliers" simply gave up and went out of business. And when Trump gave up the last of his Atlantic City casino holdings in 2009, it ended any chance that contractors would get paid. In 2016, when asked by The New York Times in the midst of Trump's presidential campaign for his opinion of the former casino mogul, Perskie thought back to those unpaid contractors and their lingering financial scars.
"When he left Atlantic City, it wasn't, 'Sorry to see you go,' " Perskie said. "It was, 'How fast can you get the hell out of here?' "
Since then, Perskie has refused to discuss Trump. When contacted by NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey about the upcoming rally and the legacy of Trump's unpaid bills in Atlantic City, Perskie declined to comment, citing his concern that he would be targeted for ridicule by Trump supporters.
Others who knew of Trump's financial failings in Atlantic City are not so shy. "You don't want to hear what I think of Donald Trump," said Marty Rosenberg of Egg Harbor.
Rosenberg's firm, Atlantic Plate and Glass, installed most of the glass and mirrors in the Taj Mahal. But when the casino opened, Trump still owed Rosenberg more than $1.5 million.
What Rosenberg, now 76 and retired, quickly noticed was that Trump had no intention of forking over the money. And with Trump saying he would pay only 33 cents on each dollar he owed, Rosenberg organized the unpaid contractors. The group then pressured Trump to pay up. But in the end, most came up short.
Rosenberg had to take out bank loans to pay his bills. He says he also spent hours on the phone begging his suppliers to give him more time.
Eventually, he paid everyone. But he is still bitter about Trump. And while he says he is a political "independent," he nevertheless volunteered to speak in television ads supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Today, Rosenberg says the way Trump handled his business affairs in Atlantic City "is similar to how he handles the United States." And with a touch of sarcasm, Rosenberg added: "If ethics and morality have nothing to do with business, then Donald Trump is a very good businessman."
Today, Rosenberg says he does not like to talk about Trump. Rosenberg is fed up. He follows the impeachment hearings. And he plans to follow the upcoming presidential campaign. Yet he is still angry at how Trump shortchanged him. He is tempted to present Trump with a bill when the president visits Wildwood for a rally among supporters.
But Rosenberg can't be bothered.
"I don't have anything nice to say about him," Rosenberg said. "I try not to mention his name."

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump holds a rally in Wildwood on Jan. 28, he will be surrounded by cellphones, webcams and giant screens.
That wasn't the case the last time a president visited Cape May County.
But then again, it was the 1890s.
Benjamin Harrison was reportedly the most recent presidential visitor in the county that will host Trump next week.
Trump will be the first sitting president in Wildwood — a location chosen because it's in the district of U.S. Rep Jeff Van Drew, who recently switched to the Republican party.
But in the 1800s, neighboring Cape May was a big summertime draw for Harrison and a number of other presidents.
Most of them stayed at Congress Hall, which Harrison made his "summer White House."
"By the middle of the 19th century, Cape May had become a booming holiday destination, rivaling Saratoga and Newport for popularity," the Congress Hall website noted.
While Trump is coming to Cape May County to campaign, previous presidents sought seaside relaxation.
Here's a look at their time at the shore:
Franklin Pierce, 1855 Many find the ocean air restorative, and that was apparently what lured President Franklin Pierce and his wife, Jane.
A July 5, 1855, article in the Pittsfield Sun reported "President Pierce and Mrs. Pierce are on a visit to Cape Island, N.J., for the health of the latter. They arrived there from Washington on Thursday."
Cape Island was renamed Cape May in 1869.
James Buchanan, 1867 Health concerns also brought former President James Buchanan to the shore. "His health, we regret to say, is quite feeble," reported an Aug. 25, 1867, New York Times article.
"He is suffering from extreme debility, the effect of a bilious attack which occurred on his return from Cape May, where he has been passing some weeks," the article added.
His trip apparently ended on a better note, with the article noting "he was decidedly better yesterday."
Buchanan would only live until the following summer but the shore trip apparently brought short-term relief.
Ulysses S. Grant, 1873-75 Grant made four visits to Cape May with his wife, Julia, in the summer of 1873, staying at Congress Hall.
In July 1875, Grant arrived in Cape May about a U.S. revenue cutter along with dignitaries who included a judge, governor and general.
The visit was quite a big deal, reported the New York Times.
"Their arrival was announced by the booming of cannon and demonstrations of enthusiasm. The distinguished visitors will witness the grand regatta, which promises to congregate more people than ever previously assembled on the island."
Chester Arthur, 1883 Forget fighting shore traffic. Arthur traveled to Cape May by presidential yacht, the USS Despatch. "After being ceremoniously escorted along the beach front, now Beach Avenue, the President was welcomed at the Stockton Hotel by the strains of 'Hail to the Chief,' played by Hassler's orchestra and the Weccacoe Band," according to the nearly century-old book "South Jersey: A History 1664-1924."
A local newspaper article added that on July 23, the night of his arrival, Arthur "managed to shake hands with upwards of 2,500 people."
Afterwards, the president met with "a few gentlemen who desired to see him socially."
"He said that he was greatly pleased with Cape May," the New York Times reported.
Benjamin Harrison, 1889-91 Even presidents like having a buddy with a shore house. For Harrison, it was famous Philadelphia retailer and Postmaster General John Wanamaker.
First lady Caroline Harrison and her family were guests at Wanamaker's Cape May cottage in June 1889; the president also paid a visit during that time, according to a 1974 Cape May newspaper article.
The next summer, the Harrisons stayed in a new shore cottage, a $10,000 gift from Wanamaker and William McLean, editor of the Philadelphia Public Ledger (An 1890 New York Times article noted that the president later paid for the home).
In the summer of 1891, Harrison spent all but one week of the summer season at Congress Hall, the "summer White House."
While the president found the shore a conducive environment for work, his wife enjoyed the leisure activities.
Caroline Harrison "was probably the most powerful and biggest booster of Cape May County in history," the 1974 article said.
"Mrs. Harrison was caught up in the social life of the shore and often took carriage rides through the area."
The shore was an escape from the scrutiny the couple faced at the White House, the article noted: "Cape residents did respect the privacy of President and Mrs. Harrison and did fend off the hordes of reporters that swarmed over the area."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats stepped up their calls for the Republican-controlled Senate to subpoena additional witnesses in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial Sunday evening, citing a New York Times report detailing disclosures made by former White House National Security Adviser John Bolton that undercut one of Trump's key lines of defense.
Bolton, in his forthcoming book, claims that Trump tied nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine to his demand that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, according to an unpublished manuscript obtained by the Times. Trump and other White House officials have repeatedly maintained that the investigations were not a condition for the money's release.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Senate Republicans to support Democrats in voting for additional witnesses to testify, tweeting: "John Bolton has the evidence."
"It's up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump's actions testify in the Senate trial," Schumer tweeted, noting the number of Republicans Senate Democrats need to garner the necessary majority to call additional witnesses.
The House impeachment managers prosecuting the case against Trump, said in a statement, "Senators should insist that Mr. Bolton be called as a witness, and provide his notes and other relevant documents."
"The Senate trial must seek the full truth and Mr. Bolton has vital information to provide," wrote the seven House Democrats serving as managers. "There is no defensible reason to wait until his book is published, when the information he has to offer is critical to the most important decision Senators must now make - whether to convict the President of impeachable offenses."
The fight over whether witnesses should be allowed to testify in Trump's impeachment trial also played out earlier in the day on the Sunday political talk show circuit.
As Trump spent Sunday morning firing off tweets denouncing the ongoing trial, the House impeachment managers made their appeal to Senate Republicans.
So far, only three Senate Republicans - Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah - have indicated a willingness to vote for additional White House officials to testify. Bolton has said he is willing to speak if subpoenaed by the Senate.
Asked if Democrats have identified a fourth Republican vote, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, one of seven House impeachment managers, told CNN's State of the Union that she was unsure, but hoped other Republicans would support the call for witnesses.
"I think the country wants a complete picture," Lofgren (D-Calif.) said. "The senators have an opportunity to get it. And I think they would be doing themselves a favor, as well as the country a favor, to get that job done."
Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation," said he would vote against additional witnesses because "House Democrats have had lots of witnesses" over the course of the impeachment proceedings.
"They're not upset that they haven't had witnesses, they're upset that their witnesses haven't said what they want them to say," Cotton said.
Senate Republicans have argued if the House impeachment managers are allowed to call additional witnesses, Trump's defense team should also be allowed to call witnesses including  Hunter Biden who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was in office. Trump has argued his push for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens was over concerns of possible "corruption," but Ukrainian officials have said there have never been any allegations of misconduct by the Bidens. House Democrats have argued that the president was seeking a politically motivated investigation to damage Biden as he runs for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Lead impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" whether Trump should be allowed to call from his witness list as a compromise, said the president's legal team "does not have the right to call irrelevant witnesses, or witnesses who are not fact witnesses."
"Should the trial be used as a vehicle to smear his opponent?" Schiff (D-Calif.) said. "Is that the purpose of a Senate trial? Or is it to get to the truth? Because if it's to get to the truth, Hunter Biden can't tell us anything about the withholding of the military funding."
Trump took direct aim at Schiff in a Sunday tweet, appearing to deliver a warning to the leader of the impeachment proceedings.
"He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!" Trump tweeted.
Asked about the tweet, Schiff told "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd, he believed it was intended to be a threat.
"This is a wrathful and vindictive president; I don't think there's any doubt about it," said Schiff. "And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today, saying that I should 'pay a price.' "
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) criticized House Democrats for not pushing back harder against Trump administration officials who defied subpoenas to testify during the House impeachment proceedings.
Lankford, appearing on ABC's "This Week" said House Democrats, in moving to drafting articles of impeachment last fall, wanted "to move as fast as possible and now they want to slow down the trial as much as possible in the Senate. It's just a very odd political strategy for them more than a fact-finding strategy."
Schumer, speaking to reporters at an unrelated news conference in Manhattan late Sunday morning before the release of the Times report Sunday evening, said it would be an uphill battle to convince four Republicans to vote with Democrats, but said he was "always hopeful."
"There is no good reason why there should not be witnesses and documents and nobody has given one, not the president's lawyers, not Republican senators, not [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell," Schumer  said. "But there is a lot of pressure to speed up the trial, do this, do that, but I am always hopeful. I always believe if you seek the truth, and that is all we are seeking here, that usually right prevails."

U.S. News: Senators Race To Campaign In Trial Break --- Candidates serving as impeachment jurors make mad dashes to Iowa, New Hampshire

Texto completo: Jody Dvorak worried Elizabeth Warren might cancel on her.
After all, the senior senator from Massachusetts is campaigning for president while serving as a juror in President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.
"I wondered and I thought she'd make the best decision on what to do. And I thought if she couldn't come, then that's OK," said Ms. Dvorak, 57 years old, who has been following the trial on television. "If we can't get [Mr. Trump] out of office, the next best thing is for [Ms. Warren] to be here when she can and meet people. And then she can go on to beat him" in the general election, Ms. Dvorak said.
Ms. Warren is one of four senators running for the Democratic presidential nomination even as Mr. Trump's impeachment trial unfolds. A consequence of campaigning while she has a day job: Ms. Warren was forced to cancel a Saturday event in Burlington, Iowa, missing an opportunity to persuade undecided Iowans to back her and energize those who already support her. But the Senate trial adjourned early enough Saturday afternoon for Ms. Warren to fly from the nation's capital to Muscatine for an evening town hall. And she added one unscheduled event to her Saturday plans.
Ms. Warren was joined by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado in making a mad dash back to Iowa and New Hampshire for a weekend blitz of campaigning before the trial resumes Monday. Iowa and New Hampshire are the first two states to vote in the Democratic primary.
The impeachment trial has kept the senators who are 2020 candidates off the campaign trail at a pivotal time: The party's balloting process will kick off in seven days when Iowans begin their caucuses. In their absence, two out-of-work politicians -- former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both leading presidential contenders -- have been campaigning in earnest.
When trial proceedings ended earlier than expected Saturday, Mr. Sanders's team in Iowa scrambled to turn a surrogate event into one that could host the candidate. Mr. Sanders had been forced to cancel a rally earlier in the week when it became clear the trial would keep him in Washington too late.
"I am really delighted to be here tonight. You don't know how delighted I am because last night I didn't know that I would be here," Mr. Sanders told supporters in Ames, Iowa, later Saturday evening.
At a campaign event Sunday in Storm Lake, he said: "The schedule we had planned for Iowa is now in the garbage can, and we had to rewrite it very quickly."
Mr. Bennet, a lower-tier candidate, booked tickets on three separate flights to New Hampshire -- around 2 p.m., 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. -- because he didn't know what time the trial session would end Saturday, according to a senior campaign aide. Thankfully for him, each ticket was refundable. "He was able to take the earliest one up to Manchester after the trial adjourned," the aide said.
Mr. Bennet, who has struggled in polling and fundraising and hasn't qualified for the party's debates since July, pulled back from other states to focus on New Hampshire. He has pledged to host 50 town halls there before the state's Feb. 11 primary.
In Washington last week, Ms. Klobuchar, who is polling in fifth place in Iowa and New Hampshire, packed any window of time during which she wasn't in the trial withsatellite interviews, tele-town halls and editorial boards interviews. On Friday, when the campaign got word the trial proceedings could end early Saturday, Ms. Klobuchar's Iowa team worked to expand her schedule. State Sen. Liz Mathis said she would host an event at her home outside of Cedar Rapids; more than 100 people showed up for the late afternoon gathering.
Voters were mostly understanding that the candidates needed to remain in Washington. "He needs to be there, really he does," said Linda Wright, a 63-year-old librarian from Nevada, Iowa, who was backing Mr. Sanders. Ms. Wright said Mr. Sanders had plenty of people spreading his message in Iowa in his absence, including her.
And despite spending less time in the state, Mr. Sanders has been doing well in the polls here. A New York Times/Siena poll out Saturday had him 7 percentage points over his nearest rival, Mr. Buttigieg. However, other polls show other top-tier candidates leading or a much tighter race among Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren.
All four of the senators, trying to stay front-of-mind with Democratic primary voters while they are away from campaigning, are increasingly taking satellite interviews with cable and network news hosts. Mr. Bennet, who has vowed not to do any fundraising during the Senate trial, is hosting videos with supporters on Facebook Live. Ms. Warren is posting pretaped videos on her social-media profiles.
Mr. Sanders has dispatched some of his top surrogates to campaign while he is in Washington, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an influential congresswoman who drew what the Sanders campaign said was over 800 people for an event in Iowa City on Friday. Mr. Sanders called in on an aide's cellphone that was plugged into the audio system so he could address the crowd.
Ms. Warren has repeatedly said impeachment is "bigger than politics." She and her colleagues have vowed not to ditch the impeachment trial for campaign events, citing a duty to uphold their oath of office. Still, arriving in Iowa after days of sitting silently at her desk on the Senate floor, Ms. Warren gave a hint as to which venue she preferred.
"Good to be in Muscatine," she told reporters. "Good not to be in Washington."

Texto completo: President Trump's defense lawyers said their opening foray this weekend in the impeachment trial was only a "sneak preview" to Monday's main event -- but that was before revelations that Trump told John Bolton he wouldn't lift a hold on military aid to Ukraine until it investigated his political rivals, according to the president's former national security advisor.
That exchange, described in a draft of Bolton's book and first reported by the New York Times, severely undercuts the defense that Trump's counsel sought to showcase this week, and bolsters Democrats' calls for witnesses in the trial. The Times could not immediately independently confirm the account.
"There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the President's defense and therefore must be called as a witness," the House managers responded Sunday night in a statement. "During our impeachment inquiry, the President blocked our request for Mr. Bolton's testimony. Now we see why."

Bolton said he wished to testify as part of the impeachment proceedings against Trump, but the White House -- which has a draft of the book, according to the New York Times -- issued a blanket order blocking officials from providing testimony and documents, broadly citing executive privilege.
A partial roster of Trump's legal team began its defense of the president on Saturday, arguing over two hours that he "did nothing wrong" when he pushed Ukraine to open investigations into the Bidens as he withheld a White House meeting and security assistance.
Trump's team reserved its more incendiary attacks for Monday, when it planned to try to shift scrutiny onto former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter -- in effect giving Trump the public inquest against his potential rival in the 2020 presidential election that he sought from Ukraine.
Kenneth W. Starr, the prosecutor whose investigation led to President Clinton's impeachment, and Alan Dershowitz, the veteran defense attorney, have yet to appear in the Senate chamber as part of Trump's defense team. But they are expected to take the lead for the bulk of the counteroffensive this week, which could last just one day.
Last week, seven House managers argued that Trump abused the power of the presidency and then obstructed Congress to cover it up, filling the 24 hours allowed by Senate rules with three days' worth of PowerPoint presentations, video clips, detailed timelines and impassioned speeches. They called for Republican colleagues to support subpoenas for witnesses and documentation, hoping to get at least four to join them for key votes this week.
Dershowitz said the Democrats were overcompensating for a dearth of evidence with political persuasion.
"Much of what was presented by the Democrats were not impeachable offenses," Dershowitz said Sunday on Fox News. "They were campaign ads."
Trump's counsel made clear they wouldn't use their full 24 hours to make the case that Trump should be acquitted, an almost certain outcome in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Trump, the most important audience for the Republican Party, as well as his lawyers, trumpeted his approval on Sunday for the abrupt, aggressive defense strategy.
"The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before," Trump said in one of a number of tweets Sunday morning about the trial. "In just two hours the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have seen their phony case absolutely shredded."
With Trump complaining that the Saturday session was "Death Valley in T.V.," Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) predicted his team would go big on Monday. "They might have some sense that they need a little prime time themselves," Blunt said.
As the chances of Republican support for witnesses appeared to dim, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was strongly considering moving quickly to an acquittal vote, potentially as soon as Friday. Per the trial's rules, if efforts to subpoena additional witnesses or evidence fail this week, Republicans could essentially shut down debate and quickly call for the up-or-down vote to determine whether Trump will remain in office.
But those preliminary plans may have been scrambled by the Bolton news.
Trump continued his lawyers' line of argument on Sunday that the impeachment was merely a political vendetta, singling out Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), the lead House manager and Intelligence Committee chairman, in a thinly veiled threat.
"He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!" Trump tweeted.
Schiff not only spoke far more than the other managers over their three days of trial arguments on the floor last week -- but he also spoke more than did 77 senators in all of 2019, according to data from C-SPAN, underscoring how little debate there was in the Senate.
The California congressman pointed to the president's remarks on Sunday as further evidence of the difficulty for Republican senators of standing up to the president.
"This is a wrathful and vindictive president; I don't think there's any doubt about it," Schiff said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "If we can't even get the senators to agree to call witnesses in a trial, it shows you just how difficult that moral courage is."
Trump's defense counsel and some Republican allies in the Senate have spent days priming the president and the public for the trial to enter a more provocative stage, seeking to keep the Bidens front and center.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) repeatedly alleged that "no one" had looked into the Bidens' activities in Ukraine. But he also said he'd vote against witnesses, whether the Bidens or Bolton.
"If we begin to open this up, the court of impeachment, to the Hunter Biden, Joe Biden thing, where does that take us?" Graham asked. "How long does that take? What acrimony does that create for the country?"
"You're asking me to violate executive privilege with John Bolton -- I'm not going to do it," he continued. "But I'm also not going to use the 53 votes we have to selectively call one set of witnesses. I think the best thing for the Senate is to judge the case that has been made."
Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, in April 2014. At that time, Ukraine and its fight against corruption was in his father's vice presidential portfolio.
In the nearly six years since -- roughly half of which Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress -- no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the Bidens has emerged.
"Donald Trump is so terrified of facing Joe Biden that he became the only president in American history to attempt to coerce a foreign nation into lying about a political rival," Andrew Bates, the rapid response director for Joe Biden's 2020 campaign, told The Times in a statement Sunday.
Jay Sekulow, Trump's private counsel, said Saturday in the Senate that Trump was right not to "blindly" follow the U.S. intelligence community's assessments that it was Russia, not Ukraine, that meddled in 2016 on his behalf.
"They kept telling you it was Russia alone that interfered in the 2016 election," Sekulow said, "but there is evidence that Ukraine also interfered."
In November, U.S. intelligence officials told senators and their aides that this debunked theory had been pushed by Russia for years as part of a long-running effort to frame Ukraine for Russia's own interference. The officials warned that Moscow was intensifying its misinformation campaign as the 2020 election approached.
Schiff argued Sunday that the attempt by Trump's counsel to justify his distrust of the U.S. intelligence community only underscored the continued danger if he remained in office.
"He continues to believe Russian propaganda over his own intelligence agencies, over his own FBI director," Schiff said on "Meet the Press." "And that makes him dangerous to our country."
The Bidens, Schiff said, are being used as a political boogeyman to distract from the facts of the case against the president.
"Hunter Biden," he said, "can't tell us anything."
But Schiff has invited his own distractions. As he closed the prosecutors' case for Trump's impeachment Friday, he cited a news story with an anonymous quote that the president had threatened Republican senators who might defy him, prompting outcry in the chamber, including from several who'd expressed support for calling witnesses.
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) dismissed the president's attacks on Schiff on Sunday. "I just don't think it's a death threat," Lankford said of Trump's tweet on CNN's "State of the Union." "It's political."
Even if Trump is acquitted, Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) expressed hope that he would learn from his impeachment. "He was taken to the carpet," Braun said on "Meet the Press." "Hopefully, it'll be instructive."
Schiff argued that the damage would be far more lasting. "If they're successful in depriving the country of a fair trial," Schiff said, "there is no exoneration."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A draft of a forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton alleges that President Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The development threatened to throw into turmoil the careful choreography of the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bolton's claim, which was reported by the New York Times and confirmed by a lawyer for Mr. Bolton, goes to the heart of Democrats' impeachment inquiry and contradicts the White House's argument that the decision to hold up nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine wasn't related to the president's push for investigations there. Democrats have said the president abused his power by leveraging aid approved by Congress in order to get a foreign leader to undertake actions that would benefit him politically.
Mr. Trump late Sunday evening denied Mr. Bolton's allegations. "I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," the president tweeted. "In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, said he sent a copy of his manuscript to the National Security Council in December so it could be reviewed for classified information, adding that he did so on the assurance that the contents of the book wouldn't be disclosed to anyone not involved in that process.
"It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript," Mr. Cooper said.
News of the manuscript's claims comes on the eve of the defense team's second session on the Senate floor, in which it was expected to present the bulk of its argument. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment on Mr. Bolton's description of his conversation with the president.
Democrats immediately intensified their calls for the Senate to vote in favor of calling more witnesses later this week, chief among them Mr. Bolton, who has said he would testify if he were subpoenaed by the Senate. Details of what Mr. Bolton might say could sway the four Republican senators who have said they are on the fence about the vote in favor of more testimony. If all Democrats vote in favor, they would need four Republicans to join them for the vote to pass.
"It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton...as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Democrats have also wanted to bring in acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two other witnesses.
The White House has sought to block testimony by Mr. Bolton and the other witnesses.
Mr. Trump said in a news conference last week that testimony by Mr. Bolton would be a "national security problem."
Mr. Bolton's book includes details of cabinet officials' discussions about Ukraine and about Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney who led the campaign for probes in Ukraine, according to the New York Times. Mr. Bolton wrote that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said privately that Mr. Giuliani's claims that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt weren't true, and that he shared his concerns about Mr. Giuliani with Attorney General William Barr after the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to work with both Messrs. Giuliani and Barr on investigations, the Times said. Mr. Bolton wrote that he told the attorney general Mr. Trump had invoked him on the call.
A Justice Department official familiar with the matter said Mr. Bolton did call Mr. Barr to express concerns about Mr. Giuliani and his shadow foreign policy in Ukraine. It wasn't clear what the attorney general did with that information.
Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec denied that Mr. Barr learned of the Ukraine call from Mr. Bolton. The department has repeatedly said he learned about it in mid-August.
The alleged conversation between the president and Mr. Bolton sheds more light on an exchange that took place later in August between Mr. Bolton and Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.). According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bolton urged him to call Mr. Trump directly about the Ukraine aid matter. Mr. Johnson spoke to Mr. Trump on Aug. 31 and asked the president if the aid to Ukraine was contingent on new investigations by Ukraine. Mr. Trump responded by vehemently denying that that was the case, Mr. Johnson said.
In their first day of arguments on Saturday, the president's lawyers argued for two hours that Democrats had failed to make a compelling case and were relying on circumstantial evidence to conclude that the Republican president had conditioned aid to Ukraine on investigations that could benefit him politically. Mr. Bolton's manuscript would provide a first-person account of the president doing precisely that.
Among other matters, the president's team was expected to argue on Monday that Mr. Trump was right to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a candidate for president, and his son, Hunter, the person familiar with the discussions said.
The president's team plans to present arguments Monday beginning at 1 p.m. EST and likely wrapping up by about 8 p.m., according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr will likely speak Monday, the person said. Depending on how the session goes, the team may not use its session on Tuesday.
The president told aides he was pleased with his team's presentation Saturday, but over the weekend he lobbed insulting nicknames at top Democrats. He said of Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager, "he has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country."
Mr. Schiff on NBC called the president "wrathful and vindictive."
---
Monday's Agenda
-- At 1 p.m. ET, the trial resumes with President Trump's defense team set to hold its second day of arguments.
-- The defense team is expected to go for several hours but will likely wrap up by around 8 p.m.
-- Among those likely arguing on the president's behalf are constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr.

Pianist Gabriela Montero applies muscle, emotion to Russian composers' works

Texto completo: It is only natural that musicians use their own experience as a template for broader commentary on social issues and the world around them - assuming, of course, that they are willing to air their views publicly. Gabriela Montero, an expatriate Venezuelan pianist, has long been outspoken, in interviews and on Twitter, about human rights abuses in her homeland, which she has described as a narco-kleptocracy and a failed state.
Though early-20th-century Russian composers fleeing the tyranny of the Soviet state were the main focus of "Westward" - the program Montero played at Hannaford Hall in a Portland Ovations concert on Saturday afternoon - her own sense of displacement from Venezuela was not far beneath the surface.
Nor was immigration, her subtopic. The Russian composers she played, Prokofiev, Stravinsky and Rachmaninov, all left the Soviet Union for the West (although Prokofiev returned, and lived to regret it). But Montero noted, in comments from the stage, that she is an immigrant, too, a point she stressed by closing her concert with a showing of Charlie Chaplin's 1917 silent film "The Immigrant," for which she improvised a score.
Montero is a powerful player, and the Russian works she offered - Prokofiev's "Sarcasms" (Op. 17) and Sonata No. 2 (Op. 14), Stravinsky's Sonata (1924) and Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2 (Op. 36) - drew on her ability to put speed and volume at the service of thorny and sometimes dense music. All four works were given muscular, emotionally forceful readings, and where there was anger in the music - or even where anger could merely be deduced - Montero brought it forth, sharpening edges rather than trying to prettify them.
Though those qualities linked her performances of all these works, it was not as if she forced these three very different composers into a uniform style. In Prokofiev's "Sarcasms," the composer's trademark angularity and steeliness prevailed much of the time, yet there were moments when Montero brought a necessary measure of fluidity to her tempos and dynamics, tempering the music's brashness in more lyrical passages, but never pushing its internal tensions out of view.
Prokofiev's Sonata No. 2 had a similarly flexible reading, with the appealing texturing she brought to the Andante third movement seeming a necessary (if brief) respite after the weight, incisiveness and constantly morphing detail of the first two movements, and before the pointed drama of the finale.
Montero's account of the Stravinsky Sonata, which she played between the Prokofiev works, was in some ways a palette cleanser. Though Montero played its opening with the same weightiness she brought to the Prokofiev, she soon pulled back enough to let the provocative qualities of Stravinsky's neo-Classical style - his toying with Baroque and Classical contours and techniques (trills, counterpoint, danceable figures) and his hopscotching between consonance and dissonance - shine through.
If there was one interpretation that raised an eyebrow, it was Montero's account of the Rachmaninov, which had a measure of weightiness and drama well beyond what many pianists bring to it - at least, those who regard Rachmaninov, not quite fairly, as Chopin filtered through an early-20th-century lens. Apart from a huge sonority, which Rachmaninov's music invites, what she brought to the work was a level of intensity that seemed as much as the score could bear: In the final pages, especially, it seemed that the music could not possibly be pushed harder, or farther.
Ending the concert with the Chaplin film was an inspired touch. As a comedy, it lightened the mood, although its glancing portrayal of some of the problems immigrants face (vulnerability, for one) maintained the program's patina of social comment. Montero's improvisational skills have been justly celebrated, and here she drew on everything from ragtime to familiar themes ("The Star Spangled Banner," in several variations, as the immigrants' ship sailed past the Statue of Liberty, for one), and mirrored the action nicely.
As an encore, Montero asked the audience to provide a theme - it turned out to be John Williams' "Star Wars" title music - around which she wove an improvisation that moved through several styles. In a way, the improvisation mirrored Stravinsky's Sonata, couching the "Star Wars" theme in Bachian counterpoint, early on, and then moving through more acerbic contemporary styles.

Texto completo: Weeks of protests against a new citizenship law in India spread to Atlanta on Sunday as more than 1,000 people marched from CNN to the National Center for Civil and Human Rights.
Protesters also planned to gather outside the Consulate General of India's office in Sandy Springs. The groups sought to draw attention to a law approved by the Indian parliament last month that critics say is the latest in a series of actions against Muslims.
The peaceful march fell on the 70th anniversary of the Indian constitution. The demonstration follows widespread protests in India. About 30 people there have died.
"Today is Constitution Day, and the government is violating the constitution," Abdul Ismiel of Atlanta said outside CNN Center.
Last month, India's parliament approved the Citizenship Amendment Act, which expedited citizenship for migrants from several neighboring countries if they are Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsee or Jain. Muslims were not included.
Representatives of the Consulate General of India's office could not be reached for comment Sunday. Indian officials have said the law is a humanitarian effort to help persecuted religious minorities.
Human rights advocates in the United States and elsewhere have said the law is blatantly discriminatory. Some have called for President Donald Trump to impose sanctions.
Critics have challenged the law in court. But that could take months, and last week India's Supreme Court declined to put the law on hold.
A handful of counterprotesters who gathered near CNN said the law has been misconstrued. They said the law is not anti-Muslim. Instead, they say it's an effort to aid minorities who have fled neighboring countries dominated by Muslims.
"I'm baffled," Vivek Sharma of South Carolina said as he watched the larger protest from across the street. "The minorities in these countries have been persecuted a long time."
"What we're saying (with this law) is, you have a home," Sharma said.
The citizenship law isn't the only government act that has drawn criticism. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India also has stripped its only
Muslim-majority state of its autonomy.
In another state, the government also has unveiled a new citizen registry that many fear will be used to discriminate against Muslims. India is building detention camps to hold those who cannot verify their citizenship.
Muslims account for about 200 million of India's 1.3 billion people. An organizer of Sunday's protest, who asked to remain anonymous because he fears retribution from India's government, said the country is abandoning its secular history in favor of a system that favors the Hindu majority.
"Muslims have completely lost trust in this government," the organizer said. "They don't believe a single word they say."
On Sunday the protesters chanted and listened to speakers outside CNN before marching around Centennial Olympic Park to the civil rights museum and back. They waved signs with slogans like "stop genocide in India" and "defend Indian secular constitution."
"They are coming for one community," the organizer said. "But they will come for the others also."

Texto completo: At home in high society and gossip columns, she also worked regularly as a TV host, designer, writer and home décor entrepreneur.
Nina Griscom, a model, television host, fashion plate, columnist and entrepreneur who came to be known as an "It" girl in the high society whirl of 1980s New York, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.
The cause was complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which was diagnosed in late 2017, said Kelly Breheny, her personal assistant.
Ms. Griscom grew up among the rich and the influential, the daughter of Elizabeth Fly Vagliano, a major benefactor of cultural and educational institutions and later the wife of Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker who helped rescue New York City from fiscal insolvency in the 1970s.
Ms. Griscom, who would all but retire the title of best dressed at charity events, began modeling by posing for the fashion industry grande dame Eileen Ford while still in college.
"I wasn't discovered at all," Ms. Griscom told The New York Times in 2015. "I marched right into there myself."
She went on to model for magazines, appearing on the cover of Elle France, and in one instance famously draped only in a towel for a Gillette Bare Elegance body shampoo advertisement.
From 1990 to 1993, Ms. Griscom was a co-host of "Entertainment News" segments on HBO with Matt Lauer. She was hired, she said, because she could memorize scripts quickly when the cable network was "too cheap for a teleprompter."
Ms. Griscom and Alan Richman, the food writer, were hosts of "Dining Around," a series of restaurant reviews that ran on the Food Network from 1993 to 1998; they later opened home-decorating stores in Southampton, N.Y. (sharing space there with Antony Todd, the Manhattan event and floral designer) and on Lexington Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side, selling such items as scented candles suggestively named "Flirt," "Revenge," and "Sultry." The Southampton store closed in 2005; the Manhattan store in 2009.
Ms. Griscom was a rebel from birth. She started smoking before she was a teenager ("I picked up the habit when I was shipped off to school in Switzerland at age 12," she wrote in her Town & Country magazine column in 2012) and had worked her way up to a pack of Marlboros a day, but stopped years ago.
Besides opening the decorating stores, Ms. Griscom styled handbags for the GiGi New York Collection, even though she acknowledged, "I am the first to say that I have zero formal training in design."
She festooned her Park Avenue apartment with old master drawings as well as African and Oceanic artifacts. ("An African fetish in the shape of a phallus, I admit, is not for everyone," she told Architectural Digest in 2017.)
Even past the point at which most of her contemporaries had matured, Ms. Griscom, in a gesture of support for an ailing friend, paid $ 150, plus tip, to get a two-inch porcupine tattooed on her right inner forearm.
"Traditional decorum suggests that getting your first tattoo after the age of 50 is like sporting a miniskirt in your 70s -- a tad age inappropriate," Ms. Griscom conceded. Her mother agreed.
"'It's neither savory, nor sound' was the reaction of my famously elegant mother, Elizabeth Rohatyn," Ms. Griscom recalled, "who, it should be noted, regularly applied that phrase to many of my well-chronicled life choices."
Nina Louise Renshaw was born in Manhattan on May 8, 1954. Her father was Charles C. Renshaw Jr., an editor and publishing executive.
Nina graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and attended Barnard College in Manhattan, where she majored in psychology.
Among her other jobs, she was a consultant to Revlon, the cosmetics company.
She is survived by her husband, Leonel Alfredo Piraino, a real estate investor and broker whom she married in 2007; a daughter, Lily Elizabeth Baker, from her marriage to Dr. Daniel C. Baker, which ended in divorce; and her stepbrothers, Pierre, Nicolas and Michael Rohatyn. An earlier marriage, to Lloyd P. Griscom Jr., a businessman whose family had been among the first investors in IBM, also ended in divorce.
Friends described Bill Blass as a father figure to Ms. Griscom, who could turn heads at society balls billboarding the latest claret-colored fashion by Blass, embroidered gold by Vera Wang or silver-and-black by Arnold Scaasi.
"You know who's so good at that throwaway thing is Nina Griscom," Craig Natiello, a designer for Halston, said in 2000, adding, "She always looks like she just came out of the pool, put on that great dress and looks fantastic."
Ms. Griscom venerated the Roaring Twenties and lamented the loss since then of manners and elegance. "I don't see anybody entertaining nicely at home," she said in an interview for the GiGi line of handbags. "I haven't seen a thank-you-note in a long time. It's very serious and ponderous and vulgar."
She also bemoaned the fettle of her daughter's generation. "I don't think they have as much fun or are as adventuresome as we were," she said.
Her glamorous adventures, romantic and otherwise, were fodder for gossip columnists, but rarely surprised her friends.
"Nina was madcap, crazy, gay in the old-fashioned sense of the word," said Louise Grunwald, for decades among the city's most influential hostesses. "She was unique in the social history of that period of New York in that she was outrageous and fun but highly intelligent. No matter how outrageous she was, no matter how much she'd had to drink, she could always get away with it."
In the fall, Guy Trebay, a fashion reporter for The Times who knew of her illness, contacted Ms. Griscom asking if she might agree to an interview -- what might be her final interview -- for a profile of her that he was writing. (The article, titled "The Party Girl, Till the End," appeared in November.) Ms. Griscom replied on Instagram with characteristic audacity.
"Is this," she asked, "for my obit?"

Texto completo: The other two cases were in Washington State and Chicago.
The United States has confirmed a third case of the novel coronavirus, after a traveler from China tested positive for the disease in Orange County, Calif.
The Orange County Health Care Agency, which received confirmation of the case in California from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement on Saturday that the person had been sent to the hospital and was in "good condition."
The patient is a traveler from Wuhan, China, and "there is no evidence that person-to-person transmission has occurred in Orange County," according to the agency. "The current risk of local transmission remains low," the statement said.
As China struggles to contain the outbreak of the deadly pneumonialike virus, global authorities are grappling with a rising number of cases at their borders. Canada and Portugal both announced suspected cases this weekend.
In China, 1,975 people have been infected with the coronavirus since the outbreak began last year in Wuhan. The death toll in China has risen to 56.
World authorities are taking their own precautions to keep the virus from spreading. Taiwan said on Sunday that it would bar all visitors from China's Hubei Province to the self-governing island, where a few cases have been confirmed.
The United States has limited passengers who have recently visited Wuhan to a handful of airports that have special screening processes in place. A number of people around the United States are being monitored for potential cases of the respiratory illness.
The person in California brings to three the number of confirmed case in the United States. The others are a woman in her 60s in Chicago and a man in his 30s in Washington State.

Texto completo: The Booker Prize winner is teaming up with his editor, Jake Morrissey, on "Marlon and Jake Read Dead People."
In his novels "A Brief History of Seven Killings" and "Black Leopard, Red Wolf," Marlon James frequently conjures lost and forgotten voices. As one of the hosts of "Marlon and Jake Read Dead People," a new podcast whose first two episodes will be available Monday, he does something similar with the spoken word. In the audio series from Riverhead Books, James and Jake Morrissey, his editor, strive to breathe life into the literature of the past.
The podcast is an outgrowth, both hosts said, of discussions that they've been having for years. "People kept walking in on me and Jake having arguments about books," James said in an interview. "The thing they noticed was that we were always arguing about no-longer-living authors as if they just wrote a book last week."
"Marlon and Jake Read Dead People" has retained this spirit. Despite its focus on the work of dead authors, it's a far cry from stodgy academic discourse. Morrissey likened its tone to two friends "sitting at a bar talking about their favorite football teams over beers."
For James, this irreverent approach avoids the pitfalls associated with both sides of the ever-churning debate about the status of the literary canon. "Too often the canon means 'these books are untouchable and let's talk about them in that way,"' he said. "People fought about 'Moby-Dick' in the 1800s. Why can't we fight about it now?"
The podcast's topics, too, reflect the hosts' wide-ranging tastes. While they do spar over the relative merits of English department favorites like Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope, they also discuss the work of the romance novelist Jackie Collins (a favorite of James's) and "Nothing Lasts Forever," the 1979 novel by Roderick Thorp on which the film "Die Hard" is based.
James, a professor at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minn., won the Booker Prize in 2015 for "A Brief History of Seven Killings," and was a National Book Awards finalist last year for his fantasy novel "Black Leopard, Red Wolf." That he would gravitate toward podcasting is no surprise to those familiar with his books. In "Black Leopard," he worked hard to retain the oral and aural dimensions of the western and central African epic traditions that inspired the project. "I write to be read aloud," he said.
On top of encouraging readers to expand their literary horizons, James has found there are other benefits to talking about authors from the past. "I'm not denying there is some fun in talking trash about dead people," he said. "They can't attack me on Twitter."
After the first two episodes of "Marlon and Jake Read Dead People" drop, the subsequent six installments will be released each Monday on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher and Spotify.

Texto completo: Kobe Bryant, who made the leap directly from high school to a glittering 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers that established him as one of basketball's all-time greats, was among nine people killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday north of Los Angeles. Bryant was 41.
The crash also killed Gianna Bryant, 13, the second oldest of Kobe Bryant's four daughters with his wife, Vanessa. They were traveling from the family's base in Orange County, Calif., to Thousand Oaks, 30 miles northwest of Los Angeles. A budding star herself, Gianna was scheduled to play an afternoon game with her travel team, coached by her father, at Kobe Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy.
News of Bryant's death predictably rocked the N.B.A., which is filled with players who grew up watching Bryant as he won five championships with the Lakers and scored 81 points in a single game. Fueled by a seemingly endless reservoir of self-confidence, Bryant was an mammoth figure almost from the moment he arrived, at age 17, as the 13th overall pick in the 1996 N.B.A. draft.
The son of the former N.B.A. player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, Kobe Bryant was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets on behalf of the Lakers and did not try -- at all -- to hide his ambition to surpass the accomplishments of the legendary Michael Jordan. Charlotte had agreed going into the draft to trade Bryant's rights to Los Angeles in exchange for the veteran center Vlade Divac.
Over the next 20 seasons, Bryant earned 18 All-Star selections, a regular-season Most Valuable Player Award in 2008 and two N.B.A. finals M.V.P. awards to go with his five championship rings. Amid all of that, a sexual assault allegation against him in 2003 would change how many people saw Bryant, though he remained hugely popular among N.B.A. fans and especially Angelenos, for whom he increasingly became synonymous with the Lakers -- the only team, despite a trade demand in 2007, that Bryant ever played for.
The trade that made Bryant a Laker was engineered by the team's general manager at the time, Jerry West, who was instantly smitten by Bryant's fearlessness and prodigious talent. A standout at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pa., outside Philadelphia, Bryant had auditioned for the Lakers in a predraft workout featuring a series of one-on-one drills against the former Lakers defensive ace Michael Cooper, then a 40-year-old assistant coach.
Only a few high schoolers had gone straight to the N.B.A. at that point -- and Bryant would be the first guard to do so. But West left the workout early, declaring that he had seen enough. "He's better than anybody on our team right now," West famously told fellow Lakers staffers of Bryant's performance.
As West envisioned, Bryant indeed helped restore the Lakers to glory -- albeit with no shortage of turmoil along the way. He did so first alongside the Hall of Fame center Shaquille O'Neal for three consecutive drama-filled N.B.A. championships in the 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons, then as the team's unquestioned fulcrum for two more titles in 2008-09 and 2009-10. With a drive to rival Jordan's and an ability to tune out critics who at times assailed his ball dominance and shot selection, Bryant was the central and enduring figure in one of the most gripping soap operas in modern professional team sports.
By the time he walked away from the N.B.A. in April 2016, after an unforgettable 60-point farewell game against the Utah Jazz, Bryant had built an unmatched legacy that persuaded the Lakers to retire both jersey numbers he wore over two 10-season stretches: No. 8 and No. 24. In perhaps the ultimate Bryant flourish, that 60-point game on the final day of the 2015-16 regular season -- in which he hoisted 50 shots -- upstaged the defending champion Golden State Warriors, who had defeated the Memphis Grizzlies on the same night to secure the best single-season record in league history, 73-9.
Bryant is widely expected to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in late August, the first time he is eligible. He led the league in scoring twice and finished his career with 33,643 points in the regular season, which put him at No. 3 among N.B.A.'s scoring leaders, behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387) and Karl Malone (36,928) until the Lakers' LeBron James passed Bryant on Saturday night in Philadelphia.
Bryant tweeted his congratulations to James on Saturday night, some 15 hours before the crash, writing: "Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother."
As Bryant began his climb up the scoring charts, O'Neal nicknamed the brash teenager "Showboat," but the term was not meant to flatter. Veterans on that Lakers team tried in vain to keep Bryant's rookie ambitions modest -- with O'Neal particularly determined to make it clear that he was the team's true alpha.
But Bryant could not be harnessed. After some notable playoff failures, Bryant broke through as a champion in his fourth season, forming a devastating partnership with O'Neal under the coaching tutelage of Phil Jackson.
"Kobe didn't care about night life or anything else," Del Harris, who coached Bryant for his first two N.B.A. seasons and the start of his third, told The New York Times in December 2017. "He only had one interest. His only focus was to be the best that he could be. And in his mind that meant challenging Michael Jordan."
"People can argue," Harris continued, "how close he actually came, but there's no question that he fulfilled pretty much all of his dreams."
Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006 to register the second-highest scoring output in league history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. But Bryant's reputation was more complicated than all his accolades would suggest.
He was charged with felony sexual assault in 2003 stemming from an incident at a Colorado hotel in which Bryant was accused of raping a 19-year-old woman who worked at the property as a front-desk clerk. Prosecutors eventually dropped the case when the woman told them she was unwilling to testify. Bryant later issued an apology, saying he understood that the woman, unlike himself, did not view their encounter as consensual. A lawsuit the woman brought against Bryant was later settled out of court.
In the closing stages of Bryant's career, well beyond the days of "Showboat," Bryant began giving himself nicknames, such as "Black Mamba" and, later, "Vino." The frequent helicopter rides he took to games at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles -- to avoid traffic and maximize time at home -- only added to his mystique.
In addition to making his name as one of the sport's most relentless competitors, Bryant was known for a special ability to play through injuries.
The one that managed to stop him was a torn left Achilles' tendon late in the 2012-13 season. Of course, stubborn as he was, Bryant did not want to accept the on-court diagnosis he received from Gary Vitti, the longtime Lakers athletic trainer.
"I told him it's ruptured and he's done," Vitti told The Times in December 2017. "He said, 'Can't you just tape it up?"'
Given the intense focus that governed Bryant's playing career, many league observers questioned how he would cope outside the game, without an outlet for his uber-competitiveness. But Bryant was flourishing in retirement, entering the world of storytelling and winning an Academy Award by transforming a poem to announce his retirement into an animated short film ("Dear Basketball") that he wrote and narrated.
He had also been drawn back to the N.B.A. by his daughter Gianna's love for it. On Dec. 29, Bryant sat with her courtside at Staples Center to watch the Lakers play the Dallas Mavericks and take pictures afterward with Luka Doncic, the Mavericks' young Slovenian star.
"My friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone," Magic Johnson, the Hall of Fame Lakers guard and Bryant's boyhood hero, wrote on Twitter. "It's hard to accept."

Texto completo: As hedge funds take a greater role in newspaper chains, journalists at the Chicago Tribune and elsewhere are sending out an S.O.S.
On a cold Chicago morning last month, Gary Marx, a veteran investigative reporter, took his dog for a walk and then strolled over to the affluent Lincoln Park neighborhood. After being buzzed into the courtyard of a large house, he hand-delivered a letter urging the intended recipient to buy -- or at least invest in -- Mr. Marx's journalistic home of more than three decades, The Chicago Tribune.
"It's one thing to put your name on a museum," Mr. Marx said, summarizing the contents of the letter in an interview, "but this is to save an institution that really safeguards this city."
Along with a Tribune colleague, the investigative reporter David Jackson, Mr. Marx undertook his unorthodox campaign after it was disclosed in November that Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund, had acquired a large stake in Tribune Publishing, the parent company of Chicago's biggest daily.
Journalists are wary of Alden because of its cut-to-the-bone management strategy. In 2018, a group of writers and editors at the Alden-owned Denver Post published a special package devoted to attacking the company, which had enacted deep staff cuts at the paper. The lead article blasted Alden executives as "vulture capitalists."
In addition to sending letters to wealthy Chicagoans, Mr. Marx and Mr. Jackson have written to Alden's president, Heath Freeman, asking him for a meeting. They have received no response. Mr. Freeman and MediaNews Group, the Alden subsidiary that runs its newspaper operation, did not reply to requests for comment for this article.
The two reporters have also made an appeal to Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire medical industry entrepreneur who bought The Los Angeles Times and other California papers from Tribune Publishing in 2018 for $ 500 million after prolonged tensions between The Times's editorial staff and Tribune executives.
Dr. Soon-Shiong, a Tribune Publishing stakeholder since 2016, has held on to 25 percent of the company. Mr. Marx and Mr. Jackson asked that he keep his interest in Tribune Publishing or sell it to civic-minded investors, rather than allowing it to end up with Alden.
"Your role as the news company's savior could only add to your reputation and opportunities," they wrote.
Their attempts to woo new investors are unusual in an industry that has traditionally tried to keep business and journalism separate.
"It was not that long ago that it would have been unusual to publicly campaign for a change of ownership," Ann Marie Lipinski, a former Chicago Tribune editor in chief and the curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, said in an interview. "What you're seeing in Chicago is a very different approach: journalists dissatisfied with leaving business decisions to the business side, trying to have significant impact on the future of their companies."
Mr. Marx, who was once expelled from Cuba because of his reporting, and Mr. Jackson, who won a Pulitzer Prize during a one-year stint at The Washington Post for his articles on victims of police shootings, have relied on habits honed in the newsroom as they make the rounds.
Before ending a conversation with a possible benefactor, for instance, they ask that person whom they should contact next. They also published an opinion article in The New York Times calling attention to what they see as the threat to journalism posed by Alden.
After having bought up roughly 32 percent of Tribune Publishing in recent years, Alden is the company's largest shareholder. It can buy more Tribune Publishing stock as soon as July. This month, the company asked journalists at newspapers across the country to volunteer for buyouts.
It is certainly not news that the newspaper business is in trouble. Its onetime profit center, print advertising, has declined sharply as readers increasingly prefer to get the news on screens.
The finance industry, looking at newspapers as distressed assets with hidden value, has swooped in, scooping up struggling publications, cutting their staffs and wringing them for profits.
Last year, the parent company of the nation's largest newspaper publisher, GateHouse Media, bought the second largest chain, Gannett, in a merger valued at $ 1.2 billion. That deal was also driven by the banking industry. The new company, named Gannett, is controlled by a private equity firm, Fortress Investment Group, which itself is owned by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The merger also received nearly $ 2 billion in financing from another private equity firm, Apollo Global Management.
On the day the deal went through, the company's leader, Michael E. Reed, spoke of "inefficiencies" at the new Gannett and described the NewsGuild, the union that represents journalists at many of its papers, as "a big problem."
Like Mr. Marx and Mr. Jackson in Chicago, journalists in other cities have made moves to protect their jobs -- by working to form unions, seeking out new ownership or generally raising a ruckus.
Journalists at The Baltimore Sun, a Tribune Publishing newspaper, have sought buyers among local entrepreneurs and foundations, said Scott Dance, a weather and environment reporter and unit chair of the union there. The prospects include the Abell Foundation -- endowed by the namesake family that owned The Sun until its 1986 sale to Times Mirror, a newspaper company that merged with Tribune Publishing's predecessor in 2000.
In Oakland last month, journalists at the Alden-owned Bay Area News Group, a ring of daily and community papers that has lost nearly 100 jobs since 2016, leafleted a Christmas tree lighting, warning about "Alden Global Capital and the Destruction of Local News."
"They clearly do not value the newspaper mission," said George Kelly, a Bay Area News Group reporter. "We've been asking for Alden to invest or get out."
Late last year, journalists at The Miami Herald and its Spanish-language sibling publication, El Nuevo Herald, won union recognition days after their owner, the publicly owned newspaper chain McClatchy, revealed that it might not be able to make an upcoming minimum payment to the company pension plan. A McClatchy spokeswoman declined to comment.
A union push followed extensive layoffs two years ago at The Los Angeles Times, job cuts that were presided over by Michael W. Ferro Jr., who was the chairman of Tribune Publishing (then known as Tronc). After he installed an editor and publisher who feuded with the staff, newsroom employees formed the paper's first union since its founding in 1881. A few months later, Dr. Soon-Shiong took The Times off Tribune Publishing's hands, to the newsroom's relief.
"The Los Angeles Times campaign started because we had all this changing management and questions about ownership," said Jon Schleuss, a former editor there who is the new president of NewsGuild, the union that represents journalists at many newspapers (including The New York Times).
"Without forming the union," he added, "we would never have gotten the new owner."
In 2018, Tribune Publishing cut the newsroom staff of The Daily News in New York in half. The layoffs at the formerly brawny tabloid, which once had the highest circulation of any daily newspaper in the country, came a year after Tribune Publishing bought it.
The reign of Mr. Ferro as the Tribune Publishing chairman was brief. It started in 2016 when his fund, Merrick Ventures, plowed $ 44 million into the company and came to an end in 2018, when he stepped down after two women accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. He sold his Tribune Publishing shares to Alden.
Other Tribune Publishing newspapers had organizing drives in recent years: The Hartford Courant, The Virginian-Pilot in Norfolk, The Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call and -- for the first time in its more than 170 years -- The Chicago Tribune formed unions. A Tribune Publishing spokesman declined to comment for this article.
Newsroom employees at The Arizona Republic, a daily belonging to the supersize version of Gannett that came into being after the merger with GateHouse Media, voted to become unionized in October. Steve Benson, a Pulitzer-winning editorial cartoonist who was laid off a year ago, designed a logo for the Arizona Republic Guild featuring a saguaro cactus with a No. 2 pencil in place of a trunk.
Maribel Wadsworth, the publisher of Gannett and USA Today, said in an interview that, as a former reporter, she sympathized with the journalists -- "seeking that sense of security is an understandable path," she said -- but expressed skepticism about the organizing effort.
"Unions are not going to be the driver of revenue growth or subscription growth, or change the challenges the industry has faced," she said.
Several Republic journalists said they hoped to achieve greater job security and opportunities for career advancement. They also sounded loftier aims that have been invoked in newsrooms across the country.
"The days of journalism being held publicly by Wall Street should be over," said Rebekah L. Sanders, the consumer protection reporter at The Republic who helped lead the union drive. "We have a public service mission, which used to be propped up by crazy ad margins. That's all gone, so we need to make a transition in our business model."

'Bad Boys for Life 'Tops Box Office (Again)

Texto completo: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's sequel raked in domestic ticket sales this weekend -- not that there was much to stop them.
With little competition for its two seasoned stars, Sony's action-comedy sequel "Bad Boys for Life" easily led movie ticket sales this weekend, maintaining its top spot at the domestic box office for its second weekend in theaters.
"Bad Boys for Life," which stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, sold an estimated $ 34 million in domestic tickets Friday through Sunday. It brought in an additional $ 42 million overseas this weekend, according to the studio.
The movie brings back buddy-cop characters Smith and Lawrence originated in the 1995 blockbuster "Bad Boys." Audiences appear happy with their return: In CinemaScore exit polls, they gave "Bad Boys for Life" an A grade. This weekend provided further proof that Smith and Lawrence can still put plenty of ticket buyers in seats, even after 17 years of radio silence since the sequel "Bad Boys II."
Not that there was much to stop them.
The only newcomer to the box office's top five this weekend was another action comedy, STXfilms's "The Gentlemen," which opened to an estimated $ 11 million in domestic sales. That's a solid success for the smaller-scaler, darker film, which was written and directed by Guy Ritchie (his squeaky-clean "Aladdin" remake exceeded expectations in May).
"The Gentlemen" has an ensemble of stars -- Matthew McConaughey, Colin Farrell, Michelle Dockery, Henry Golding and Hugh Grant -- with a plot centering on a drug kingpin (McConaughey) eyeing retirement, and a collection of reprobates who want to take his place.
"The Gentlemen" received a fairly warm reception from critics -- it currently holds a 72 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, "Mostly the movie is about Ritchie's own conspicuous pleasure directing famous actors having a lark, trading insults, making mischief."
[Read our critic's review of "The Gentlemen."]
"The Gentlemen" landed in fourth place overall, behind a pair of holdovers.
Second place went to Universal's "1917," which brought in an estimated $ 15.8 million in domestic sales this weekend. The World War I drama from Sam Mendes has continued to pick up awards-season steam in the lead-up to the Oscars next month, giving it an advantage at the box office.
Universal's "Dolittle," an adventure movie that casts Robert Downey Jr. as the titular, fictional veterinarian, landed in third: It sold around $ 12.5 million in domestic tickets according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That's a paltry amount for a movie that cost at least $ 200 million to make and market -- and was in only its second weekend in domestic theaters.
"The Turning," a horror movie also distributed by Universal, was released in domestic theaters this weekend but apparently failed to crack the top five. It managed just $ 7.3 million in estimated ticket sales, which would put it in sixth place, behind Sony's "Jumanji: The Next Level." That movie, which was in its seventh weekend in theaters, sold an estimated $ 7.9 million in tickets Friday through Sunday. Final counts on Monday will determine whether it or "The Turning" landed in fifth.

Texto completo: Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said that he will no longer seek public office, and hoped to spend more time with his family.
For nearly his entire adult life, Ruben Diaz Jr. had seemed to be on a one-way path to political stardom.
At the age of 22, he was elected to the New York State Assembly. A dozen or so years later, he was elected as Bronx borough president. Political insiders speculated just how high Mr. Diaz might rise.
In 2018, Mr. Diaz seemed to offer an answer, becoming the first candidate to file papers declaring his interest in the 2021 New York City Democratic primary for mayor. His chances seemed formidable: He had the backing of the powerful Bronx Democratic Party; an alliance with the more powerful governor, Andrew M. Cuomo; and presumed support from Latino voters.
But for more than a year, Mr. Diaz said that something did not feel right. He would attend fund-raisers, shake voters' hands and sit for portraits.
All this, he said he had thought to himself, "for the guy who is not running for mayor."
Mr. Diaz, 46, has decided to withdraw from the mayor's race, telling The New York Times in an interview that he does not plan to seek any public office once his term as borough president runs out in 2021.
He said the primary reason for dropping out was that he wanted to spend more time with his family than would be possible, either as mayor or borough president.
"You miss out on a lot," Mr. Diaz said of his wife and two sons. "I want to hang out with them more."
The decision -- which Mr. Diaz has not shared with most members of his staff or colleagues -- comes as the mayor's race is taking firmer shape.
His departure leaves Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, as the only major candidate of color; Mr. Adams is black. The two other leading candidates are white: the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, and the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson.
And although the Democratic primary for mayor is more than a year away, Mr. Diaz seemed to be ceding ground to his rivals.
Since July, he has raised about $ 94,000, and has spent $ 102,000. Mr. Stringer, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Adams have each raised at least three times that amount, and have spent tens of thousands of dollars less. Mr. Diaz does have about $ 900,000 in his campaign war chest, but Mr. Adams and Mr. Stringer each have more than $ 2 million; Mr. Johnson has nearly $ 700,000.
Mr. Diaz said that he has eased off on fund-raising efforts as he wrestled with whether to proceed with a campaign.
"I cannot continue to pretend to folks, ask them for money, ask them to support me when after, really thinking about this and feeling it and doing soul-searching and speaking with my family, I know I'm not giving it 100 percent," he said.
Mr. Diaz said he will return all donations that he has raised for this race, and hopes his supporters will rally around another candidate.
"I'm doing it now so my supporters have ample time to recalibrate on whatever they want to do in terms of other candidates," Mr. Diaz said. "I'm at peace with it."
Carl Heastie, the New York State Assembly speaker and a close friend of Mr. Diaz's, said he was "disappointed" not to see the Bronx borough president become the next mayor. But, Mr. Heastie said, "I wasn't surprised."
"These things are personal," he said. Before becoming speaker, Mr. Heastie said he, too, had a "fleeting thought" about leaving public office. At the time, he had served 14 years as a member of the Assembly. He was also the Democratic County leader in the Bronx, and his daughter was just 5 years old. "It is time that you can't make up," he said.
Still, Mr. Diaz's reason was met with some skepticism.
Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, said, "Anyone who wants to dedicate themselves to spending more time with their family, I respect that. Some constituents may respect that, or find it curious since his children are grown."
Mr. Diaz's youngest son, Ryan, is in the Army and stationed in Germany. His older son, also named Ruben, lives in the Bronx. Mr. Diaz described his relationship with his children as harmonious, but remote.
"I haven't seen my youngest, I've seen him three days in over the last 380 days," he said. "Ruben lives in the West Bronx and I see Ruben every other week? He lives right here."
Mr. Diaz said that he expected his decision to no longer seek public office to be greeted with suspicion of some hidden, less savory motive.
Paul J. Del Duca, Mr. Diaz's chief of staff and senior strategic adviser, said that if there were some potential legal problem lurking, "We would never be giving the money back," referring to the political donations.
Mr. Diaz echoed Mr. Del Duca's sentiment, quickly adding, "I'm giving the money back. Who does that?"
His defection from the mayor's race will still leave one member of his family in politics: His father, Ruben Diaz Sr., a Pentecostal minister who opposes same-sex marriage and has had a history of anti-gay remarks, is a city councilman running for Congress.
Mr. Diaz said he has not told his father of his plans to leave public office and not run for mayor, admitting he did not trust that his decision would be held in confidence.
Mr. Diaz demurred when asked if he thought his father took his son's political interests to heart. "He would say he does," he said. "Some would question that."

Texto completo: The former vice president has made inaccurate claims this month about his record on Social Security, race and foreign policy.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. remains atop most national polls before the first votes are cast next month in the Democratic presidential primary. Before the Iowa caucuses, The New York Times reviewed recent statements he made defending his decades-long career, stressing his standing in the black community and highlighting his perceived strength on foreign policy. Here's a fact check.
Mr. Biden tried to defend his record on Social Security and birth control with questionable claims.
Antonia Hylton, a reporter for Vice News: "Do you think, though, that it's fair for voters to question your commitment to Social Security when in the past you've proposed a freeze to it?"
Mr. Biden: "No, I didn't propose a freeze."
-- at the Brown & Black Democratic Presidential Forum last week in Iowa
False. In 1984, faced with budget deficits under the Reagan administration, Mr. Biden was a co-sponsor of an amendment with two Republican senators that froze for one year nearly all military and domestic spending, including cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits.
Pressed by Ms. Hylton after his inaccurate denial, Mr. Biden said that his proposal came "in the context of we saved Social Security during the Reagan administration" and noted that Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a liberal stalwart, voted for the plan.
When President Ronald Reagan entered office in 1981, Social Security was running low on funding and Mr. Reagan did propose to make deep cuts to benefits. But he ultimately endorsed and signed bipartisan legislation in 1983 -- which Mr. Biden and Mr. Kennedy both voted for -- to assure the fund's continuing solvency. Changes included postponing cost-of-living adjustments, and the Biden campaign said that the former vice president was referring to this episode.
"It is easy to believe Biden thought minor cuts in the program in the short run would represent a better outcome than the much bigger cuts President Reagan and his advisers seemed to favor," Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. "In those days, 'compromise' was not a dirty word in the eyes of most members of Congress."
Mr. Biden's own freeze plan, though, came "well after the Social Security rescue was over," said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University who wrote a book on the 1983 effort.
Rather, the plan was another step in a decades-long "mating dance between centrist Democrats and Republicans to come up with a grand bargain on the deficit," said Eric Laursen, author of "The People's Pension: The Struggle to Defend Social Security Since Reagan."
Mr. Biden said as much in April 1984, as he decried "gargantuan deficits" and argued that not accepting a one-year freeze to cost-of-living adjustments would lead to a "a fundamental debate over whether or not there should be COLAs in Social Security" at all. The amendment that he co-sponsored ultimately failed by a vote of 65 to 33 (Mr. Kennedy voted against it).
Mr. Biden's overall record on Social Security includes both actions that would slow or reduce spending and those that would protect benefits.
He voted for an amendment in 1995 to require a balanced federal budget that he and other Democrats warned would endanger the Social Security fund. He was open to raising the eligibility age for Social Security in 2007. And he brokered a deal with Republican lawmakers in 2010 that extended the Bush-era tax cuts and created a holiday for the payroll tax, which funds Social Security, that temporarily reduced the tax by two percentage points.
But Mr. Biden also voted for an amendment to that balanced budget legislation in 1995 that would have excluded Social Security from its aims. From 2001 to 2008, he repeatedly voted against privatizing Social Security and for improving the trust fund's solvency, according to the Alliance for Retired Americans, an affiliate of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that represents union retirees. In 2008, Mr. Biden's last year in the Senate, he received a lifetime score of 96 out of 100 from the group. He spoke out against Social Security privatization in the 2012 vice-presidential debate and his current plan vows to protect the safety net.
Lauren Kelley, New York Times Editorial Board member: "You also originally argued for greater exemptions to the contraception mandate in Obamacare. So I think there's some concern out there --"
Mr. Biden: "No, I didn't, by the way."
-- in an interview with The New York Times Editorial Board published Jan. 17
This is disputed. The Obama administration announced in January 2012 a rule requiring most insurance plans to cover birth control free of charge, including for the employees of hospitals, schools and charities run by Catholic groups.
The making of the rule sparked an internal debate in the White House. Reporting from news outlets cast Mr. Biden as part of the camp arguing for a less stringent rule.
According to ABC News and Bloomberg, the vice president and William Daley, then the chief of staff to President Barack Obama, warned of the political fallout with Catholic voters who backed Mr. Obama in the 2008 election and argued that the issue would be framed as an attack on religious liberty. The Times reported that officials had initially sought a year to work out a compromise, but "a group of advisers had bested Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others and sold the president on a stricter rule."
The announcement fueled a fierce backlash from Catholic organizations and Republicans. As the Obama administration contemplated the fallout, Mr. Biden did not publicly oppose or defend the rule, but hinted during a radio interview that it would be softened.
"There's going to be a significant attempt to work this out, and there's time to do that," he said on Feb. 9, 2012. "And as a practicing Catholic, you know, I am of the view that this can be worked out and should be worked out and I think the president, I know the president, feels the same way."
Mr. Biden also said in the interview that the administration wanted to "make sure women who need access to birth control are not denied that," according to The Wall Street Journal.
A day later, the administration revised the rule to shift the responsibility of providing contraception to insurers, rather than the religiously affiliated institutions themselves.
Mr. Biden overstated his support among young black voters and his role in the civil rights movement.
Ms. Hylton: "Why is Senator Sanders leading you with voters under age 35?"
Mr. Biden: "He is not leading me with black voters under the age -- look, just all I know is, I am leading everybody, combined, with black voters."
-- at the Brown & Black forum
This is exaggerated. Mr. Biden is correct that in most polls, he leads Democratic candidates among black voters overall, but he is wrong to deny Senator Bernie Sanders' edge with younger African Americans.
A January poll conducted by The Washington Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, found that Mr. Biden held a wide lead among black Democrats with 48 percent support, but Mr. Sanders led with those between age 18 and 34 at 42 percent while Mr. Biden placed second at 30 percent.
An Ipsos survey conducted with Vice this month asked black Americans who they would consider voting for and found that 56 percent would consider voting for Mr. Sanders and 54 percent for Mr. Biden, a statistical tie. Among those between ages 18 and 34, Mr. Sanders' support increased to 81 percent compared with 65 percent for Mr. Biden, according to a breakdown provided by Chris Jackson, the vice president of Ipsos Public Affairs.
In a poll by the political action committee BlackPac and released in December, Mr. Biden led all black voters with 38 percent, but trailed Mr. Sanders in support among black voters between ages 18 and 24 at 14 percent compared to 30 percent for Mr. Sanders. Support for the two candidates was nearly identical among black voters between the ages of 25 and 39, with 24 percent supporting Mr. Biden and 25 percent supporting Mr. Sanders.
The Sanders campaign also pointed to an array of surveys demonstrating the same generational gap: a fall poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics where Mr. Sanders was the first choice of black voters between ages 18 and 29, a January poll from Chegg Media Center where Mr. Sanders led with black college students with 43 percent and a September survey from Essence Magazine where Mr. Sanders had the most support of black women between ages 18 and 34 with 19 percent.
"I was involved in the civil rights movement."
-- at the Brown & Black forum
This is exaggerated. Over his long political career, Mr. Biden has occasionally suggested he played a greater role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s than he actually did. While there are accounts of Mr. Biden participating in a few desegregation events, he has also said he would not consider himself an activist in the movement.
Mr. Biden has said that he protested a segregated movie theater in demonstrations in Wilmington, Del. at the Rialto Theater in the early 1960s. His account is backed by a former president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a former president of the Delaware A.F.L.-C.I.O.
A 1987 edition of "Current Biography Yearbook," a magazine that profiles American figures, noted that Mr. Biden had participated in "anti-segregation sit-ins at Wilmington's Town Theatre during his high school years."
During his first bid for president, Mr. Biden wrongly said in 1987 that he had "marched with tens of thousands of others" in the civil rights movement. Later, a spokesman for Mr. Biden clarified that he had participated in actions to "desegregate one restaurant and one movie theater." Mr. Biden himself conceded that "I was not an activist."
"I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Del. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. But I was not out marching," he said in a news conference that fall. "I was not down in Selma. I was not anywhere else. I was a suburbanite kid who got a dose of exposure to what was happening to black Americans."
He struck a similar tone in interviews with the journalist Jules Witcover, who wrote the book "Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption."
"I didn't do any big deal, but I marched a couple of times to desegregate the movie theaters in downtown Wilmington," Mr. Biden said in the book. But he acknowledged that "I wasn't part of any great movement."
Mr. Biden inaccurately characterized one element of President Trump's North Korea policy.
"The president showed up, met with them, gave him legitimacy, weakened these sanctions we have against him."
-- at the Democratic presidential debate in January
This is misleading. Mr. Biden is referring to Mr. Trump's efforts to engage diplomatically with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. There is a widespread consensus that the president's willingness to meet with him provided Mr. Kim with additional credibility at home and abroad without giving the United States and its allies much in return.
At the same time, Mr. Trump's meetings with the North Koreans have increased support from China and Russia for easing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, as the Biden campaign pointed out. Soo Kim, a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation, a research group, pointed out that South Korea has also recently been testing the waters for securing sanctions relief for its northern neighbor.
But the Trump administration itself has not lifted the United States' own sanctions and has opposed the calls from China and Russia to ease the international sanctions.
"As far as I know, sanctions have not been eased," said Jim Walsh of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Certainly the international U.N. sanctions continue unabated, and I am unaware of any significant sanctions relief granted by the administration."
A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said Mr. Biden's statement was inaccurate and that the agency "has sanctioned 261 individuals and entities under its North Korea authorities, accounting for more than half of North Korea-related sanctions ever imposed."
Nearly every month from March 2017 to March 2018, the department announced sanctions on North Korean nationals and companies, as well people and entities around the world linked to North Korea. After Mr. Trump's summit with Mr. Kim in Singapore in June 2018, Treasury imposed more sanctions in August, September, October, November and December of that year.
In March 2019, shortly after Mr. Trump met again with Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, the president issued a confusing statement on Twitter announcing that he had rolled back newly imposed sanctions on North Korea, though restrictions announced a day earlier on two Chinese companies linked to North Korea were not actually revoked. The White House press secretary at the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explained that Mr. Trump "doesn't feel it's necessary to add additional sanctions at this time."
A month later, Mr. Trump said the sanctions on North Korea are "at a fair level" and should remain in place. More were announced in June, August and September. The United States opposed lifting United Nations sanctions on North Korea in December and sanctioned two more entities January.
Mr. Biden's theory that Mr. Trump's personal appeals to Mr. Kim has weakened the resolve of other countries to enforce sanctions is a matter of interpretation.
This line of argument "was trotted out every time Obama engaged in diplomacy," Mr. Walsh said. "We don't know if diplomacy with North Korea has had the effect of reducing the impact of sanctions. Maybe. But as with all things North Korea, it's hard to say."

Texto completo: The apology to the staff from the Philadelphia Museum of Art executive involved a manager who had been the subject of employee complaints.
Timothy Rub, the director and chief executive officer of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, on Wednesday apologized to hundreds of employees, saying the institution had made mistakes in the way it dealt with a former manager several female staff members have accused of sexual harassment.
Mr. Rub's remarks, made at a closed-door, all-staff morning meeting before the museum opened to the public, addressed the allegations that have surfaced against Joshua Helmer, the former assistant director for interpretation at the museum. In 2018, he left and went on to become director of the art museum in Erie, Pa., where an intern made a similar complaint.
On Jan. 10, The New York Times reported that several women had accused Mr. Helmer of making advances toward them in the workplace during his time at the Philadelphia museum. On Jan. 12, the Erie Art Museum forced Mr. Helmer to resign.
Mr. Helmer, who did not respond to a request for comment, has denied any misconduct but declined to discuss his relationships with female employees.
The Philadelphia museum has been under pressure to respond to criticism that it had been insensitive to staff concerns before Mr. Helmer's departure. On Jan. 15, Mayor Jim Kenney called for it to "strengthen" its policies regarding sexual harassment. Two Pennsylvania state senators -- Pam Iovino and Katie Muth -- also called for greater management accountability in cases where sexual misconduct is suspected.
In recent weeks, museum officials met with individual departments before calling the full staff meeting, which was labeled a "town hall."
In a statement after the meeting, Mr. Rub said: "Following on the department meetings, today's town hall was extremely important, and I know that actions speak louder than words. It is my firm commitment to do all that is necessary to address our issues head on, to ensure that this is a workplace in which people feel secure and fully supported."
Last week, the Philadelphia Museum's board chair, Leslie Anne Miller, said in an email to staff members that she would lead a "cultural assessment" -- including staff interviews and focus groups with an independent third party -- "to understand what brought us here and most importantly what we need to change to be sure it never happens again."
The Erie Museum posted a statement on its Facebook page announcing that a trustee, Diana Denniston, would play a more active role in day-to-day operations while the museum begins "the long process of recruiting a new executive director."
"The board has made and will continue to make, improvements to ensure the museum is a great place to work, and that the staff feels safe in voicing their concerns," the statement said, adding, "The Erie Art Museum is more than just one man."
Mr. Rub's comments at Wednesday's meeting, first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer, struck several employees in attendance as too little too late.
Some have said that during Mr. Helmer's tenure at the Philadelphia museum, Mr. Rub showed tremendous confidence in him, a posture that some felt made it hard to come forward with complaints.
"So at this point, I doubt Timothy does (or will ever) really understand how he personally contributed to this mess," Jennifer Schlegel, a museum employee in the technology department, said in an email after the meeting.
Kelsey Rhodes, the development assistant in charge of donor engagement and communications, said: "I am tired of hearing, 'I am sorry you did not feel comfortable coming forward.' That was not an option for many people, including myself, and there is lasting hurt.
"I am attempting to remain optimistic and be a part of change here as we better our future as an institution," she continued, "but it's hard to repair personally when the leadership I am depending on is so reluctant to admit any culpability."
Adam Rizzo, a member of the education department, commended the "actual apology," but said he was frustrated that it "was given behind closed doors and only when it was requested."
"I expected the museum could at least announce mandatory harassment training for all staff and the rollout of an anonymous reporting system," he added, "but instead all we got was a request for us to be patient while they figure it out."

The New Threat to Journalists

Texto completo: The cases against Julian Assange and Glenn Greenwald may be models for a crackdown.
When Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was charged last year by the Trump administration in connection with the publication of secret United States government documents nearly a decade earlier, many journalists expressed deep concern about the dangerous precedent the case could set for investigative reporting in America.
But few seemed to consider that the case might also serve as a model for other nations eager to clamp down on press freedom.
On Tuesday, Glenn Greenwald, an American journalist living and working in Brazil, was charged, in a criminal complaint brought by Brazilian prosecutors, with cybercrimes in connection with his stories on private messages among Brazilian officials that revealed corruption and abuses at the highest levels of the government. Brazilian prosecutors asserted that Mr. Greenwald was part of a criminal organization that hacked the cellphones of government officials. He has denied the charges. (Full disclosure: Mr. Greenwald is a co-founder of The Intercept, where I work as a reporter; I also run the First Look Press Freedom Defense Fund, part of the nonprofit organization that includes The Intercept.)
The case against Mr. Greenwald is eerily similar to the Trump administration's case against Mr. Assange. Last April, the Justice Department charged Mr. Assange with aiding a source, the former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, to gain access to a United States military computer database. In May 2019, the charges against him were broadened, and he was indicted under the Espionage Act in connection with the publication of American military and diplomatic documents by WikiLeaks.
Both cases are based in part on a new prosecutorial concept -- that journalism can be proved to be a crime through a focus on interactions between reporters and their sources. Prosecutors are now scrutinizing the processes by which sources obtain classified or private information and then provide it to journalists. Since those interactions today are largely electronic, prosecutors are seeking to criminalize journalism by turning to anti-hacking laws to implicate reporters in the purported criminal activity of their sources in gaining access to data on computers or cellphones without authorization.
This blunt approach gives the government enormous leverage over journalists and, in the United States, provides them with a detour around First Amendment concerns. If these cases become templates that prosecutors in the United States and other nations follow, virtually every investigative reporter will become vulnerable to criminal charges and imprisonment.
Both the Trump administration and the right-wing Brazilian government of President Jair Bolsonaro seem to have decided to experiment with such draconian anti-press tactics by trying them out first on aggressive and disagreeable figures.
In fact, by the time of his indictment last year, there was still an ongoing debate within the media about whether Mr. Assange should even be considered a journalist at all.
In 2010, when WikiLeaks began publishing the huge leaks of United States government documents it had obtained from Ms. Manning, Mr. Assange suddenly emerged as a strange new player in the modern journalistic landscape. Under his leadership, WikiLeaks both published the documents itself and also shared many of the leaked documents with other major news organizations, including The New York Times.
Mr. Assange was both a publisher and an intermediary between sources and reporters, which made it difficult to define his journalistic role. His later involvement in the Trump-Russia case -- in 2016, WikiLeaks obtained and released emails and other documents from the Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee from a hacker believed to be a front for Russian intelligence -- transformed Mr. Assange into an even more incendiary character with little public support. (The federal charges against Mr. Assange are not related to his involvement in the 2016 campaign.)
Mr. Greenwald revels in his divisiveness and his disdain for the mainstream media, and he and I have publicly clashed over our differing views of the Trump-Russia case. But he is also a zealous journalist who came to prominence in 2013 for his Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of a giant trove of documents from the National Security Agency that were leaked by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward Snowden.
Last year, Mr. Greenwald obtained another big leak, the private messages of Brazilian government officials concerning a major corruption case in Brazil that had led to the conviction of the former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
Mr. Greenwald's reporting revealed that the investigation that led to Mr. da Silva's conviction was deeply politicized and corrupt. The stories were explosive in Brazil, and ultimately helped lead to Mr. da Silva's release from prison in November.
But Mr. Greenwald's reporting enraged President Bolsonaro, who had been leveling threats against the journalist for months before the complaint issued on Tuesday.
In an interview with me on Thursday, Mr. Greenwald agreed that there are parallels between his case and Mr. Assange's, and added that he doesn't believe that Mr. Bolsonaro would have taken action against an American journalist if he had thought President Trump would oppose it.
"Bolsonaro worships Trump, and the Bolsonaro government is taking the signal from Trump that this kind of behavior is acceptable," he said.
The State Department has not issued any statement of concern about Brazil's case against Mr. Greenwald, which in past administrations would have been common practice.
"This is all about targeting reporters who are publishing information that is embarrassing, and not like the 90 percent of the leaks coming out of Washington that are official leaks designed to support the people in power," said Joshua Dratel, a criminal defense attorney in New York who has represented prominent whistle blowers and who also represented WikiLeaks in a civil suit brought against it by the Democratic National Committee.
In fact, Mr. Trump's anti-press rhetoric and actions have encouraged authoritarian regimes around the world to prosecute and jail journalists, and to impose new anti-press laws and other measures designed to curtail negative coverage.
Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in an interview that one of the latest tactics spreading around the globe is the creation of vaguely worded "fake news" laws that criminalize news that government officials deem to be wrong. "Fake news" is, of course, a phrase that Mr. Trump has helped popularize.
"Qatar just promulgated a fake news law this week," Mr. Simon said, noting that Singapore also has one. "These fake news laws are absolutely correlated with the Trump administration."
The most tragic evidence that Mr. Trump is enabling a global crackdown on the press has been his failure to hold Saudi Arabia's leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, accountable for the brutal 2018 murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. "The Trump administration is an accessory after the fact to the Khashoggi murder," Mr. Simon said.
While the Bush and Obama administrations were "inconsistent" on press issues, "they were still willing to discuss concerns about press freedom with another country in the framework of the bilateral relationship," he added. "That's gone now with Trump."
It will be tragic if journalists shrug off the attack on the contrarian Mr. Greenwald and don't see his case for what it truly signifies -- that Trump-like attacks on the press are spreading like a virus around the globe.

Texto completo: The White House granted TruNews, a right-wing Christian site, press credentials for the president's Davos trip after its founder's remarks calling impeachment a "Jew coup."
To coordinate coverage of President Trump's trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the White House provided press credentials to the usual mix of American news organizations, including Fox News, Reuters and The New York Times.
One media outlet stood out: TruNews, a website aimed at conservative Christians whose founder, a pastor named Rick Wiles, recently described Mr. Trump's impeachment as "a Jew coup" planned by "a Jewish cabal."
Five employees of TruNews, which is based in Florida, received formal credentials from the White House to cover the president's trip, Mr. Wiles said in an interview last week from his hotel room in Switzerland -- a room in a ski lodge reserved by the Trump administration for traveling members of the American press. (Like other media organizations, TruNews paid for its flights and lodging.)
White House officials, in this and previous administrations, tend to be flexible in choosing which news organizations receive press credentials: Reporting is a form of free speech and there are no legal restrictions on who can declare themselves a journalist.
But Mr. Wiles's ability to secure credentials after his anti-Semitic remarks -- which prompted a formal rebuke from two members of Congress -- has left civil rights groups deeply troubled.
"It's a validation of their work," said Kyle Mantyla, a senior fellow at the progressive group People for the American Way, which has tracked Mr. Wiles's work. TruNews, he said, "sees it as the White House being on their side."
TruNews was not granted special access to the president in Davos, nor did its members travel on Air Force One. But one of Mr. Wiles's colleagues, Edward Szall, asked a question of the president's daughter Ivanka Trump during a news conference.
"We want to thank President Trump and the White House for extending the invitation to be here," Mr. Wiles said in a video from Davos. "We are honored to be here, representing the kingdom of heaven and our king Jesus Christ."
It was not the first time TruNews has gotten close to Mr. Trump and his family.
The president took a question from Mr. Szall at a 2018 news conference in Midtown Manhattan. In March 2019, a TruNews correspondent filmed an interview with Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, after a rally in Michigan. (A spokeswoman for Donald Trump Jr. told The Washington Post that the interview was impromptu and that Mr. Trump was unfamiliar with the site.)
TruNews, which Mr. Wiles founded as an online radio program in 1999 called America's Hope, has a history of spreading conspiracy theories and proclaiming an imminent apocalypse. It drew more scrutiny in November after Mr. Wiles, in an online video, accused Jews of orchestrating Mr. Trump's impeachment.
"That's the way Jews work," Mr. Wiles said. "They are deceivers. They plot, they lie, they do whatever they have to do to accomplish their political agenda. This 'Impeach Trump' movement is a Jew coup, and the American people better wake up to it really fast."
Mr. Wiles also warned his listeners that "when Jews take over a country, they kill millions of Christians."
Afterward, Representatives Ted Deutch of Florida and Elaine Luria of Virginia, wrote to the White House asking why TruNews had been allowed to attend presidential events. They did not receive a response.
The White House declined to comment for this article. In the past, the administration has faced lawsuits after revoking press credentials from reporters from CNN and Playboy.
On the phone from Switzerland, Mr. Wiles explained how his Davos trip had come about.
"We're on a list of media organizations at the White House and from time to time they send out notices that there are events taking place," Mr. Wiles said, adding that his team had also covered Mr. Trump's visits to NATO summits and Group of 20 gatherings. He said that he received an email from the White House about the Davos trip and that his request to attend was approved.
The team from TruNews -- three correspondents and a two-person production crew -- stayed at a hotel where the White House had reserved a block of rooms for the use of American journalists. (As with a wedding block, those who used the rooms paid the hotel directly.) Reporters spotted Mr. Wiles at the breakfast buffet at the hotel, the Privà Alpine Lodge.
Asked in the interview if he understood why his "Jew coup" comments prompted charges of anti-Semitism, Mr. Wiles replied: "I coined a phrase. It came out of my mouth: 'It looks like a Jew coup.' All I pointed out was many of the people involved were Jewish."
Pressed if such rhetoric could be reasonably interpreted as anti-Semitic, Mr. Wiles said: "It's hard to say. I don't know. I can tell you from my heart there is no ill will toward the Jewish people, with all sincerity."
His critics disagree. Mr. Deutch, the representative from Florida, learned of TruNews's presence in Davos while on a congressional trip to Jerusalem to commemorate the Holocaust.
"I can't believe the day before I attend an event at Yad Vashem marking 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, anti-Semites were given WH credentials to broadcast from European soil," Mr. Deutch wrote on Twitter. (Yad Vashem is the Israeli Holocaust memorial.)
The president of the White House Correspondents' Association, Jonathan Karl of ABC News, has asked the Trump administration why TruNews was credentialed for the trip.
"It's puzzling that a known hate group would get press credentials from the same White House that revoked the credentials of a correspondent for a major television network," Mr. Karl said on Sunday, referring to Jim Acosta of CNN, whose credentials were revoked -- and then restored after a lawsuit -- in 2018.
"We have asked why this happened and if the White House intends to issue credentials to this group in the future," Mr. Karl said. "We have not received an on-the-record response."
Mr. Wiles, in the interview, said that he had been unfairly attacked by "the self-appointed gods and goddesses of the news media, who do not think we should be permitted to attend any event." He went on to blame George Soros, the Jewish financier often cited in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, for coordinating a campaign against him.
"I don't think anybody can find fault with our news coverage at these events," Mr. Wiles said. "They may not agree with our analysis and conclusions. But our behavior at these events -- we're professional, we're respectful."
He added: "And we're able to get interviews with prominent people."

COMMENTARY; 'Dirt' reveals a failing of book industry; The establishment deemed it the great immigrant novel, yet it doesn't reflect Latino experience

Texto completo: By now, you've probably heard about the uproar that took place last week over a book.
"American Dirt" by Jeanine Cummins was celebrated by critics as the great immigrant novel of our day.
"Masterful."

"Pulse-pounding."
"Soul-obliterating."
"A 'Grapes of Wrath' for our times."
Even Oprah Winfrey dove in early Tuesday morning, the day of the release, and anointed "American Dirt" with the holy grail of endorsements, selecting it for her book club.
"I was opened, I was shook up, it woke me up," Winfrey said in a promotional video. "I feel like everyone who reads this book is actually going to be immersed in the experience of what it means to be a migrant on the run for freedom."
It was a perfectly orchestrated mega-budget campaign that might have gone off without a hitch if weren't for Latinos. Many who grew up in actual immigrant families unleashed a storm of criticism -- unlike anything the book industry has seen in years.
I was among those who spoke up.
I'm an immigrant, after all. My family fled by foot and bus to the U.S. in the 1980s as right-wing death squads were killing and torturing thousands across El Salvador, including several of my relatives.
The trauma of those dark days shaped everything about me.
I figured I might recognize some part of my story in Cummins' book, which follows an immigrant mother and son on their harrowing escape north from Mexico.
Then I read the book. My skin crawled after the first few chapters.
Not because of the suspense, though that's probably the only thing this narrative does well, like a cheap-thrill narconovela.
What made me cringe was immediately realizing that this book was not written for people like me, for immigrants. It was written for everyone else -- to enchant them, take them on a wild border-crossing ride, make them feel all fuzzy inside about the immigrant plight.
All, unfortunately, with the worst stereotypes, fixations and inaccuracies about Latinos.
Sure, I know it's all fiction and I'm no literary critic. Cummins is not obligated to write a book that reflects my life. But it's strange that a novel so many are praising for its humanity seems so far from all the real-life immigrant experiences I've covered.
Never in nearly two decades of writing about immigrants have I come across someone who resembles Cummins' heroine, a Mexican woman named Lydia.
She's a middle-class, bookstore-owning "Mami" who starts her treacherous journey with a small fortune: a stack of cash, thousands of dollars in inheritance money; also an ATM card to access thousands more from her mother's life savings.
Why is she fleeing? Because while her husband, a journalist, was investigating a drug lord, Lydia was flirting with that same narco.
Moments after he walked into her bookshop, "She smiled at him, feeling slightly crazy. She ignored this feeling and plowed recklessly ahead."
Later, when Lydia is running for her life, debating whether she and her 8-year-old son should jump on La Bestia, the perilous northbound freight train that's cost many immigrants their limbs and lives, she has an identity crisis. She used to be "sensible," "a devoted mother-and-wife." Now she calls herself "deranged Lydia."
Because hint, hint, reader: Any immigrant parent desperate enough to put their kids in such danger must be crazy, right?
It's a book of villains and victims, the two most tired tropes about immigrants in the media, in which Cummins has an "excited fascination" with brown skin, as New York Times critic Parul Sehgal pointed out in one of the few negative reviews of the book. Her characters are "berry-brown" or "tan as childhood." There is also a reference to "skinny brown children."
When two of her leading characters, sisters migrating from Honduras named Rebeca and Soledad, hug, "Rebeca breathes deeply into Soledad's neck, and her tears wet the soft brown curve of her sister's skin."
When's the last time you hugged your sister and stopped to contemplate the color of her skin?
All novelists offer vivid descriptions of their characters, but Cummins' preoccupation with skin color is especially disturbing in a society that constantly measures the worth of Latinos by where they fall on the scale of brownness.
Soledad, by the way, is also "dangerously" beautiful. She's a "vivid throb of color," an "accident of biology." Even in the "most minor animation of the girl's body ... danger rattles off her relentlessly."
Of course. Everywhere we Latinas go, our bodies are radioactive with peligro.
Speaking of Spanish, you'll pick up quite a few words in "American Dirt." Cummins, in stiff sentences that sound like Dora the Explorer teaching a toddler, will introduce you to conchas, refrescos, "Andale," "Ay, Dios mio," "Me gusta!"
All this, it pains me to say, was praised by nearly every U.S. critic who reviewed it as a great accomplishment.
It's what the Washington Post's critic "devoured" in a "dry-eyed adrenaline rush," what kept the Los Angeles Times reviewer up until 3 a.m., what the New York Times initially said had all the "ferocity and political reach of the best of Theodore Dreiser's novels." (The latter paper later deleted the tweet, and an editor explained the line had been from an unpublished draft.)
The heart of the problem is the industry -- the critics, agents, publicists, book dealers who were responsible for this project. They've shown just how little they know about the immigrant experience beyond the headlines.
So we are left with this flawed book as our model, these damaging depictions at a time when there's already so much demonizing of immigrants.
Cummins said she questioned whether she was the right person to tell this story.
She was born in Spain and raised in Maryland. A few years ago she identified herself in the New York Times as "white," though in the book she plays up her Latina side, making reference to a grandmother from Puerto Rico. Her publisher publicized the book by promoting Cummins as "the wife of a formerly undocumented immigrant." She doesn't mention that her husband is from Ireland.
"I worried that, as a non-immigrant and non-Mexican, I had no business writing a book set almost entirely in Mexico, set entirely among migrants," she said in her author's note.
"I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it."
Still, she saw herself as a "bridge," so she plunged in.
I don't take issue with an outsider coming into my community to write about us. But "American Dirt" so completely misrepresents the immigrant experience that it must be called out.
Cummins said her goal was to help immigrants portrayed as a "faceless brown mass." She said she wanted to give "these people a face."
How's that for a captivating book pitch?
The industry ate it up. In a rare three-day bidding war, Flatiron Books reportedly won Cummins' book for a seven-figure sum.
The number astounded many writers. It fell with a blunt force on Latinos, who are constantly shut out of the book industry.
The overall industry is 80% white. Executives: 78% white. Publicists and marketing: 74% white. Agents: 80% white.
These numbers include 153 book publishers and agencies, including what's known in the book world as the Big Five, which control nearly the entire market.
This diversity study, the most comprehensive in the industry, was launched by a small independent children's book publisher in New York called Lee & Low Books. They've conducted it twice, in 2015 and in 2019. (Figures noted above are from the latest study, which will be released Tuesday.)
In those four years, the numbers showed no significant change.
"The power balance has been off for so long," said Hannah Ehrlich, director of marketing and publicity for Lee & Low. "Even when a big mistake is brought to their attention, when there's a sense of urgency, publishers don't fix it -- or they try, with good intentions, but they don't know how."
They don't know how. (Insert emoji of head exploding.)
The solution is simple: Hire more Latinos. More people of color. Listen to them. Promote them. Treat them fairly so they don't leave.
Ehrlich kindly walked me through the world of publishing, which of course is very similar to journalism, including in its glaring lack of racial diversity.
Often, Ehrlich said, what happens is gatekeepers go looking for good stories, stories that resonate with their view of the world. If they come across a compelling pitch about a person of color, the question becomes, "How do you sell this idea to a broader, mainstream audience?" Translation: white people.
By focusing on one audience, the industry makes it harder for writers of color to break through and also for publishers to build a more diverse customer base.
So it goes, in a long process that many writers of color know all too well, where the best of our stories are frequently sanitized, devalued, tropicalized, manipulated, shrunk down, hijacked.
All for sums that don't come close to seven figures.
And for deals that don't get the kind of superstar treatment of "American Dirt." That includes books that Cummins studied closely to prepare for her novel, with real migrant stories like Oscar Martinez's "The Beast," Sonia Nazario's "Enrique's Journey," Luis Alberto Urrea's "The Devil's Highway."
Cummins has no regrets about reaping the benefits of the system. She already got a movie deal and will travel to the border with Oprah for more publicity.
"I was never going to turn down money that someone offered me for something that took me seven years to write," she said in a recent interview.
When asked about the criticism, the author often keeps the focus on the question of appropriation, saying writers shouldn't be silenced. I have no desire to silence her, but her book is a symptom of a larger problem.
Cummins said people should direct their attention to the publishing world, not individual writers like her.
She's got a point. In the end, the real fight over "American Dirt" is not about this writer. It's about an industry that favors her stories over ones written by immigrants and Latinos.
Still, it's hard to let Cummins off the hook.
Not when she has posted photos on her Twitter account showing her celebrating "American Dirt" with floral centerpieces laced with barbed wire.
"That's what I call attention to detail right?!" she wrote in a comment below the photo she posted of the party.
I can't explain the gut punch I felt when I saw this image on the internet.
Growing up, my family spoke of this barbed wire. How it encircled them, how it tore their hands and legs in their treacherous trek north.
For us, the boogeyman that forced us to leave El Salvador was not some drug kingpin with a quivering mustache like La Lechuza.
It was a brutal 12-year war of terror waged on poor people by oligarchs, backed by the United States, which spent billions to train and equip Salvadoran death squads and the Salvadoran military; the U.S. helped pay for their weapons, bombs, jeeps, uniforms, gas masks. More than 75,000 Salvadorans died in the fighting.
Before my third birthday, I lost just about everyone: My grandfather, uncle and aunt were killed. My father was exiled. My mom was forced to leave me behind in El Salvador to come north.
It's a story that repeats itself among the hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans who fled to the U.S. in the 1980s.
Because of greed, a thirst for power and government violence in Central America -- a place where the United States has heavily intruded since the 1800s -- thousands of families continue to run north. From Honduras. From Guatemala. From El Salvador.
This is the immigration story of our times.
Hopefully, soon, the book world will gather the nerve to let more of our own writers tell it. And give that story the same royal treatment it gave "American Dirt."

To the Editor:
Re "Amid Plans to Expand Penn Station, Tunnels Await Trump's Help" (news article, Jan. 13):
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's ambitious plans to create an Empire State Complex surrounding Penn Station, including adding tracks south of the station if the Gateway project happens or not, overshoots the opportunity to create an architecturally significant, modern transportation center and public space akin to Grand Central Terminal in New York, Union Station in Washington or St. Pancras Station in London.
A more cost-effective use of the large sums of money needed to buy a city block south of the station and placing unnecessary additional tracks there would be to pursue conversion of the entirety of the existing Penn Station track plan to a "through" station as opposed to a partly "terminal" one.
The money saved could be used to build or expand regional hubs (Newark and Long Island City) as advocated by Rethink NYC. This should be done in combination with the rebuilding of the original McKim, Mead & White Penn Station thoroughly updated for 21st-century transportation needs.
In this way, Penn Station can be returned to its rightful place as one of the finest transportation centers, public spaces and architectural buildings in the world.

To the Editor:
We appreciate Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's desire to get an expansion project done at Penn Station. But first things first: A second Hudson tunnel remains the highest transportation priority for the city. New York cannot walk away from this necessity.
Further development of the Penn Station site should not be a consolation prize. At a minimum, a nine-month wait for the next presidential election may be worthwhile to ascertain what the long-term options are.
In addition, there are organizations, including ours, that look at this site as an opportunity to restore the original Penn Station, a classic design that is easily adapted for this new expanded role.
The demolition of this great New York landmark is a decadeslong error that still calls out for correction. Not to mention that any development must include a relocation of Madison Square Garden to an area that is not burdened by hundreds of thousands of daily travelers.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to get everything done right.

Texto completo: The natural world is in convulsions. It's also poised to begin again.
NASHVILLE -- For most of my adult life, I wore a red coat when the weather got cold. It started when I was 22 and searching for new outerwear during my first winter in Philadelphia. (It turned out to be my only winter in Philadelphia.) I kept being drawn to a bright red peacoat in a mail-order catalog. Perhaps it reminded me of home in Alabama, the color of the ubiquitous cardinals perched among green pine needles.
My block in urban Philadelphia offered no such reminders of home -- the birds outside my grad-school apartment were pigeons and house sparrows and starlings, gray or brown or black. I loved that red peacoat. The Philly skies were steely and low, continually threatening snow or a bitter rain, and I felt happier swaddled in a cheerful bit of living color while the world turned itself into a 19th-century engraving all around me.
But even before I left Alabama, winter was my least favorite season, a time when songbirds mostly cease their singing and small, furtive creatures find a secret place to sleep all day. Winter is the season of coats, the season of shoes. In summer I was a barefoot child in the emerald woods. In winter I sat indoors and watched it rain.
For decades afterward, I stuck with that red-coat cure for the wintertime blues, but four years ago the zipper broke on my latest red coat, and I couldn't find a replacement I liked. Turns out it didn't matter. Somewhere along the way I had stopped hating winter. I fell in love with the way the peeling bark and bare limbs of the sycamore reveal a ghost tree reaching for the sky, and the way the faded beech leaves cling to their branches and rustle in the wind like castanets. A shivering beech tree in a damp winter forest gives off its own light in the same way that dogwood blossoms in springtime look like tiny ground-borne suns.
I fell in love with the great-horned owl's haunting winter courtship song and the crows' constant, raucous conversation. One of my chief wintertime pleasures is to leave whole peanuts out for the squirrels to hide in their secret caches under the leaf litter and in the forks of trees -- and then to watch the wily blue jays digging them up and carrying them away to their own hidy-holes. I have come to welcome the gray, lowering skies because they mean I will have the trails at the park to myself.
Who could fail to love a season so beautiful and so fragile?
For far too long most of us didn't understand how fragile it truly is. But on Christmas Day it was 70 degrees in Nashville, and two weeks later, the daffodils were blooming. It's always a mistake to confuse weather for climate, but all five of the five warmest years on record have occurred since 2015, and last year was the 43rd year in a row in which temperatures across the planet measured above average. There can be no reasonable argument about what is happening here in the Anthropocene.
Nevertheless, the winter of old returned last week to pay a visit. The songbirds, mostly absent during the extended warm spell, once again swarmed our feeders. With insects no longer flying, even the bluebirds settled for sunflower hearts until I could get to the store for mealworms. When I walked the dog on a night with temperatures in the teens, my eyes kept tearing up and the tears kept freezing to the inside of my glasses.
That's when I remembered the seed catalogs. I love to sit under a blanket on a cold night and thumb through page after page of blooming flowers. The loss of a 70-year-old maple tree last summer left a new sunny place in our yard, and there's room now for a whole new pollinator bed to feed our local bees and butterflies. I picked out some promising seed varieties, and then I looked them all up to be sure they were native to Middle Tennessee. By the time I'd come up with a plan for the new flower bed that included plants of varying heights and colors and blooming times, plants that are also compatible with both the specific light and soil conditions of our yard and the specific needs of native insects, I felt as though I'd passed some kind of test.
I was so absorbed by the task of planning for spring that I completely forgot it was winter. I was imagining the scent of turned earth, the feel of damp soil. I was thinking about how nature always renews itself, given even half a chance. I was remembering my favorite part of planting: the moment when the seedling, as fragile as any lace-winged insect or hollow-boned nestling, somehow shoves the clods of earth aside and makes its way upward and outward. The way it somehow always finds the light.

Texto completo: Speaking at a prominent synagogue near Miami, the former New York City mayor spoke of his Jewish heritage and his support for Israel.
AVENTURA, Fla. -- Michael R. Bloomberg on Sunday addressed rising anti-Semitism and spoke personally of his Jewish heritage in a speech at a prominent synagogue near Miami, a sign that courting Jewish voters is core to his strategy of building support in Florida.
The speech was a rare instance of a major address by a Democratic presidential candidate this cycle that specifically confronted the rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. He spoke directly to Jewish Americans who may worry that progressive Democratic front-runners have too sharply criticized Israel or who may dislike some of President Trump's agenda but support his Israel policy.
"The violence that has always threatened Israel is rearing its ugly head here in America, with alarming frequency," Mr. Bloomberg said.
"The toxic culture the president has created is harming our relationship with Israel," he said. "If I am elected, you will never have to choose between supporting Israel and supporting our values here at home."
Mr. Bloomberg not-so-subtly sought to distinguish himself from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is also Jewish and who recently took the lead in Iowa, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers. Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, took aim not only at Mr. Sanders's Israel policy but also at his democratic socialism.
"Now, I know I'm not the only Jewish candidate running for president," Mr. Bloomberg said in his speech on Sunday afternoon, delivered in a ballroom with a roving blue spotlight and Israeli techno and music by the rapper Pitbull setting the mood. "But I am the only one who doesn't want to turn America into a kibbutz." The audience whooped.
The crowd of several hundred people included prominent business figures, former local politicians and many with personal connections to the candidate, some of whom had traveled from New York. Ari Ackerman, an owner of the Miami Marlins baseball team, was among them, having helped to rally young Jewish support for two of Mr. Bloomberg's mayoral runs.
"Quadrupling funding for religious institutions, creating a Holocaust program in schools so people are educated about what happened, bringing together the presidents of different universities to create a coalition to battle anti-Semitism -- this is what he's talking about," Mr. Ackerman said.
The speech on Jewish identity was an unusual move for Mr. Bloomberg, a secular Jew who has long not been religiously observant. He has previously turned to his Judaism in competitive campaign moments, as in his 2005 mayoral re-election campaign when he addressed Hasidic Jews in Borough Park, Brooklyn, on a stage dotted with blue balloons that read "Mike the Mensch."
While Jews make up only about 3 or 4 percent of Florida's population, they are a critical voting group in the delegate-rich swing state. As his competitors crisscross Iowa, Mr. Bloomberg has instead looked past early voting states in hopes of picking up delegates on Super Tuesday and beyond.
He delivered his words Sunday at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center, standing in front of a "United for Mike" sign, the dot of the "i" in his name replaced by a Star of David. Campaign staff members distributed an array of pins and shirts, some emblazoned with "Mishpucha for Mike" (using a Yiddish word for "family"), while platters of black-and-white cookies and rugelach were on hand nearby.
"A Jew can become president," Philip Levine, the former mayor of Miami Beach, told the crowd as he introduced the billionaire. "And, I'll tell you something, you're lucky -- it's not going to cost you money."
Aventura, a small suburban city near the beach in northeast Miami-Dade County, is known as a hub for politically active Jewish Democrats in the state.
"It is important to talk to a set of people who may not know him as well," Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said in a phone interview.
Mr. Bloomberg spoke of personal connections to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, where a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire in 2018, killing 11 congregants. He also said that while he had initially opposed the Iran deal, he opposed Mr. Trump's withdrawal from it, and promised to work to end Iran's nuclear program to protect Israel and the region.
"As president, I will always have Israel's back," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Bloomberg has also long opposed the movement of economic boycotts and sanctions against Israel known as B.D.S., or Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions.
The Democratic presidential candidates across the board have condemned anti-Semitism, especially after the recent attacks in Monsey, N.Y., when five people were stabbed in a Hasidic rabbi's home during a Hanukkah celebration and an Orthodox Jewish man was stabbed while walking to synagogue. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said his administration would devote $ 1 billion to combat violent extremism, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has a plan to fight white nationalism; both of their plans aim to fight anti-Semitism.
But the field as a whole has not addressed the specifics of anti-Semitism enough, said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League.
"We are certainly hearing about this issue more than we have before," Mr. Greenblatt said in a phone interview. But the real question candidates must address is, he said, "How do you move from rhetoric condemning anti-Semitism to real plans rooting it out?"
Many American Jews have found themselves caught in an uncomfortable tension between traditional liberal American Jewish values and Mr. Trump's alliance with Israel. Mr. Trump, who won 24 percent of Jewish voters in Florida in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center, has also been trying to strengthen his support by making anti-Semitism and backing of Israel a partisan issue.
Mr. Sanders wrote about his Jewish identity, his relatives who were murdered by Nazis and the recent rise of anti-Semitic violence in a personal essay in November for Jewish Currents, a progressive Jewish publication. Unlike Mr. Bloomberg, he criticized what he called "false accusations of anti-Semitism" by Mr. Trump against progressives and called for the end of Israel's "occupation" of Palestinians.
"We should be very clear that it is not anti-Semitic to criticize the policies of the Israeli government," he wrote. "We must also be honest about this: The founding of Israel is understood by another people in the land of Palestine as the cause of their painful displacement."
That position worries some Democratic Jews across the country. "Among the Jews I talk to, Bernie is anathema," said George Arzt, a political consultant who was press secretary to the former New York mayor Ed Koch. But Mr. Bloomberg's views, he said, have been "lesser known."
Evan Ross, a lobbyist and Democratic activist in Miami-Dade County who attended the event, said many Jews in the area had supported Mr. Trump's Israel policy, even though they disliked much else about his leadership.
"There are people who are really fearful of the possibility that our party could nominate someone more extreme like Bernie Sanders," Mr. Ross said in a phone interview. "If that happens, we might as well take Florida off the map and hand it to Donald Trump. We need a moderate."
Patricia Halfen Wexler, a Venezuelan-American who works in venture capital and lives in Miami, said Bloomberg's centrism made him well-suited to court Hispanic voters. "We're not a monolith, but Hispanics generally are much more moderate than liberals imagine we are," she said. "Seeing the trauma of what happened in Venezuela made me realize we can't be glib about thinking crazy things couldn't happen here. Bloomberg is by far the one I have the most confidence putting my trust in."
Debbie Picker, who splits her time between Westchester County and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said she was disappointed Mr. Bloomberg hadn't taken questions on Sunday and wanted to know how he planned to elevate his profile in the race.
"We pay attention because we're Jewish New Yorkers who were there for him for 12 years," she said. "But if you were to go anywhere outside of the New York Metro and Miami Metro, I don't think people know him."

Schiff, Calling President 'Vindictive,' Says He Takes Latest Tweet as a Threat

Texto completo: In an extraordinary back-and-forth between a president and a congressman, President Trump warned that Representative Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, "has not paid the price, yet."
WASHINGTON -- Representative Adam B. Schiff, the House's lead impeachment manager, accused President Trump on Sunday of trying to threaten him on Twitter and urged Republican senators to find the "moral courage to stand up" to a "wrathful and vindictive president."
Mr. Trump, writing on Twitter Sunday morning, attacked Mr. Schiff as "a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man," warning, "He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!"
It was an extraordinary back-and-forth between a member of Congress and a sitting president, coming at a turning point in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors -- the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. Mr. Schiff's comments, on the NBC program "Meet the Press," came as Mr. Trump's legal team planned to resume its defense of the president when the Senate reconvenes Monday at 1 p.m.
"Look at the president's tweets about me today saying that I should pay a price," Mr. Schiff said on "Meet the Press."
"Do you take that as a threat?" asked Chuck Todd, the show's host.
"I think it's intended to be," the congressman replied.
Mr. Schiff has been under fire from Republicans for mentioning a news report during the trial that alleges that the White House had threatened to put their heads "on a pike" if they voted to convict. He doubled down on that claim Sunday, saying that he merely meant it would require fearlessness on the part of the senators.
Once Mr. Trump's defense team wraps up its case, senators will have an opportunity to ask questions and then vote on whether to call witnesses or subpoena new documents. Unless at least four Republicans join Democrats to vote to expand the scope of the proceedings, the trial could wrap up as early as this week with Mr. Trump's expected acquittal.
At least two Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, who is running for re-election this year, and Mitt Romney of Utah, elected in 2018 -- appear to be leaning toward calling witnesses. But Mr. Trump, in an interview that aired on Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures," said doing so could be "very bad" for Republican senators who are up for re-election.
"I think it would be very bad for the Republican Party if we lost that great unity that we have right now," Mr. Trump said in the interview, which was taped at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. "Some of them are running, and I think it would be very bad for them."
Democrats have been pushing for four witnesses -- including John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, who wrote in an unpublished manuscript that the president conditioned security aid to Ukraine on investigations into Democrats -- over the strong objections of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Some Republicans are floating the idea of a witness swap in which they would call either former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or his son Hunter Biden, both of whom Mr. Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate, even though neither has direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's behavior.
Democrats have opposed such a move, and Mr. Schiff suggested on Sunday that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, should rule on that question.
"We have a very capable justice sitting right behind me who can make decisions about the materiality of witnesses," Mr. Schiff said, adding, "We trust the Supreme Court justice."
If history is any guide, Chief Justice Roberts will be reluctant to do so. When President Bill Clinton was tried in the Senate in 1999, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist used his authority sparingly, leaving most questions to the Senate to decide.
Lawmakers on both sides -- along with Alan Dershowitz, a consultant to Mr. Trump's legal team -- took to the Sunday morning talk show circuit to make the case for or against Mr. Trump. The president was impeached by the House in December on charges that he abused his oath of office and obstructed Congress by pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and then covering it up by concealing evidence from lawmakers.
Mr. Schiff and his team of prosecutors maintain that the president was trying to influence the 2020 election for his personal gain. During an abbreviated session of the Senate on Saturday, the president's team pushed back hard on that assertion, arguing that it was the Democrats who were trying to undo the results of the 2016 election -- and to interfere with the one in 2020.
"They're asking you to tear up all of the ballots all across the country on your own initiative, take that decision away from the American people," Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, said of the House managers, adding: "They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history, and we can't allow that to happen."
Mr. Dershowitz, speaking on "Fox News Sunday," backed away from an assertion he made in 1998, when Mr. Clinton was facing possible impeachment in the House, that a crime is not needed to remove a president from office. Mr. Trump's team has argued that he cannot be convicted or removed because he is not accused of violating a law -- an argument Mr. Dershowitz said he now agreed with because he had done more research.
"I've been immersing myself in dusty old books, and I've concluded that no, it has to be a crime," Mr. Dershowitz said. "That's what scholars do, that's what academics do. We do more research."
Mr. Schiff has emerged as a polarizing figure in the trial. His speech on Thursday telling lawmakers they could "not trust this president to do what is right for this country" went viral -- and earned even grudging respect from some Republicans. But on Friday, he invoked a CBS report that cited an anonymous source saying Republican senators had been warned their heads would be "on a pike" if they voted against Mr. Trump.
In so doing, Mr. Schiff angered several centrist or swing-state Republicans -- including Senators Collins and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- who are potential votes in favor of having witnesses. The congressman said Sunday that he was not intending to offend.
"It is going to be very difficult for some of these senators to stand up to this president. It really is. There's no question about it," he said. "I don't want to acknowledge it in a way that is offensive to them, but I do want to speak candidly about it -- and if this weren't an issue, there wouldn't be an issue about calling witnesses."
Democrats on Sunday came to Mr. Schiff's defense. During a conference call with reporters, Representative Sylvia Garcia, Democrat of Texas and a House impeachment manager, said Republicans should be disturbed by Mr. Trump's behavior, not Mr. Schiff's.
"If you look at this president and his behavior, he has done some very outlandish things, so it kind of surprised me that Mr. Schiff referencing a news report would be so offensive to them," she said. "The president's behavior should outrage them to the highest degree."

Texto completo: Pastor says metaphor on 'satanic pregnancies' was misinterpreted
A Florida pastor and longtime spiritual adviser to President Trump says she was speaking in metaphor when she recently prayed in a sermon for all 'satanic pregnancies' to end in miscarriage.
In video of the Jan.-5 sermon, posted by the liberal advocacy group Right Wing Watch, the Rev. Paula White, a televangelist, breathlessly calls on Jesus to 'command all satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now.'
'We declare that anything that's been conceived in satanic wombs, that it will miscarry, it will not be able to carry forth any plan of destruction, any plan of harm,' White said before an auditorium of congregants.

White's words are largely being interpreted literally " that she wishes for evil women to have miscarriages " but she shared a rare response to the criticism in which she explained that she was speaking in metaphor, praying for evil plans to be foiled in her congregants' lives.
'I don't normally respond but clearly this has been taken out of context,' White tweeted Sunday. 'I was praying [Ephesians] 6:12 that we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Anything that has been conceived by demonic plans, for it to be cancelled and not prevail in your life.'
Ephesians 6:12, according to the King James Bible translation, reads: 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.'
After watching the clip, which is less than two minutes long, André Gagné, a theological studies professor at Concordia University and an expert on the Christian right, said White was probably speaking in metaphor when she called for the miscarriages. He pointed to a book by Nigerian evangelist D.K. Olukoya that describes 'satanic pregnancies' as 'the plans that Satan has against a person's life.'
According to Gagné, 'White is commanding that Satan's plans be aborted.'
Still, many observers recoiled at White's remarks.
'So Paula White wants everyone at @WhiteHouse to know she is praying for abortion,' tweeted Jennifer Gunter, an obstetrician and gynecologist who writes a column about women's reproductive health for the New York Times.
'No pregnancies are satanic. Every child is a gift from God,' tweeted the Rev. James Martin, a prominent Jesuit priest. 'No one should ever pray for any woman to miscarry. No one should ever pray for evil or harm to befall another person. Jesus asked us to pray for our persecutors, not to curse them. To love our neighbors as ourselves.'
White did not respond to a request for comment sent Sunday morning.
The 53-year-old megachurch pastor, who recently joined the White House Office of Public Liaison as a religious adviser, delivered the remarks during a sermon in which she inveighed against a variety of forces, including anyone who sought to harm Trump.
'We come against the marine kingdom, we come against the animal kingdom,' said White, eyes closed. 'We declare that any strange winds " any strange winds that have been sent to hurt the church, sent against this nation, sent against our president, sent against myself, sent against others " we break it by the superior blood of Jesus right now.'
She also condemned 'any hex, any spell, any witchcraft, any spirit of control, any Jezebel,' and 'anything that the enemy desires through spells,' according to the footage.
Impassioned rhetoric is one of White's calling cards. She has used the same type of language in numerous rallies and public events, including a reelection rally for Trump in June.
But it is almost unheard of for a leader of an evangelical church to call for the death of fetuses in any context. The belief in the right to life and opposition to abortion rights are paramount political issues for religious conservatives, and defections from those stances are rare, even in metaphor.
An October 2018 article from Christianity Today, the country's flagship evangelical magazine, offered a list of recommendations for pastors to help couples cope with the loss of a baby. 'Grieving parents need to know that their friends and church family care about them,' the article read. A post last year on the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association website also offered supportive words for women who have miscarried.
Miscarriages are the most common type of pregnancy loss, occurring in 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies. The causes can vary: chromosomal abnormalities, infections, substance abuse. In the United States, medical professionals define a miscarriage as the death of an embryo or fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy.
The loss of a fetus after the 20th week is a stillbirth.
White has been in Trump's orbit for years, sticking close to him as he has embraced the evangelical movement, an essential part of his support base.
The pair first spoke in the early 2000s, when Trump called her with glowing reviews of her televised sermon, The Washington Post Magazine has reported. Focus on the Family founder James Dobson later credited White as having 'personally led [Trump] to Christ.'
White said she was aware of Trump's presidential ambitions long before he ran. She told The Post in 2017 that Trump reached out to her in 2011 for advice on a White House bid. 'I don't feel it's the right timing,' she said she told him.
When he did decide to run, White was involved with the campaign, at one point helping orchestrate a meeting with hundreds of evangelical leaders. And when Trump was inaugurated, White was one of six clergy members who spoke at the ceremony.
In October, she joined the White House in an official capacity, advising the president's Faith and Opportunity Initiative and handling outreach to religious groups.

Texto completo: Alleges Trump directly
tied withholding Ukraine aid to probe of Bidens
Congressional Democrats called for former national security adviser John Bolton to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial following a new report that the president told Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it aided investigations into the Bidens.
The New York Times reported Sunday evening that in last summer's conversation, Trump directly tied the holdup of nearly $400 million in military assistance to the investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. That is according to an unpublished manuscript of Bolton's forthcoming book, the Times said.
The book, 'The Room Where It Happened,' is scheduled for publication March 17, but a White House review could attempt to delay its publication or block some of its contents.
Two people familiar with the book, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the project, confirmed that it details Trump tying aid to the desire for Biden probes and details a number of conversations about Ukraine that he had with Trump and key advisers, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They said Bolton is ready to testify in the Senate impeachment trial.
In a joint statement, the seven House impeachment managers called the report 'explosive' and urged the Senate, controlled by Republicans, to agree to call Bolton as a witness in Trump's trial, which kicks off its second full week on Monday. Bolton has said that he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed.
'The Senate trial must seek the full truth and Mr. Bolton has vital information to provide,' the managers said in a statement Sunday. 'There is no defensible reason to wait until his book is published, when the information he has to offer is critical to the most important decision senators must now make " whether to convict the president of impeachable offenses.'
Trump is on trial, facing two charges " abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The assertion from Bolton could undermine one core defense that has repeatedly been laid out by Trump, his defenders and his legal team: that there was no explicit quid pro quo involved when the administration withheld the military assistance, as well as a White House visit coveted by Ukraine.
The White House has said that Trump's request for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections, was because he was interested in rooting out corruption and that he did nothing improper.
The president's legal defense team is expected to mount a vigorous defense on Monday when they deliver a full day of arguments against the impeachment charges.
The revelation from the Bolton book was certain to roil the dynamics of the trial this week, when the Senate was expected to face a critical vote on whether to allow witnesses at all.
Charles Cooper, a lawyer for Bolton, said he submitted the manuscript to the National Security Council's records management division on Dec. 30 for a standard review process to examine potentially classified information. Cooper said they believed that the book manuscript did not include any classified material and that its contents would not be shared with officials outside that review process.
'It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,' Cooper said in the statement.
Sarah Tinsley, a spokeswoman for Bolton, added: 'The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period.'
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and many Senate Republicans would prefer the Senate avoid witnesses, but at least four GOP senators are seen as potential votes for favoring more testimony: Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.).
Romney and Collins have already indicated that they are likely to support hearing from witnesses and getting more evidence, and Romney has also said that he would like to hear from Bolton.
'The odds of deposition for new witnesses is certainly rising dramatically,' one senior Republican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess party dynamics, said Sunday evening after the publication of the Times report.
'John Bolton has the evidence. It's up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump's actions testify in the Senate trial,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a tweet.
Earlier Sunday, Trump escalated his attacks on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), issuing what appears to be a veiled threat against the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
'Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man,' Trump tweeted Sunday morning. 'He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!'
Schiff is the lead impeachment manager in the Senate trial.
Schiff responded in an interview on NBC News's 'Meet the Press,' saying he believes that Trump's remarks were intended as a threat.
'This is a wrathful and vindictive president; I don't think there's any doubt about it,' Schiff said in the interview. 'And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today, saying that I should 'pay a price.' '
'Do you take that as a threat?' host Chuck Todd asked.
'I think it's intended to be,' Schiff replied.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said it was 'ridiculous' for Schiff to claim that Trump was threatening him. In an appearance on Fox News Channel's 'Media Buzz,' she accused the California Democrat of 'grandstanding,' although she acknowledged that she had not had an opportunity to ask Trump what he meant by the tweet.
'I think he means . . . [Schiff] hasn't yet paid the price with the voters,' Grisham said.
She also echoed Trump's attack earlier Sunday on Schiff, saying: 'I mean, it seems he's having a little bit of a mental issue when you sit on the floor for hours and hours and hours. He's obsessed with this president and trying to take him down.'
Democrats contend that Trump has continued to publicly solicit foreign interference in U.S. elections and that the integrity of the 2020 race is at risk. The president fired back Sunday by leveling the same accusation at his political opponents.
'The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before,' he said in a tweet.
Some Republicans on Sunday defended Trump's remarks about Schiff. In an interview on CNN's 'State of the Union,' Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he was not troubled by Trump's declaration that Schiff 'has not paid the price.'
'I don't think it's a death threat. I don't think he's encouraging a death threat,' Lankford said.
Host Jake Tapper responded by saying that 'people who are supporters of the president have heard his rhetoric and then actually tried to bomb and kill politicians and the media.'
This prompted Lankford to refer to the 2017 congressional baseball shooting that targeted Republicans and injured several people, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).
'So to be able to say the president's trying to be able to spur this on would be able to say Democrats were trying to spur on the killing' of Republicans, Lankford said.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who is also an impeachment manager, called Trump's tweet about Schiff 'really unfortunate' and said the president has said things before 'that seem threatening to people.'
'He really ought to get a grip and be a little more presidential,' she said on 'State of the Union.'
In a tweet later Sunday morning, Trump also took aim at Todd, accusing the 'Meet the Press' host of holding a 'softball interview' with Schiff and 'never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress, where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President!'
Both sides continue to spar over the question of whether the Senate trial will include witnesses. Some key Senate Republicans, already hesitant on the issue, became even more so over the weekend after Schiff referred to a CBS News report in which an anonymous Trump ally was quoted as having warned lawmakers, 'Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike.'

Texto completo: The Grammy Awards' tribute to Prince Sunday night left fans with mixed feelings.
Almost four years after Prince's death from an accidental overdose in April 2016, the Recording Academy honored his legacy on music's biggest night with Usher belting out a medley of the artist's biggest songs.
While Usher sang along to Prince's greatest hits, including "Kiss" and "When Doves Cry," veteran musician Sheila E. accompanied him on drums and Grammy-nominated singer FKA twigs performed on a pole and danced onstage.
After the performance, fans were split. While some praised Usher's vocals and FKA twigs' dance moves, others criticized the performance, upset that Usher was chosen to perform and complaining that FKA twigs was reduced to a side act.
"Usher has slayed the Janet MTV ICON honor, that MJ special, and now this Prince tribute. He gets nothing but my respect," @trapcry tweeted.
Grammys 2020: Kobe Bryant tributes, Demi Lovato's teary return and more must-know moments
"Even Prince would be proud of Usher tonight," @ThatEricAlper tweeted.

Grammys 2020: The winners list
Others weren't loving Usher's rendition of Prince's classics.
"Usher this ain’t it. Prince is rolling around in his grave," @da1don tweeted.
"a prince tribute and the person you call is usher? I guess. . . " @aaliyahbic tweeted.
"It’s a valiant effort, but no one does Prince like Prince," @LermanScott tweeted.
"You can almost hear prince up there rolling his eyes right now yo," @OfficiallyIce tweeted.
"Seeing Usher give tribute to Prince, just reminded me that there will never be another Prince," @BenBoogie22 tweeted.
FKA twigs responded in a tweet Sunday night after her performance: "of course i wanted to sing at the grammys. i wasn’t asked this time but hopefully in the future. none the less what an honour. congratulations to all winners x. "
"She didn’t want to sing," Sheila E. told USA TODAY backstage. "First she wanted to, but then she didn’t want to when we ran through it because she didn’t have a (microphone) pack and (in-ear monitors), so she couldn’t hear. And she would rather have danced – which is what we asked her as well. She chose not to; she said ‘No, I’m OK. ’ "
Grammys 2020: Brutally honest reviews of all the performances
Earlier in the day, FKA twigs' "Cellophane" lost out when the 2020 Grammy for best music video went to Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus' "Old Town Road. "
"imagine making the decision to not let FKA Twigs sing anything at all," @robsheff tweeted.
"FKA Twigs has never been less utilized effectively," @speriod tweeted.
"So you're telling me FKA Twigs is here to be a backup dancer for USHER??" @JudiceSay tweeted.
"when FKA twigs did that stunning pole dance but didn’t sing a word during that tribute," @moonlightwonbp tweeted with a meme that read "Let them speak. "
"Not a fan of FKA Twigs being reduced to a pole dancer while Usher sings, even if it is a Prince tribute," New York Times fashion director and critic Vanessa Friedman tweeted.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A draft of a forthcoming book from former national security adviser John Bolton alleges that President Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The development threatened to throw into turmoil the careful choreography of the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bolton's claim, which was reported by the New York Times and confirmed by a lawyer for Mr. Bolton, goes to the heart of Democrats' impeachment inquiry and contradicts the White House's argument that the decision to hold up nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine wasn't related to the president's push for investigations there. Democrats have said the president abused his power by leveraging aid approved by Congress to get a foreign leader to undertake actions that would benefit him politically.
Mr. Trump late Sunday evening denied Mr. Bolton's allegations. "I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens," the president tweeted. "In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."
Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, said he sent a copy of his manuscript to the National Security Council in December so it could be reviewed for classified information, adding that he did so on the assurance that the contents of the book wouldn't be disclosed to anyone not involved in that process.
"It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript," Mr. Cooper said.
News of the manuscript's claims comes on the eve of the defense team's second session on the Senate floor, in which it was expected to present the bulk of its argument. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment on Mr. Bolton's description of his conversation with the president.
Democrats immediately intensified their calls for the Senate to vote in favor of calling more witnesses later this week, chief among them Mr. Bolton, who has said he would testify if he were subpoenaed by the Senate. Details of what Mr. Bolton might say could sway the four Republican senators who have said they are on the fence about the vote in favor of more testimony. If all Democrats vote in favor, they would need four Republicans to join them for the vote to pass.
"It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton... as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Democrats have also wanted to bring in acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two other witnesses.
The White House has sought to block testimony by Mr. Bolton and the other witnesses on the Democrats' list.
Mr. Trump said in a news conference last week that testimony by Mr. Bolton would be a "national security problem" and added: "I don't know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not."
Mr. Bolton's book also includes details of cabinet officials' discussions about Ukraine and about Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney who led the campaign for investigations in Ukraine, according to the New York Times. Mr. Bolton wrote that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said privately that Mr. Giuliani's claims that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt weren't true, and that he shared his concerns about Mr. Giuliani with Attorney General William Barr after the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to work with both Messrs. Giuliani and Barr on investigations, the Times said. Mr. Bolton wrote that he told the attorney general Mr. Trump had invoked him on the call.
A Justice Department official familiar with the matter said Mr. Bolton did call Mr. Barr to express concerns about Mr. Giuliani and his shadow foreign policy in Ukraine. It wasn't clear what, if anything, the attorney general did with that information.
Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec denied that Mr. Barr learned of the Ukraine call from Mr. Bolton. The department has repeatedly said he learned about it in mid-August.
The alleged conversation between the president and Mr. Bolton also sheds more light on an exchange that took place later in August between Mr. Bolton and Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.). According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bolton urged him to call Mr. Trump directly about the Ukraine aid matter. Mr. Johnson spoke to Mr. Trump on Aug. 31 and asked the president if the aid to Ukraine was contingent on new investigations by Ukraine. Mr. Trump responded by vehemently denying that that was the case, Mr. Johnson said.
News of Mr. Bolton's claims shook the White House, where several top advisers hadn't read the manuscript. As of late Sunday evening, the press office hadn't yet decided whether to issue a statement on the matter.
In their first day of arguments on Saturday , the president's lawyers argued for two hours that Democrats had failed to make a compelling case and were relying on circumstantial evidence to conclude that the Republican president had conditioned aid to Ukraine on investigations that could benefit him politically. Mr. Bolton's manuscript would provide a first-person account of the president doing precisely that.
Among other matters, the president's team was expected to argue on Monday that Mr. Trump was right to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a Democratic candidate for president, and his son, Hunter, the person familiar with the discussions said. They will argue that it was corrupt for the younger Mr. Biden to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father as vice president was overseeing U.S. efforts to combat corruption in Ukraine. No evidence has emerged of wrongdoing by either Mr. Biden or his son, though Hunter Biden has said serving on the company's board while his father worked on anticorruption efforts showed poor judgment.
Republican lawmakers have echoed the president's calls for an investigation into the Bidens, which Democrats say amount to an effort by the White House to enlist a foreign country's help in interfering in this year's election.
The president's team plans to present arguments Monday beginning at 1 p.m. EST and likely wrapping up by about 8 p.m., according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr will likely speak Monday, the person said. Depending on how the session goes, the team may not use its session on Tuesday, the last day it has to make arguments before senators begin their questioning.
If the Senate votes against calling more witnesses, it would proceed soon afterward to a vote on whether to convict or acquit the president. Mr. Trump faces little prospect of conviction, which requires a two-thirds majority of senators to remove him from office.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think each party is utilizing the impeachment trial in the coming presidential election? Join the conversation below.
The president told aides he was pleased with his team's presentation Saturday, but over the weekend he lobbed insulting nicknames at top Democrats. He was in particular rebuked by Democrats on Sunday for a tweet he issued about Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager. The president said of Mr. Schiff, "he has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country."
Mr. Schiff on NBC called the president "wrathful and vindictive" and added: "I don't think there's any doubt about it. And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today."
Separate from the trial, new information has continued to emerge about the president's dealings with Ukraine. On Saturday, a lawyer for Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Giuliani, released a 90-minute recording that appeared to show Mr. Trump ordering the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine at a small 2018 dinner with donors.
Mr. Trump has denied knowing Mr. Parnas, who is under indictment for alleged campaign-finance violations, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
The former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, testified during the impeachment inquiry about her removal, which Democrats argued was designed to clear the way for the Ukraine pressure campaign. Republicans portrayed her testimony as largely irrelevant to the impeachment inquiry.

Texto completo: LONDON - London's police department said Friday that it would begin using facial recognition technology in the city to identify people off the street in real time with video cameras, adopting a level of surveillance that is rare outside of China.
The decision is a major development in the use of a technology that has set off a worldwide debate about the balance between security and privacy. Police departments contend that the software gives them a technological edge to catch criminals that may otherwise avoid detection. Critics say the technology is an invasion of privacy and is being rolled out without adequate public discussion.
Britain has been at the forefront of the debate. In a country where CCTV cameras line the streets, police surveillance has traditionally been more accepted than in other Western countries.
The technology that London plans to deploy goes beyond many of the facial recognition systems used elsewhere, which match a photo against a database to identify a person. The new systems, created by the company NEC, attempt to identify people on a police watch list in real time with security cameras, giving officers a chance to stop them in the specific location.
Under pressure to address rising crime, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the technology would help quickly identify an J apprehend suspects and help "tackle serious crime, including serious violence, gun and knife crime, child sexual exploitation and help protect the vulnera ole."
"Every day, our police officers are briefed abcut suspects they should look out for," NickEphgrave, assistant commissioner of the police department, said in the statement. Live facial recognition, he said, "improves the effectiveness of this tact."
"As a modern police force, I believe that we have a duty to use new technologies to keep people safe in London," he added.
Already widespread in China, facial recognition is gaining traction in Western countries. An investigation by The New York Times this month found that more than 600 law enforcement agencies are using a facial recognition system by the company Clearview AI. According to researchers at Georgetown University, cities including New York, Chicago, Detroit and Washingxr. have at least piloted tne use of the re altime systems.
Use of the facial recognition technology has generated a backlash. S an Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley in California, along with Somerville and Brookline in Massachusetts, have banned its use.
Privacy groups immediately criticized London's decision and vowed to take legal action to try to stop its deployment.
"This decision rep resents an enormous expansion of the surveillance state and a serious tnreat to civil liberties in the U.K.," said Silkie Caile, director of Big Brother Watch, a London-based group that has been fighting the use of facial recognition. "This :s a breathtaking assault on our rights, and we will challenge it."
The Metropolitan Police said it would be transparent about deploying the technology. Officers will post signs and hand out leaflets when the cameras are in use.
Researchers have found problems with many facial recognition systems, including trouble accurately identifying people who are net white men. C vil liberties groups point to flaws in the technology as a reason it should nőtte deployed, arguing it will lead to constant surveillance and hinder free movement.

Ibram X. Kendi and the call for equality

Texto completo: NC STATE COMMUNICATIONS
Author Ibram X. Kendi recently visited North Carolina State University as part of the university's Martin Luther King Jr. campus commemoration events.
In 2016, Kendi became the youngest winner of the National Book Award for nonfiction for his first book, "Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America." Still just 37, he is one of America's preeminent racetheory scholars, and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2019. That same year, The Root listed him as the 15 th most influential African American between the ages of 25 and 45, and the most influential college professor. Kendi's most recent work, "How to Be an Antiracist," a New York Times bestseller, examines how perceived racial inequalities shape public policy and play out in personal, social and academic arenas.
Addressing a full house in Talley Student Union's Stewart Theatre, Kendi spoke first about common misnomers given to King - that he was "colorblind" and an assimilationist - and then discussed the challenges facing racial equity in America. Kendi also addressed audience questions submitted via text. "Typically, when I speak about Dr. King, I spend most of my time challenging widespread myths about him," he said. "Over the years, Americans have taken who they are from a racial standpoint and put it on King. But he had a very clear set of ideas."
Kendi argued that Americans' collective memory freezes King on Aug. 28, 1963, the date of his "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. In textbooks and elsewhere, that is seemingly the only King there is. Kendi noted that King lived another four years and would eventually go on to say, in an interview with NBC News, that "my dream has turned into a nightmare."
When he made that statement, King was referencing the steady march of racist policies that - while simultaneous with the march of different aspects of racial progress - would produce mass incarceration, unequal education and housing, health care inequality and more. "But," said Kendi, "we're more comfortable with 'I Have a Dream' than we are with the complicated King, and with King's 'nightmare.'"
In his final years, King became a champion of the Poor People's Campaign, which he started in 1967 at the suggestion of Marion Wright, then director of the NAACP's Legal Defense and Educational Fund in Jackson, Mississippi. Beyond desegregation and the right to vote, King understood that economic security was essential for full participation in American society.
"He saw that it doesn't matter if you have access to a restaurant if you can't afford the meal," Kendi said. Prior to his assassination in 1968, King broadened his horizon and pushed for nonviolent protest against a number of issues, including the Vietnam War.
Pivoting to the topic of his latest book, Kendi argued that the vast majority of people believe themselves to be not racist even when they might support racist policies. "Americans are in deep denial about how racist our institutions are. We use King to escape that denial. And the sound of that denial is, 'I'm not racist.'"
Our common belief that we are all "not racist," posits Kendi, is one of the major roadblocks to improving systems and laws that unfairly benefit one group over another. We can't see - or refuse to see - what's wrong with these systems because we're more comfortable believing there's something inherently flawed about the people penalized by them. Cited as one example: African Americans make up just under 13% of our nation's population, but they represent over 40% of those in prison.
Kendi was initially afraid to share his own past with racist ideas, and Antiracist opens with an unflinching recollection that still embarrasses him. As a high school senior, he made a speech that suggested black Americans were to blame for their own problems. It was met with enthusiastic applause by the mostly black audience. Further reflection led him to believe his speech made use of racist ideas and rhetoric to gain that reaction. In fact, he says some of the most revered African American thinkers and speakers have unthinkingly fallen back on racist rhetoric.
John Robinson-Miller IV, program coordinator for the African American Cultural Center, says bringing Kendi to campus was part of a larger vision for the year ahead. "We looked at not only who we wanted to bring in for the MLK commemoration, but what we wanted to say. We're very intentional about critically analyzing the issues of the [African] diaspora," he said. "How could we introduce the concept of antiracism, and what does that look like? It's easy to get caught up in 'what does this mean for me personally?' versus 'what does this mean for society?'"

US reporter freed; deportation likely
JAKARTA — An American environmental journalist accused of violating the terms of his visa has been freed after three days in jail and is likely to be deported soon, a top Indonesian government minister said. The journalist, Philip Jacobson, 30, who works for the nonprofit news site Mongabay and is known for exposing environmental damage and corporate misconduct, was arrested on the island of Borneo after attending a public meeting between officials and indigenous leaders. Immigration officials said he had been conducting journalistic activities while on a business visa, which was not permitted, and that he faced up to five years in prison. The minister for political, legal, and security affairs met on Friday with the US ambassador and told reporters afterward that the case would be handled as an administrative matter punishable by deportation, not as a crime. (New York Times)
Afghanistan
Killing of teen, father investigated
KABUL — The Afghan government said on Saturday that it was investigating the fatal shootings by Afghan soldiers of a girl and her father in Kandahar province, amid complaints by residents that the security forces have for years been accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuses. The most basic details about the girl, named Naza, were conflicting. She was either 10, 13 or 17 years of age, according to different versions by at least three officials. One official said she had been out shepherding a herd of sheep near their home in Shah Wali Kot District in Kandahar when she was shot. Khalil Ahmad Mujahid, a member of Parliament from Kandahar, said she had been in the fields near her home collecting vegetables when the soldiers had opened fire. When her father carried her body to the gates of the army base in the village in southern Afghanistan the next day, he, too, ended up dead, officials said. Officials have remained tight-lipped about even the most basic details, once again raising concerns about a pattern of lack of accountability after Afghan forces have been accused of abuses against civilians during the years-long war. A spokesman for Afghanistan's Defense Ministry said it was looking into the episode and could not provide details. (New York Times)
Iran
Negotiations with US still possible
Iran is not ruling out negotiations with the United States even after an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the country's foreign minister said in an interview released Saturday. Mohammed Javad Zarif told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine that he would “never rule out the possibility that people will change their approach and recognize the realities," in an interview conducted Friday in Tehran.

Pompeo says reporter he berated lied first

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lashed out Saturday at an NPR reporter who accused him of shouting expletives at her after she asked him in an interview about Ukraine. In a direct and personal attack, Pompeo said the journalist had “lied" to him and he called her conduct “shameful."
NPR said it stood by Mary Louise Kelly's reporting.
Pompeo claimed in a statement that the incident was “another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt" President Trump and his administration. Pompeo, a former CIA director and Republican congressman from Kansas who is one of Trump's closest allies in the Cabinet, asserted, "It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity."
It is extraordinary for a secretary of state to make such a personal attack on a journalist, but he is following the lead of Trump, who has repeatedly derided what he calls “fake news" and ridiculed individual reporters.
In Friday's interview, Pompeo responded testily when Kelly asked him about Ukraine and specifically whether he defended or should have defended Marie Yovanovitch, the US ambassador in Kyiv whose ouster figured in Trump's impeachment.
“I have defended every State Department official," he said. "We've built a great team. The team that works here is doing amazing work around the world. . . . I've defended every single person on this team."
This has been a sensitive point for Pompeo. As a Trump loyalist, he has been publicly silent as the president and his allies have disparaged the nonpartisan career diplomats, including Yovanovitch, who have testified in the impeachment hearings.
After the NPR interview, Kelly said she was taken to Pompeo's private living room, where he shouted at her “for about the same amount of time as the interview itself," using the “F-word" repeatedly. She said he was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.
Pompeo, in his statement, did not deny shouting at Kelly and did not apologize. Instead, he accused her of lying to him when setting up the interview, which he apparently expected would be limited to questions about Iran, and for supposedly agreeing not to discuss the post-interview meeting.
Kelly said Pompeo asked whether she thought Americans cared about Ukraine and if she could find the country on a map.
“I said yes, and he called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing," she said in discussing the encounter on “All Things Considered." “I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away. He said, 'People will hear about this."'

Biden picks up another endorsement in Iowa
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa is endorsing former vice president Joe Biden, giving him another prominent backer with just over a week until the state's caucuses.
Axne, a freshman Democrat who unseated a Republican incumbent, hails from the kind of swing district that was key to the party's takeover of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and will be crucial to its continued control.
Biden has now been endorsed by two of Iowa's three Democrats in Congress.

Democrats pour into Iowa for last-minute push

Texto completo: BY BILL BARROW
The Associated Press
DES MOINES - Freed momentarily from the Senate's impeachment trial, several presidential candidates high-tailed it to Iowa on Saturday for a last-minute blitz of campaigning before the state's caucuses kick off the battle for the Democratic nomination.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota planned to hold town halls, rallies and concerts across Iowa on Saturday to keep their supporters motivated heading into the final stretch of the caucus campaign. They'll join former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who don't have Senate obligations and have already spent much of the past week in Iowa.
The burst of campaigning comes as the contest for the Democratic nomination enters a critical - and volatile - phase. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday showed Sanders with a slight edge over the other leading candidates, but the race remains competitive. Several polls show Biden, Buttigieg and Warren are still front-runners.
"There's still plenty of time for movement," said Kurt Meyer, chairman of the Tri-County Democrats in northern Iowa. "Every part of the ground game counts."
Stuck in Washington for much of the past week, the senators in the race have flooded Iowa and other early voting states with top-shelf surrogates - rock star lawmakers, former Cabinet members, celebrities and spouses. The stand-ins aren't a guaranteed way to sustain excitement or win votes, but the campaigns see it as the best way to maximize their reach in a nominating fight that could turn on the narrowest of margins in Iowa and other early states.
Biden isn't bound to the Senate like some of his rivals, but he must navigate the trial nonetheless. House Democrats' charges that Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress are rooted in the president pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden's foreign policy duties in Ukraine as vice president and his son Hunter's personal business dealings there.
Trump's defense team began its defense of the president on Saturday, and some Republicans are determined to frame the matter more around Biden than around the president.
After a brief trip to New Hampshire, the second state to vote in Democrats' nominating process, Biden planned to return to Iowa on Saturday evening and intended to remain in the state until caucus day. He began the day announcing an endorsement from U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne, who joined her fellow first-term congresswoman from Iowa, Abby Finkenauer, in backing Biden.
Ahead of his arrival in Iowa, Sanders sent progressive icon and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to the state. She addressed dozens of Sanders volunteers at one of his field offices inside a strip mall, before heading out to canvass in Cedar Rapids. She promised to wear her green "Green New Deal" baseball cap to join them on a clear but cold Saturday, amid snow drifts that piled along plowed roads and melting ice.
"We are here to make a revolution that lasts," Ocasio-Cortez said.
She was set to join Sanders and filmmaker Michael Moore for a Saturday night rally in Ames.
Sanders' wife, Jane, and actor Danny Glover were campaigning on his behalf in Nevada, which hosts the third nominating contest. Jane Sanders predicted a strong showing in the early voting states.
"I think we'll win Iowa," she told about 40 staff and volunteers. "I think we'll win New Hampshire. And then I think it's up to you whether we win Nevada. But it looks great."
Warren has Julian Castro, the former Obama housing secretary and onetime presidential candidate, in Nevada. U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., another star of the House freshman class like Ocasio-Cortez, is in South Carolina.
The Senate adjourned about noon EST Saturday, giving the presidential candidates time to return to Iowa for late-afternoon and evening events. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., was going to New Hampshire.
The weekend is critical for them, depending on how many more days the trial will extend this coming week. Warren's campaign on Saturday hit prospective donors with a frank plea ahead of an "important January fundraising deadline."
Fall short of her financial targets, the campaign wrote, and "we risk having to scale back our advertising plan during the most critical period of this election."

A black eye for the Grammys

Texto completo: This was the year when the oft-maligned Grammy Awards were going to get it right. But an unexpected thing happened on the way to crowning Lizzo -- or Billie Eilish -- as queen of Music's Biggest Night.
The Recording Academy's new CEO -- and first woman boss -- was placed on administrative leave for misconduct just 10 days before Sunday's show.
The official explanation is that Deborah Dugan allegedly bullied a senior female staffer who was the previous CEO's longtime assistant.
The New York Times reported that Dugan, who had been tasked with making improvements in the slow-to-change Recording Academy, was apparently too aggressive in overhauling an organization long dominated by older white men.
Before being placed on leave, Dugan filed a complaint with the academy's HR department raising concerns about sexual harassment, conflicts of interest, voting and
financial irregularities, and excessive payments to law firms by the 63-year-old nonprofit.
With lawyers for all parties volleying charges and denials back and forth for the past several days, this behind-the-scenes intrigue sounds like the making of a prime-time miniseries that could be more compelling than 3 ½ hours of the Grammy Awards themselves.
Under Dugan, the Grammys were poised to become more inclusive. Women accounted for only 26% of the academy's voting membership as of last summer. The organization pledged to recruit 2,500 new women members by 2025, as well as more young people and voters of color. For this year's process, 1,186 new voting members signed up -- 49% of them women and 51% age 39 and younger.
This year's nominations certainly seem more inclusive. The leading nominees are Lizzo, 31, with eight and Eilish, 18, and openly gay rapper Lil Nas X, 20, with six each. All the finalists for album of the year are 40 or younger, and women hold five of the eight nods in that category.
Dugan, 61, a white woman, has been replaced by a black man as interim CEO: Harvey Mason Jr., 51, chairman of the academy's board of trustees, is a record producer known for working with Chris Brown and on such movies as the "Pitch Perfect" franchise.
History of Grammy gaffes
Founded in 1957 by a handful of record-label honchos, the Recording Academy has long been viewed as a stodgy, myopic institution dominated by older male executives and lawyers often out of touch with the current music world.
The Grammys have been harshly criticized for giving top prizes to safe, rather than smart, choices. For example, in 2018, Bruno Mars took album of the year for "24K Magic" instead of the more innovative "Melodrama" by Lorde and "Damn" by Kendrick Lamar.
Some choices have been so glaringly misguided that Adele apologized to Beyonc in 2017 for grabbing best album for "25" over "Lemonade." Macklemore similarly apologized via Instagram that he was not worthy of beating Kendrick Lamar for best new artist in 2014.
The list of Grammy gaffes is long, perhaps none more egregious than Lionel Richie's "All Night Long" being named album of the year in 1985 over Prince's "Purple Rain" and Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A."
In 1995, the Grammys implemented changes after the out-of-touch choice of Tony Bennett's "MTV Unplugged" for top album. The Recording Academy decided to enlist an anonymous blue-ribbon panel to determine the finalists for the so-called "Big Four" categories -- best new artist and song, record and album of the year -- to circumvent block voting by record-company staffers and other improprieties.
In 2019, the finalists in those categories were expanded from five to eight. Of course, that could mean the winner might receive as little as 13% of the votes cast. Dugan reportedly was exploring a ranked voting system like the Academy Awards uses for best picture.
In any case, Dugan -- a former record-label lawyer who most recently ran the AIDS-fighting RED organization started by U2's Bono -- was in the process of giving the Grammys an overdue makeover.
She'd already planned to forgo the CEO's speech during the ceremonies, a moment that her predecessor, Neil Portnow, often used to dourly lobby for arts education or music-related issues before Congress.
Few women in industry
Not only does the academy's membership have a gender imbalance but so does the music industry overall.
"In 40 years in the music business, I've maybe worked with three women engineers, and as far as women producers, there was just me when I produced myself," said four-time Grammy winner Rosanne Cash, who is nominated this year for best American roots song. "The changes that need to be made are systemic. Making women heads of major labels and [their talent departments], not just in publicity and lower and mid-level positions."
In 2018, when Portnow was criticized for presenting only one award to a woman during the lengthy televised ceremonies, he stirred anger by saying that women needed to "step up."
Bouncing back from his faux pas, Portnow made noticeable changes last year, enlisting Alicia Keys as host and front-loading the first hour with women performers.
The Recording Academy also convened a task force chaired by lawyer Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama's former chief of staff. It recommended, among other initiatives, diversifying the organization's board of trustees (which was 65% male and 65% white) and the influential committees that review nominations.
Dugan was definitely stepping up. Ads for Sunday's Grammys have promoted women performers -- including Eilish, Lizzo, Camila Cabello, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato -- over men such as the Jonas Brothers.
The show's producer, Ken Ehrlich, 76, who has been involved with the Grammys for 40 years, will step down after this year. His signature contribution has been orchestrating unexpected collaborations such as Elton John and Eminem, or Prince and Beyonc. The only pairing CBS has touted this year is an obvious one: lovebirds Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani.
"I love to see great combinations that we could never see at a concert," said pop-culture junkie Lori Barghini, a My Talk 107.1 FM radio personality. "The performances have always made the Grammys the most fun awards show to watch. I don't care who wins."
Barghini and other Grammy viewers will likely see more changes in 2021 with new executive producer Ben Winston, 34, an Emmy winner who has produced the Tonys and the Brits (England's answer to the Grammys) as well as "Late Late Show With James Corden" and a One Direction movie.
Regardless of what has gone wrong behind the scenes, 2020 could end up as the year the Grammys at least got the prizes right.

Our Grammy predictions
Album of the year: The albums by Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Lana Del Rey and Ariana Grande all made my best-of-2019 list. Lizzo's ubiquitousness may give her an edge, but I'm predicting that the striking accomplishment of Eilish -- 16 at the time she recorded her bedroom pop classic -- will deservedly prevail.
Record of the year: You can't find a more unlikely story than Lil Nas X's record-setting hit "Old Town Road." He bought the beat for $100 online and got a Nashville-credibility boost with a remix contribution by Billy Ray Cyrus. But Lizzo's "Truth Hurts" is 100% the winner.
Best new artist: Because of her youth and the fact that she actually is brand new, Eilish deserves it. But, even though Lizzo has issued three albums, our former homegirl and her music have been everywhere in the past year; she takes the trophy.
Song of the year: Sentiment sometimes rules the Grammys, which is why I'm predicting a prize for Tanya Tucker's collaboration with Brandi Carlile, Bring My Flowers Now," a terrific pre-funeral wish.
Best alternative album: Vampire Weekend triumphs for the adventurous "Father of the Bride."
Best urban contemporary album: Because we love Lizzo, it's "Cuz I Love You."
Best rap album: In a less than stellar year for this category, Tyler the Creator's "Igor" was the most creative album.
Best country album: The sentimental vote gives the trophy to Tanya Tucker for "While I'm Livin'," though I think the Pistol Annies merit it for "Interstate Gospel."
Best Americana album: This boils down to two singer-songwriters not originally from America -- England's Yola and Minnesota's J.S. Ondara, who was born and raised in Kenya. Yola has the momentum for "Walk Through Fire."
Best compilation soundtrack: "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" was a hoot with its hodgepodge of music circa 1969. And who couldn't appreciate "Rocketman" and what Beyonc did for "Lion King"? But this Grammy goes to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper for "A Star Is Born."

Texto completo: Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, recently said they will step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family.
Queen Elizabeth II was caught off guard by the couple’s decision and immediately scheduled a crisis family meeting to discuss the matter, according to The Associated Press.
The duke and duchess of Sussex said they will work to become financially independent while splitting their time between England and North America.
But they won’t be doing it in an RV, according to Snopes.com.
Following their announcement, a fake photo of the royal pair standing in front of an RV camper began making the rounds on social media, Snopes said.
The doctored image is actually a composite of at least three different photos, including a picture of an RV and a photo of a casually dressed couple manipulated to incorporate Meghan’s and Harry’s heads.
According to Snopes, some RV dealers have used the photo in advertising on Facebook accompanied by captions such as, "This nice, young couple from England certainly knows where to shop when it comes to buying a camper" and "We have just sold our first seasonal touring pitch of 2020 to a lovely couple who just want to get away from the hustle and bustle."
Pelosi’s custom pens didn’t cost $2,000 each House Speaker Nancy Pelosi used about 30 pens to sign her name to the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
The custom-made black pens, featuring Pelosi’s signature and used during the Jan. 15 event, were laid out in two small trays, according to The Associated Press. She used each pen to compose a piece of her signature and then handed them out to House prosecutors and committee chairmen who had taken part in the impeachment proceedings.
Pelosi was criticized by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham for not appearing somber as she gave the pens away "like prizes" during the proceedings.
"Nancy Pelosi’s souvenir pens served up on silver platters to sign the sham articles of impeachment," Grisham said on Twitter.
But false criticism appeared on Facebook in a post that greatly exaggerated the cost of the pens, according to PolitiFact.com.
"$2,025 per pen paid for by taxpayers," the post said. "Now we know why (Pelosi) delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate ... she was waiting for her gold-plated impeachment pens."
The pens, however, cost less than $15 each, Pelosi’s chief of staff Drew Hammill told PolitiFact.
According to a recent Statement of Disbursements of the House, a quarterly report that tracks lawmakers’ spending, the speaker’s office spent nearly $29,000 on supplies and materials from July 1 to Sept. 30, PolitiFact said. The review doesn’t have a separate line item for pens.
"The $2,025 figure is ridiculous," Brown University political science professor Richard Arenberg told PolitiFact.
The post was flagged by Facebook as part of its effort to combat false news and misinformation, PolitiFact said.
Top 1% still controls majority of wealth While attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, President Donald Trump said there has been a recent redistribution of wealth.
"For the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few," he said. "We are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist."
That’s not the case, according to The Associated Press.
Unchanged from 2017 when Trump took office, the richest 1% of Americans still own 32% of the U.S. wealth and the middle class share remains at 29%, the AP said.
During Trump’s tenure, there has been an increase in the percentage of Americans who own their own homes, the AP said.
Biden didn’t claim to eat the stick in a corn dog A recent Twitter post, appearing to be an excerpt from The New York Times editorial board’s interview series, seems to include a quote in which Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden claims he eats the wooden sticks in corn dogs.
The quote, attributed to Biden talking about the election, says, "I was eating a corn dog the other day, this is like a corn dog, with some mustard. When you get to the middle, it’s hard and tough, and dry (chuckles) but you have to eat that, too. You have to eat that to finish it."
Biden did an interview with the Times but this quote is not from that interview and there is no evidence the former vice president ever said this about corn dogs, according to Snopes.com. The interview didn’t include any conversations about corn dogs or sticks.
The user who tweeted the false quote was also responsible for a different hoax last year on Twitter, Snopes said.

Texto completo: This lends itself to way more questions than answers, a friend of mine wrote on Facebook the other day above a weird photo.
It showed three boxes of Imodium A-D, that trusted anti-diarrhea medication, lying crumpled in a parking lot. What nightmarish emergency, he wondered, could have possibly led to this?
Turns out, it was nightmarish. Just not in the way most of us would think.
A few commenters on the post explained what was probably going on: People battling opioid withdrawal sometimes gobble Imodium by the fistful.
Imodium is the brand-name of loperamide: a drug that, if taken in gigantic quantities, can produce an opioid-like high – and present serious dangers to a person's health.
I had no idea this was a problem. But apparently it's nothing new.
According to U.S. News & World Report, the U.S. National Poison Data System reported a 90% spike in loperamide overdoses between 2010 and 2016.
Abusing the drug can, naturally, lead to horrific constipation. But it can also wreak havoc on your heart – usually through irregular heartbeats, the New York Times reported in 2016. Back then, overdose deaths had reportedly occurred in at least five states.
"Most physicians just recently realized loperamide could be abused, and few look for it," the story read.
"There is little if any national data on the problem, but many toxicologists and emergency department doctors suspect that it is more widespread than scattered reports suggest."
A 2019 paper out of Rutgers University confirmed that. It said loperamide fatalities have spiked over the last few years.
All that has finally caused the FDA to step in.
In September, the agency announced it would limit Imodium A-D, Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief and Be Health Loperamide HCI capsules – as well as their generic offshoots – to 48 milligrams per package, or about 24 capsules per box. The maximum daily dosage is eight milligrams.
"Abuse of loperamide continues in the United States and taking higher than recommended doses can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death," acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in the release.
But the FDA isn't going to come crashing through pharmacy windows if stores don't follow those guidelines. The new rules are nothing more than voluntary.
That becomes pretty clear if you take a stroll through a local pharmacy.
Battling dirty looks from pharmacy workers and customers alike, I scoped out several stores around Evansville this week and found a variety of anti-diarrhea displays.
Some kept Imodium locked in clear plastic cases. Others sported cage-free boxes that held as much as 96 milligrams per package.
I suppose you could rant about how all this is a sign of a deteriorating culture. I can't even buy diarrhea medication anymore without feeling like a drug addict!
The saddest part for me, though, is that people feel they have to resort to this. I hope whoever left those crumpled boxes behind can find the help they need to kick their addiction.

Her first book examined St. Louis murders; her new novel is so controversial Left Bank cancels event here

Texto completo: A horrific murder in St. Louis is something Jeanine Cummins has grappled with since she was a teenager. And that trauma indeed affected her new bestseller, "American Dirt."
"My life experiences very much come to bear on the way I've written this book," she says. "I am a person who has experienced significant trauma in life.
"I can't unbraid that part of my identity from any other part of my identity and determine which things match up with what in my books. But I know for a fact that one of the things that was a catalyst for me in wanting to write 'A Rip in Heaven' was also a catalyst for 'American Dirt' -- the sense that this story, in large part, had been taken over by violent men.'"
"American Dirt" was published Tuesday, but it's already poised to be the most talked-about novel of early 2020.
Picked for book clubs by Oprah Winfrey and Barnes & Noble and already optioned for film, the propulsive story of a Mexican mother and son running for safety grips readers from the start. Cummins had been scheduled to speak at the Ethical Society in Ladue on Sunday, but Saturday night Left Bank Books, which was sponsoring the event, canceled Cummins' talk, citing calls and posts to social media "insisting we cancel the event" promoting "a white author who writes about a Latinx experience."
But on Wednesday, Cummins had shared her side of the controversy with us. She had already gotten some of the kind of feedback she'd hoped for. A woman in tears told her: "I'm the person who needed this book. I am not an empathetic person by nature. I did not care about migrants, and now I do." After reading "American Dirt," the woman said, she went online to find a place to volunteer to help migrants.
"Of course my hope is that the book can effect change in people's hearts and their minds," Cummins says, noting that's a "lofty" goal. But, she says, "I know that it's possible because it's happened to me."
The reader's comment helped counter vitriolic criticism the author has received, including personal attacks about not being Mexican yet imagining a protagonist from Acapulco who seeks entry to the U.S. after her husband, mother and other relatives are executed.
In the story, Lydia and Luca have survived by hiding in a shower stall as a drug cartel takes revenge on her husband, a journalist. When police arrive, Lydia goes to his body:
"Someone has removed the cardboard sign the gunmen left weighted to his chest with a simple rock. TODA MI FAMILIA ESTÃ MUERTA POR MI CULPA (Today my whole family is dead because of me)."
Like she did in "A Rip in Heaven," Cummins wants "American Dirt" to "reframe the story and put the people on the flip side of violence at front and center." She hopes to burrow into the hearts of those affected.
ST. LOUIS PAST
A couple of writers who aimed attacks on the novel even before its publication seem to discount Cummins' own past, her living through the tragedy and grief of murdered relatives.
On April 4, 1991, Cummins' brother, Tom, and two cousins, Julie and Robin Kerry, went to the old Chain of Rocks Bridge to see a poem the sisters had spray-painted on the derelict structure, a hangout for teenagers. Jeanine, 16, remained safe in bed. Her family was to leave in the morning for home in Maryland after the spring break visit with family.
At the bridge, two young men and two youths attacked the Kerry sisters, Hazelwood East grads and students at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. One of the youths later told police that the other three raped the women and pushed them off the bridge into the Mississippi River. Tom was robbed and forced at gunpoint to jump. Julie's body was recovered three weeks later, but Robin's was never found.
Only Tom, then 19, survived, crawling out of the river and warily looking for signs of the attackers. He flagged down two drivers, who called for help. Later, police found his story so unlikely that Tom was briefly the suspect.
Since then, the Post-Dispatch has printed hundreds of stories in connection with the case, but only the early ones were about the victims themselves. Most followed trials and appeals, including death penalties given for two men. One man would be put to death; the other, who had been beaten by police, was retried and finally admitted guilt. He was sentenced to life in prison.
Cummins published "A Rip in Heaven," about the events of that case, in 2004 because, she wrote then, her "family has watched helplessly while the press has demoted Julie and Robin to little more than background details. Meanwhile, their murderers became media darlings."
In 2015, she wrote an opinion column for the New York Times addressing the fact that three of the four suspects in the case were black:
"For almost 25 years, I asserted that race had no place in the discussion of what happened to my family. I still don't want to write about race. What I mean is, I really don't want to write about race. I'm terrified of striking the wrong chord, of being vulnerable, of uncovering shameful ignorance in my psyche. I'm afraid of being misinterpreted.
"I am white. The grandmother I shared with Julie and Robin was Puerto Rican, and their father is half Lebanese. But in every practical way, my family is mostly white. I'll never know the impotent rage of being profiled, or encounter institutionalized hurdles to success because of my skin or hair or name. But I care about race and equality. And it's imperative for white people to join the conversation about racism. Discomfort is the least of our obligations."
She wrote the column in the aftermath of the protests over the shooting death of Michael Brown and the coming appeal of one of her cousin's killers. She argued that police misconduct in questioning one of the killers "violated the justice Julie and Robin deserve" but didn't offset his guilt; it also didn't make her family a model for "'victimized' white people."
This column recently has been cited to highlight her "whiteness," but it's also clear Cummins has thought about social justice issues for many years, not just in connection with the new book. Her previous two novels also touched on the theme: "The Outside Boy" is about a boy who is an Irish traveler and the prejudice his family lives with ("I wanted to show him as a human boy, first," she says). "The Crooked Branch" delves into mothers in two historical periods, including the Irish potato famine and Britain's role.
All have been reprinted with new covers identifying Cummins as the "bestselling author of 'American Dirt.'"
STRIKING A CHORD
For several years, Cummins lived in Ireland to escape the land of her cousins' murders. Now, she's steadying herself for some 40 stops to talk about the new novel. If she was afraid of "striking the wrong chord" when writing about the Chain of Rocks killings, she faces more challenges over "American Dirt."
"I was resisting telling this story because I was afraid of this exact moment," she says, noting that she's trying to read fewer attacks on social media about whether she has a right to appropriate a different culture.
"I understand that voices of color and voices of women have been hijacked for a very long time," she says. "It has been a conversation long overdue."
But she questions whether novelists are the ones to solve the publishing industry's long history of favoring white authors. (Although many books and memoirs by Latinx writers have been published, this country's few millionaire novelists have usually been white. Cummins reportedly received a seven-figure deal for her book.)
In a New York Times review, novelist Lauren Groff wrote: "In contemporary literary circles, there is a serious and legitimate sensitivity to people writing about heritages that are not their own because, at its worst, this practice perpetuates the evils of colonization, stealing the stories of oppressed people for the profit of the dominant."
A Mexican American writer in Texas, David Bowles, wrote that he isn't against white authors writing about immigrants, but he cited the expensive deal, Winfrey's endorsement and what he said is poor use of Spanish as part of his takedown on medium.com: "At a time when Mexico and the Mexican American community are reviled in this country as they haven't been in decades, to elevate this inauthentic book written by someone outside our community is to slap our collective face."
A review on thebluenib.com lists inauthentic details, including that Luca would be "Lucas" in Spanish.
The issue focusing on writers will no doubt be debated in book clubs. Counter-arguments often bring up free speech and the primacy of imagination, fearing that demands for writers to stay "in their own lanes" smacks of censorship and segregation. If a poorly written book misrepresents or stereotypes another culture in fiction, readers can spotlight it. Let the author take the heat then.
Christopher-Alex ChablÃ©, a poet in St. Louis, earned his master's degree from the University of Missouri-St. Louis. As a Chicano who grew up in Columbia, Missouri, ChablÃ© is sensitive to the issue of "don't write the other," he says.
"I really think writers can write whatever they want," he says, "but just because you do it doesn't mean you aren't free from criticism. You have to write well and write with the intent of creating people who are real and are not stock characters." He doubts he'll read "American Dirt" because he's reading books by Latino writers.
Javier Ramirez, a Chicano bookseller in Chicago, supports the book and is angry over the controversy.
"I've seen this cancel culture in publishing, and we cannot let this happen," he told booksellers just days ago at the American Booksellers Association's annual conference.
Much of the criticism on social media has come from people who haven't read the novel, let alone actually had an experience anything like the one depicted in the book, he said.
"It chills me that they would talk about Jeanine as a terrible monster looking to make a buck off migrants."
Ramirez, one of the owners of Madison Street Books, which opens next month, says he will display "American Dirt" with books by Latino writers. He believes the novel will get people to "dig deeper" into Latino literature.
Kelly von Plonski, owner of Subterranean Books in University City, is one bookseller who will proclaim she loved the novel. "I think if we limited storytelling to only telling your own narrow experience, then imagination doesn't get enough play and the stories themselves would be very limited. Just because a non-Chicana wrote this one doesn't mean that there isn't room for Chicanas to (continue to) write them, too."
Cummins, who now lives in New York's Hudson Valley, believes "fiction will not exist if we are only allowed to write about what we know. That is memoir."
She doesn't want to fight social media attacks, saying that some of the questions will be better addressed on tour: "I feel confident when people actually read the book and are basing their judgments on the merits of the book itself and what's in the pages, that's a very different animal than what has grown online."
Her motivation for writing was to counter the superficial "dueling narratives in this country from the political right and left," she says, stereotypes either of "invading criminals" or "poor people" who must be saved. She saw a "glaring gap in the middle where humanity should be. I was determined to write into that gap. I was hoping the story might feel like a bridge of empathy and love into an experience that readers themselves have not had."
This book is more plot-driven than her others, she says. Over some five years of work, she concentrated first on the action after reading books by Mexican American writers and traveling to the border to interview migrants and workers there.
Supporters of Cummins' work have included Mexican American and Latina writers such as Sandra Cisneros, Julia Alvarez and Erika SÃ¡nchez.
Cummins wishes more fiction writers would pay attention to migrants' stories: "No one needs it more right now than the people all over the world who are compelled to leave their homes, who in many cases don't have any choice, and are taking great personal risk just in the hopes of getting to safety. In this country we're pretty complacent about it."
When she comes back to St. Louis, she'll return to the "place of her most significant heartbreak." But she also feels love toward the city and her aunts and cousins who still live here.
Her brother, Tom, she says, has been a firefighter for 30 years. Now a captain, he's getting ready to retire. He's proud of her new book, Cummins says. The teenager who survived a jump into the Mississippi is standing with her, she says. "He's very much enjoying this moment with me."

Texto completo: Democrats seized on "explosive" details from John Bolton to increase pressure on the GOP-led Senate to call President Trump's former national security adviser as a witness in the impeachment trial.
House impeachment managers said Bolton has "vital information" for their case, as evidenced by a New York Times report Sunday evening about Bolton's upcoming book, which undercuts the Trump defense team's claim that the freeze of security assistance to Ukraine was separate from the president pressing Kyiv to announce investigations into his political rivals, including presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.
"There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president’s defense and therefore must be called as a witness at the impeachment trial of President Trump," said a joint statement from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and his fellow impeachment managers.
Drafts of Bolton's manuscript, which are circulating among Bolton's associates and the White House for a review process, said Trump told his then-national security adviser in August that he was withholding nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid as leverage to convince Ukraine to assist with investigations into Democrats. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeatedly pushed Trump to unlock the funds, which were released in September.
“During our impeachment inquiry, the President blocked our request for Mr. Bolton’s testimony. Now we see why. The President knows how devastating his testimony would be, and, according to the report, the White House has had a draft of his manuscript for review. President Trump’s cover-up must come to an end," the impeachment managers wrote. “Americans know that a fair trial must include both the documents and witnesses blocked by the President — that starts with Mr. Bolton."
Bolton left the White House in September and announced earlier this month that he was willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial if called by lawmakers. Trump signaled that he would block Bolton from testifying, claiming it would be to protect executive privilege for himself and future presidents.

House Democrats levied two articles of impeachment against Trump accusing him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The latter relates to his administration's efforts to block some witnesses and documents during the House proceedings.
Opening arguments are underway, and following a written questions period, the Senate will hold a four-hour debate on whether to subpoena or call witnesses to testify or to seek additional evidence. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the upper chamber and a handful of moderate GOP senators on the fence, Democrats hope they will win enough support to secure Bolton's testimony.
"John Bolton has the evidence," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, tweeted Sunday evening. "It’s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, [acting White House chief of staff] Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump’s actions testify in the Senate trial."
“Senators should insist that Mr. Bolton be called as a witness, and provide his notes and other relevant documents," the impeachment managers wrote in their statement. "The Senate trial must seek the full truth and Mr. Bolton has vital information to provide. There is no defensible reason to wait until his book is published, when the information he has to offer is critical to the most important decision Senators must now make — whether to convict the President of impeachable offenses."
Bolton's book, titled The Room Where it Happened, is tentatively scheduled to be released on March 17.

Klobuchar gaining foothold in New Hampshire with newspaper endorsement and stronger polls

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar's boomlet in Iowa could be carrying over to New Hampshire.
Though decidedly in the second-tier of candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Klobuchar, 59, was endorsed this weekend by the state's most widely circulated newspaper, the New Hampshire Union Leader.
"Beating Donald Trump means building a broad coalition and bringing people with us," the Minnesota senator tweeted late Saturday.
Tweet
In its editorial, the New Hampshire Union Leader flagged weaknesses with her rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, ahead of a general election against President Trump. Those four contenders comprise the top-tier of Democratic White House hopefuls, according to RealClearPolitics polling averages.
"Each has weaknesses, whether of age, inexperience or a far-left agenda that thrills some liberals but is ripe for exploitation in a mainstream general election," the newspaper wrote. "Sen. Klobuchar has none of those weaknesses and the incumbent needs to be presented a challenger who is not easily dismissed."
The endorsement preceded the release Sunday morning of NBC News's and Marist's first poll of New Hampshire, which found 10% of likely Democratic primary voters would cast their ballot for Klobuchar on Feb. 11. The survey is the second one in as many weeks in which the senator has registered double-digit support after an Emerson College study showed her breaking the barrier for the first time earlier in January.
Between the endorsement and the poll numbers, Klobuchar, the former chief prosecutor for the county covering Minneapolis, is countering concerns she cannot compete in New Hampshire given the perceived dominance of Sanders and Warren as neighboring senators. Some Democratic strategists expressed doubt to the Washington Examiner earlier in the cycle whether Klobuchar's Midwest appeal, which has helped her in Iowa, would assist her in wooing voters in New England.
In the final days before Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses on Feb. 3, Klobuchar was this week endorsed by the New York Times and Iowa's Quad-City Times. She was also named the candidate "best for the needs and interests of rural Iowa" by Focus on Rural America, a poll in which she pulled 11% support. Yet the senator still trails the field's leading pack, including consistent front-runners Biden and Sanders, a trend picked up on by political commentators on Twitter.
"Dem women helped Ds win House in 2018. Dem women running for president keep winning editorial board endorsements, yet still two older, white guys who are top choice for D voters in 2020," Amy Walter, the national editor of the Cook Political Report, tweeted Sunday.

Pompeo privately admitted Giuliani claims about Ukraine ambassador were phony: Bolton book

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo doubted Trump lawyer Rudy Giualini's claims that former United States Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was corrupt, according to a draft of former national security adviser John Bolton's book.
Drafts of Bolton's unpublished book said Pompeo privately admitted to him last spring that Giuliani may have been pushing baseless accusations about Yovanovitch because she may have been cracking down on Giuliani's clients with dealings in Ukraine as part of an anti-corruption effort, according to the New York Times.
Bolton, who left the White House in September, also wrote that Trump told him in August that he was withholding nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aide to Ukraine until Kyiv assisted with investigations into his political rivals, including former Vice President and presidential candidate Joe Biden. Bolton, Pompeo, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeatedly pushed Trump to unlock the funds, which were released in September.
Bolton announced earlier this month that he is willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial if called by lawmakers, but Trump has indicated that he will block Bolton from testifying.
Democrats have wanted Bolton to testify ever since his former aide, Fiona Hill, testified to House impeachment investigators that Bolton opposed the Ukraine pressure campaign. She said Bolton wanted no part of what he described as a "drug deal" that fellow Trump administration officials were "cooking up."
The New York Times report, based on drafts circulating among Bolton's associates and the White House for a review process, comes two days after NPR host Mary Louise Kelly said Pompeo shouted and swore at her when she asked him about Ukraine and whether he had ever defended Yovanovitch and owed her an apology.
Pompeo released a statement accusing Kelly of lying to him and reporting the details of a conversation he claimed was off the record.

"This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration. It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity," he said.
Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in May 2019 and went on to testify in the House impeachment hearings that a superior told her that she had done nothing wrong, but that President Trump had lost faith in her. She also condemned the “smear campaign” against her, saying allegations that she put together a “Do Not Prosecute” list were a “fabrication” and denying claims that she had told anyone at the embassy or in Ukraine that Trump’s orders should be ignored.
Michael McKinley, another impeachment witness who was a top adviser to Pompeo, testified that his former boss rejected his push for the State Department to release a statement supporting Yovanovitch and highlighting her "professionalism and courage." Pompeo claimed afterwards that McKinley, who abruptly resigned in October, "didn't say anything to me" about it.
[READ: Bolton lawyer blames book leak on 'corrupted' review process]
Trump had called for Yovanovitch's ouster as early as April 2018 during a private dinner that was attended by two now-indicted associates of Giuliani.
"Get rid of her. Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it," the president can be heard saying in the footage taken by Igor Fruman, who along with Lev Parnas informed the president that the ambassador had been talking badly about him.
Bolton's book, published by Simon & Schuster, will also touch on controversies related to Russia and Venezuela, and some top Trump officials are said to be subject to unkind descriptions. According to the latest report, Bolton claimed he raised concerns about Giuliani with Attorney General William Barr after Trump's July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
A transcript of the call that was released to the public shows Trump encouraged Zelensky to talk to Giuliani and Barr about investigations into Democrats. A statement by the Justice Department claimed Trump never told Barr to contact Ukraine about said inquiries and distanced the attorney general from Giuliani.
Bolton's book, titled The Room Where it Happened, is tentatively scheduled to be released on March 17.

Texto completo: A lawyer for John Bolton slammed the leak of details from the former national security adviser's upcoming book that have quickly rocked the impeachment case against President Trump.
Drafts of Bolton's manuscript were shared with associates and the White House for a review process, and the New York Times reported on Sunday that Bolton wrote that he was told by Trump in August that a hold on nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid was tied to his efforts to pressure Kyiv into assisting with investigations into his political rivals, including former Vice President and presidential candidate Joe Biden. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper repeatedly pushed Trump to unlock the funds, which were released in September.
"It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript," Charles Cooper, who is a lawyer to Bolton, said in a statement.
The New York Times report, which was sourced by "multiple people" who described Bolton's book but cited no direct quotes from his drafts, prompted a swift reaction from Democrats.
House impeachment managers issued a statement that said Bolton has "vital information" that undercuts the Trump defense team's claim that the freeze of security assistance to Ukraine was separate from the push for an announcement of investigations that would be politically beneficial to the president. Led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, they called on senators to vote in favor of subpoenaing or calling witnesses to testify.
Bolton left the White House in September and announced earlier this month that he was willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial if subpoenaed by lawmakers. Trump signaled that he would block Bolton from testifying, claiming it would be to protect executive privilege for himself and future presidents.
A manuscript of Bolton's book, which is being published by Simon & Schuster, was submitted to the National Security Council's Records Management Division for standard prepublication security review for classified information on Dec. 30, according to Cooper, who provided journalists a copy of the accompanying cover letter.
"As explained in my cover letter to Ellen J. Knight, Senior Director of the Records Management Division, we submitted the manuscript not withstanding our firm believe that the manuscript contained no information that could reasonably be considered classified and on the assurance that the 'process of reviewing submitted materials is restricted to those career government officials and employees regularly charged with responsibility for such reviews' and the 'contents of Ambassador Bolton's manuscript will not be reviewed or otherwise disclosed to any persons not regularly involved in that process,'" Cooper said.
Sarah Tinsley, an adviser to Bolton, told Axios that the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations sent the draft manuscript only to the White House for a pre-publication review by the National Security Council. "The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period," she said.
Bolton's book, titled The Room Where it Happened, is tentatively scheduled to be released on March 17.

Frank Bruni: Of all of Trump’s defenses, this is the lamest

Texto completo: Once the Senate concludes its trial of President Donald Trump, it should go into recess. Until next January. The House, too. Lawmakers shouldn’t pass legislation, consider nominations or make any important decisions whatsoever: This is an election year, and the voters will soon weigh in on the direction of America. The nation’s business should await that judgment, lest members of Congress contradict it.
A ludicrous proposal? Indeed. But it’s in line with — and an extrapolation of — a favorite argument against Trump’s conviction and removal from office. His Republican supporters say that lawmakers shouldn’t speak for voters on such a crucial issue. To preempt the verdict at the ballot box, they say, is to subvert the people’s will.
Nice try. Lawmakers are elected specifically to speak for voters on crucial issues. That’s the system. That’s their job. American government doesn’t operate by daily, hourly or issue-by-issue polls (at least not overtly). Congress doesn’t have exponentially more power one week after Election Day than it does one year later (though it may indeed have more political currency).
And lawmakers shouldn’t defer to their constituents at every turn. Those constituents expect them, over the course of their legislative terms, to use their judgment as better-informed proxies for the people they represent. So does the Constitution, which created America as a representative democracy, not a direct one. Our lawmakers are supposed to lead as well as follow, to be responsive to public sentiment but not mesmerized or paralyzed by it. That’s even truer when the stakes are huge than when they’re small.
Republicans have decided to sing a different tune. If it sounds familiar, that’s because they turned to the same music when Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace him and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, declared that a presidential election about eight months in the offing prevented the Senate from taking any action. It was a song not of principle but of political convenience. The same holds true now.
“Give the people back their power,” the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, implored a few months ago, arguing against impeachment itself. Referring to the president’s transgression and the November 2020 election, McConnell said, “The American people, if they think this is a very significant episode, can take it into account.” Sen. Lindsey Graham chimed in: “I really do believe that the best person — group of people — to pick a president are the voters, not a bunch of partisan politicians.” Pat Cipollone, one of the president’s lawyers, added: “No one ever thought that it would be a good idea for our country — for our children, for our grandchildren — to try to remove a president from a ballot, to deny the American people the right to vote.”
No one? Really? How about the framers of the Constitution, who established the impeachment process to do essentially that and declined to add any asterisks about the next election’s imminence? “If the framers thought impeachment in an election year was a bad idea, they could have set things up differently,” noted Jill Lepore, a Harvard history professor and the author of the 2018 book “These Truths: A History of the United States.”
“They could have instituted a mechanism for an interim election, for instance,” Lepore told me. “They did not. They could have said, ‘Except not in an election year.’ They did not. You want there to be no impeachments allowed in an election year, ever? You have to get a constitutional amendment ratified.” And that would never happen, because it would be license for a president to do anything he or she wanted, fearlessly, if it synced with the calendar just so.
The framers, in fact, wanted a government that wasn’t too sensitive to voters — that mediated voters’ whims and prejudices through representatives presumably taking a longer, cooler view. Senators’ six-year terms reflect that. As Alison LaCroix, a University of Chicago professor who teaches constitutional law and American history, told me, “The Senate is supposed to have a little more deliberative power and maybe be a little less beholden to the people.” When senators say they should kick an issue back to the people, they’re arguably violating the spirit of the chamber.
LaCroix made another excellent point: What’s happening to Trump isn’t muscling voters out of the process but, rather, taking into account what voters recently did. “You only get an impeachment vote when people have changed their minds,” she said, referring to their opinions about a sitting president. “The votes comes from the House, and we know, from things like the midterm elections, that some amount of people have changed their minds. Another party has gained control of the House. That has to be telling us something.”
Granted, that switch in the House majority wasn’t a referendum on Trump’s interactions with Ukraine, which were the grounds for his impeachment and hadn’t yet come to light. But they were absolutely a referendum, in part, on his behavior and character. Lawmakers who are now assessing and acting on the worst of that behavior and character are hardly turning a deaf ear to voters.
If Republican leaders were really so invested in a government that didn’t diverge from voters’ desires, more of them would be questioning the Electoral College. Because of it, the country has a president, Trump, who received about 3 million fewer votes than his opponent. Because of it, George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election despite being the choice of fewer Americans than Al Gore. But both Trump and Bush are Republicans. So it’s fine if the system and voter sentiment aren’t perfectly aligned.
Similarly, Republicans — Democrats, too — are fond of tarring opponents by saying that they’re too beholden to polls. The implication is that elected officials should have the courage of their own convictions and not outsource their judgment to constituents. Saying that only voters should decide Trump’s fate is precisely such outsourcing. And Election Day is essentially the biggest poll of all.
There’s an additional, profoundly important wrinkle in the case of Trump’s impeachment and trial. They stem specifically from actions he took to corrupt the next presidential election by getting a foreign government to smear a potential rival. To give those actions a pass is to green-light more of the same or worse, meaning that voters’ verdict on Trump’s behavior might be fatally tainted: not a clean expression of popular will but a product of, well, cheating. The election can’t be the remedy when the election is what’s at issue.
But McCarthy, McConnell and other Republicans are determined to spare their party the humiliation of Trump’s removal and to protect themselves from his wrath (and his base’s fury) if he isn’t saved. So they reach for whatever arguments they can. Some are more plausible than others. The assertion that an election next November forbids honor this January is a joke, and the framers would have laughed at it.

Texto completo: Park City • Without Oprah or Apple, the Russell Simmons documentary “On the Record” went ahead with its premiere Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival, where the women who came forward with sexual assault allegations against the hip-hop mogul received one of the festival’s most roaring receptions.
The lead-up to Sundance was especially rocky for “On the Record." Oprah Winfrey, an executive producer, on Jan. 10 withdrew from the film because she felt it needed more reporting. Her exit, which stunned the directors, Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, also meant “On the Record” no longer had a distributor in Apple TV Plus.
Ahead of the film's premiere, Ziering thanked Sundance “for standing strong and never blinking.”
“On the Record” is centered on the story of Drew Dixon, a former music executive for Def Jam Recordings, the record label co-founded by Simmons. It chronicles her decision to come forward and go on the record in a 2017 New York Times article, along with numerous other women, in accusing Simmons of harassment and rape.
Simmons has denied any wrongdoing. The filmmakers said he declined to be interviewed for the film.
More than a dozen other women, many of whom also appear in “On the Record,” have also come forward with allegations of assault or harassment against Simmons. Along with Dixon, in attendance Saturday were Sherri Hines, a member of the all-female hip-hop group Mercedes Ladies who alleged that Simmons raped her in his office in the early 1980s; and Sil Lai Abrams, who has said Simmons raped her in 1994.
In the crowd in Park City was the actress Rosanna Arquette, who has accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. Arquette stood up during the Q&A to salute the women in the film. “I'm so proud of you,” she said.
“On the Record” also delves into the place black women have in the #MeToo movement and the racial dimensions of sexual assault. One audience member noted that the film, despite being about black women accusing a black man of rape, is directed by two white people.
“A lot of this is about power and ecosystems of power,” Dixon said. “And all of us have kept our stories to ourselves for decades, and there are people within that ecosystem who knew our stories."
“Some of those people are filmmakers,” she continued. "It’s an entertainment industry story after all, right? But nobody told our story. Because the people who knew our story were subject to the same ecosystem. And to me, this is where allies matter. Allies who are not subject to that same dynamic. They have traction that they can use to pull you forward.”
Ziering and Dick have made several documentaries before about sexual assault. Their “The Hunting Ground" focused on rape on college campuses. “The Invisible War” scrutinized sexual assault in the military.
“On the Record” depicts the personal struggle of coming forward and the years of pain and self-doubt that can follow sexual assault. Dixon says she ultimately retreated from the music industry after she said she was again harassed by another executive, L.A. Reid. Reid has denied it.
Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, an attorney and civil rights advocate, after the film alluded to the history of black women who have accused public figures of assault, citing the treatment of Anita Hill and Desiree Washington, who accused Mike Tyson of rape.
“You’ve seen this film. The question is will anyone else see it?" Crenshaw said. "So whatever can be brought to bear to make sure that this doesn’t get snuffed out — think of all the history of what has already happened and say never again.”

Maureen Dowd: For Romney, revenge is a dish best served with milk

Texto completo: Republicans know very well who they are.
That’s why it was such a juicy moment when Hakeem Jeffries, the congressman from Brooklyn and Democratic impeachment manager, quoted a lyric by fellow B-town native son Biggie Smalls to rebut Jay Sekulow when the president’s lawyer disingenuously wondered, “Why are we here?”
Referring to the Democrats’ crystal-clear case that Donald Trump abused his power and corrupted the highest office in the land, Jeffries proclaimed, “And if you don’t know, now you know.”
I went to the press gallery one afternoon to check out the tableau vivant. The visitors’ gallery was only half full, and there was none of the passion and titillation that infused the Clinton impeachment, which also, oddly enough, revolved around a power disparity between two people.
One Democratic Senate staffer mourned the apathy. “Our phones aren’t ringing,” he told me. “Nobody cares. It’s the saddest thing ever.”
One side of the room seemed to be smirking.
Mitch McConnell is resorting to his Merrick Garland playbook. He’ll let the Democrats make all their noble points, but it’s Kabuki. Republicans have perfected the dark art of “There’s nothing to see here, just keep moving.” McConnell long ago choreographed the end, with Democrats losing the argument and the acquitted scoundrel triumphantly sweeping into the Capitol to make his State of the Union address.
At night, tipsy Republican staffers treated Senate office buildings as a pub crawl, roaming the halls with celebratory bottles of wine.
Some Republicans were paying attention at the trial — or wanted to be seen paying attention. Susan Collins was glued to the proceedings, as was the senator to her left in a magma-colored shawl, Lisa Murkowski. Republicans like Collins who are vulnerable in 2020 have to be alert and figure out how to find their way out of the hearings without doing more political harm. A Trump confidant told CBS News that Republican senators were warned, “Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike.”
Seated at the back of the class, Mitt Romney looked dutiful, and the thought must have crossed his mind that’s he’s in a position to inflict payback on Trump for calling him “a pompous ass” and tricking him into an interview for secretary of state only to humiliate him. (Revenge is a dish best served with milk.)
But more senators on the Republican side were telegraphing boredom.
Lindsey Graham yawned and rearranged his yellow pencil and went on walkabouts, later telling reporters, “About the fourth time you tell me the same thing is twice too much.” He cleaved to his lap-dog role, saying preposterously of Trump: “What he wants to do is get to the truth.”
Tom Cotton played with the fidget spinner Richard Burr had handed out to all the Republicans. Marsha Blackburn and others left to trash the proceedings on Fox News.
The senators in the Democratic presidential race could not have been happy to be stuck there, either. Bernie Sanders, accustomed to making like Leonard Bernstein at big rallies and upset he’s not in Iowa to relish his surge, had a hard time keeping his hands still, moving them restlessly, silently clapping, and finally holding them together on his chest over his blue sweater.
But heads on both sides did snap to attention whenever that unholy, jangly, self-impeaching peal, so inescapable in the last three years, rang out in the hallowed chamber. Trump’s voice was impossible to ignore when the House impeachment managers played incriminating video clips of the human fidget spinner himself, sometimes howling over the blades of his chopper on the South Lawn.
So many people in this very room had tried and failed, or are now trying, to vanquish the guy. Romney, Cruz, Rubio, Graham, Klobuchar, Sanders, Bennet, Booker, Gillibrand, Warren, Harris. Trump had savaged all his fellow Republicans and yet here they were listening to an unending recitation of his crimes and coming out to be his Praetorian guard.
Adam Schiff tried to warn the former nemeses turned defenders of Trump that if the president is not removed, he could turn on them the way he had turned on Marie Yovanovitch and Joe Biden, using the power of the presidency to cheat, lie and smear. (Now Rudy’s buddy Lev Parnas says he has forked over to congressional Democrats a 2018 recording of Trump personally ordering Yovanovitch to be fired.)
“The next time, it just may be you,” Schiff told the Republican senators. “Do you think he wouldn’t ask you to be investigated? Do you think for a moment that he wouldn’t?”
Schiff also reminded Republicans that Trump had inverted their dogma, embracing the Evil Empire and authoritarianism and trusting Crazy Rudy’s conspiracy theories over his own intelligence services.
“You don’t realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don’t have it,” Schiff said.
But the more impressive the Democrats’ case is, the more depressing the reality becomes. They want to convince themselves that character matters. But many Americans knew they were voting for a thug. They wanted a thug who would bust up Washington, and they got one.
The Democrats are relying on facts, but the Republicans are relying on Fox.
And if you don’t know, now you know.

Texto completo: Un alto cargo de salud del gobierno chino ha advertido este domingo que la ya rápida expansión del peligroso coronavirus se está acelerando . Su alerta aumenta la preocupación mundial de una enfermedad que ha atacado a unas 2,700 personas en todo el mundo y que se ha cobrado la vida de al menos 80 en China .
El desalentador diagnóstico llega en medio de las esfuerzos de China por detener su propagación. El país asiático ha hecho una r estricción de viajes que afecta a 56 millones de personas pero la cuarentena podría ser contraproducente ya que deja zonas desprovistas de suministros médicos.
Además, el director de la Comisión Nacional de Salud en China, Ma Xiaowei, ha señalado que incluso las personas que no muestran síntomas de la enfermedad pero que la portan podrían contagiar a otras. Esas transmisiones sin síntomas dificultarían el control de la enfermedad ya que las personas aparentemente sanas se desplazan e interactúan con otras.
“La epidemia está entrando ahora en un periodo más serio y complejo “, dijo Ma el domingo durante una conferencia de prensa en Beijing. “Parece que continuará por un tiempo y la cantidad de casos podría aumentar”.
Los intentos chinos por frenar la propagación de la enfermedad aislando Wuhan , una ciudad de 11 millones de habitantes, es “un experimento de salud pública ” de una envergadura sin precedentes, según el doctor William Schaffner. Este experto en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de Vanderbilt considera que “logísticamente es impresionante y se hizo muy rápido”.
Distanciar a la población que pueda estar contagiada puede evitar que la enfermedad se siga extendiendo, dijo a The New York Times el exdirector del Centro la el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades, Thomas R. Frieden. Sin embargo, mantener una ciudad aislada plantea enormes desafíos como la provisión de alimentos, combustibles y la atención médica de millones de personas .

Texto completo: En un manuscrito de un libro se publicará próximamente, John Bolton asegura que el presidente Donald Trump le dijo que pretendía seguir bloqueando la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que el país del este de Europa les ayudara con las investigaciones contra los demócratas . La afirmación del que fuera consejero de seguridad nacional del mandatario estadounidense -que adelantó este domingo el diario The New York Times– podría jugar un papel fundamental en el juicio político que se celebra estos día en el Senado.
La Casa Blanca recibió recientemente un borrador manuscrito del futuro libro de Bolton para el habitual proceso de revisión. En él -asegura el periódico neoyorquino- el exconsejero del ejecutivo señala que Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter estaban entre los demócratas a los que Trump quería que se investigara.
Bolton dice que se mostró preocupado por la retención de los casi 400 millones de dólares de la ayuda ucraniana en una conversación que tuvo en agosto con el presidente. Según su propio manuscrito, Trump le dijo que prefería no enviar la asistencia a Ucrania la asistencia para seguridad hasta que los altos cargos de ese país entregaran los materiales que tuvieran sobre la investigación rusa relacionada con el exvicepresidente Biden y con los partidarios ucranianos de Hillary Clinton.
En el esbozo de libro, Bolton afirma que advirtió a los abogados de la Casa Blanca que Rudy Giuliani , el abogado personal de Trump, estaba aprovechando su relación con el presidente para ayudar a sus clientes particulares . El diplomático añadió que el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo, le reconoció en privado que las afirmaciones de Giuliani sobre la entonces embajadora en Ucrania, Marie Yovanovitch, no tenían fundamento .
Esta información ayuda a los fiscales demócratas en el impeachment contra Trump a presionar aún más para que Bolton declare como testigo. “No puede caber ninguna duda ahora de que Bolton contradice el núcleo [argumental] de la defensa del presidente “, escribieron los representantes en un comunicado que lanzaron la noche de este domingo.
Sin embargo, los demócratas necesitarían el apoyo de varios republicanos en la Cámara alta para conseguir citar como testigo al exasesor del presidente. Antes de que saliera esta noticia, senadores decían que las posibilidades de 51 republicanos en el Senado votaran a favor de traer testimonios sobre el juicio político estaban menguando. En cualquier caso, esperarían a que terminarán las rondas de preguntas para decidir si respaldan la petición de los demócratas. Esto tendría lugar al finalizar la próxima semana.

President of St. John’s shakes up the status quo

Texto completo: Mark Roosevelt, president of St. John’s College in Santa Fe, knows firsthand the heartbreak of closing a school.
When he was superintendent of Pittsburgh Public Schools from 2005-11, Roosevelt had to shutter about 30 public schools after the city’s massive population loss. The big steel mills closed in the 1980s, and it took many years for Pittsburgh’s economy to revive.
As Roosevelt sits in his office on the tranquil St. John’s campus, surrounded by images of Abraham Lincoln, the scars from his Pittsburgh days are palpable.
“Do you realize that we’re going to lose 200 small liberal arts colleges in the next 10 years?” is his opening gambit.
The underlying message is clear: St. John’s won’t be one of them, at least not on Roosevelt’s watch.
In 2018, St. John’s took the radical step of cutting its tuition for the 2019-20 academic year from $52,000 to $35,000 and saw a surge in applications. Its commitment to a classical education in an era in which learning to code is seen as the key to career success prompted The New York Times to dub the school “The Most Contrarian College in America.”
A copy of the 2018 article hangs framed outside Roosevelt’s office, ushering one into the inner chambers of the school’s contrarian in chief.
Roosevelt is a curious mixture of opposites. A patrician who is a great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, he is plain-speaking and exudes a kind of toughness that seems at odds with the cloistered halls of academe. Indeed, one gets the feeling the Rough Rider’s direct descendant doesn’t care if people like him or not.
Still, St. John’s is on a charm offensive. Roosevelt has decided that the college needs to do a better job of explaining its relevance in a world addicted to the selfie and the cellphone.
In the now-classic book, “Colleges That Change Lives,” by Loren Pope, St. John’s keeps company with such academic institutions as Whitman College of Walla Walla, Washington; Reed College of Portland, Oregon; and Antioch College of Yellow Springs, Ohio.
Before joining St. John’s in 2016, Roosevelt was hired in 2011 to bring Antioch back to life. The private liberal arts college closed in 2008 for three years until a group of alumni joined forces to resurrect it.
While it may share a devotion to inquiry and free thought with other small liberal arts institutions, St. John’s is an original. There simply isn’t another college in the country like it.
There are no majors. There are no electives. There are no professors. Educators are known as “tutors” and each tutor has to teach the entire curriculum, which encompasses philosophy, literature, and the history of science and mathematics. There are no lecture classes.
While there is no requirement to learn a foreign language at St. John’s in Santa Fe or at its sister campus in Annapolis, Maryland, both campuses make it possible for students to study ancient Greek.
As Roosevelt himself said in his convocation speech to incoming students last week, “St. John’s is as different from other small liberal arts schools – such as Middlebury, Pomona or Oberlin – as these schools are from the University of Texas or Ohio State.”
There are no “trigger warnings” to protect students from the sometimes violent content of the Greek classics. There is little attempt to incorporate voices outside the white male-dominated canon of Western Civilization, though Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington and Jane Austen make the cut.
Diversity may be limited in its curriculum, but St. John’s is committed to having an eclectic mix of backgrounds among its roughly 850 undergrads. Here’s how the numbers stack up: 47% of the student body is female, 28% are people of color, 14% are international and 13% are the first generation in their family to attend college.
Just 12% of its students come from New Mexico, while 21% receive Pell Grants, a federal program that gives low-income recipients financial aid that doesn’t have to be paid back. More than 90% of students receive some form of financial aid, said Roosevelt.
Who are St. John’s students? “They’re seekers,” said Roosevelt. “They’re willing to work much harder than the typical student. They want to understand why things are the way they are.”
Asked what she tells people when they ask what her major is, St. John’s senior Claire Motsinger first laughs, then replies: “I say I’m studying philosophy, literature, the history of math and science of the Western canon.”
A Santa Fe native and a graduate of the New Mexico School for the Arts, Motsinger said she picked St. John’s because she wanted “something academically rigorous” to balance her high school education, which emphasized sculpting and printmaking.
While at St. John’s, Motsinger has had work-study jobs at the International Museum of Folk Art, as well as the Metropolitan Museum in New York, where she plans to work after she graduates in the spring.
Although St. John’s doesn’t have a swimming pool, it has an arts studio where Motsinger would work on the potter’s wheel when she wasn’t studying.
Although all St. John’s undergrads study the same great books of Western civilization, seniors can break out of the curriculum if they wish with their senior essay. For her essay, Motsinger chose Franz Kafka’s “Description of a Struggle.”
Motsinger said she decided to attend St. John’s because she wanted “quality over quantity.”
In his welcoming speech to the incoming freshman last week, Roosevelt told students, “You will work very hard here. How different is this from many other schools? Just check out the recent book ‘Academically Adrift,’ which examines how little work college students actually do and how little they learn.”
The book found that about a third of the 2,300 college incoming freshmen tested on measures such as critical thinking, analytic reasoning and other higher-level skills had made no gains in those areas when tested again as outgoing seniors.
Of course, not all students stick around St. John’s once they realize what they’ve gotten themselves into. According to the website collegetuitioncompare.com, the school’s graduation rate is 64% within six years, versus 68% for private liberal arts colleges on average.
That’s a number Roosevelt is focused on improving. He said that no St. John’s student is allowed to drop out without him personally signing a permission slip.
Told about a restaurant employee in town who has dropped out of St. John’s twice, Roosevelt asks, “Does he want to come back?” and jots the young man’s name down.
He said St. John’s has added mental health counselors and private tutors to prevent troubled students from dropping out, but lamented, “It’s hard for some kids to ask for help.”
While the tuition rollback in the 2019-20 academic year was viewed by many as a way to make St. John’s more affordable, Roosevelt said it was actually a move to “increase transparency.”
He points out that it’s a well-known secret that colleges engage in obfuscation as they attempt to woo students into taking on the biggest financial obligation in their lives to date.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan debt in the United States lies between $902 billion and $1 trillion, with around $864 billion of this federal student loan debt.
Unlike many other forms of debt, federally backed student loans cannot be reduced or eliminated through bankruptcy. Unpaid student debt can be garnished from wages, tax refunds and even from Social Security.
By lowering tuition dramatically, Roosevelt said St. John’s is attempting to avoid the game-playing that colleges engage in when they offer so-called merit-based scholarships.
To make up for the shortfall in tuition revenue, St. John’s has stepped up its fundraising activity. At the same time it announced the tuition cut, it kicked off a $300 million capital campaign and is closing in on its goal. According to the trade publication insidehighered.com, more than $1 million has come from gifts under $5,0000, a first for the school.
Roosevelt boasted that the donations coming will be used to help keep tuition down and improve the quality of education. “We’re not going to build a swimming pool or a football stadium (there isn’t a football team) or hire sushi chefs in the cafeteria,” he said. “We’re about education and critical thinking here, not great amenities in the dorms.”
While St. John’s classics-based education might not fit the vocational needs of some employers, it does provide a good springboard for post-graduate education. About 70% of “Johnnies,” as they are known locally, will go on to graduate school.
According to statistics provided by St. John’s, from 2005-14, the school ranked in the top 4% for all colleges and universities in the percentage of alumni getting Ph.D.s in the humanities, journalism, business, science and engineering.
In the humanities alone, St. John’s ranks No. 1. Hey, who needs a football team, anyway?

Texto completo: En un manuscrito de un libro se publicará próximamente, John Bolton asegura que el presidente Donald Trump le dijo que pretendía seguir bloqueando la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que el país del este de Europa les ayudara con las investigaciones contra los demócratas . La afirmación del que fuera consejero de seguridad nacional del mandatario estadounidense -que adelantó este domingo el diario The New York Times– podría jugar un papel fundamental en el juicio político que se celebra estos día en el Senado.
La Casa Blanca recibió recientemente un borrador manuscrito del futuro libro de Bolton para el habitual proceso de revisión. En él -asegura el periódico neoyorquino- el exconsejero del ejecutivo señala que Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter estaban entre los demócratas a los que Trump quería que se investigara.
Bolton dice que se mostró preocupado por la retención de los casi 400 millones de dólares de la ayuda ucraniana en una conversación que tuvo en agosto con el presidente. Según su propio manuscrito, Trump le dijo que prefería no enviar la asistencia a Ucrania la asistencia para seguridad hasta que los altos cargos de ese país entregaran los materiales que tuvieran sobre la investigación rusa relacionada con el exvicepresidente Biden y con los partidarios ucranianos de Hillary Clinton.
En el esbozo de libro, Bolton afirma que advirtió a los abogados de la Casa Blanca que Rudy Giuliani , el abogado personal de Trump, estaba aprovechando su relación con el presidente para ayudar a sus clientes particulares . El diplomático añadió que el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo, le reconoció en privado que las afirmaciones de Giuliani sobre la entonces embajadora en Ucrania, Marie Yovanovitch, no tenían fundamento .
Esta información ayuda a los fiscales demócratas en el impeachment contra Trump a presionar aún más para que Bolton declare como testigo. “No puede caber ninguna duda ahora de que Bolton contradice el núcleo [argumental] de la defensa del presidente “, escribieron los representantes en un comunicado que lanzaron la noche de este domingo.
Sin embargo, los demócratas necesitarían el apoyo de varios republicanos en la Cámara alta para conseguir citar como testigo al exasesor del presidente. Antes de que saliera esta noticia, senadores decían que las posibilidades de 51 republicanos en el Senado votaran a favor de traer testimonios sobre el juicio político estaban menguando. En cualquier caso, esperarían a que terminarán las rondas de preguntas para decidir si respaldan la petición de los demócratas. Esto tendría lugar al finalizar la próxima semana.

Texto completo: *Editor's note: This story has been updated to include the latest information on the number of fatalities in China.
A resident of Brazos County who was tested for coronavirus after returning to Texas from China is not afflicted with the same deadly strain that has killed dozens of people, health officials said Sunday.
“The Brazos County Health District has received the results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus,” Sara Mendez, Brazos County Health District health promotion manager, said in a brief statement. “The results are negative for 2019-nCoV.”
The Texas A&M University student recently traveled to Wuhan, China, where the deadly virus originated, health officials said last week. A student at Baylor University in Waco is also being tested after traveling to China but health officials haven't received those results, said Kelly Craine, a spokeswoman with the Waco-McLennan County Public Health District.
As of Sunday evening, 80 people who have contracted the illness have died, the New York Times reported. The deaths have been confined to China but health officials in several other countries have confirmed cases, including five in the United States.
The confirmed cases in the United States are in Arizona, California, Illinois and Washington state. More cases are expected but U.S. health officials said risk to the general public remains low, the New York Times reported.

Manjoo: We’re sleepwalking into a surveillance state

Texto completo: There is much about the future that keeps me up at night — AI weaponry, undetectable viral deepfakes, indefatigable and infinitely wise robotic op-ed columnists — but in the past few years, one technological threat has blipped my fear radar much faster than others.
That fear? Ubiquitous surveillance.
I am no longer sure that human civilization can undo or evade living under constant, extravagantly detailed physical and even psychic surveillance; as a species, we are not doing nearly enough to avoid always being watched or otherwise digitally recorded.
Your location, your purchases, video and audio from within your home and office, your online searches and every digital wandering, biometric tracking of your face and other body parts, your heart rate and other vital signs, your every communication, recording, and perhaps your deepest thoughts or idlest dreams — in the future, if not already, much of this data and more will be collected and analyzed by some combination of governments and corporations, among them a handful of megacompanies whose powers nearly match those of governments.
Why am I so pessimistic? Over the last year, as part of the New York Times opinion section’s privacy project, I’ve participated in experiments in which my devices were closely monitored in order to determine the kind of data that was being collected about me. The experiments have given me new insight into the psychology underpinning surveillance; I’ve realized how blind we are to the kinds of insights tech companies are gaining about us through our gadgets. Our blindness not only keeps us glued to privacy-invading tech — it also means that we’ve failed to create a political culture that is in any way up to the task of limiting surveillance.
That’s why, across the species, whether under American or European democracy or Chinese authoritarianism, few of our cultural or political institutions are even much trying to tamp down the surveillance state.
In China, the government is building a frightening surveillance dragnet in broad daylight, stitching together facial recognition, fingerprint and other databases into an all-seeing eye aiming to closely watch more than a billion citizens.
Yet the United States and other supposedly liberty-loving Western democracies have not ruled out such a future. Just consider the odd politics surrounding privacy invasion. Donald Trump and his supporters repeatedly argue that the FBI is corrupt and untrustworthy. Yet, like Barack Obama before him, Trump and the Justice Department are pushing Apple to create a backdoor into the data on encrypted iPhones — they want the untrustworthy FBI and any local cop to be able to see everything inside anyone’s phone.
Apple, mercifully, is resisting, just as it did the request of Obama’s Justice Department to create a loophole in iPhone security — but the fact that both Obama and Trump agreed on the need for breaking iPhone encryption suggests how thoroughly political leaders across a wide spectrum have neglected privacy as a fundamental value worthy of protection.
Indeed, because of a dearth of laws protecting our privacy — and almost no high-profile political discussion about the stakes at hand — Americans are sleepwalking into a future nearly as frightening as the one the Chinese are constructing. I choose the word “sleepwalking” deliberately, because when it comes to digital privacy, a lot of us prefer the comfortable bliss of ignorance. As a result, much of the surveillance engine operates underground — just beyond where many of us dare to look.
In recent months, my colleagues at the New York Times and other media outlets have published a series of shattering investigations into modern digital surveillance. Among other revelations: Advertising companies and data brokers are keeping insanely close tabs on smartphones’ location data, tracking users so precisely that their databases could arguably compromise national security or political liberty. There are few meaningful checks on scanning for people using facial recognition, genetic profiles or other biometric data. Tracking technologies have become cheap and widely available — for less than $100, my colleagues were able to identify people walking by surveillance cameras in Bryant Park in Manhattan.
A week ago, the Times’ Kashmir Hill reported on a company called Clearview AI that has created a tool that “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously.” By scraping pictures from Facebook, YouTube and other websites to create a huge database of faces, the company lets cops identify people just by snapping a photo. It’s Shazam for faces, not very different from the kind of facial recognition tools we worry the authorities may be using in China — and even though hundreds of police departments may have access to it, almost no one outside the company understands how it works.
The Clearview AI story suggests another reason to worry that our march into surveillance has become inexorable: Each new privacy-invading technology builds on a previous one, allowing for scary outcomes from new integrations and collections of data that few users might have anticipated.
I was recently confronted by this sort of cascade with my own smartphone tracking data. Late last year, with the help of Stuart Thompson, an opinion editor, I set up my phone to monitor how certain apps were tracking me. I focused on apps that required me to grant them access to my physical location — among them apps to find cheap gas, coupons and nearby retail discounts, and to otherwise help me navigate and find deals as I wandered about the world.
The upshot: As the location-tracking apps followed me, I was able to capture the pings they sent to online servers — essentially recording their spying. I sent the data to Stuart and his team, who interpreted and mapped the pings the apps had collected about me. Their picture shocked me; the apps had followed me far more closely, capturing much more data and far more often, than I had imagined when I’d said yes to their tracking.
Like a lot of people, I’ve long justified my apathy about privacy through innocence: I’m a stand-up guy — what do I have to hide?
But looking at the God’s-eye-view that a few coupon apps can glean about me, I can no longer pretend I’ve got nothing to worry about. Sure, I’m not a criminal — but do I want anyone to learn everything about me? And more to the point: Is it wise for us to let any entity learn everything about everyone?
Because those are the stakes. The remaining uncertainty about the surveillance state is not whether we will submit to it — only how readily and completely, and how thoroughly it will warp our society.
Will we allow the government and corporations unrestricted access to every bit of data we ever generate, or will we decide that some kinds of collections, like the encrypted data on your phone, should be forever off limits, even when a judge has issued a warrant for it?
In the future, will there be room for any true secret — will society allow any unrecorded thought or communication to evade detection and commercial analysis? And, if there can be no more secrets, how will we account for what we lose? How completely will living under surveillance numb creativity and silence radical thought? Can human agency survive the possibility that some companies will know more about all of us than any of us can ever know about ourselves?
I’m worried we’ll soon be forced to find out.

Krugman: Trump abuses his tariff power, too

Autor: Krugman, Paul.

Texto completo: So here’s the story: Donald Trump has abused the powers of his office to threaten a U.S. ally. His threat is probably illegal; his refusal to produce documents about his decision process is definitely illegal. And his claims about the motivation for his actions don’t pass the laugh test.
You probably think that I’m talking about Trump’s attempt to pressure Ukraine into producing political dirt on Joe Biden by withholding aid, and the subsequent cover-up — you know, the stuff for which he has been impeached (and that half the country believes should lead to his removal from office). But there’s another, somewhat similar story: his repeated threats to impose prohibitive tariffs on imports of automobiles from Europe.
Granted, the auto tariff story isn’t as vile as the Ukraine story, and it poses less of a direct threat to a fair election. But it’s recognizably part of the same syndrome: abuse of presidential power, contempt for the rule of law and dishonesty about motivations.
Some background: U.S. tariffs — taxes on imports — are normally set the same way we set other taxes, through legislation that must pass Congress and then be signed by the president. The law does, however, give the president discretion to impose temporary tariffs under certain circumstances, for example to give U.S. industries breathing space in the face of sudden import surges, to counter foreign export subsidies or to protect national security (Section 232).
Until Trump, Section 232 cases were rare. He has, however, used the national security justification for tariffs with abandon and zero regard for plausibility. Canadian aluminum poses a national security risk? Really?
And so it was that in 2018 the Trump administration announced that it was beginning a Section 232 investigation of auto imports, especially from Europe and Japan. Every trade expert I know considered the notion that German or Japanese cars constitute a threat to national security absurd. Nonetheless, in 2019 a report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports do, indeed, endanger national security.
What was the basis for this conclusion? Well, we don’t actually know — because the Trump administration has refused to release the report.
This stonewalling is clearly illegal. The statute requires that all portions of the Commerce report that don’t contain classified or proprietary information be published in the Federal Register, and it’s hard to believe that any of the report contains such information, let alone the whole thing. Furthermore, Congress inserted a provision in a spending bill last month specifically requiring that the Trump administration turn over the report.
Why won’t Trump obey the law and hand over the document? My guess is that his people are afraid to let anyone see the Commerce report because it’s embarrassingly thin and incompetent. To be honest, I have some doubts about whether the report even exists. Remember, the Commerce Department is run by Wilbur Ross, whom readers of my New York Times colleague Gail Collins voted Trump’s worst Cabinet member, which is quite a distinction given the competition.
Beyond all that, why does Trump even want to impose tariffs on European cars? Obviously it has nothing to do with national security. But what’s it really about?
Part of the answer may be that the self-proclaimed Tariff Man still believes that protectionism will revive U.S. manufacturing, even though the evidence says that his trade war had the opposite effect.
Beyond that, it appears that Trump tried to use the threat of auto tariffs to bludgeon European nations into backing him up in his confrontation with Iran. This is, by the way, a clear violation both of U.S. law, which does not give the president discretion to impose tariffs for reasons unrelated to economics, and of our international agreements, which prohibit this kind of bullying.
And remember, the nations Trump was trying to bully are or were among our most important allies, part of the coalition of democracies we used to call the Free World. These days, our erstwhile allies can no longer consider America a reliable partner, on trade or anything else. Of course, that probably doesn’t bother Trump, who prefers autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman.
So how should we think about the auto tariff saga? At one level it’s part of the broader story of Trump’s trade war, which has raised prices for American consumers, hurt U.S. businesses and farmers and deterred business investment by creating uncertainty.
But these economic considerations are, I’d argue, much less important than the political aspects. Trump’s scofflaw behavior with regard to auto tariffs is part of a broader pattern of abuse of power and contempt for the rule of law. On every front, Trump treats U.S. policy as a tool he can deploy as he chooses, in his own interests, without seeking congressional approval or even informing Congress about what he’s doing or why.
Basically, the man in the White House operates on the principle that l’état, c’est Trump. It’s a principle nobody who believes in American ideals should accept.

On Day Off From Impeachment Trial, Senators Campaign Frantically in Iowa; Trial has kept the 2020 Democratic senators off the campaign trail at a pivotal time

Texto completo: Jody Dvorak worried Elizabeth Warren might cancel on her.
After all, the senior senator from Massachusetts is campaigning for president while serving as a juror in President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate—only the third time in U.S. history that the chamber-turned-courtroom has undertaken such a task.
"I wondered and I thought she'd make the best decision on what to do. And I thought if she couldn't come, then that's OK," said Ms. Dvorak, 57, who has been following the trial on television. "If we can't get [Trump] out of office, the next best thing is for [Warren] to be here when she can and meet people. And then she can go on to beat him" in the general election, Ms. Dvorak said.
Ms. Warren is one of four Senate Democrats running for president even as Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, which began with a marathon start last week, unfolds. A consequence of campaigning while she has a day job: Ms. Warren was forced to cancel a Saturday event in Burlington, Iowa, missing an opportunity to convince undecided Iowans to back her and energize those who already support her. But the Senate trial adjourned early enough Saturday afternoon for Ms. Warren to fly from the nation's capital to Muscatine—not far from Ms. Dvorak's corn and soybean farm—for an evening town hall. And she added one unscheduled event to her Saturday plans.
Ms. Warren was joined by Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado in making a mad dash back to Iowa and New Hampshire for a weekend blitz of campaigning before the trial resumes Monday. Iowa and New Hampshire are the first two states to vote in the Democratic primary.
The impeachment trial has kept the 2020 Democratic senators off the campaign trail at a pivotal time: The party's balloting process will kick off in eight days when Iowans begin their all-important caucuses . In their absence, two out-of-work politicians—former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both leading presidential contenders—have been campaigning in earnest.
When trial proceedings ended earlier than expected Saturday, Mr. Sanders's team in Iowa scrambled to turn a surrogate event into one that could host the candidate. A big screen had been the centerpiece of the room so Mr. Sanders could live stream in, but now that he could make the evening event in Marshalltown, Iowa, they needed to deal with the screen. They put up a slide urging people to commit to caucus for him and rearranged chairs so it was no longer the main attraction. Mr. Sanders had been forced to cancel a rally earlier in the week when it became clear the trial would keep him in Washington too late.
"I am really delighted to be here tonight. You don't know how delighted I am because last night I didn't know that I would be here," Mr. Sanders told supporters in Ames, Iowa, later Saturday evening. The next day he added two more events to his schedule.
"The schedule we had planned for Iowa is now in the garbage can, and we had to rewrite it very quickly," Mr. Sanders said Sunday at a campaign event in Storm Lake. "I have zero idea what's going to be happening this week or perhaps future weeks." He said he if his schedule permits, he hopes to come back this week, "and I certainly hope to be here for our victory celebration."
Mr. Bennet, a lower-tier candidate, booked tickets on three separate flights to New Hampshire—around 2 p.m., 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.—because he didn't know what time the trial session would end Saturday, according to a senior campaign aide.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think the impeachment trial is affecting the senators in the presidential race? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Thankfully for him, each ticket was refundable. "He was able to take the earliest one up to Manchester after the trial adjourned," the aide said.
Mr. Bennet, who has struggled in polling and fundraising and hasn't qualified for the party's debates since July, pulled back from other states to focus on New Hampshire, where he is banking on an upset victory to boost his campaign. He has pledged to host 50 town halls there before the state's Feb. 11 primary. As of Sunday, he has eight more to go. "Obviously, as you can imagine, impeachment makes that harder," his aide said.
In Washington, D.C., last week, Ms. Klobuchar, who is polling in fifth place in Iowa and New Hampshire but remains in single-digits, packed any window of time during which she wasn't in the trial with satellite interviews, tele-town halls and editorial boards interviews. On Friday, when the campaign got word the trial proceedings could end early Saturday, Ms. Klobuchar's Iowa team worked to expand her schedule. State Sen. Liz Mathis said she would host an event at her home outside of Cedar Rapids; more than 100 people showed up for the late afternoon gathering.
Voters were mostly understanding that the candidates needed to remain in Washington.
"He needs to be there, really he does," said Linda Wright, a 63-year-old librarian from Nevada, Iowa, who was backing Mr. Sanders. Ms. Wright said Mr. Sanders had plenty of people spreading his message in Iowa in his absence, including her.
And despite spending less time in the state, Mr. Sanders has been doing well in the polls here. A New York Times/Siena poll out Saturday had him 7 percentage points over his nearest rival, Mr. Buttigieg. However, other polls show other top-tier candidates leading or a much tighter race among Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren. While she hasn't led in recent polling, on Saturday, Ms. Warren received an endorsement from the Des Moines Register, and Ms. Klobuchar got the backing of the New Hampshire Union Leader, influential newspapers in their respective states.
All four of the senators, trying to stay front-of-mind with Democratic primary voters while they are away from campaigning, are increasingly taking satellite interviews with cable and network news hosts. Mr. Bennet, who has vowed not to do any fundraising during the Senate trial, is hosting videos with supporters on Facebook Live. Ms. Warren is posting pretaped videos—dubbed "Big Structural Conversations," after her campaign pledge to fight as president for big, structural change—on her social-media profiles.
Mr. Sanders has dispatched some of his top surrogates to campaign while he is in Washington, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an influential progressive congresswoman who drew what the Sanders campaign said was over 800 people for an event in Iowa City on Friday. Mr. Sanders called in on an aide's cellphone that was plugged into the audio system so he could address the crowd.
Ms. Warren has repeatedly said impeachment is "bigger than politics." She and her colleagues have vowed not to ditch the impeachment trial for campaign events, citing a duty to uphold their oath of office. Still, arriving in Iowa after days of sitting silently at her desk on the Senate floor, Ms. Warren gave a hint as to which venue she preferred.
"Good to be in Muscatine," she told reporters. "Good not to be in Washington."

Texto completo: Seattle Seahawks
COMING UP
Today: Pro Bowl, noon
TV: ESPN/ABC/NFL
SEATTLE - Russell Wilson tweeted the other day that it "makes me sick" not to be still playing in pursuit of a Super Bowl title.
The Seahawks quarterback did just about everything humanly possible to try to get his team there. The next few months in these parts will be spent agonizing over what went wrong, where the team's deficiencies lie, and what can be done to correct them. The process is already underway in full force.
But the Seahawks' premature ouster in Green Bay does allow one unique but ever-constant phase of their calendar to commence, in all its glory.
I'm talking, of course, about the unleashing of Off-Season Russ, the coolest, weirdest cat on Earth.
He's a decidedly different fellow than the buttoned-up, cliché-ridden, so-called Stepford Quarterback to whom we become accustomed from August through January (or, optimally, early February).
You know the persona I'm talking about: "Typical boring Russell. Robot Russell."
Don't get offended. Those are Wilson's own words, in a video he put out in 2018 to introduce a character he dubbed "Mr. Unlimited," which he described as his alter ego.
"You got to be unlimited. You got to have a thought process of being unlimited," Wilson explained, sort of. "So when people ask you what you're thinking about or what you want to do in life or where you want to go, tell them I'm unlimited. You know what I mean."
Well, not exactly, if truth be told. But Mr. Unlimited, in fact, is a perfect representation of Off-Season Russ - the Notorious OSR. A little bizarre, but ultimately endearing.
Once unencumbered by the immediate pressure and responsibility of winning games, Wilson seems determined to, in the words of a recent New York Times article, "let his goofball flag fly."
He'll make you raise your eyebrows, for sure, and maybe shake your head, but try to keep from smiling when his next way-out-there Instagram, Twitter or Snapchat post arrives. I'll let you decide if you're laughing with him or at him.
You can see already Wilson shaking off the rust from Off-Season Russ during the lead-up to today's Pro Bowl, during which he'll be quarterbacking the NFC squad. There are the videos of him attempting witty repartee during an NFC workout, the picture of him cheekily wearing Ciara's sunglasses, the photo of him sporting what appears to be a man bun.
Trying out hairdos and assorted costumes, incidentally, is a key element of Off-Season Russ. Who can forget OSR sporting a jaunty top hat while attending the Royal Ascot horse race in London in June 2018, or posting an animated video of himself dressed as a bunny, chanting "Welcome to my Snapchat" when he first joined that platform?
You never know where Off-Season Russ will show up via social media - and these are all real, from years past: flipping pancakes with Jeff Bezos; in the pits at a Canadian Formula One Grand Prix race; hanging out with Justin Timberlake at his album release or Snoop Dogg at the Super Bowl; filming a sketch for Joel McHale's Netflix show; getting slimed as host of the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards; piloting Ciara on a helicopter ride around Seattle on "date night," walking with her down the red carpet at the Academy Awards, or dancing with her on top of a hill in Cape Town, South Africa.
I'm eagerly waiting to see what exotic locales the Wilsons will visit, what tony events they'll frequent, and what A-list celebrities they'll rub elbows with between now and training camp. You never know quite what accent, inflection or tone of voice Wilson is going to use, either. That's an equal part of the intrigue.
The classic of the genre, of course, occurred last April, after Wilson signed a record $140 million, four-year contract with a $65 million signing bonus and $107 million guaranteed.
Wilson appeared on Twitter, in bed with Ciara late at night, bare-chested, announcing in a smoky, Barry White voice, "Hey Seattle, we got a deal."
It was an "I don't believe what I just saw" moment. That video immediately became a meme, and imitations were rampant - including one memorable one by Seattle teammates D.J. Fluker and Tyler Lockett.
Who knows what Off-Season Russ has in store for 2020? Maybe this is the year he tries to unicycle or hot-air balloon or sing opera. I can't wait to find out.
It's a guarantee there will be posts galore of him training, working out, throwing the football, pumping iron, with and without teammates.
Another certainty: Eagle-eyed fans will study those videos and photos like the Zapruder film and claim to find evidence that Wilson has become a little thicker, or a little slower. And then he'll come back in September in optimal shape and have another stellar season.
At that point, of course, Wilson will bid a fond adieu to Off-Season Russ, along with the rest of us, and reassume his straight-laced alter ego: Robot Russell. The top hat goes back into the closet, the dancing shoes come off, and the soundtrack is set permanently on "earnest, supportive teammate with a laser focus on playing football."
I don't know about you, but I'm going to soak it up while I can. OSR, let loose that hot-air balloon.

Lunar New Year celebrations canceled Local Chinese association pulls plug on celebrations due to coronavirus concerns

Texto completo: The Spokane Chinese Association made the difficult decision to cancel its Lunar New Year festivities after a number of community members raised concerns about the coronavirus outbreak.
"It's a big, hard, painful decision for us," said Spokane Chinese Association President Ping Ping.
More than 1,300 people have been infected with coronavirus, leading to 56 deaths, since the outbreak began in December in Wuhan, China, the New York Times reported. It's led to school closures and travel restrictions in China.
The first case in the U.S. was confirmed in Snohomish County on Tuesday in a man who had just returned from Wuhan.
Ping said a community member raised concerns to the Spokane Chinese Association board on Tuesday about potential public health concerns related to the Snohomish County case. Ping said some people in Spokane's Chinese American community have relatives in China who are working in hospitals responding to the outbreak but are otherwise unaffected.
Ping said she spoke Wednesday with a Centers for Disease Control official who assured her there was no public health concern. But on Friday, with community members continuing to remain concerned about the virus, Ping said eight of nine board members voted to cancel the event.
"We think this is good for public health," said Ping, who thought the atmosphere at the celebration might have been somber if it continued as scheduled. "It's a wise decision."
Organizers of a similar celebration on Saturday in Sammamish also canceled due to concerns about the virus, but other Seattle-area lunar events continued as scheduled, the Seattle Times reported.
The event scheduled to take place at University High School was to include a cultural fair, calligraphy demonstrations, music and dance performances and, for the first time, storytelling. The event drew several hundred people last year at a smaller location.
Ping said around 70 people showed up to the high school on Saturday after her organization did its best to notify people about the cancellation Friday night.
"We can tell they're disappointed," Ping said of people who came to the school, as well as others who commented on social media.
Ping said she hopes to reschedule the Spokane event for after the coronavirus outbreak's projected peak in March.
"Hopefully we can do it in the springtime," Ping said.

Texto completo: THE BIRTHDAY BUNCH
Sportscaster-actor Bob Uecker is 85. Actor Scott Glenn is 81. Activist Angela Davis is 76. Producer-director Mimi Leder is 68. Rock singer-musician Eddie Van Halen is 65. Actress-comedian-talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is 62. Hockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky is 59. Gospel singer Kirk Franklin is 50. Actress Matilda Szydagis is 46. NBA player Vince Carter is 43. Actor Colin O'Donoghue is 39.
PEOPLE
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lashed out in anger Saturday at an NPR reporter who accused him of shouting expletives at her after she asked him in an interview about Ukraine. In a direct and personal attack, America's chief diplomat said the journalist had "lied" to him and he called her conduct "shameful."
NPR said it stood by Mary Louise Kelly's reporting.
Pompeo claimed in a statement the incident was "another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt" President Donald Trump and his administration. Pompeo, a former CIA director and Republican congressman from Kansas who is one of Trump's closest allies in the Cabinet, asserted, "It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity."
It is extraordinary for a secretary of state to make such a personal attack on a journalist, but he is following the lead of Trump, who has repeatedly derided what he calls "fake news" and ridiculed individual reporters. In one of the more memorable instances, Trump mocked a New York Times reporter with a physical disability.
Marley's kids celebrate late reggae icon's 75th birthday
At a celebration for Bob Marley's 75th birth anniversary, the late icon's children - famous in their own right - gathered to tell stories about the reggae king and discuss passing the musical torch to their own children.
Bob Marley's children, including Cedella Marley, Julian Marley and Rohan Marley, and several of his grandchildren held a pre-Grammys brunch Friday alongside Universal Music and Mastercard in Los Angeles - about two weeks before the Jamaican singer's Feb. 6 birthdate. Bob Marley died of cancer in 1981, at age 36.
The event also celebrated Julian Marley, who is nominated for best reggae album at Sunday's Grammy Awards.
Cedella Marley, a three-time Grammy winner, said her father, who died in 1981, taught his children important lessons about perseverance.
"Daddy was a fitness guru  and there were times when we would do these relay races and a lot of parents just want their children to win, win, win. No, we had to really win," she said. "If we run, we have to really run. And he was not the one that was just going to let you win just because, and I think that's an important lesson. Nothing is handed to you, you have to go out there (and work hard)."
Bob Marley's kids passed that message on to their own children, who were in attendance Friday. Skip Marley, Cedella Marley's son who has collaborated with Katy Perry, H.E.R. and Major Lazer, said he didn't choose music, but "music chose me."

Texto completo: The divide is widening. The gulf is deepening. What media outlet you trust is more and more a matter of your ideology. And as hard as it might be to admit, it looks like President Trump is enjoying some success with his scorched-earth campaigns against such mainstream media giants as The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.
Those are some of the darker conclusions I came to after going inside the numbers on a study released Friday by the non-partisan Pew Research Center titled "U.S. Media and the 2020 Election: A Nation Divided."
Data showing how polarized we are might not seem like news to some, but Pew's evidence of erosion in trust in institutions that practice fact-based journalism is troubling to me, especially when it can be linked to the president's war on truth. And the erosion is not only with the hardcore Trump base. According to this study, it also involves Republican-leaning independents.
"As the U.S. enters a heated 2020 presidential election year, a new Pew Research Center report finds that Republicans and Democrats place their trust in two nearly inverse news media environments," the study states.
"Moreover, evidence suggests that partisan polarization in the use and trust of media sources has widened in the past five years. A comparison to a similar study by the center of web-using U.S. adults in 2014 finds that Republicans have grown increasingly alienated from most of the more established sources, while Democrats' confidence in them remains stable, and in some cases, has strengthened," the report concludes.
I tried to find something hopeful in the suggestion that while some Republicans have turned away from the pillars of fact-based journalism in the Trump era, some Democrats have come to embrace those outlets more than ever. That's at least a wash, right?
Not exactly when you track the differences in levels of distrust found in a 2014 Pew study versus this one, which was conducted in October and November 2019.
"Most of the movement over these five years has come from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents increasing their distrust of many of the more traditional outlets tied to legacy platforms like network TV and print newspapers," the report says.
For example, distrust of CNN among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents rose from 33% in 2014 to 58% today. That loss of 25 percentage points is among the largest of any included in the report. CNN has been the primary target of Trump's "fake news" attacks.
For the Washington Post, the percentage of distrust increased from 22% to 39%. Distrust of The New York Times went from 29% to 42% during the last five years. Two more of the president's favorite targets.
"Among those that have seen the largest erosion are those decried by President Trump," is the way the report makes the connection between Trump's attacks and the loss of confidence among Republicans in the three news sites.
The study also cited a previous Pew report that found "within the Republican Party, approval of Donald Trump aligns with much greater animosity toward news organizations and journalists."
There was essentially nothing like the increase in distrust among Republicans on the Democratic side, which was described in the report as "remarkably stable" across the five years.
"One exception is the Sean Hannity radio show, where distrust among Democrats increased moderately from 32 to 38%" for the daily radio show hosted by the prime-time star of Fox News, the report said.
It also noted that distrust of Breitbart News jumped from 7% to 36%, but pointed out that the percentage of increase could have been skewed by the fact that in 2014 only 10% of the Democrats interviewed had heard of Breitbart compared to 42% now.
That is likely the most important factor. But based on my observation, Breitbart has gone all in with Trump is recent years, slamming his detractors and opponents, while wildly praising the president and his allies. A Breitbart headline emailed this week referred to U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chief floor manager prosecuting Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, as "Pencil Neck." Such partisan rhetoric could also be driving some of that distrust among Democrats who have actually consumed Breitbart content.
Under the heading "The Fox News phenomenon," the report says, "In the more compact Republican media ecosystem, one outlet towers above all others: Fox News. It would be hard to overstate its connection as a trusted go-to source of political news for Republicans. About two-thirds (65%) of Republicans and Republican leaners say they trust Fox News as a source. Additionally, 60% say they got political or election news there in the past week."
The report shows CNN as the inverse go-to site for Democrats and independents leaning toward the left.
"Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, CNN (67%) is about as trusted a source of information as Fox News is among Republicans," Pew says. "The cable network is also Democrats' most commonly turned to source for political and election news, with about half (53%) saying they got news there in the past week. The big difference is that while no other source comes close to rivaling Fox News' appeal to Republicans, a number of sources other than CNN are also highly trusted and frequently used by Democrats."
Those sources are: NBC News (61%), ABC News (60%), CBS News (59%), PBS (56%), New York Times (53%), BBC (48%), MSNBC (48%), Washington Post (47%), and NPR and Time magazine (46%).
Enhancing the credibility of the Pew findings for me is the way they sync up with a Gallup survey from 2019 examining overall trust in mass media among Democrats, Republicans and Independents. That report showed only 15% of Republicans trusting mass media, one point up from the all time low of 14% following the 2016 election, which featured daily assaults by Trump on legacy news operations like CNN and the Times.
"Republicans became increasingly mistrustful of the media in 2016 when Trump was campaigning for president and was sharply critical of the media's coverage of him," the Gallup report says.
Meanwhile, trust among Democrats was at 69% in 2019. Two Americas, for sure.
"Americans' trust in the media has been eroding over time, but in the current highly polarized climate, the views of political partisans have become increasingly divergent," according to Gallup. "President Donald Trump's description of the media as 'the enemy of the people' has undoubtedly colored the views of all Americans."
How low will trust go among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents during the 2020 campaign? As president, Trump has far more weapons today with which to attack mainstream journalistic outlets than he did as a candidate.
Beyond his vast arsenal of White House communications tools, the loyalty of the number one cable news channel in Fox News and radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh, the president now has podcasters like former Breitbart chairman and Trump strategist Steve Bannon, along with what the Washington Post described as a "loyal army" of regional talk show hosts, pumping out his messages on an hourly basis.
Furthermore, there are new cable channels like OAN (One America News Network) even more slavishly devoted to the president and his re-election than Fox News and Fox Business. And what about that gang of social media operatives known for faked videos and far-right views that the president invited to the White House in July? His message to them: Do your thing in the 2020 election; I've got your back.
And that only starts to describe what fact-based journalism is going to be up against in this election.
Like I said, I tried to find something hopeful in the latest news from Pew.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - There is no Spanish translation for a caucus, that political process particular to just a few states. It is simply "el caucus."
But for many Latinos in Iowa, el caucus is hardly simple. The state's Latino population has surged in recent decades, with the number registered to vote estimated at more than 50,000, making it a potentially important bloc in the fast-approaching Democratic caucuses. And local leaders like Vanessa Marcano-Kelly believe there are not nearly enough Spanish-tailored caucus sites or interpreters to meet the need in the state.
"I feel like this year everyone has been talking about how Iowa is superwhite, but it's really not superwhite to me," said Marcano-Kelly, who petitioned the state Democratic Party to create caucus sites in Spanish. "I see Latinos everywhere."
It is the first Iowa caucus for Marcano-Kelly, 34. In 2016, she watched from the sidelines, slightly bewildered at the spectacle and wondering how people could possibly understand if they did not speak English. As she wrote in her application months ago to the state Democratic Party, the Spanish sites would "ensure that the voices of all people can really be heard."
So on Feb. 3, the doors will open at the South Suburban YMCA in Des Moines for hundreds of Spanish-speaking caucusgoers.
Marcano-Kelly has been refreshing her Spanish vocabulary as she searches for the right words - some easier (viable is "viable"), some more obscure (threshold is "límite").
Although Latinos make up just 6% of Iowa's population, they have more than doubled in the state in the last two decades.
In nearly a dozen towns throughout the state, Latinos now make up more than one-third of the population. And since 2016, the League of United Latin American Citizens has worked to get thousands more registered to vote, a number the group estimates has now grown to 53,000.
Roughly 194,000 Latinos live in the state, and by most estimates, fewer than 3,000 participated in the 2016 caucuses. This year, Latino activists expect that number to grow to 20,000 or more. And for the first time, there are set to be six Spanish satellite caucus sites, a concession Democratic Party officials made to try to increase participation.
But despite the efforts, many activists believe there are not nearly enough interpreters lined up for the caucuses. Party officials are still scrambling to find bilingual speakers to run the Spanish caucuses, even as they look for more Spanish speakers to volunteer at other sites throughout the state.
And while some campaigns plan to send Spanish-speaking volunteers to towns where Latinos make up more than one-third of the population, there is no clear system to ensure that Spanish-speaking caucusgoers will have interpretation services.
"Whatever the number is, I think it would be impossible to have enough to meet the need," said Rob Barron, a Polk County school board member who runs a group dedicated to electing more Latinos to office. "Even if you're a native English speaker, the process is intimidating. So for those who are willing to walk into that room without speaking the language, then hear words like viable, it's only going to get more and more chaotic and confusing."
When the Democratic Party put a call out for applications for satellite caucuses that could be held away from traditional geographic precincts, Marcano-Kelly knew that she would write one for Spanish. She thought of several of her friends who recently became citizens but do not speak English as well as many Puerto Ricans she knows who moved to Iowa after Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.
After submitting the satellite application, Marcano-Kelly decided she would become the precinct captain for Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, in charge of rounding up supporters who come to the Spanish caucus. But in recent days she has found herself grappling with whether her primary responsibility lies with the campaign or individual voters.
Evidence of a booming Latino population can be seen in pockets all over the state, including Des Moines, where Latinos make up 12% of the city's population and 26% of public school students. In recent years, Mexicans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans have settled here, many moving from California, Illinois and Texas.
Showing up to places where Latinos congregate has been a part of the strategy for some of the campaigns and the League of United Latin American Citizens, more commonly known as LULAC, which has led the effort to register more Latinos. The group has held voter registration drives at stores and sponsored several mock caucus trainings in the state.

Texto completo: The new caravan is the largest since
Mexico strengthened border security.
A new caravan of several thousand Central American migrants crossed into southern Mexico earlier this week after forming in Honduras and traveling on foot through Guatemala.
The caravan clashed with authorities at the border between Guatemala and Honduras and again at the border between Mexico and Guatemala, according to media reports.
Here's what we know about the latest caravan, the first in 2020, a presidential election year in the United States.
The new caravan followed a lull in caravan activity since several large caravans angered President Donald Trump in 2018 and early 2019, prompting him to order the deployment of about 5,000 national guard troops to assist the Border Patrol on the southwest border with Mexico.
The new caravan also is the largest since Mexico, under pressure from the U.S., has strengthened border security along its southern border with Guatemala to block Central American migrants from traveling through the country.
Where did it form? The caravan formed in San Pedro Sula, a small city in northern Honduras known for high rates of gang-related crime, and set off during the week of Jan. 12.
Traveling on foot and by hitchhiking, the caravan grew in size as it moved through Honduras before reaching the border with Guatemala, where Honduran police fired tear gas to try and stop migrants from continuing, The New York Times reported.
The caravan then moved through Guatemala, arriving at a bridge in Tecun Uman that spans the Suchiate River, which divides Guatemala from Mexico.
Mexican authorities closed a fence on the bridge, blocking about 4,000 migrants from crossing. Mexican authorities refused a petition presented by the migrants asking Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador for permission to pass through Mexico so they could reach the U.S.
About 1,000 migrants went around the bridge and waded across the low Suchiate River to cross over from Guatemala to Mexico.
Video posted on social media showed migrants streaming across the river on Monday and then rushing up the banks attempting to evade hundreds of Mexican national guard troops that tried to block them with shields.
Chaos ensued with video showing migrants and national guard troops throwing rocks at each other.
Mexico's government announced Tuesday that the caravan had been mostly stopped and that several hundred migrants had been deported to Honduras by plane and by bus, Reuters reported.
Is the caravan still headed toward the U.S.? On Thursday, hundreds of migrants left Ciudad Hidalgo on Mexico's border with Guatemala and began walking northward on a highway toward Tapachula.
But before reaching Tapachula, the caravan was stopped on the highway by hundreds of national guard troops in riot gear.
Video posted on social media shows the migrants standing their ground as the phalanx of national guard troops armed with batons marches towards them with shields up. The national guard troops then push through the crowd, firing pepper spray.
Mexico's National Migration Institute said Thursday that 800 Central American migrants had been apprehended and taken by bus to shelters. Immigration authorities were trying to find another 200 migrants that fled, the agency said.
Irineo Mujica, an organizer with the humanitarian group Pueblos Sin Fronteras, said Friday the caravan had been halted for now. The group had been monitoring movement of the caravan and response by Mexican authorities.
When asked via the text messaging app WhatsApp if any migrants were still walking north, Mujica responded, "No there is no caravan it was disolved."
What has been the response from the U.S.? The Trump administration has sent "dozens" of Department of Homeland Security personnel to Central America to help local immigration authorities and security forces stop the caravans, DHS Acting Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement Wednesday.
Wolf praised Mexico's government response to the caravan.
"The efforts by the Mexican National Guard and other officials have thus far been effective at maintaining the integrity of their border, despite outbreaks of violence and lawlessness by people who are attempting to illegally enter Mexico on their way to the United States," Wolf said.
In June, the Mexican government deployed several thousand national guard troops to Mexico's southern border after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican imports to the U.S.
Mexico has deployed national guard troops to its northern border to help immigration authorities apprehended Central American migrants attempting to reach the U.S.
The United States has begun flying migrants from Honduras and El Salvador who had sought asylum in this country to Guatemala as part of a new "Asylum Cooperative Agreement" with the government of Guatemala.
Under the agreement, more than 200 Salvadoran and Honduran asylum-seekers, including more than 50 children, have been flown to Guatemala, CBS News reported.
The U.S. in 2019 also implemented a program that forces asylum-seeking migrants from Central America to wait in border communities in Mexico for a court hearing in the U.S. Under the policy, known as Migrant Protection Protocols, more than 56,000 asylum-seekers have been sent to Mexico to await immigration hearings in the U.S.
What prompted the latest caravan? The latest caravan shows how many Central Americans are desperate to escape "overwhelming violence and crippling poverty," despite efforts by the U.S. and Mexico to stop them, said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group.
The use of force by Mexican national guard troops to stop the caravan is alarming, she said.
"I think we have seen real concerns of excessive use of force by Mexico's military forces not trained with how to deal with vulnerable populations," Meyer said.
The timing of the latest caravan seems suspicious, said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University who studies how caravans form.
Some have speculated that caravan was designed to draw attention away from Trump's impeachment trial and bolster support for Trump and his policies cracking down on Central American migrants during a presidential election year, she said.
There was similar speculation that the caravans that formed in 2018 were intended to motivate Trump's base to vote in the 2018 mid-term elections to shore up support for Republican candidates, but Democrats ended up taking control of the House of Representatives.
On the other hand, there is also speculation that the caravan was designed to provoke criticism of Trump's policies and Mexico buckling to pressure from the U.S. to stop the movement of Central Americans migrants, she said.
"I cannot say with certainty who is behind this," she said, "but there are a lot of people who are benefiting from supporting the caravans" at the expense of migrants.

Texto completo: Coco Cohen is a triathlete. She has competed in Ironman competitions, has a black belt in karate and is a trained sword fighter.
But nothing could quite prepare her for the trials of shouting at top volume all day, several days a week, to her classes at New York City's Columbus Circle Equinox health club, where she is a manager and group fitness instructor. It turns out that shouting repeated encouragements during spin class - "Rise out of the saddle and push!" or "Trust yourself!" - is an occupational hazard.
"I sounded like Kathleen Turner on a downward spiral," said Cohen, who, in a compounding irony, is also a trained professional singer. As her voice grew huskier and the nodes on her vocal cords grew more callused, it took just one cough - the kind you make when water goes down the wrong pipe - for Cohen to get vocal paralysis. She could barely speak above a whisper, if at all, and had the same type of surgery that Julie Andrews had in 1997 after starring in "Victor/Victoria" on Broadway. (Andrews' surgery was botched and left her unable to sing, but Cohen described hers as successful.)
Talk to surgeons and speech language pathologists, and you quickly learn that there's a whole universe of professionals at risk for vocal damage whose job descriptions, technically, do not emphasize the use of their voices at all. Like teachers, for instance. Also lawyers. And a growing number of group fitness instructors like Cohen.
"This is a group that is so mindful of being healthy and taking care of their bodies, but their voices are really neglected," said Leanne Goldberg, director of Grabscheid Voice and Swallowing Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
Comprehensive data on this particular population is limited, but a small body of evidence suggests that fitness instructors are now among those at high risk. In 2016, Christine Estes, a speech language pathologist at the Weill Cornell Medicine Sean Parker Institute for the Voice, noticed that her patients featured a recurring cast of fitness instructors. She decided to conduct a study of them over a two-year period. What she discovered amazed her: They had polyps. They had nodules. They had hemorrhages. Real damage to the vocal cords that needed real treatment. All 24 were referred for behavioral treatment, and 10 opted to have surgery.
Instructors typically average around 15 classes per week, some starting as early as 5 a.m. Many lead several classes back-to-back, with almost no breaks in between. Throughout the day, they're shouting directives - often while demonstrating the moves they're describing - over loud, upbeat music and, in some cases, competing with the noise coming from treadmills, stationary bikes and clanging weights.
Most of all, they're motivating their clients to push themselves, and that motivation generally takes the form of volume. And while most instructors do wear microphones, those devices may not help much if the studio has a low-quality sound system, or if the instructors don't know how to use them to their vocal advantage. A result: Many instructors compromise their vocal health by giving what is a very taxing performance.
Complicating matters even further, the fitness industry has grown more competitive in recent years - in no small part because gym members can rate their instructors online, leaving reviews that someone was "inspiring." As the industry becomes more exacting, so do instructors' appetites to be the very best at their jobs. New instructors "are hungry," Cohen said. "They'll teach class after class, and I've started to warn them: Your voice will be gone."
Patrick Frost, now a Nike Master trainer and the creator of Frostfit, started his fitness career nearly a decade ago at Barry's Bootcamp, a full-body treadmill-and-weights workout studio with locations around the world. He quickly rose through the ranks and, by his account, was teaching close to 22 classes per week.
"Talk to any other instructor," he says. "If you say you teach 22 Barry's Bootcamp classes a week, they'll tell you 'that's insane.' " Which is probably why, about two years into his job, Frost was frantically casting around for last-minute subs and calling in sick.
"Sometimes I'd wake up and not even know if I had a voice," he said. He soon discovered he had major vocal cord polyps, with some hemorrhaging. To conserve his voice, Frost often found himself choosing between his career and his social life. He eventually had surgery in 2015. As part of his recovery, Frost had to be diligent about his at-home exercises, warming up his voice by doing trills and repeating lines he'd say to his classes ("My name is Patrick Frost, Frost like the snowman") at various volumes and pitches.
Stories like Frost's are becoming more common as the industry expands. (According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for trainers is projected to grow 13% by 2028, faster than most occupations.) Take the case of Gerren Liles, for instance. He works not only for Equinox, but also for Mirror, a fitness startup that streams fitness classes right into a person's home (via a special wall-mounted mirror - hence the name). With that, Liles' class load went from 14 per week to 25. Even before joining Mirror, he had vocal problems, and his expanded schedule only exacerbated them. Liles said that when it became "really, really painful," he underwent surgery this past March.
Many fitness instructors work freelance and may not have health insurance that covers treatment for vocal injuries. If they defer treatment, the damage can get worse. Instructors and experts alike say that education about vocal health should be required for new hires.
Some trainers are taking the initiative independently. At Equinox Columbus Circle, for example, Cohen said that she and a colleague organized a few sessions for other instructors focused on vocal health and made some information available to other instructors online.
Practicing good vocal hygiene includes staying hydrated; keeping studio music at lower levels; reducing unnecessary patter; and, when possible, leaving space between classes. Most important, though, it means instructors must develop the same vocal habits as professional singers. Namely, they need to warm up. A few minutes of humming, lip trills or resonance exercises can go a long way. And Estes recommends keeping most headset microphones two finger-widths from the corner of the mouth, but this can vary based on the amplification system.
"You think you don't need something, like warming up your vocal cords or drinking that extra glass of water," Cohen said. "But you do."

Texto completo: It's a Wednesday afternoon, and Dorjan Puka, chef-owner of three popular West Hartford restaurants, is heading to Manhattan to cater a party for two dozen international diplomats at the apartment of Albania's U.N. ambassador, Besiana Kadare. Though his eateries are Italian, French and Middle Eastern, Puka himself is Albanian, and cooking for his country's ambassador is a patriotic errand. His Audi Q7 is crammed with wine glasses, table decorations, food in warming trays and a case of Montemeca wine, an Albanian red blend.
"The ambassador insisted on Albanian wine," the chef tells his assistant, Laura. Puka got tonight's gig when Kadare reached out through the friend of a friend. It's a haul, driving to New York to do a small party. "But I want to represent my country," he says.
Europe's most isolated nation was a challenging training ground for a future chef. "Albania was a poor country, without much meat, so you had to be creative," Puka recalls. "At night you had tea with bread and a bit of feta. My father would sauté the bread with oil and herbs. That was your dinner."
The Communist strongman, Enver Hoxha, ruled the country for decades, and his was the last Communist government in Europe to fall, in 1991. Puka was 16. "I was there when we tore down the monument to Hoxha. I was jumping on him!"
Western tourism poured into the capital, Tirana, and Puka quit college to work at an Italian restaurant. At 23, in a life-altering stroke of fortune, he won the coveted U.S. green-card lottery and decamped for this country with his fiancée (now wife), Mira. Puka spent 10 years as a chef in the Max Restaurant Group, and in 2011 opened Treva in West Hartford. Three restaurants later - including West Hartford's À Vert and Zohara - he's one of Connecticut's most successful restaurateurs. "I'm living the American dream," he loves to say.
Mired in traffic through the Bronx, the chef checks his watch. "We gotta stop at this pizza place, PQR. This guy, Angelo Iezzi, he's the best pizzaiolo in the world." Puka is the kind of chef who can't resist an eating detour. His phone buzzes; it's the ambassador. He speaks to her in Albanian and then English. "Besiana, don't worry, we'll get there!" He hangs up, looks at his watch again and grins. "We still gonna get pizza."
After the stop for a pork-belly-and-butternut-squash pizza, Team Puka finally makes it to the ambassador's East Side apartment building. In a cold and teeming rain they unload the car, piling everything on a pair of luggage trolleys and hauling it all up to the 40th floor. The apartment is tiny, with a regal view of the East River and the United Nations. The ambassador, a slender woman in her 40s, seems a nervous hostess, trailing the caterers with a Swiffer as they bring stuff in.
There is a special feng shui to setting up an elaborate cocktail party in a limited space, and Puka and Laura set to it, creating a lavish food display on the room's one small table. Four kinds of cheese, cut in cubes and arranged on a marble slab. A board laden with prosciutto. Figs coated in pistachios and mounted on sticks like popsicles.
Outside, night is falling, Manhattan twinkling through windows beaded with glittery rivulets. The ambassador requests a Coke and Jack Daniels ("Make it strong," Puka whispers to Laura) and carries it to the window. "This weather is terrible," she frets, gazing out. "What if no one comes?"
"Don't worry," Puka reassures her. "Besiana, you're gonna have the best party ever. Now you just gotta relax."
Finally, guests begin to arrive. The Canadian ambassador. The Slovenian ambassador. The American ambassador, Jonathan Cohen, who is tonight's guest of honor. The room fills with diplomats drinking Albanian wine and talking about summits and conferences. In the tiny kitchen, Puka arranges Albanian specialties on platters. Qofte pasha, a falafel-like dish. A hard cheese called kashkaval, akin to Gran Padano. Yogurt and halumi. Spinach-filled phyllo pastries known as byrek.
To the uninitiated, Albanian food might look a lot like Greek food. Puka scoffs. He seems to view the Balkans as a conspiracy by other countries - Greece especially - to take credit for Albanian accomplishments. "The Greeks, they stole everything from us and the Turks." Athens and Sparta bolstered their armies with Albanian mercenaries, he points out. "And you know who Alexander the Great's mother was? She was Albanian!"
In the crowded living room, the evening culminates with a toast to the American ambassador, who is leaving his post at the U.N. Kadare clinks a glass. "I want to say a few words to our friend," she announces, with a smile at Cohen. "Jonathan, you have done an outstanding job representing your country. You are a voice of reason, which at the U.N. is abig thing."
The remark garners a laugh from the diplomats. Ambassador Kadare brandishes a bottle of Arrabon, a walnut flavored raki provided by Puka. "This is a very strong Albanian grappa," she says, doling out shots of the tawny-colored liqueur. "It has a very nice effect on you."
After a round of shots and smartphone photos, the party begins to thin out. Puka and Laura busy themselves cleaning up.
"I think it went well," the ambassador reflects when the last guest is gone. "I think they enjoyed themselves." She pours another raki, and one for Puka, and the two drink a countryman's toast, far from home.
At last everything is packed away and loaded onto the luggage trolleys. Outside, the deluge has not abated, and by the time Puka and Laura get everything back into the car, they're drenched. "That was a lot of work," the chef says.
It's 11 p.m. when the SUV hits the FDR Drive. The trip back to West Hartford is a long slog, and tomorrow Puka is flying to Italy. But tomorrow is tomorrow. The chef checks his watch; that sly grin passes across his face.
"I know this really great Italian place," he says. "Anybody hungry?"

Texto completo: As the number of travelers cruising Antarctica swells, polar expedition companies are launching sustainable vessels designed for these bucket-list trips.
According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, approximately 56,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2018-19 season, a 53% increase from the 2014-15 season.
"Climate change is a chief reason for the increased interest in visiting Antarctica," said Mary Curry, a small ship cruise specialist and travel planner at Adventure Life. "We truly don't know if the region will ever be as magnificent as it is now."
Interested in seeing the southernmost continent? Here's a roundup of some of the tour operators planning itineraries.
Antarctica21: In November, Antarctica21 debuted the world's first vessel purpose-built for Antarctic tourism: the 73-passenger Magellan Explorer, equipped with ice-detecting radar technology, a heat recycling system and a fleet of 10 Zodiac boats. A forward-facing observation deck and glass-enclosed lounge offer prime wildlife viewing, while designer guest rooms feature balconies and single cabins.
Most itineraries, including the eight-day Classic Antarctica Air-Cruise, bypass the turbulent waters of the Drake Passage by flying from Punta Arenas to King George Island. From there, travelers cruise the South Shetland Islands and west coast of Antarctica to spot penguins, whales and other marine wildlife. Full board rates begin at $13,995 per person and include Antarctic flights and activities.
Hurtigruten: Cruise operator Hurtigruten in March will unveil the 530-passenger MS Fridtjof Nansen, the sister ship to the just-launched MS Roald Amundsen. Both vessels feature science centers and citizen science projects, and both are hybrid electric-powered with low-emission engines.
The MS Fridtjof Nansen's Highlights of the Frozen Continent, a 12-day journey, explores some 20 sites across the Antarctic Peninsula, where guests can take a polar plunge and enter a lottery to camp overnight on the ice. Prices start at $7,875 per person with eight sailings from November to January 2021.
Lindblad Expeditions: In April, Lindblad Expeditions' new National Geographic Endurance vessel will hit the seas featuring 69 cabins, a science command center and a PC5 ice class -- it is the strongest ice-breaking expedition ship of its kind based on an international rating system for polar vessels. Additional amenities include two observation "igloos," a spa with infinity Jacuzzis and a permanent polar art installation. The new 35-day Epic Antarctica voyage traverses the Antarctic Peninsula, the 200-foot Ross Ice Shelf and UNESCO sites on Australia and New Zealand's sub-Antarctic islands. Guests travel with a crew of veteran naturalists, a certified photo instructor, and an undersea specialist equipped with a hydrophone and underwater video camera.
"Travelers will encounter almost every imaginable form of ice and observe endemic species found nowhere else on earth," said Trey Byus, the company's chief expedition officer. All-inclusive rates from $48,800 with departures on Dec. 27, 2021, and Jan. 26, 2022.
Adventure Life: Astronomy buffs should keep their eyes on the 93-cabin Ocean Victory, launching this December. The travel outfitter Adventure Life is taking guests to witness next year's total solar eclipse on Dec. 4 at a prime position just east of South Orkney Island. (The rare celestial show will not happen again in this part of the world until 2061.) Other trip highlights include viewing breeding penguins on South Georgia Island, Weddell seals on Cuverville Island and Lemaire Channel's orca whales.
The 15-day voyage starts at $13,000 per person on a full-board basis.
Quark Expeditions: Next year, Quark Expeditions will christen the 102-suite Ultramarine, and its two twin-engine helicopters and 20 easy-access Zodiac boats. Guests will be able to test their mettle on a variety of heli-adventures from hiking to flightseeing, all of which explore areas only accessible by air.
Outdoor enthusiasts can also cross-country ski, paddle polar waters with stand-up boards and camp out in the icy wilderness. Tour operator Scott Dunn will be offering 11- to 23-night full-board trips to Antarctica on Ultramarine in 2021, starting at approximately $15,000 per person.
Ponant: Expedition cruise company Ponant plans to bring together travelers and scientists on a new electric hybrid vessel, the 135-stateroom Le Commandant Charcot, launching in May 2021. Fitted with modern oceanographic equipment and a research laboratory, guests will be able to assist scientists in research activities.
The ship's bevy of polar toys, including hovercrafts, electric snowmobiles and a tethered hot air balloon, give guests a privileged vantage point of Antarctica's indelible and fragile beauty. All-inclusive prices for the 15-day Expedition to Charcot & Peter I Islands start at $16,480 per person for trips departing next fall and winter.

Texto completo: People who work on cruises often describe ships as "cities at sea," but cities usually have speedy Wi-Fi, food delivery services you can summon on your phone, and homes with voice-activated assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Google to answer questions and provide information.
Now, cruise companies are getting in the tech game.
In October, Carnival Corp. unveiled the Sky Princess, the first ship built specifically to support the company's Ocean Medallion technology. The medallion is a pendant, the size of a quarter, that guests on ships like the Sky Princess can wear as a bracelet or necklace, or keep in a pocket. The medallion doesn't need to be charged. It can unlock a stateroom door and guests can use the medallion to pay for meals and settle bills through an app downloaded to their phones. The medallion's Ocean Compass lets people track friends and family on their phones.
The Celebrity Edge's new app lets guests upload a selfie, and the company's facial recognition software will automatically check them into the cruise. The app also allows passengers to see entertainment and dining options. These functions will also be available on the Apex, a Celebrity ship setting sail in April.
Check-in via selfie is also available on the app for Celebrity's parent company, Royal Caribbean. Royal Caribbean says the function allows guests to get from "car to bar" in 10 minutes. On Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas, guests can use an in-app remote for their TVs and use the app to unlock their stateroom doors.
People attached to voice apps such as Google, Siri and Alexa who book a cruise on MSC's newest ships, the Bellissima and the Grandiosa, can ask an onboard voice-activated system called Zoe for all sorts of guidance.

Junior-high boys caught up in scrunchie crush craze

Texto completo: Here's the news from winter break: Scrunchies have become a desired item for junior-high schoolboys.
Today's tween girls are offering their scrunchies -- the fabric-poofed hair elastics last popular in the 1980s -- to their crushes. If accepted, the boy will wear it around his wrist until he finds a new scrunchie -- er, crush.
If he really likes the girl, he can offer his hoodie in return.
"Well, now I know why my 13-year-old has a bunch of scrunchies in his room, and why his hoodie is missing," said Amanda Marks, who lives in Decatur, Georgia, and is the co-host and producer of the "Sis & Tell" podcast.
How this trend started is a bit of a mystery, but it appears to have gained traction.
It's possible that the Netflix movie "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" had something to do with it. During the flick, which is based on Jenny Han's young adult book series, the main character snags a scrunchie from his crush's hair and puts it on his wrist, commenting that she looks pretty with her hair down.
Han had no idea it was such an influential scene.
"I had no idea kids were offering up scrunchies to their crushes," she said. "I think it's delightful."
Perhaps adults are unaware of or indifferent to the scrunchie crush craze, but in junior highs and even in some high schools across the country, it appears to be quite a big deal.
The hashtag #Savethescrunchies trended briefly this fall, scrunchie collection funds started by parents of tween girls have started, and undoubtedly any store selling scrunchies is making money off these crushes.
And there are rules, according to Nora Cullerton, a 15-year-old in River Forest, Illinois.
"If a guy is wearing a scrunchie, you know he has a girlfriend," she said. "You can give any color, and the boys will take a Snapchat of the scrunchie and send it to the girl to show them that they're wearing it."
In middle school, Nora said, a girl gives a boy a scrunchie if she likes him. In high school, she gives it to him if they're dating. If the couple is in a nontraditional relationship? Anything could happen.
You may note that the scrunchie-hoodie trade is not an equal one.
After learning of the trend and noticing the scrunchies piling on her son's desk -- along with the missing hoodie -- Marks told her son that it was ridiculous to give away a hoodie because it's simply not equivalent in monetary value to a scrunchie.
"I mentioned I would totally buy him some scrunchies to give to girls he had crushes on if he wanted me to," Marks said. "Of course he gave me a look that said, 'You're being ridiculous.' "
Mark, 42, said that back in her day they gave each other a mixtape or CD, or even homemade friendship bracelets made out of string.
"I'm guessing sending someone a Spotify playlist just doesn't have the same sentiment?" she said dryly.
Kate Sorensen, the mother of a 12-year-old boy in Ankeny, Iowa, said the scrunchie crush trades are "running rampant" in his sixth grade class. He has arrived home with two so far.
"As for our son giving away a hoodie -- he's got plenty to spare, however, I would be really frustrated if he started giving clothes away," Sorensen said.
The two scrunchies he received now live on his desk in his room.
Other tweens are possessive over their scrunchies, given the fact that posh velvet or satin are the styles to get and they can really make a dent in the allowance ($18 for a set of 10 at Urban Outfitters).
Tully Lovell, 10, a fifth grader in River Forest, Illinois, said she hasn't given anyone a scrunchie and doesn't plan on indulging in the fad.
"I like my scrunchies too much," she said.

Texto completo: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she will endorse one of the Democratic candidates for president in the coming weeks, but while she's winnowing the list she's still not saying who's in or out of consideration for her.
During a phone interview, Lightfoot told the Chicago Tribune that she's still weighing her choices, but she has some defined parameters. The Chicago Democrat said she wants to back someone who demonstrates they can be a party healer, get-out-the-vote and defeat Republican President Donald Trump in November.
"First and foremost, I want to support somebody who is going to be able to beat Trump," the mayor said Thursday, during a break from the U.S. Conference of Mayors' winter meeting in Washington. "I just can't wrap my mind around a world where we have a Donald Trump who's term-limited and doesn't have to face the voters again."
Lightfoot's endorsement could carry some weight, at least locally. She won each of Chicago's 50 wards in last year's election.
Recent polls have shown the front-runners in the crowded Democratic primary as former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Lightfoot told the Sun-Times on Thursday that Sanders and Warren -- who both backed the Chicago Teachers Union during its recent strike -- had not contacted her about getting her endorsement.
"It is what it is," Lightfoot told the Sun-Times. "They haven't reached out. They've been to Chicago. They were very supportive of the Chicago Teachers Union strike but didn't feel it was necessary to talk to the new black LGBTQ mayor."
Those campaigns have since reached out to the mayor's political operation, according to a Lightfoot campaign spokesman.
Later Friday, Lightfoot told The Hill that she wanted to clarify, "What I said and what is true is that obviously I'm not going to make any endorsements from somebody who doesn't ask and who doesn't have a one-on-one conversation with me."
Asked by the Tribune if anyone's out of the running, she hinted they were: "Look, I don't want to name names in this process. I've put out a set of parameters" that some candidates meet and others don't.
"I'm looking closely at somebody's who's got the viability to (win in the general election) and bring different sectors of (Democrats in) our country home -- you know the folks who stayed home in 2016 -- galvanizing them and really giving them a reason to come out and vote," Lightfoot said.
She's also considering which candidate understands cities, Lightfoot said.
"Obviously, I'm thinking of someone who understands the importance and values of cities, and how a complicated, urban environment is one in which we're the laboratories for what should be national policy," Lightfoot said, "and that we've got to be supported by a federal government that understands that we've got to be supported not only with resources, but also with not having regulations or policies that impede our ability to deliver for our residents."
So is she talking about Bloomberg, a relatively recent entrant in the Democratic race?
"I wouldn't say that. Bloomberg's an interesting candidate for a whole host of reasons. But ... No. 1, can they beat Trump in a general election and bring new voters who would otherwise stay home?" Lightfoot said. "And, No. 2 basically getting back to the core values of the party: You know we were a party that was built by working class and organized labor and I want someone who speaks those values."
A recent New York Times piece on Bloomberg's nascent campaign noted that he is relying on support from powerful city leaders who have received the grants through his Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge -- Chicago is among them -- or participated in a Harvard "bootcamp ... that gives the mayors access to strategic advice from Bloomberg-funded experts," the New York Times notes. Lightfoot is a participant.
Stay tuned, Lightfoot said. She'll be out with a decision ahead of Illinois' March 17 primary.

Hard choices

Texto completo: If you have flooring you don't like -- whether it's carpet, vinyl or unappealing wood -- it can feel like there's no way to escape it, no matter how many rugs you pile on top. But if you have floors you love, walking across them can be a daily pleasure.
That's because the floor is the base upon which all other decorating decisions are built. Change your floors, and you change the character of your home. It's as simple as that.
So it's no surprise that new floors -- specifically, hardwood floors -- are at the top of many renovation wish lists. Not all wood floors, however, are equally appealing or appropriate for every space.
"We look at a building holistically, so the walls and windows, and the environment that we're in, all feed into the decision-making about the floors," said Paul Bertelli, the design principal of JLF Architects in Bozeman, Montana, whose firm chooses a different wood floor for almost every project.
The wood flooring industry has evolved considerably in recent years, as wider planks have increased in popularity and finish and installation options have expanded. Given all the choices available, we asked architects and flooring pros for advice on how to pick the right one.

Choose the wood species and color
Browsing through flooring samples to choose a type of wood and a color for your new floor is probably the most enjoyable part of the process. At this stage, much depends on personal preference and your overall vision for your home.
One of the most popular species is white oak, a classic, durable and widely available wood. "It can also take stain very well," said Chris Sy, the president of Carlisle Wide Plank Floors. That means it can be customized for a wide variety of aesthetics, from bleached off-white to ebony.
Other types of wood offer different looks. "Hickory has a lot of color variation, from light tones to dark tones," Sy said.
Those who want a rich, darker brown usually select walnut, while those who prefer blonder wood may opt for maple or birch.

Prefinished or site-finished?
Another major decision is whether to buy prefinished flooring, sold with its final color and topcoat in place, or unfinished flooring that can be stained and finished by an installer after it's put down.
One of the advantages of prefinished flooring is that it can be installed quickly, usually in a single day.
When floors are finished on site, the home has to be vacated to allow for sanding, staining and finishing, including drying time.
"It's very messy work, and it's very important that nobody step on it for days, or weeks, at a time," said Elizabeth Roberts, an architect in Brooklyn.
Because prefinished flooring is made in a factory, companies can also produce it with a wide range of exotic finishes that might be difficult for an installer to re-create on-site and with great consistency.
"You know what you're going to get," said Jane Kim, an architect in New York.
A key difference, however, is that prefinished boards usually have beveled edges to allow for slight irregularities, which creates more pronounced lines between the boards after installation.
Because unfinished flooring is sanded flat after it is installed, the finished floor looks more like a solid plane, without gaps.

Choose the finish
Most hardwood floors today have a finishing coat of clear polyurethane. "Polyurethane essentially sits on top of the wood," protecting it from moisture, wear and staining, said Jamie Hammel, owner of the Hudson Co., a supplier of wood flooring and paneling.
Water-based polyurethanes have grown in popularity in recent years, and the finishing sheen can range from matte to glossy.
A polyurethane finish is very durable, but once damaged or worn, it can be difficult to repair, Hammel said, because it typically requires refinishing an entire board, if not the whole floor.
An alternative is an oil-based finish. "Oil penetrates into the wood and therefore tends to make it look a bit richer," he said. And because it doesn't leave a film on top of the wood, it allows for relatively easy spot repairs.
The downside to an oil finish is that it requires more regular maintenance.

Select solid or engineered wood
Solid wood is just what it sounds like: a plank of your chosen wood, cut from a log. An engineered wood floor is composed of a thinner layer of your chosen wood on top of a manufactured base of layered wood, like plywood.
Engineered wood has a number of benefits. "It's built to be more dimensionally stable," Hammel said. "It will expand and contract less," reducing the chance that the boards will warp or shrink over time.
Engineered flooring is especially good in basements, in high humidity areas and over radiant heating systems, he said.
And in homes with concrete subfloors, like many high-rise apartments, engineered flooring can be glued directly to the slab, whereas solid wood usually requires a plywood subfloor so it can be nailed in place.
But it isn't always the best option. Some people simply like the idea of solid hardwood better, and in extremely dry areas, solid wood may perform better.

Pick plank widths and installation patterns
Narrow boards with widths of about 2 to 3 inches were once standard for hardwood flooring. Not anymore. Five- to 8-inch widths are now commonplace, and some homeowners opt to go even wider, with broad planks measuring up to a foot wide and beyond.
In general, the wider the boards, the higher the cost. And "the wider it gets, the less stable it gets, because the wood wants to move," Roberts said. "When we get into really wide flooring, we almost always recommend an engineered floor, because that prevents it from cupping and warping."
Most floors are installed with the boards in straight lines, but there are many alternative installation patterns, including herringbone and chevron, which are enjoying renewed popularity.

On the right side of fun

Texto completo: Drive-thrus are difficult, and tollbooths are worse. But for people who own right-hand-drive cars in the United States, the infrequent headaches are the price they pay for a unique kind of fun.
They might not have the wow factor of a Lamborghini, but right-hand-drive cars (besides the mail carrier's) elicit double takes on North American roads just the same.
Roughly a third of the world's nations drive on the left side of the road, and cars from Australia, Britain and Japan with the driver's cockpit on the "shotgun" side are particularly desirable. By law, cars imported into the United States must pass a raft of federal safety and emission standards; cars at least 25 years old are exempted.
Jeff Zurschmeide of Portland, Oregon, grew up in a family of automotive enthusiasts. His dad loved British sports cars and passed that appreciation on to him. So when he got the chance to own a right-hand-drive 1976 Austin Mini 1000, he jumped at the opportunity.
This British racer is crazy fun to drive, Zurschmeide said. "A friend owned this Mini, and she was moving away and couldn't take it, so I bought it about eight years ago," he said.
He made some performance enhancements, including better front brakes. Zurschmeide, who is 6 feet tall, also replaced the original front seats with a more comfortable pair from a Mazda Miata, that match the caramel-colored interior and rear bench seat.
Then it was time to trick out the interior. He put in a chunky, high-performance MOMO steering wheel and made a custom horn button from a coin commemorating Queen Elizabeth's 50th year on the throne. The stick shift knob is a billiard ball.
"You might think that learning to shift with your left hand would be hard," Zurschmeide said, "but it's not. The hard thing to learn to do is to look up and left for the rearview mirror, instead of up and right."
Phil Hansford's right-hand-driving ways began in 2006. A teacher in Airdrie, Alberta, he spends as much time in nature as he can -- mountain biking, camping, hiking -- and a capable four-wheel-drive vehicle is essential to get him off the grid. He realized he could import vehicles he couldn't get in North America -- short-wheelbase diesel SUVs, with manual transmissions, for example.
"I've lived in many parts of Canada, including Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, British Columbia and Alberta," Hansford said. "All these places have great outdoor areas, but accessing them means you need the right vehicle."
His first import from Japan brought a realization: These well-maintained cars often had lower miles and weren't exposed to the same hostile temperatures, terrain and speed extremes they would have seen here.
"Not to mention the engine combinations that we didn't get here, along with extra options," Hansford said.
In North America, "aside from a rare few, pretty much every SUV is a V6," he added. "Our choice in diesels is limited to full-size pickups. Manual trans? Almost extinct in every vehicular application. To be able to buy a Japanese-engineered, short-wheelbase, manual diesel? Pretty much unicorn status."
After his first Japanese car, "it was difficult to go back to North American market vehicles again," Hansford said.
He and his wife own four right-hand-drive SUVs: two 1999 Toyota Land Cruisers (one a diesel with a manual transmission); a two-door Mitsubishi Pajero; and their crown jewel, a 1997 Mitsubishi Pajero Evolution. Hansford said that this was a special model made for rally racing and that Mitsubishi had sold only 2,500 in Japan. His is No. 581.
The prices for these cars vary widely. The cost to import will include shipping, and a good starting price is a few thousand dollars. It's worth seeking out an importer who can help with all of the arrangements, including customs.
Life on the right side of the car has some quirks.
"Drive-thrus are best done when you have a passenger," Hansford said. "Additionally, tollbooths can be an exercise in calisthenics." Consider E-Z Pass.
The Japanese gauges show kilometers, so smartphone apps that convert kilometers to miles will help owners go with the flow. Additionally, fender-mounted mirrors on the Japanese vehicles (for curbside parking in Japan) seem to throw people off.
Parts can be hard to get. Online forums, international parts websites and social media groups can be great assets.
After eight years, Zurschmeide, who owns both left- and right-hand-drive Minis, still sometimes walks up to the wrong side of the car. That's a theme for people who own both left- and right-driving cars.
Hansford recounted his early right-hand-drive hiccups: "trying to shift the door handle as I attempted to turn off the wipers and indicate correctly at the same time." In Japanese vehicles, the turn signal and wiper stalks are often opposite their North American counterparts.
"The expletives that came out of the old tire shop guy's mouth when he had to drive my truck into the shop," Hansford said, "I still laugh just thinking about it."
Zurschmeide has fun with his Mini. "I bought a full-size plastic skeleton and sometimes belt it into the left-hand seat," he said. "People see the Mini and they look at it before they know it's a right-hander. They see the skeleton in the 'driver's seat' and do a double-take."
Any time Zurschmeide is on the road, he's grinning.
"I love running club rallies or driving in the hills with other British sports car owners," he said. "My club is the Original Minis Group, or OMG."

Hui’s annual juried show presents pleasing works by familiar talents

Texto completo: Isn’t the real sport in juried art shows second-guessing the jury? Hence, the grand tradition of the “Salon des Refuses,” or showcase for rejects, going back to 1863, when the tony but hidebound official Paris Salon, sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, shut out the progressive likes of Gustave Courbet and Edouard Manet.
What, I wonder, might a gathering of rejects look like on Maui in the year 2020?
The Annual Juried Exhibition at the Hui No‘eau Visual Arts Center in Makawao welcomes all comers, name-brand professionals to Sunday dabblers. Artists may enter as many as three pieces each, none more than 2 years old, in any medium of their choice, from painting, sculpture, drawing, photography and printmaking to ceramics, jewelry, fiber, wood and that perennial catch-all “mixed.”
Yet the invariably pleasing jumble that results looks remarkably unchanged year to year, showcasing the same cadre of Valley Isle talents you’ll encounter from under the banyan tree in Lahaina to the galleries at resorts in Wailea. For whatever reason, this year’s haul includes no glass, a medium in which Maui artisans excel.
This year 174 hopefuls inundated the hui with 360 submissions. Of the 39 (or roughly 1 in 5) who made the cut, 13 got lucky more than once, for a total of 58 items in three sunny galleries. Seven honorees are represented with two works; an improbable six, with three. A viewer might reasonably ask why.
By email the Honolulu-based artist, curator and consultant Kelly Sueda, this year’s guest juror, explained his criteria, which boil down, in essence, to excellence of the work, his professional integrity and the wild card of personal taste. Happily, the hui’s exhibitions and marketing coordinator, Josephine Bergill-Gentile, who hung the show, has exercised some ingenious artistic judgment of her own, sometimes placing like items with like, sometimes separating like from like for greater surprise.
Before scrutinizing those multiple citations, let’s focus on standouts from the rank-and-file of the one-and-done. A well-deserved ribbon for Juror’s Choice fell to Becky Lewis for “Wave After Wave,” a construction of plant materials that resembles a free-form Mesoamerican vase — or a precarious stack of slate-gray and reddish-brown bowls and plates neatly contained within an elastic net.
Jonathan Yukio Clark was honored with the Recognition Award from the Hawai‘i State Foundation on Culture and the Arts for his boxy yet elegant architectural miniature “Across Two Islands,” in hardwood and mixed media.
Now to those winners of the triple crown. Conspicuous among them is Derek Bencomo, whose spiral nebulae in turned and sculpted wood are prized by discerning collectors around the world. But in this context do we need three? Three of Jennifer Valanzuela’s Japanese-inspired candy-color- and-gold fantasy landscapes, in oil on panel? Three of Aio Wolf watered- down Peter Max knockoffs? Three rings by jeweler Nicole Busto? A necklace, an armband and a pair of earrings from Will Ryan, who beats silver and other metals into ornamental spirals?
Before one’s eyes, art morphs to “art” and from “art” to merchandise.
With Thomas C. Jones, the last of the triply crowned, that transformation does not occur. Some might question whether he belongs here at all, but within a spiky signature style we might classify as primitive, self-taught or “outsider,” each of his efforts has its distinctive vibe — jaunty and energized for a pair of bikers standing on the grass; zonked for a moon-eyed, stone-face surfer(?) dude staring up from a bed; self-infatuated for a profile of Donald Trump mesmerized by another profile of Donald Trump.
The checklist gives Jones’ medium as “marquee on eucaboard”— eucaboard being a material carpenters use for the bottoms of drawers, the backs of bookcases and other parts of furniture that don’t show. What “marquee” signifies in this context is anybody’s guess; the colors are matte, flat and a little dusty.
Given a few gold stars to pass out, this visitor would stick one on the ecological nightmare Caroline Killhour calls “Maui Burning,” a relief print in doomsday white on black. Another would go to Larry Berko’s prominently displayed oil-on-canvas portrait “Where She Went,” which bathes a Polynesian beauty and her gigantic Popsicle in eerie shades of lime and turquoise.
Susan David’s pair of sequined denim jackets — tributes to Bob Dylan, who performed on Maui in 2014 — simply leap from the wall.
Elizabeth Keller’s watercolor “Old Bank of Hawaii Building (Paia)” pleases for its transparency and luminous calm, as do Janet Davis’ house-shaped island seascape “The World Is a Magical Place” for its cheery naivete and Pamela Andelin’s dense, jazzy “Malta Abstract,” both in oil.
Kirk Kurokawa, also working in oil, has composed a spare “trompe l’oeil” still life consisting of a ballpoint pen lying beside a narrow, much longer paint brush. The label adjacent reads, “What Defines You? #1.” What indeed? Language or images? Even the title deserves a prize.

Texto completo: >> Founded by the late W.S. Merwin and his wife, Paula, to preserve in perpetuity their Haiku home with its hand-planted, botanically priceless exotic palm forest, the Merwin Conservancy seeks to foster a reverence for language, nature and the imagination. To that end the Conservancy’s Green Room Series presents readings, conversation and book-signings with distinguished literary and ecologically minded guests. Welcome Joy Harjo , enrolled member of the Mvskoke Nation, playwright and saxophonist. “The saxophone is so human,” she has written. “Its tendency is to be rowdy, edgy, talk too loud, bump into people, say the wrong words at the wrong time. But then, you take a breath, all the way from the center of the earth and blow. All that heartache is forgiven. All that love we humans carry makes a sweet, deep sound and we fly a little.” Have I mentioned that Harjo is America’s reigning poet laureate, following in the shining footsteps of Merwin himself? Poets laureate don’t grow on trees, you know. — 7 p.m. Thursday at MACC’s McCoy Studio Theater. Tickets: $ 25 ( $ 10 students) at mauiarts.org or call 242-7469.
>> Arnold Schoenberg, immortal (or infamous) as the trailblazer of 12-tone music, was also an orchestrator of genius, capable of repurposing a piano quartet for symphony orchestra or crunching symphonies to chamber proportions. With Mahler’s mournful, tempestuous four-part cycle “Songs of a Wayfarer,” he was working in the latter vein. His exquisitely tinted version — performed by Robert E. Wills, baritone, plus 10 of Maui’s most intrepid classical instrumentalists — forms the centerpiece of a “A Classical Soiree” presented by ProArts and Halekulani Kula. Also on the program: Debussy’s sunnily sensual “Afternoon of a Faun,” arranged for trio, plus Mozart and Prokofiev. — 7:30 p.m. Thursday at ProArts Playhouse, 1280 S. Kihei Road. Tickets: $ 40 at proartsmaui.com or call 463-6550.
>> Let them entertain you! “Cabaret and Cocktails: Pastie Premiers 2020!” brings what old-timers used to call the Burly Q to Azeka Makai, promising new acts, new talent and new teases. Titillation guaranteed, until the vice squad rolls in. (Does anybody still have a vice squad?) Lin McEwan, ProArts Playhouse’s bouncy executive director, has been telling folks to leave the kids at home. — 8 p.m. Saturday at ProArts Playhouse. Tickets: $ 25, $ 35 at proartsmaui.com or call 463-6550.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the first week of November, the police in San Francisco and New York responded to a series of telephone calls claiming that hostages were being held in the homes of Adam Mosseri, a senior Facebook executive.
The calls appeared to be coming from inside the homes.
Officers arrived in force and barricaded the streets outside. Twice.
But after tense, hourslong standoffs, they realized the calls were hoaxes. There were no hostages, and no one in the homes had called the police.
Mosseri is one of a number of tech executives who have been targeted recently in so-called swatting incidents. Swatting is online lingo used to describe when people call the police with false reports of a violent crime of some sort inside a home, hoping to persuade them to send a SWAT team.
These episodes have become more common in communities rich with tech companies and their billionaire executives, like the Bay Area and Seattle, according to six police departments contacted by The New York Times.
Exact numbers are unclear, police say, because there is no central repository of information for these sorts of attacks.
But as online discourse has become more combative and more personal, some in the industry aren't surprised that tech executives - the people who decide what is posted on social media and who is barred from it - have become regular targets.
Swattings have spiked at Facebook in particular, according to local police departments and security officials at the company, which in recent years has cracked down on false accounts, threatening language and other types of content that violates its rules. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the attacks.
Mosseri declined to comment, and a Facebook spokesman, Anthony Harrison, said in a statement that "because these things deal with security matters and our employees, we are unable to comment."
The attacks have been aided by forums that have sprung up both on the public internet and on the camouflaged sites of the so-called dark web. These forums name thousands of people, from high-ranking executives to their extended families, who could be targets, providing cellphone numbers, home addresses and other information. Some even discuss techniques that can be used - like cheap, online technology that can spoof a phone number and make the police believe a 911 call is coming from a target's home.
In the eight months since one online forum was started, nearly 3,000 people have joined.
"Who should we do next?" read one message on the forum last month. The responses included gun emojis - the symbol, in swatting forums, for an attack in which the police were successfully called to the target's home. Many of the responses were laced with profanity, as well as suggestions for ex-girlfriends who should be swatted.
One forum names at least two dozen Facebook employees as potential targets. They range from executives to product engineers. Some forum participants said that they had been barred from Facebook or Instagram, and that Facebook employees were fair game because they "think they are god."
Swatting started in the combative world of online gaming. It was a way to terrorize someone more famous, get even with a rival or retaliate against someone with different political views.
Provoking a heavily armed police response presents obvious risks. Last year, a 26-year-old California man was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for calling in dozens of fake emergency calls, including one that led to the fatal police shooting of Andrew Finch, a Kansas resident.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - There is no Spanish translation for a caucus, that political process particular to just a few states. It is simply "el caucus."
But for many Latinos in Iowa, el caucus is hardly simple. The state's Latino population has surged in recent decades, with the number registered to vote estimated at more than 50,000, making it a potentially important bloc in the fast-approaching Democratic caucuses. And local leaders like Vanessa Marcano-Kelly believe there are not nearly enough Spanish-tailored caucus sites or interpreters to meet the need in the state.
"I feel like this year everyone has been talking about how Iowa is superwhite, but it's really not superwhite to me," said Marcano-Kelly, who petitioned the state Democratic Party to create caucus sites in Spanish. "I see Latinos everywhere."
It is the first Iowa caucus for Marcano-Kelly, 34. In 2016, she watched from the sidelines, slightly bewildered at the spectacle and wondering how people could possibly understand if they did not speak English. As she wrote in her application months ago to the state Democratic Party, the Spanish sites would "ensure that the voices of all people can really be heard."
So on Feb. 3, the doors will open at the South Suburban YMCA in Des Moines for hundreds of Spanish-speaking caucusgoers.
Marcano-Kelly has been refreshing her Spanish vocabulary as she searches for the right words - some easier (viable is "viable"), some more obscure (threshold is "límite").
Although Latinos make up just 6% of Iowa's population, they have more than doubled in the state in the last two decades.
In nearly a dozen towns throughout the state, Latinos now make up more than one-third of the population. And since 2016, the League of United Latin American Citizens has worked to get thousands more registered to vote, a number the group estimates has now grown to 53,000.
Roughly 194,000 Latinos live in the state, and by most estimates, fewer than 3,000 participated in the 2016 caucuses. This year, Latino activists expect that number to grow to 20,000 or more. And for the first time, there are set to be six Spanish satellite caucus sites, a concession Democratic Party officials made to try to increase participation.
But despite the efforts, many activists believe there are not nearly enough interpreters lined up for the caucuses. Party officials are still scrambling to find bilingual speakers to run the Spanish caucuses, even as they look for more Spanish speakers to volunteer at other sites throughout the state.
And while some campaigns plan to send Spanish-speaking volunteers to towns where Latinos make up more than one-third of the population, there is no clear system to ensure that Spanish-speaking caucusgoers will have interpretation services.
"Whatever the number is, I think it would be impossible to have enough to meet the need," said Rob Barron, a Polk County school board member who runs a group dedicated to electing more Latinos to office. "Even if you're a native English speaker, the process is intimidating. So for those who are willing to walk into that room without speaking the language, then hear words like viable, it's only going to get more and more chaotic and confusing."
When the Democratic Party put a call out for applications for satellite caucuses that could be held away from traditional geographic precincts, Marcano-Kelly knew that she would write one for Spanish. She thought of several of her friends who recently became citizens but do not speak English as well as many Puerto Ricans she knows who moved to Iowa after Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.
After submitting the satellite application, Marcano-Kelly decided she would become the precinct captain for Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, in charge of rounding up supporters who come to the Spanish caucus. But in recent days she has found herself grappling with whether her primary responsibility lies with the campaign or individual voters.
Evidence of a booming Latino population can be seen in pockets all over the state, including Des Moines, where Latinos make up 12% of the city's population and 26% of public school students. In recent years, Mexicans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans have settled here, many moving from California, Illinois and Texas.
Showing up to places where Latinos congregate has been a part of the strategy for some of the campaigns and the League of United Latin American Citizens, more commonly known as LULAC, which has led the effort to register more Latinos. The group has held voter registration drives at stores and sponsored several mock caucus trainings in the state.

Could we have a clean Estero Bay?

Texto completo: "Is it possible we could have a clean Estero Bay again? I think it is." Ralf Brookes Environmental attorney
Instead of sleeping in or hitting Costco, more than 100 people spent their Saturday in a windowless FGCU ballroom staring down the problems facing Estero Bay and its wider watershed.
"The Estero Bay is in trouble: What citizens can do to help" was the theme of 2020's Cela Tega – a Calusa Indian term for the view from high ground, which the conference aimed to offer.
The presenter list read like a who's who of the area's eco-influencers from government agencies, nonprofits, the legal field and the university, but conference organizer and associate biology professor Nora Demers made sure they all kept the citizenry in mind. "Hopefully the message of engagement of residents at every level shines through," Demers said.
Plenary speaker Jim Beever, planner for the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council, kicked things off with a scientific overview of the state of the bay and its 360-square mile watershed.
For the most part, the picture was grim. Hurricane Irma packed a huge wallop of pollution, Beever said. "When the entire watershed floods in a storm event that exceeded the 500-year flood and it's dissolving everything – in everyone's garden shed, lawns, golf courses – and then that water drains in the tributaries to the bay, that is a massive dose of nitrogen to the bay."
And with an increase in climate change-fueled hurricanes, population and impervious surfaces, Beever said, we can expect more of the same.
On the bright side, he pointed out conservation land within the watershed has increased significantly thanks to Lee County's 3,900-acre Edison Farms purchase in 2017, which Beever called a "major triumph for your watershed."
Engagement will be the key link between science and action, pointed out Jennifer Hecker of the Coastal and Heartland National Estuary Partnership, who said she was on her way to Tallahassee the next day for the Legislative session.
Her panel's topic was "What We Can Do to Reduce Harmful Algae Blooms," and she was joined by scientists and advocates who talked about Lee County's fertilizer ordinance and nutrient pollution. The Conservancy of Southwest Florida's Marisa Carrozzo made the case for an update to Florida's stormwater rule, in a state where more than half the waterbodies monitored by the state don't meet its own standards for cleanliness.
Much of the conference's news was breathtakingly bad: harmful algal blooms increasing worldwide, disappearing wetlands. "Fire flood, disease, pollution, the loss of what we need to survive, including our natural systems," said Brad Cornell, Southwest Florida policy associate for Audubon Florida.
Some of it drew standing ovations, such as former Martin County commissioner and environmental advocate Maggy Hurchalla's declaration that she wouldn't back down in her high-profile legal battle with a mining company. Last year, an appeals court upheld a $4.4 million judgment against her after Hurchalla emailed Martin County commissioners in 2013 with concerns about a rock mining project near Indiantown. "We're headed to the Supreme Court," she promised.
Some of it seemed bound to create controversy, such as research by Bill Mitsch, FGCU Eminent Scholar and Director, Everglades Wetland Research Park, implicating manmade nitrate fertilizer in recent virulent red tides. After sampling the bloom's microorganisms for the source of nitrates, "The Gulf of Mexico red tide was right smack dab in the nitrate fertilizer box," Mitsch said, "That's what's fueling the red tide ... And I'm sorry, but Mother Nature doesn't manufacture fertilizer – we do."
Earlier in his talk, Mitsch read from a letter reacting to the just-published new definition of Waters of the United States, which removes many wetlands protections. "I am so angry," he said. "This is absolutely a disaster ... I wrote and I sent it off to The New York Times last night."
Mitsch said he'd followed the tug of war between industrial, agricultural, energy, and real estate sectors with those seeking protection for wetlands and waterways for decades, and said the changes heralded possibly "the darkest day for federal protection of wetlands since it first started 45 years ago."
The conference powered on through the lunch hour, with environmental attorney Ralf Brookes doing a little sermonizing on grassroots advocacy. As participants munched on salads and wraps, he exhorted the crowd to "make something happen – with big and with little – because both count."
After liberally quoting Jacques Cousteau, Brookes issued a challenge:
"Is it possible we could have a clean Estero Bay again? I think it is."
"Is it possible we could have a clean Estero Bay again? I think it is." Ralf Brookes Environmental attorney

Democrats are a house divided ahead of election

Texto completo: The New York Times, an ultra-left-wing newspaper which has endorsed every Democrat presidential candidate since President Kennedy, entered the Democrat primary fray for 2020 by endorsing not one but two presidential candidates: Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.
Let's set aside the fact that endorsing two candidates when voters can only vote for one candidate is akin to picking both Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers to win the Super Bowl. The move by the NYT to endorse two candidates instead of one highlights the quandary for the Democrat party: two different political philosophies going head-to-head in a party that is deeply divided. This division has no end in sight as there are several enabling factors that will likely make the situation only worse:
Candidate funding: Recent Federal Election Commission filings show three candidates (Warren, Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg) with at least $20 million cash on hand. Biden has $9 million, but he is leading most national polls. That leaves four candidates who can stay viable for a long time. Add to the list the two billionaires with plenty of financial resources and you have six candidates with plenty of runway ahead of them.
Democrat party rules: To secure any delegates in a state primary/caucus, a candidate has to meet the 15% threshold. Delegates are proportionately divided amongst the candidates who meet the 15% threshold.
Let's take Iowa as an example to illustrate the downside to these rules. Here's the most recent average of polls from RealClearPolitics: Biden 21%, Sanders 17%, Warren 17% and Buttigieg 16%. If the polls are accurate, here's the potential delegate count coming out of Iowa: Biden 12, Sanders 10, Warren 10, Buttigieg 9, and the rest of the field 0. The difference between first place and fourth place is three delegates, and no one is anywhere close to a majority of 21 delegates. Many states in addition to Iowa are in an identical situation. California with 416 delegates has Biden at 24%, Sanders at 23% and Warren at 21%. It will take a majority of 1,886 delegates to avoid a contested convention and win the nomination outright.
Contested convention: If no candidate gets a majority of 1,886 delegates on the first ballot, the 764 superdelegates (aka the establishment) are eligible to vote in subsequent ballots. Imagine the reaction from Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez if the superdelegates end up deciding the nominee and picking someone not named Sanders. Chicago 1968 would pale in comparison to Milwaukee 2020.
Trump lies in wait: When the Democrat party finally picks a nominee, President Trump lies in wait with plenty of cash to go after that nominee. As of December, the president had $83 million and Republican Party had $63 million cash on hand (the Democrat party had $8 million). This situation will be similar to the 2012 Obama-Romney contest with the shoe on the other foot. Romney was in a weak financial position coming out of the primaries and during the summer of 2012 Team Obama obliterated Romney, never letting him rise. Expect Team Trump to do the same in 2020.
One final point: The New York Times' infinite wisdom of endorsing two candidates notwithstanding, the Democrats can only have one nominee. That leaves them with a choice of a socialist or a "moderate." Nominate a socialist, and the independents go with Trump. Nominate a "moderate," and the socialists stay home. Democrats are a house divided, and for some reason, the name McGovern and the year 1972 comes to mind.

Texto completo: Here's the news from winter break: Scrunchies have become a desired item for junior-high schoolboys.
Today's tween girls are offering their scrunchies - the fabric-poofed hair elastics last popular in the 1980s - to their crushes. If accepted, the boy will wear it around his wrist until he finds a new scrunchie - er, crush.
If he really likes the girl, he can offer his hoodie in return.
"Well, now I know why my 13-year-old has a bunch of scrunchies in his room, and why his hoodie is missing," said Amanda Marks, who lives in Decatur, Georgia, and is the co-host and producer of the "Sis & Tell" podcast.
How this trend started is a bit of a mystery, but it appears to have gained traction.
It's possible that the Netflix movie "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" had something to do with it. During the flick, which is based on Jenny Han's young adult book series, the main character snags a scrunchie from his crush's hair and puts it on his wrist, commenting that she looks pretty with her hair down.
Han had no idea it was such an influential scene.
"I had no idea kids were offering up scrunchies to their crushes," she said. "I think it's delightful."
Perhaps adults are unaware of or indifferent to the scrunchie crush craze, but in junior highs and even in some high schools across the country, it appears to be quite a big deal.
The hashtag #Savethescrunchies trended briefly this fall, scrunchie collection funds started by parents of tween girls have started, and undoubtedly any store selling scrunchies is making money off these crushes.
And there are rules, according to Nora Cullerton, a 15-year-old in River Forest, Illinois.
"If a guy is wearing a scrunchie, you know he has a girlfriend," she said. "You can give any color, and the boys will take a Snapchat of the scrunchie and send it to the girl to show them that they're wearing it."
In middle school, Nora said, a girl gives a boy a scrunchie if she likes him. In high school, she gives it to him if they're dating. If the couple is in a nontraditional relationship? Anything could happen.
You may note that the scrunchie-hoodie trade is not an equal one.
After learning of the trend and noticing the scrunchies piling on her son's desk - along with the missing hoodie - Marks told her son that it was ridiculous to give away a hoodie because it's simply not equivalent in monetary value to a scrunchie.
"I mentioned I would totally buy him some scrunchies to give to girls he had crushes on if he wanted me to," Marks said. "Of course he gave me a look that said, 'You're being ridiculous.' "
Mark, 42, said that back in her day they gave each other a mixtape or CD, or even homemade friendship bracelets made out of string.
"I'm guessing sending someone a Spotify playlist just doesn't have the same sentiment?" she said dryly.
Kate Sorensen, the mother of a 12-year-old boy in Ankeny, Iowa, said the scrunchie crush trades are "running rampant" in his sixth grade class. He has arrived home with two so far.
"As for our son giving away a hoodie - he's got plenty to spare, however, I would be really frustrated if he started giving clothes away," Sorensen said.
The two scrunchies he received now live on his desk in his room.
Other tweens are possessive over their scrunchies, given the fact that posh velvet or satin are the styles to get and they can really make a dent in the allowance ($18 for a set of 10 at Urban Outfitters).
Tully Lovell, 10, a fifth grader in River Forest, Illinois, said she hasn't given anyone a scrunchie and doesn't plan on indulging in the fad.
"I like my scrunchies too much," she said.

There's a growing problem in national opioid fight

Texto completo: This lends itself to way more questions than answers, a friend of mine wrote on Facebook the other day above a weird photo.
It showed three boxes of Imodium A-D, that trusted anti-diarrhea medication, lying crumpled in a parking lot. What nightmarish emergency, he wondered, could have possibly led to this?
Turns out, it was nightmarish. Just not in the way most of us would think.
A few commenters on the post explained what was probably going on: People battling opioid withdrawal sometimes gobble Imodium by the fistful.
Imodium is the brand-name of loperamide: a drug that, if taken in gigantic quantities, can produce an opioid-like high – and present serious dangers to a person's health.
I had no idea this was a problem. But apparently it's nothing new.
According to U.S. News & World Report, the U.S. National Poison Data System reported a 90% spike in loperamide overdoses between 2010 and 2016.
Abusing the drug can, naturally, lead to horrific constipation. But it can also wreak havoc on your heart – usually through irregular heartbeats, the New York Times reported in 2016. Back then, overdose deaths had reportedly occurred in at least five states.
"Most physicians just recently realized loperamide could be abused, and few look for it," the story read. "There is little if any national data on the problem, but many toxicologists and emergency department doctors suspect that it is more widespread than scattered reports suggest."
A 2019 paper out of Rutgers University confirmed that. It said loperamide fatalities have spiked over the last few years.
All that has finally caused the FDA to step in.
In September, the agency announced it would limit Imodium A-D, Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief and Be Health Loperamide HCI capsules – as well as their generic offshoots – to 48 milligrams per package, or about 24 capsules per box. The maximum daily dosage is eight milligrams.
"Abuse of loperamide continues in the United States and taking higher than recommended doses can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death," acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in the release.
But the FDA isn't going to come crashing through pharmacy windows if stores don't follow those guidelines. The new rules are nothing more than voluntary.
That becomes pretty clear if you take a stroll through a local pharmacy.
Battling dirty looks from pharmacy workers and customers alike, I scoped out several stores around Evansville this week and found a variety of anti-diarrhea displays.
Some kept Imodium locked in clear plastic cases. Others sported cage-free boxes that held as much as 96 milligrams per package.
I suppose you could rant about how all this is a sign of a deteriorating culture. I can't even buy diarrhea medication anymore without feeling like a drug addict!
The saddest part for me, though, is that people feel they have to resort to this. I hope whoever left those crumpled boxes behind can find the help they need to kick their addiction.

Texto completo: DE PERE - Sylvia Bowersox didn't know how much one dog could change a life until Timothy came into hers. A U.S. Army veteran who did three tours in Iraq as a broadcast journalist and press officer, she struggled in the years after she returned home in 2007 — 10 days after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was hanged.Bowersox, suffering from traumatic brain injury, severe post-traumatic stress disorder and "a whole alphabet of other things," was misdiagnosed by Veterans Affairs with bipolar disorder and was put on lithium and a host of other drugs.
"They had me on just bizarre, bizarre medications. I was a zombie. I was an absolute zombie. I wasn't functioning," she said. "I was just beside myself, because I am not bipolar. They kept upping my doses, so I did not have a quality of life at all. I was desperate."
She was living in Columbus, Ohio, when the idea of a service dog to help with the PTSD first came up. She was referred to a local program in which jail inmates trained dogs, but when the door slammed behind her the first time she visited, she had a massive panic attack. She never went back. She wasn't well enough.
Then her husband Jon found Little Angels Service Dogs, which trains canines on a 10-acre ranch outside San Diego. That's where she would meet Timothy, a British Labrador puppy she first laid eyes on via Skype.
"The first thing he did is he walked up and he started cleaning my face," Bowersox said.
He was a year old when she took him home. They've been inseparable in the nearly nine years since.
"Timothy is my baby. He's my fur baby. He's my child," said Bowersox, a writer and painter who moved to De Pere in 2016. "He tells me when I've had enough and I have to go walk around the building. He paws at me when I'm freaking out. He sleeps with me. When I disassociate, he just sits at my feet and doesn't go anywhere and doesn't let me go anywhere until I come out of it. He is amazing. He's my guy."
Sharing her story on the big screen The two are co-stars in "To Be of Service," a documentary by Josh Aronson about war veterans with PTSD and the service dogs that have helped them regain their lives. The film opened in select U.S. cities in November and is streaming on Netflix.
The crew filmed Bowersox and Timothy in De Pere, including at Luna Cafe and Roastery, and also at Little Angels for one of Timothy's training refresher courses and during Bowersox's reading of her "This War Can't Be All Bad" in Venice, California.
"To Be of Service" was one of 159 documentary features submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Science for 2020 Oscar consideration. It received strong reviews from The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and others, but it did not make the cut as one of five nominees in its Oscar category.
The film also received national attention for "Unbroken," the song Bon Jovi wrote for the project. The band is donating all proceeds from downloads of the single to the Patriotic Service Dog Foundation, a nonprofit that provides service dogs to veterans in need.
There wasn't a red carpet premiere that allowed Bowersox the chance to rub elbows with Jon Bon Jovi — she'd tell him how much his lyrics captured the veterans experience, particularly "I'd do it all again" — but she was able to catch a screening in Chicago. She and Timothy appeared on NBC's "Today with Hoda & Jenna" on Veterans Day to talk about the importance of service dogs for veterans.
She was also in attendance when "To Be of Service" was screened for Congress. She spent two days in Washington, D.C. encouraging members to support the PAWS Act. The Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act was introduced in June to make service dogs more accessible to veterans looking for an alternative PTSD treatment. If passed, it would require the VA to provide a $25,000 voucher for a service dog to veterans diagnosed with PTSD.
The VA does not currently cover the expense of a service dog. One veteran in the film did a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money. Bowersox knows when Timothy retires in another year, she'll need to somehow come up with $30,000 for her next service dog.
"My thought is why do we as veterans have to go begging for a service dog? Why are we doing this? That's why I got behind the PAWS Act," she said.
Eating cat food: bad. Getting belly rubs: good. It's impossible for Bowersox to put a price on how valuable Timothy has been to her.
"He's my partner in crime," she says. "He's phenomenal. He settles me. He's my best pal."
It took the two about a year to get to know each other. He had to figure out what his job was, what her needs were and how that all fit into what he knows how to do. She had to learn how to deal with people who want to pet him when they're out in public, a no-no as it's a distraction from his job.
She also had to learn how to properly feed him. She overdid it at first and "he became a little sausage." He's closer to his ideal weight now, but it hasn't stopped him from trying to convince her he's starving.
They reached a mutual agreement that he couldn't eat the cat's food. Not good for the cat — or his digestive system. Belly rubs, however, are always good.
With the exception of a trip overseas that kept them apart for a couple weeks, Bowersox is never without him. Where she goes, he goes, including Chicago, where she's studying art. Calm and relaxed, Timothy can sense when Bowersox is feeling anxious. In the year when she was having frequent nightmares, he would wake her up.
"When I'm in a place and he decides I need to take a break, well, he's 80 pounds, so when he says, 'Nope, we're leaving,' we're going," she said.
"What happens to me, because of my brain injury and because of my PTSD, if I allow myself to get overstimulated, overly stressed, I shut down. I completely shut down. I either do one of two things. I either get really, really scared or the lights are on but nobody's home. ... We work together. He is my barometer."

What's Hillary up to?

Texto completo: "Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician." So says Hillary Clinton of her former Senate colleague and 2016 rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders.
Her assessment of Sanders' populist-socialist agenda? "It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people get sucked into it."
Does that assessment still hold with Sanders now running strong in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and having emerged, according to The New York Times, as "the dominant liberal voice in the 2020 race"?
"Yes, it does," said Clinton, who left open the possibility she might not support Sanders if he became the nominee.
In her interview with The Hollywood Reporter to promote a documentary that premieres Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival, Clinton also tore into Bernie's backers.
"It is not only him. It's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women," said Clinton. "It should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture — not only permitted (he) seems to be very much supporting it."
From her own words, Clinton regards Sanders as a nasty man running a misogynistic campaign and a political phony whose achievements are nonexistent and who lacks the temperament to be president.
As Clinton describes Sanders, he seems to fit nicely into her Trumpian "basket of deplorables." Reflecting the significance of Clinton's attack, The New York Times put it on Page 1.
This comes one week after Elizabeth Warren, at the end of the last debate, confronted Sanders, who had denied ever telling her a woman could not win the presidency. "I think you just called me a liar on national TV," said Warren, twice. Sanders assuredly had. He then accused Warren of lying.
This is "a part of a pattern," says Clinton, noting that Sanders said in 2016 that she was not qualified to be president.
What is Hillary up to? She is "hellbent on stopping Sanders," says Obama strategist David Axelrod.
The bad blood between Bernie and two leading women in the Democratic Party calls to mind the battle between Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater, which did not end well for the Republican Party in 1964.
While the eventual GOP nominee, Goldwater, lost in a 44-state landslide to Lyndon Johnson, the liberal Republican establishment that Rockefeller led would never again be able to nominate one of its own.
It is difficult to see how this acrimony inside the Democratic Party — over the character, record, ideology and alleged sexism of Sen. Bernie Sanders — ends well for the Democrats.
Already, Sanders' backers believe the DNC "rigged" the nomination in 2016 by feigning neutrality while secretly aiding Clinton.
If Sanders now fails in the first primaries and loses his last chance for the Democratic nomination because of the Clinton-Warren's attacks, it is difficult to see how his backers enthusiastically support Warren.
As for Sanders backing Biden, the raison d'etre of the liberal-radical wing of the party to whom Sanders is a hero is that the Democratic establishment consistently sells out progressive values. Sanders' crowd consists of true believers, a trademark of whom is militancy. Such folks often prefer defeat behind a principled leader to victory for a corporatist Democrat they regard as the enemy within.
Assume Sanders defeats Warren in Iowa, bests Biden in New Hampshire, and then goes on to win the nomination. Would women, a majority of whom vote Democratic, and who are indispensable to party victory, surge to the polls to install a president whom Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren describe as a sexist who ruined their own presidential hopes?
Would Democratic women come out to vote for a candidate who was responsible, in two successive presidential elections, for keeping the glass ceiling firmly intact over the heads of the Democratic Party's leading female candidates? Sanders has made some bad enemies.
Ten days before the Iowa caucuses, the great unifier of the Democratic Party remains Donald Trump. But now, with Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina dead ahead, the Democrats' focus is becoming: Who should replace Trump?
The rival claims of the constituent elements inside the party are rising to the fore. And what they reveal is a Democratic Party that is a coalition of groups that seem to be dividing along the lines of ideology, politics, race, class and culture.
Consider the most loyal of Democratic constituents in presidential elections: African Americans. They are 13% of the electorate but a fourth of the national Democratic vote.
Yet, of the six candidates for the nomination on stage in the last debate, not one was African American. Not one was Hispanic or Asian. Four were white men, and two were white women.
The lone outsider rising in the polls is another white man, a multibillionaire who is willing to spend a billion dollars to buy the presidential nomination of the party of the common man.

Texto completo: Why do we read? Some read to escape. Others look at reading as an educational tool. Words teach us about others, their societies, culture, dysfunctions and how we relate to them. Biographies, historical fiction and fiction wait to be absorbed. Today's galaxy of new novels is a reflection of the decade that defines us, like the opioid crisis, the rural crisis and a look back at America's soul.
Let's begin with "Long Bright River,"a suspense novel by Liz Moore that takes us to Philadelphia where two sisters, Kacey and Mickey, who were inseparable, are driven apart by the opioid crisis. Kacey, the addict, lives on the streets. Mickey, a police officer, tries to keep tabs on her. Kacey vanishes amid a string of killings. Mickey searches to discover the culprit and what happened to her sister.
In "Tightrope," Nicholas Kristoff, a New York Times columnist, and Sheryl WuDunn, a former reporter at the paper, show us how the inequality that has become the culture of the working poor across the country affected the town Kristoff was brought up in. There, his classmates have died from overdoses and suicides. While misery exists, there are moments of optimism and resilience, too. The book's greatest strength is the exaltation of the common person's voice bearing expert witness of the troubles selfish power has wrought.
When people think of author Zora Neale Hurston, they most often think of her 1937 classic, "Their Eyes Were Watching God." So when Hurston died in 1960 it was thought some of her work died with her. However, eight of her stories written during her years at Barnard College during the Harlem Renaissance have found their way to bookstores' shelves in "Hitting a Straight Link with a Crooked Stick," a collection of short stories. Incidentally, the book club that I belong to read "Their Eyes Were Watching God." The dialect was a challenge, but I soldiered through 200 pages and finished one of my most enlightening reads. Hurston is a treasure.
"Women on Women," by Radhika Jones, Vanity Fair's editor in chief, is a look back on 25 years of the magazine's stories on women by women. Included are Leslie Bennett on Michelle Obama, Ingrid Sischy on Nicole Kidman, Gail Sheehy on Hillary Clinton and Maureen Dowd on Tina Fey. Also, the book features a selection of the best profiles, essays and columns about female subjects. From profiles of Gloria Steinem, Princess Diana, Whoopi Goldberg, to essays on workplace harassment, readers get a take on a four decades and how women have shaped a narrative.
"Founding Mothers: The Women Who Raised Our Nation," by the late Cokie Roberts, author and television commentator, proved to be a worthy read. When David Rubenstein asked how long it took her to research and write the book about The Revolutionary War, Roberts said that while searching the manuscript division of the Library of Congress, she found a trove of long letters written by the Founding Mothers. She said the letters are unvarnished and frank. There is a much more complete view of society as a whole and a truer sense of the men receiving the letters. The last question Rubenstein poses is which mother is most impressive. The answer was all are impressive for different reasons. Roberts said she would enjoy dinner with Sarah Livingston Jay. Roberts had her menus and enjoyed them with family.
"The American Story" includes Chief Justice John G. Roberts and how, by chance, he had an encounter while an undergraduate at Harvard. He expected to be an historian, but a cab ride in Boston changed his mind. When the driver mentioned he'd been a history major at Harvard, John Roberts decided to pursue a law career, which would not force him to be driving cabs after graduation. His answer to what is the greatest pleasure of being chief justice is not surprising. The answer: "I get to do work I enjoy in service of the country I love with eight others, and I can do it for as long as I want."
On a personal note, my knowledge of history and those who have shaped it and those who continue to shape it have been through the wonderful, committed authors who have shared. Books give seniors and others a glimpse into other worlds within our own country so we can understand what is going on outside our own windows. Happy reading.

Texto completo: A Maine coon cat and its inquisitive owner take center stage in "Careless Whiskers," (Berkley Prime Crime/Penguin Random House), the latest novel by Miranda James. It's the 12th installment in the New York Times best-selling author's "Cat in the Stacks" series.
Miranda James is the pseudonym of Dean James, a seventh-generation Mississippian who recently returned to his home state after 30 years in Texas, according to his website, catinthstacks.com. Whether writing under the pen name or his own, Dean James has fans eager for mystery and suspense with cozy, down-home heart and humor.
Charlie Harris is a librarian at a small college in fictional Athena, Mississippi. The widower is passionate about his family and friends, justice for all, and about an arrogant cat named Diesel. The cat goes everywhere with Charlie, including the college theatre where his daughter, Laura, is co-starring in a play directed by her husband, Frank Salisbury.
It's there that Charlie and Diesel get caught up in their latest adventure, even though Charlie has sworn off crime-fighting. A guest performer, Luke Lombardi, whose fame is fading faster than a falling star, is poisoned on stage.
The cast of suspects include Laura, who handed him the poisoned drink, a mysterious stranger sneaking around backstage, an odd playwright with location connections, and two French followers (one a lover, one an employee) of the now-dead actor. Is one of these people also threatening Charlie's daughter, or is there someone else lurking in the wings?
James keeps readers entertained with an easy-flowing dialogue and well-developed characters. Readers can identify with the cast and settings. As befitting a well-educated character, Charlie Harris has a way with words and literary references. Recurring characters, such as the Ducote sisters, Melba and Azalea, and developing relationships between humans and pets bring home the small-town feel of neighborhoods and family dinners.
And although this novel is part of a series, it can be read as a stand-alone with easy-to-follow throwbacks to earlier stories. The series began with "Murder Past Due" in 2010, and a new novel has been released each year since then. The next — and 13th — novel, "Cat Me if You Can," is due out in August.
Susan O'Bryan was a journalist for 30 years before she joined the University of Mississippi Medical Center in 2010 as a web content coordinator. She is a freelance writer for several newspapers and literary review.

Texto completo: In our self-centered business landscape, asking how you can help others is a counter-intuitive strategy for your own achievement.
In our quest for achievement, it's easy to get caught up in complexity. We often think something has to be difficult in order for it to drive real progress.
But then something so simple comes along that drives the most profound advancement in our careers, companies and even in communities.
I've discovered three dead-simple questions that can dramatically upgrade your results. Easy inquiries to take your game to the next level:
1. What's the one extra thing I can add? This is a question we ask ourselves when we're about to complete a project, sales call, assignment, email, presentation, or any other form of work product.
The powerful question challenges you to add that extra special something that will make your work stand out.
You've already taken the time and energy to do a good job, so why not add that little extra dash of creativity to make it special?
The smallest over-deliver against expectations will blow away those around you and — if practiced consistently — can change the trajectory of your career.
2. How can I help? In our self-centered business landscape, asking how you can help others is a counter-intuitive strategy for your own achievement.
If you're constantly on the look out for how you can boost someone else's day or help them shine, the rewards will come back to your tenfold.
If this becomes one of your daily mantras, you'll stand out as a servant leader, a great colleague, and a team member on the rise.
3. What can I do better next time? Especially in situations when you deliver a strong result, ask the person on the other side of the table for feedback on how you can drive even more value the next time.
First, your humility will be refreshing. Secondly, asking people for their ideas and help gets them invested in your success. Plus, you'll get powerful feedback to up your game while showcasing that you're exactly the type of person people love to work with.
Try to inject these three questions as frequently as possible and in as many situations as you can (hint: they work beautifully in your personal life too). Think how much you'd love the person down the hall who constantly practiced this framework. When asked consistently and often, these are small questions that will yield gigantic results.
No question about it.

Texto completo: DE PERE - Sylvia Bowersox didn't know how much one dog could change a life until Timothy came into hers.
A U.S. Army veteran who did three tours in Iraq as a broadcast journalist and press officer, she struggled in the years after she returned home in 2007 — 10 days after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was hanged.
Bowersox, suffering from traumatic brain injury, severe post-traumatic stress disorder and "a whole alphabet of other things," was misdiagnosed by Veterans Affairs with bipolar disorder and was put on lithium and a host of other drugs.
"They had me on just bizarre, bizarre medications. I was a zombie. I was an absolute zombie. I wasn't functioning," she said. "I was just beside myself, because I am not bipolar. They kept upping my doses, so I did not have a quality of life at all. I was desperate."
She was living in Columbus, Ohio, when the idea of a service dog to help with the PTSD first came up. She was referred to a local program in which jail inmates trained dogs, but when the door slammed behind her the first time she visited, she had a massive panic attack. She never went back. She wasn't well enough.
Then her husband Jon found Little Angels Service Dogs, which trains canines on a 10-acre ranch outside San Diego. That's where she would meet Timothy, a British Labrador puppy she first laid eyes on via Skype.
"The first thing he did is he walked up and he started cleaning my face," Bowersox said.
He was a year old when she took him home. They've been inseparable in the nearly nine years since.
"Timothy is my baby. He's my fur baby. He's my child," said Bowersox, a writer and painter who moved to De Pere in 2016. "He tells me when I've had enough and I have to go walk around the building. He paws at me when I'm freaking out. He sleeps with me. When I disassociate, he just sits at my feet and doesn't go anywhere and doesn't let me go anywhere until I come out of it. He is amazing. He's my guy."
Sharing her story on the big screen The two are co-stars in "To Be of Service," a documentary by Josh Aronson about war veterans with PTSD and the service dogs that have helped them regain their lives. The film opened in select U.S. cities in November and is streaming on Netflix.
The crew filmed Bowersox and Timothy in De Pere, including at Luna Cafe and Roastery, and also at Little Angels for one of Timothy's training refresher courses and during Bowersox's reading of her "This War Can't Be All Bad" in Venice, California.
"To Be of Service" was one of 159 documentary features submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Science for 2020 Oscar consideration. It received strong reviews from The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and others, but it did not make the cut as one of five nominees in its Oscar category.
The film also received national attention for "Unbroken," the song Bon Jovi wrote for the project. The band is donating all proceeds from downloads of the single to the Patriotic Service Dog Foundation, a nonprofit that provides service dogs to veterans in need.
There wasn't a red carpet premiere that allowed Bowersox the chance to rub elbows with Jon Bon Jovi — she'd tell him how much his lyrics captured the veterans experience, particularly "I'd do it all again" — but she was able to catch a screening in Chicago. She and Timothy appeared on NBC's "Today with Hoda & Jenna" on Veterans Day to talk about the importance of service dogs for veterans.
She was also in attendance when "To Be of Service" was screened for Congress. She spent two days in Washington, D.C. encouraging members to support the PAWS Act. The Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act was introduced in June to make service dogs more accessible to veterans looking for an alternative PTSD treatment. If passed, it would require the VA to provide a $25,000 voucher for a service dog to veterans diagnosed with PTSD.
The VA does not currently cover the expense of a service dog. One veteran in the film did a GoFundMe campaign to raise the money. Bowersox knows when Timothy retires in another year, she'll need to somehow come up with $30,000 for her next service dog.
"My thought is why do we as veterans have to go begging for a service dog? Why are we doing this? That's why I got behind the PAWS Act," she said.
Eating cat food: bad. Getting belly rubs: good. It's impossible for Bowersox to put a price on how valuable Timothy has been to her.
"He's my partner in crime," she says. "He's phenomenal. He settles me. He's my best pal."
It took the two about a year to get to know each other. He had to figure out what his job was, what her needs were and how that all fit into what he knows how to do. She had to learn how to deal with people who want to pet him when they're out in public, a no-no as it's a distraction from his job.
She also had to learn how to properly feed him. She overdid it at first and "he became a little sausage." He's closer to his ideal weight now, but it hasn't stopped him from trying to convince her he's starving.
They reached a mutual agreement that he couldn't eat the cat's food. Not good for the cat — or his digestive system. Belly rubs, however, are always good.
With the exception of a trip overseas that kept them apart for a couple weeks, Bowersox is never without him. Where she goes, he goes, including Chicago, where she's studying art. Calm and relaxed, Timothy can sense when Bowersox is feeling anxious. In the year when she was having frequent nightmares, he would wake her up.
"When I'm in a place and he decides I need to take a break, well, he's 80 pounds, so when he says, 'Nope, we're leaving,' we're going," she said.
"What happens to me, because of my brain injury and because of my PTSD, if I allow myself to get overstimulated, overly stressed, I shut down. I completely shut down. I either do one of two things. I either get really, really scared or the lights are on but nobody's home. ... We work together. He is my barometer."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - When Louis C.K. returned to the Comedy Cellar nine months after confessing to sexual misconduct, many criticized the club in tweets and articles, and a few protested and walked out of shows. But the only star comic to stop performing there was Leslie Jones.
She started spending more time at the Comic Strip on the Upper East Side near her home. "They took his picture down," Jones said of that club, adding, "Mine's up."
Jones, who has talked to the Comedy Cellar's management about her disappointment but has returned to the club after a long stint away, said it was a personal decision.
"I knew girls," she said, pausing and holding a stare, "and they got to walk into the club and see him talking to the owner. That ain't cool."
Using a metaphor she returned to a couple of times in our interview, Jones said she no longer cared about rocking the boat: "I am at the age when I will get off the boat and get on another damn boat."
Last year, she exited the biggest yacht in comedy, "Saturday Night Live," and when asked why, Jones paused, uncharacteristically cautious: "I'm 52 and tired. 'SNL' is a hard job. It's 100 hours a week," she said. "Also, it's an institution. I get bored. And I want to do different things."
So she is, with movie and television projects in the works this year (the "Coming to America" sequel and a reboot of "Supermarket Sweep," which she will host), along with a just-released Netflix special, "Time Machine," directed by the showrunners of "Game of Thrones," David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.
Onstage and off, Jones is not short on swagger.
"I want to be the next Johnny Carson," she said. "I want 'The Tonight Show' really bad."
But what about Jimmy Fallon?
"I love Jimmy, but Jimmy is going to leave in a minute," she said. "And who are they going to possibly fill that spot with?"
After clarifying "except Seth Meyers," she answered her question with a roar: "ME!" She then flashed a stern face that pushed defiance into a deliriously funny kind of self-parody.
Jones thinks a lot about funny faces. She has studied the greats - Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball, whom she said had "the best faces in the game" - and developed her own go-to expressions from hours of testing in front of a mirror. There's the withering glare that writers on "SNL" would write into scripts as "the Leslie Look." It was inspired by the exasperation of her late brother, while a photo of her father in Vietnam is the model for her most unhinged expression, eyes popped out, one more than the other, a glance she uses to intimidate audiences and tame hecklers.
When Jones kills at clubs - and she can lay waste to an audience in a way that few others today can match - it can seem like a force of nature, the work of raw charisma and a tornado of energy. But make no mistake: She's a veteran student of her craft, honing her act since 1987 when she started telling jokes onstage as a Colorado college student in a contest before moving back to Los Angeles. However, she describes her new hour as a reintroduction. Since rocketing to fame on network television, she has an entirely new audience, one that's far whiter than the crowds she played to early in her career.
When asked about the difference, Jones said white audiences are "so much easier," before cackling and assuring me she loves the high standards of her black fans.
"You know how they say if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere?" she said. "If you can make it with a black audience, you can make it with anyone."
In the last few years, Jones' comedy has also evolved, thanks to a collaboration with comic Lenny Marcus, a bespectacled Jewish tactician of stand-up who opens for her and gives notes on jokes.
Jones, 6 feet tall with a booming voice, has always been a ferocious and freewheeling performer, but Marcus persuaded her to make a set list for the first time, to stick to the same jokes at every show as opposed to improvising new lines, and also to be more strategic with crowd work.
"She is also so quick and even when just talking, she's captivating," Marcus said by phone.
The funniest moments in a Jones performance are not really the move from setup to punchline but the radically extreme pivots between emotions. No comic alive travels a greater distance between confidence and vulnerability. In her most ambitious bit in the new special, she dramatizes texting a boyfriend, veering from angry dismissals to heartbreak and desperation in mere moments. "It's not easy to date Leslie Jones," she said, a line written by Marcus.
Being lonely in love has been a common theme of her comedy since the start of her career. Her first reliable joke involved telling women who can't find a man to visit the produce section of the supermarket, before whipping out a cucumber and later taking a bite out of it. "Do you know how many rotten cucumbers were in my car?" she said, laughing at that early prop work.
As a famous black woman in comedy, Jones has taken more abuse than most. After the sexist controversy over an all-female "Ghostbusters," which she starred in, Jones became the target of trolls. Her phone was hacked, and nude photos were spread across the internet.
Jones quickly turned this incident into comedy on "SNL," but she said that the intensity of the backlash got to her, briefly. It didn't make her stop sending nude photos. "I remember the person I sent it to was like, 'You ain't learned yet? You learned nothing,' " she said, letting out a booming guffaw.
And when the trailer for another "Ghostbusters" was recently released, she saw it as vindication for the worst critics. "It pissed me off," she said. "It feels like, 'They did it wrong, and we know you guys were upset about that little girls' "Ghostbusters," so we're going to do it right now.' "
She added that her movie was hurt by studio interference and an edit that took out 20 minutes of strong material, and she wished she had spoken up in protest.
"If I was the Leslie I am now, I think it would have went different," she said, shifting her face into not exactly the Leslie Look but something adjacent. "Big franchise, don't rock the boat," she said. "I wish I would have rocked the boat."

Texto completo: There was a time when if you were out of town and mentioned you were from Rochester, people would know you came from the home of Kodak. Now, it looks like the Garbage Plate has pushed Kodak aside as the city's identifier.
Food has beaten film.
The Plate's fame was amplified recently by the comedian Jim Gaffigan on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show. While in Rochester recently, Gaffigan visited Nick Tahou Hots on West Main Street, the home of the Garbage Plate. It had him at "Hello."
"I highly recommend it if you go to Rochester," Gaffigan told O'Brien.
Given this national recognition, it's time that the Garbage Plate got a little love from this column. For years, I've sung the praises of chicken French, a dish with clear Rochester origins. But I haven't really given the Garbage Plate its due. So here we go, for all of us who wold like a refresher:
The Garbage Plate's origin story began with the first Alex Tahou, a Greek immigrant, who opened an eatery called Hots and Potatoes in Rochester in 1918. He served a dish that echoed his establishment's name, hot dogs, potatoes, cold beans and Italian bread.
His son, Nick Tahou, arrived from Greece in 1937 and worked with his dad, their establishment eventually becoming Nick Tahou Hots. It's now at 320 W. Main St. and owned by Nick's son, Alex.
According to the second Alex Tahou, the Garbage Plate evolved over time, building on the foundation established by his grandfather. Patrons can now mix and match ingredients, choosing hot dogs or hamburgers, and any combination of home fries, French fries, beans and macaroni salad. All of this can be topped with a meaty hot sauce.
The Garbage Plate got its name, Alex Tahou says, from customers coming in and asking for "one of those plates with all the garbage on it." They eventually shortened that order to, "The Garbage Plate."
For a while, the Tahous discouraged the name. "We told people, 'Don't use that,'" Alex said. "'It's food; it doesn't sound good.'"
Making a plus out of what they originally thought was a minus, the family trademarked the Garbage Plate name in 1992. That explains why all the Garbage Plate sound-alikes that have sprung up in the Rochester area aren't really Garbage Plates.
The New York Times sampled the Garbage Plate in a 2016 story by Justin Sablich. "It's an outlaw dish," Michael Stern, a founder of roadfood.com, told Sablich.
But Stern made clear that the Garbage Plate is an outlaw dish that works. "There's a huge amount of gastronomy that succeeds because it goes against what we're supposed to like and supposed to be eating," he said.
Stern's appreciation of the Garbage Plate contrasts with that of Jan Wong, a Toronto Globe and Mail reporter who took a flame thrower to Rochester in a November 2003 story.
Wong described her cheeseburger at Tahou's as "dry as a cracker." She also suggested that an unnamed "skinny cashier appears to eat elsewhere."
In a follow-up story in the Democrat and Chronicle, Alex Tahou said that if Wong had asked, he would have cooked her another cheeseburger. The waitress, Bobby Wasson, said that she didn't mind being called skinny and that she ate at Tahou's and was partial to macaroni topped with cheese and hot sauce.
In Wong's defense, it was 2003, and the Garbage Plate's charms as an outlaw dish had not been nationally recognized.
Seventeen years later, it's clear that the Garbage Plate has more than arrived. It's Rochester's signature dish. Eat your heart out, Toronto and everywhere else.

Latinos in Iowa prepare to partake in 'el caucus' But activists decry lack of interpreters for emerging bloc

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - There is no Spanish translation for a caucus, that political process particular to just a few states. It is simply "el caucus."
But for many Latinos in Iowa, el caucus is hardly simple. The state's Latino population has surged in recent decades, with the number registered to vote estimated at more than 50,000, making it a potentially important bloc in the fast-approaching Democratic caucuses. And local leaders like Vanessa Marcano-Kelly believe there are not nearly enough Spanish-tailored caucus sites or interpreters to meet the need in the state.
"I feel like this year everyone has been talking about how Iowa is superwhite, but it's really not superwhite to me," said Marcano-Kelly, who petitioned the state Democratic Party to create caucus sites in Spanish. "I see Latinos everywhere."
It is the first Iowa caucus for Marcano-Kelly, 34. In 2016, she watched from the sidelines, slightly bewildered at the spectacle and wondering how people could possibly understand if they did not speak English. As she wrote in her application months ago to the state Democratic Party, the Spanish sites would "ensure that the voices of all people can really be heard."
So on Feb. 3, the doors will open at the South Suburban YMCA in Des Moines for hundreds of Spanish-speaking caucusgoers.
Marcano-Kelly has been refreshing her Spanish vocabulary as she searches for the right words - some easier (viable is "viable"), some more obscure (threshold is "límite").
Although Latinos make up just 6% of Iowa's population, they have more than doubled in the state in the last two decades.
In nearly a dozen towns throughout the state, Latinos now make up more than one-third of the population. And since 2016, the League of United Latin American Citizens has worked to get thousands more registered to vote, a number the group estimates has now grown to 53,000.
Roughly 194,000 Latinos live in the state, and by most estimates, fewer than 3,000 participated in the 2016 caucuses. This year, Latino activists expect that number to grow to 20,000 or more. And for the first time, there are set to be six Spanish satellite caucus sites, a concession Democratic Party officials made to try to increase participation.
But despite the efforts, many activists believe there are not nearly enough interpreters lined up for the caucuses. Party officials are still scrambling to find bilingual speakers to run the Spanish caucuses, even as they look for more Spanish speakers to volunteer at other sites throughout the state.
And while some campaigns plan to send Spanish-speaking volunteers to towns where Latinos make up more than one-third of the population, there is no clear system to ensure that Spanish-speaking caucusgoers will have interpretation services.
"Whatever the number is, I think it would be impossible to have enough to meet the need," said Rob Barron, a Polk County school board member who runs a group dedicated to electing more Latinos to office. "Even if you're a native English speaker, the process is intimidating. So for those who are willing to walk into that room without speaking the language, then hear words like viable, it's only going to get more and more chaotic and confusing."
When the Democratic Party put a call out for applications for satellite caucuses that could be held away from traditional geographic precincts, Marcano-Kelly knew that she would write one for Spanish. She thought of several of her friends who recently became citizens but do not speak English as well as many Puerto Ricans she knows who moved to Iowa after Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.
After submitting the satellite application, Marcano-Kelly decided she would become the precinct captain for Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, in charge of rounding up supporters who come to the Spanish caucus. But in recent days she has found herself grappling with whether her primary responsibility lies with the campaign or individual voters.
Evidence of a booming Latino population can be seen in pockets all over the state, including Des Moines, where Latinos make up 12% of the city's population and 26% of public school students. In recent years, Mexicans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans have settled here, many moving from California, Illinois and Texas.
Showing up to places where Latinos congregate has been a part of the strategy for some of the campaigns and the League of United Latin American Citizens, more commonly known as LULAC, which has led the effort to register more Latinos. The group has held voter registration drives at stores and sponsored several mock caucus trainings in the state.

Streaming's rising costs help refresh video stores

Texto completo: My wife and I finally made time to see the new Star Wars movie, "The Rise of Skywalker," in a theater last week. But, before we did, we wanted to rewatch the two films that preceded it. The challenge was finding them.
I used to – way back, like five years ago – handle tasks like this by Googling the content I wanted to watch and then playing it on one of the handful of existing streaming services I subscribed to. That doesn't really work anymore. As streaming apps are proliferating, the content I'm looking for in most cases turns out to be available on a service that I don't have.
If you want to watch Star Wars films, as we did, then the only way to stream them is to spend $7 a month on a new service called Disney Plus. I am not going to do that, not even for Baby Yoda (at least, not until my 9-month-old son learns what Disney is).
Instead, we went to the Family Video store near our house, paid about $6 to rent both films on Blu-ray and watched them. It was a very 2003 way to spend a weekend. But, as changing times once called for people to adopt streaming technology, the most recent evolution of video content is making video stores great again. At least, the few that remain.
It's expensive to subscribe to everything If you haven't paid attention while driving around Indianapolis, you might be baffled by a reference to video stores in 2020. That's understandable. The once-ubiquitous Blockbuster Video and Hollywood Video chains have been gone for about a decade. They collapsed around the time that video streaming was hitting its peak for consumers.
For a brief golden era, you could subscribe to Netflix, Hulu and, maybe, Amazon Prime Video, and you'd have access to almost all the content you could want – or, at least, so much that you didn't have time to miss the shows and movies that weren't available.
But video stores didn't entirely go extinct – and that era of streaming didn't last long. Much like 2010, we are again at a turning point.
Now, if you want access to everything that the internet has to offer on demand, you have to pay monthly fees to all the early players, plus newcomers including CBS All Access, ESPN Plus, Apple TV Plus and the aforementioned Disney Plus. That doesn't include the cost of cable or live-television services such as YouTube TV, or longtime premium services such as HBO and Showtime. Soon, there will be even more options, including NBC's upcoming streaming service, called Peacock, and a short-form video app called Quibi.
You could easily spend more than $200 a month to ensure you always have immediate access to the programming you want. But your best, most cost-effective option for watching something in 2020 might be renting it on a title-by-title basis.
Just like the old days.
Video stores remain in Indy At a time when no one thinks about video stores, Indianapolis is uniquely well served by them. Family Video, a chain with hundreds of locations, mostly in the Midwest, still has several stores across the city.
While everyone might have been fed up with late fees 10 years ago, Family Video now offers an oasis for people fed up with paying for new subscriptions. Even accounting for the notorious late fee, it is now generally cheaper to go into a Family Video and rent a movie or TV show than it is to pay for whatever streaming service has the content you want.
And, while Family Video might be the only video store left standing in Indianapolis, it is not the only option for a la carte video borrowing. There are still Redbox locations everywhere and you can probably rent what you're looking for at no cost from the public library (though you might have to wait for it).
I realize there are some problems with my argument that borrowing DVDs is suddenly relevant again.
Do you own a DVD or Blu-ray player? Even Family Video has been closing stores lately.
Overall DVD consumption is in a perpetual free fall. DVD sales plummeted from $10 billion in 2010 to about a third of that now, according to Digital Entertainment Group data cited by The Los Angeles Times.
That ties in with perhaps the biggest problem. As one of my colleagues pointed out when I mentioned this idea, she doesn't own a DVD player. That would certainly make it hard to watch a DVD.
If you don't own a device that plays DVDs, it's a good time to consider getting one. Even if the idea of reverting back to renting movies doesn't appeal to you, it's worth considering whether it might be better to just buy the content you watch rather than pay endless monthly fees for access that could end at some point.
Veronica Walsingham made this point well last week in a thoughtful New York Times essay that imagines it's 2022 and she has realized it was a mistake to pay for streaming services that keep splintering.
"We never outsmarted the entertainment industry when we opted for Netflix subscriptions over cable," Walsingham writes. "Instead, we gave the industry a way to monetize our love of one or two television shows forever."
From cable bundles to apps, studios are good at finding ways to capture the most money for their content. When they evolve, consumers should consider doing the same, even if it feels like a step backward.

Texto completo: What does it mean to have a child with epilepsy?
It means holding your breath every time she has a seizure.
It means worrying every time she goes off to school that I will get "the call."
It means making unexpected trips to the hospital while on vacation out of state.
My daughter's first seizure happened when she was 18 months old. As I held my shaking toddler in my arms, Alexandra turned blue and I thought she was dying. That seizure happened 21 years ago, but the memory of it is still as fresh today as it was the day it happened.
That seizure changed our lives. The journey that it sent us on was long and filled with setbacks. Finding the right combination of medications to control seizures and minimize side effects can be difficult as medications affect each person differently and it can take a lot of trial and error to find the right combination.
And once the doctors get it right, your child has a growth spurt and you have to start again.
While epilepsy, and everything that came with it, has been a struggle for us, I am so very thankful. Years ago, one of Alex's neurologists recommended that I connect with the local epilepsy support agency — Epilepsy-Pralid Inc. I immediately joined the board and got Alex involved in their programs.
Through my work with EPI, I have met many families who have it much worse — who struggle daily with seizures, with multiple children with epilepsy, and with the financial burden of a chronic medical condition.
EPI helps these families through a number of supports and services. We provide important epilepsy education services and seizure first aid training — from sitting down with newly diagnosed families to educating school health classes. EPI connects families through networking groups, recreation opportunities, a college scholarship, teen weekend retreats and summer camps.
Much of this work receives financial support from the Chocolate Ball, EPI's annual gala dedicated to raising awareness and support for our epilepsy services. The Chocolate Ball is a night of fundraising and celebration. This community offers much to those affected by epilepsy — education, networking, support — but there is still much work to be done.
Come celebrate with us on Feb. 1, 2020, as we host the 34th annual Chocolate Ball. Taste award-winning, Food Network-worthy cakes, made by local bakers right here in Rochester. Listen to our keynote speaker, Kurt Eichenwald, a former New York Times investigative journalist who has struggled with epilepsy since college. Learn about how Camp EAGR, our sleepaway summer camp for kids with epilepsy changes lives.
Don't miss out on Rochester's sweetest gala — check it out at epiny.org.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa - There is no Spanish translation for a caucus, that political process particular to just a few states. It is simply "el caucus."
But for many Latinos in Iowa, el caucus is hardly simple. The state's Latino population has surged in recent decades, with the number registered to vote estimated at more than 50,000, making it a potentially important bloc in the fast-approaching Democratic caucuses. And local leaders like Vanessa Marcano-Kelly believe there are not nearly enough Spanish-tailored caucus sites or interpreters to meet the need in the state.
"I feel like this year everyone has been talking about how Iowa is superwhite, but it's really not superwhite to me," said Marcano-Kelly, who petitioned the state Democratic Party to create caucus sites in Spanish. "I see Latinos everywhere."
It is the first Iowa caucus for Marcano-Kelly, 34. In 2016, she watched from the sidelines, slightly bewildered at the spectacle and wondering how people could possibly understand if they did not speak English. As she wrote in her application months ago to the state Democratic Party, the Spanish sites would "ensure that the voices of all people can really be heard."
So on Feb. 3, the doors will open at the South Suburban YMCA in Des Moines for hundreds of Spanish-speaking caucusgoers.
Marcano-Kelly has been refreshing her Spanish vocabulary as she searches for the right words - some easier (viable is "viable"), some more obscure (threshold is "límite").
Although Latinos make up just 6% of Iowa's population, they have more than doubled in the state in the last two decades.
In nearly a dozen towns throughout the state, Latinos now make up more than one-third of the population. And since 2016, the League of United Latin American Citizens has worked to get thousands more registered to vote, a number the group estimates has now grown to 53,000.
Roughly 194,000 Latinos live in the state, and by most estimates, fewer than 3,000 participated in the 2016 caucuses. This year, Latino activists expect that number to grow to 20,000 or more. And for the first time, there are set to be six Spanish satellite caucus sites, a concession Democratic Party officials made to try to increase participation.
But despite the efforts, many activists believe there are not nearly enough interpreters lined up for the caucuses. Party officials are still scrambling to find bilingual speakers to run the Spanish caucuses, even as they look for more Spanish speakers to volunteer at other sites throughout the state.
And while some campaigns plan to send Spanish-speaking volunteers to towns where Latinos make up more than one-third of the population, there is no clear system to ensure that Spanish-speaking caucusgoers will have interpretation services.
"Whatever the number is, I think it would be impossible to have enough to meet the need," said Rob Barron, a Polk County school board member who runs a group dedicated to electing more Latinos to office. "Even if you're a native English speaker, the process is intimidating. So for those who are willing to walk into that room without speaking the language, then hear words like viable, it's only going to get more and more chaotic and confusing."
When the Democratic Party put a call out for applications for satellite caucuses that could be held away from traditional geographic precincts, Marcano-Kelly knew that she would write one for Spanish. She thought of several of her friends who recently became citizens but do not speak English as well as many Puerto Ricans she knows who moved to Iowa after Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017.
After submitting the satellite application, Marcano-Kelly decided she would become the precinct captain for Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign, in charge of rounding up supporters who come to the Spanish caucus. But in recent days she has found herself grappling with whether her primary responsibility lies with the campaign or individual voters.
Evidence of a booming Latino population can be seen in pockets all over the state, including Des Moines, where Latinos make up 12% of the city's population and 26% of public school students. In recent years, Mexicans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans have settled here, many moving from California, Illinois and Texas.
Showing up to places where Latinos congregate has been a part of the strategy for some of the campaigns and the League of United Latin American Citizens, more commonly known as LULAC, which has led the effort to register more Latinos. The group has held voter registration drives at stores and sponsored several mock caucus trainings in the state.

Texto completo: A Maine coon cat and its inquisitive owner take center stage in "Careless Whiskers," (Berkley Prime Crime/Penguin Random House), the latest novel by Miranda James. It's the 12th installment in the New York Times best-selling author's "Cat in the Stacks" series.
Miranda James is the pseudonym of Dean James, a seventh-generation Mississippian who recently returned to his home state after 30 years in Texas, according to his website, catinthstacks.com. Whether writing under the pen name or his own, Dean James has fans eager for mystery and suspense with cozy, down-home heart and humor.
Charlie Harris is a librarian at a small college in fictional Athena, Mississippi. The widower is passionate about his family and friends, justice for all, and about an arrogant cat named Diesel. The cat goes everywhere with Charlie, including the college theatre where his daughter, Laura, is co-starring in a play directed by her husband, Frank Salisbury.
It's there that Charlie and Diesel get caught up in their latest adventure, even though Charlie has sworn off crime-fighting. A guest performer, Luke Lombardi, whose fame is fading faster than a falling star, is poisoned on stage.
The cast of suspects include Laura, who handed him the poisoned drink, a mysterious stranger sneaking around backstage, an odd playwright with location connections, and two French followers (one a lover, one an employee) of the now-dead actor. Is one of these people also threatening Charlie's daughter, or is there someone else lurking in the wings?
James keeps readers entertained with an easy-flowing dialogue and well-developed characters. Readers can identify with the cast and settings. As befitting a well-educated character, Charlie Harris has a way with words and literary references. Recurring characters, such as the Ducote sisters, Melba and Azalea, and developing relationships between humans and pets bring home the small-town feel of neighborhoods and family dinners.
And although this novel is part of a series, it can be read as a stand-alone with easy-to-follow throwbacks to earlier stories. The series began with "Murder Past Due" in 2010, and a new novel has been released each year since then. The next — and 13th — novel, "Cat Me if You Can," is due out in August.
Susan O'Bryan was a journalist for 30 years before she joined the University of Mississippi Medical Center in 2010 as a web content coordinator. She is a freelance writer for several newspapers and literary review.

Film on fashion photographer hits Island first

Texto completo: Call it the documentary that almost never was. "The Times of Bill Cunningham," Mark Bozek's portrait of the late, legendary fashion photographer, began as a one-minute video clip for an awards ceremony in 1993. More than 25 years later, Bozek's raw interview footage has been transformed into a feature-length documentary that will arrive in theaters Feb. 14. Bozek will bring his film in person to Huntington's Cinema Arts Centre Feb. 1 at 3 p.m.
"I started this as a kind of side project," says Bozek, a first-time filmmaker who compiled an early cut of the movie on a laptop in his Huntington home. "Instead it took over my life for the last two-and-a-half years."
Bozek, 60, may not be a Long Island native - he's from Michigan -but he has a couple of strong connections to the area. For one, he's the guy who discovered East Meadow's Joy Mangano while she was selling her now-famous Miracle Mops on the QVC shopping channel, where he was Senior Vice President of Broadcasting. (David O. Russell's biopic "Joy" featured a version of him played by Bradley Cooper. "I will mention that for the rest of my life," Bozek says). His wife, Susan, hails from Oyster Bay; they moved to Huntington in 2003.
Having also worked in the apparel industry for a time, Bozek was familiar with Cunningham, a self-taught photographer who became famous for his journalistic approach to fashion. Cunningham was a mainstay at The New York Times for nearly 30 years and a contributor to Details magazine; he also mounted several exhibits of his work. At the same time, Cunningham avoided the limelight himself, preferring instead to be known as just another New York eccentric - the old guy on the bike, wearing his trademark blue jacket and taking snapshots all over the city.
Bozek was working as a producer Fox Television, he says, when he began pursuing Cunningham for an interview in 1993. Cunningham refused, but later called back to ask a favor: He was receiving a fashion-industry award and didn't want to attend the ceremony -- would Bozek mind videotaping a short acceptance speech? Bozek grabbed a camera and several Betacam videocassettes and showed up to Cunningham's studio - a kitchen-less, bathroom-less apartment above Carnegie Hall -- for what turned into a non-stop, four-hour talk session. (Cunningham's place was so dark that they filmed in a friend's apartment in the same building.)
Bozek isn't sure why Cunningham spoke so candidly that day. "I'm no Barbara Walters," he says. Even when Cunningham began to shed tears - while talking about his own shyness, for instance -- he insisted the camera keep rolling. "After about 45 minutes I realized I should just keep quiet," Bozek recalls. The interview ended only when the tape ran out.
The day of Cunningham's death, in 2016, Bozek dug out those now-obsolete Betacam tapes. He found a company that could digitize them, then began piecing together what would become "The Times of Bill Cunningham." He showed a rough cut to the late photographer's friends, whom he says gave it their blessing; a meeting with Cunningham's niece, Patricia Simonson, who controls his archives, resulted in access to roughly 3 million photographs. A proposal for Sarah Jessica Parker to serve as narrator met with a quick yes. The film is being released by Greenwich Entertainment, which helped release the Oscar-winning documentary "Free Solo" in 2018.
"Some people say he would have hated all this attention," Bozek says of Cunningham. "But other of his friends say the opposite - that in his own way, he would have loved this."

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN IOWA THE HAWKEYE STATE IS KNOWN FOR ITS DARING DECISIONS

Texto completo: It's less than 10 days before Iowans, possibly braving bitter cold and blowing snow, head to school libraries, church basements, community centers and veterans' halls to begin the formal process of choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. The outcome is as uncertain as the weather.
Iowans are accustomed to making daring decisions. They chose a former director of central intelligence, George H.W. Bush, over a conservative icon who had been a two-term governor of California, Ronald Reagan, in 1980. Some 28 years later they chose an unknown senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, over a onetime vice-presidential nominee, John Edwards, and a first lady-turned-senator, Hillary Clinton.
Almost three-quarters of the winners of contested races in Iowa since 1972 have won their party's nomination, but just two (Jimmy Carter and Mr. Obama) won the White House. So Iowa sets the table but doesn't necessarily serve up the meal.
Even so, no one doubts the importance of the caucuses, and no one, except former Mayor Mike Bloomberg of New York, is willing to bypass them. And this time, the struggle to win Iowa is more obscured than usual.
"This contest is far more unsettled than most," says a veteran caucus observer, Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Des Moines' Drake University. "There is nobody running away with this. Iowa caucuses bring surprises, and right now there is no clear front-runner. Huge numbers are undecided or subject to change their minds. Anyone who would predict the winner would be foolish."
That's partially because no one knows whether Amy Klobuchar is surging. Her poll numbers are low, but she has visited all 99 counties and is airing ads like mad. She's the senator from Minnesota, which shares a long border at 43º 30' N, roughly near the divide between the watersheds of the Des Moines, Iowa and Blue Earth rivers. Geography matters. For one thing, it makes it easy for her supporters to flood across the border to assist her candidacy.
The 1988 caucuses are illustrative. They were won by Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, which borders Iowa at the south, with Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, which borders Iowa to the east, coming in second. (Geography is not infallible. Rep. Michelle Bachman of Minnesota came in sixth in a field of seven in 2012, with barely over 6,000 votes.)
No one knows for sure whether former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., has peaked. He led the polls in the state from mid-November through the end of December but may have faded since then. Former Vice President Joe Biden has been leading in recent days, but his fortunes have risen and fallen like the levels of the Mississippi River, where the Iowa cities of Burlington, Bettendorf, Davenport, Dubuque and Marquette sit.
Those are only some of the moving parts bearing on the caucuses. Indeed, there have been several changes in the structure of the contest in recent days, and the most significant have come from the East, which has shaped Iowa since the Black Hawk Treaty of 1833 opened most of the state to white settlement. The 2020 influences come from New York and Washington.
From New York comes The New York Times' double endorsement of Ms. Klobuchar and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Though candidates actively seek the endorsement of The Des Moines Register, newspaper endorsements ordinarily do not provide substantial boosts to candidates. (Best example: In 1972, the Manchester Union Leader supported Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles in the Democratic race. Yorty won 6% of the vote that year.) Endorsements from far away - especially from New York, especially from The Times, especially at a time of press distrust - have little possibility of possessing much weight.
But this one might. No one will vote for the Minnesotan on the basis of The Times recommendation. But the endorsement has the potential of elevating Ms. Klobuchar into the top tier. Then anything can happen.
The second factor is in Washington, also where anything can happen - except perhaps a Senate vote removing President Donald Trump from office.
But the Senate trial now underway requires all sitting senators to do exactly that - sit. And by sitting in the Senate chamber, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont aren't running in Iowa. They are hostages to the Senate trial, leaving Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg with all the airtime and attention. The three senators at the top of the race are sidelined. So is Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is struggling for air in the presidential race and now is essentially out of breath.
The Times editorial does in some way reshape the race, which once had a progressive lane (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, perhaps others now departed), a moderate lane (Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Klobuchar) and an outsider lane (Mr. Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang).
But now it is possible to see the Democratic race differently, and to discern a new architecture to the contest.
With the pairing of Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar, the race now has a female lane, pitting the two endorsed candidates against each other, and a blue-collar-appeal lane, pitting Mr. Sanders, who speaks of workers' rights and excoriates the wealthy, against Mr. Biden, who also has appeal for working folks. Why else would a fight break out between the two men over Social Security, a vital retirement income supplement for working Americans?
Now add another new development.
A study conducted by the Yale and George Mason centers on climate change communication separates Americans into categories depending on their views on climate change. For the first time, the segment "alarmed" about climate change has reached 31%, nearly triple its size five years ago, while those who were dismissive or doubtful of the effect of climate change have decreased.
Does that mean anything politically? Almost certainly it does, in the long run. In the short run, it may be a boost to Mr. Steyer, who relentlessly has trumpeted the cause of climate change. Iowa is for upsets. That would be the biggest one of all time. It's unlikely, almost out of the question. But a month ago, most of this column would have been considered just that way.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House legal team opened arguments on Saturday in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial by saying Mr. Trump did "nothing wrong" and that House Democrats had "hid evidence" in the last three days that would have proved the president's innocence.
"They have the burden of proof, and they have not come close to meeting it," said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone at the start of a two-hour session on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
He portrayed the Democrats' efforts to remove Mr. Trump from office less than a year before Americans go to the polls as "the most massive interference in an election in American history."
Mr. Trump's defense lawyers attempted to undercut arguments presented by a team of six House Democrats for nearly 24 hours over the last three days.
Democrats have asserted that Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine and by withholding a coveted White House meeting in an attempt to pressure the American ally to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden is running for the Democratic nomination in this year's presidential election.
After a 12-week impeachment inquiry last fall, the House of Representatives voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
But Mr. Cipollone said on Saturday that conclusion was wrong, calling attention to parts of the summary of Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The summary, which the White House released last September, includes talks between the two leaders about broad anti-corruption efforts, and U.S. efforts to push Europe to do more to help Ukraine.
"Yes, you are absolutely right," Mr. Zelenskiy told Mr. Trump, according to the White House summary of the call, read aloud by Mr. Cipollone. "Not only 100 percent, but actually 1,000 percent."
Mr. Zelenskiy went on to tell Mr. Trump he had recently told German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron "they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing" and that "I'm very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine."
The White House strategy attempted to rebut claim House Democrats' claim that Mr. Trump cared only about his re-election prospects and that the president diverged from established U.S. foreign policy in temporarily freezing the aid to Ukraine.
Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, pointed to several other instances in 2018 and 2019 that the Trump administration had decided to temporarily freeze or renegotiate military aid to other countries.
Aid was held in those cases, Mr. Sekulow said, due to concerns that those countries were not sharing enough of the burden in fighting corruption, terrorism or other problems identified by U.S. officials.
Aid was withheld to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, El Salvador and South Korea, he said. Such decisions were routine practice, he said, pointing to sworn testimony by Fiona Hill, a Russia expert formerly at the National Security Council, and other witnesses called by House Democrats to testify in the impeachment inquiry.
Therefore, Mr. Trump acted within his right to question the nearly $400 million in military aid due to Ukraine, he said.
"To say the president of the United States was not concerned about burden-sharing, that he was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine ... the facts establish exactly the opposite," Mr. Sekulow said.
White House lawyers also claimed Ukrainian officials could have felt no pressure because they were unaware of the hold on U.S. aid at the time of Mr. Zelenskiy's July 25 phone call with Mr. Trump.
The aid to Ukraine was ultimately released, and Mr. Zelenskiy got his meeting with Mr. Trump at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in Poland on Sept. 25. The importance to Mr. Zelenskiy of having that meeting in the Oval Office specifically was overblown by Democrats, Mr. Sekulow said.
The lawyers said Mr. Zelenskiy publicly described the July 25 phone conversation - while sitting beside Mr. Trump at the U.N. meeting - as a "good phone call" and "normal" and insisted that "nobody pushed him."
The Democrats "think you can read minds," Mr. Sekulow said. "I think you look at the words."
That argument resonated with some Senate Republicans.
"Now you know the rest of the story," Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told reporters after the session concluded. The defense team exposed, Mr. Lankford said, the Democrats' case relied on "innuendo" and "secret motivations and presumptions" instead of facts.
By presenting a different view of what witnesses said, the White House strategy could complicate a looming fight over whether the Senate should vote to call witnesses or issue subpoenas for documents.
Senate Democrats have been demanding four key witnesses testify as part of the trial, a move Senate Republicans have resisted. On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled chamber voted down a slew of Democratic attempts, by repeated 53-47 party-line votes, to obtain more information.
The Senate will revisit the question as soon as Thursday.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters he thought "the case for witnesses and documents has gotten even stronger" with the White House defense. The lawyers' insistence that Mr. Trump should have been able to cross-examine witnesses lends weight to the Democrats' push to call them, he said.
Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the lawyers' focus on the July 25 phone call gives senators a limited view of Mr. Trump's scheme.
In particular, Mr. Casey said, he wants to see a cable written by Bill Taylor, former acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, expressing concerns to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the president's actions.
"A lot of the facts could be better considered if we had witnesses and documents," Mr. Casey said in an interview after the session. "You often see the corruption after you've seen the totality of the evidence."
Meanwhile, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has questioned the need for witnesses. Mr. Toomey said on Saturday he would support a witness if they could resolve a disputed key fact - "the resolution of which would change my mind on my final conclusion."
So far, he said, nothing in the case would benefit from witnesses. The White House team merely provided "more complete testimony," rather than leaving key facts open to dispute, he explained.
"The Democrats left out all the elements that contradicts their narrative," Mr. Toomey said. "It's clear the impeachment managers intended to mislead with the witness testimony."
One point of agreement between the two sides: the seriousness of the decision before the Senate.
Mr. Cipollone, facing all 100 senators who are confined to their desks, said the president's removal would result in unprecedented upheaval.
"They're asking you to tear up all of the ballots across the country," he said. "I don't think they spent one minute of their 24 hours talking to you about the consequences of that to our country."
The defense lawyers portrayed the House impeachment inquiry as a rushed, unfair process that denied the president due process rights.
"They had a timetable to meet, they wanted to have impeachment done by Christmas," said Patrick F. Philbin, deputy counsel to the president.
Mr. Philbin also attacked the credibility of the whistleblower and faulted Democrats for not launching an inquiry into that person's potential bias or political motive for filing the report.
He suggested Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. - who as chair of the House Intelligence Committee led the impeachment inquiry last fall - could have been colluding with that person.
Mr. Schiff "had a reason to not have that inquiry," Mr. Philbin said.
After the session, Mr. Schiff called that notion "nonsense." He said that he followed the law by referring the whistleblower to the intelligence community's inspector general.

DECOLONIZING HISTORY AT JUSTICE SUMMIT GATHERERS TALK ABOUT DISCRIMINATION, ALGORITHMS

Texto completo: If decolonizing history sounds like a lot for one day, the Pittsburgh Racial Justice Summit was jam-packed with trying.
"Who gets to tell the story?" was a question repeated and reframed throughout the halls of the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary on Saturday during workshops on environmental justice, housing discrimination, art representation and even algorithms.
Carl Redwood Jr., a community organizer in the Hill District who grew up around the corner from the Highland Avenue venue, opened with an example from his youth.
Every day, he'd walk past a sign that declared the establishment of Highland Park to have been "settled in 1778."
The story that sign told was about Alexander Negley, a Swiss soldier and blacksmith who became the first white settler to make a home in this part of East Liberty - an area that is now, again, quickly gentrifying.
The indigenous people who were here before Negley and who were displaced from this river valley by similar settlements aren't considered in that sign, Mr. Redwood said.
"Who gets to tell the story? All of us get to tell the story," proclaimed Tarek Abuata, a Palestinian-born activist who moved to Houston when he was 6.
His history of the founding of the State of Israel was much different than the history that Rabbi Brant Rosen, of Chicago, learned from stories of his parents and grandparents.
Rabbi Rosen, sitting next to Mr. Abuata, talked about how that history changed over time, as he started to listen to the stories of individual Palestinians.
The Pittsburgh Racial Justice Summit, in its 22nd iteration this year, is put on by the Black and White Reunion, an organization founded in 1996, a year after the death of Jonny Gammage. Mr. Gammage, a black driver, died of asphyxiation in the custody of police in suburban Pittsburgh during a traffic stop.
This year, the gathering was dedicated to a mainstay of the Black and White Reunion, Ann Mason, who died in November.
"She was just a human being who bridged the gap between races," Tim Stevens, a co-founder of the summit and CEO of the Black Political Empowerment Project, said of his friend. "Today, you're here to emulate the work of Ann Mason."
The organizing committee initially intended to name the summit "1619 to 2020," a reference to the year when African people were brought to the United States as slaves and the subject of a massive New York Times project that frames all major aspects of modern American life as a linear result of 246 years of slavery.
In the end, the title was changed to 1492 to 2020, to take into account the indigenous people who were displaced and colonized with the arrival of Christopher Columbus in North America at the end of the 15th century.
It was a theme of the day to pan out further.
Alex Jackson, a student at Carnegie Mellon University, drew a line from history into the digital future in a workshop about the biases built into algorithms that govern increasingly more aspects of our lives.
"Data [is] most the valuable product we have right now," Ms. Jackson said.
When data reflects the results of institutions that were built on racism and inequality, using biased data to make predictions will lead to biased predictions, she said.
Ms. Jackson spoke about predictive algorithms used by police departments and judges to inform which neighborhoods get more enforcement or which individuals in the criminal justice system are likely to offend again.
"You're basing these algorithms on historical trends," she said, which perpetuates a loop. Except "now you have it with this 'objectivity' - a computer is telling me I should be going out and policing these neighborhoods."
Algorithms that assume the less an insurance company has paid out, the healthier the insured must be are being used to make decisions about interventions and treatment - and that ends up being biased against minority populations who have historically received worse health care and worse health insurance coverage, Ms. Jackson said.
"Discrimination from our past is now being encoded," she said.
The results of red-lining and credit discrimination are now encoded into algorithms that govern bank loans and interest rates.
"Those things have never been corrected in our society, and so they're going to show up in algorithms," Ms. Jackson cautioned.
Speakers drew attention to historical patterns but urged participants not to resign to them. Mr. Stevens has asked for a list of action steps from each workshop that he hopes to post on the Black and White Reunion website in the near future.

ORNATE CHAMBER BECOMES JURY BOX

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Americans watching broadcasts of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial last week were treated to a steady diet of individual speakers, with government-operated cameras trained at one of three podiums. Occasionally, during a break in the action, they could see a distant shot of the gilded chamber.
The Senate Press Gallery has a far more expansive view. Perched above the front of chamber, the gallery faces all 100 senators such that reporters can observe their real-time reactions: their attentive postures, fidgets, note-taking, heavy sighs, teeth-picking, leg-stretching, head-shaking, occasional yawning and, perhaps, some nodding off.
Though it betrayed little emotion to journalists attempting to glean any insight into their thinking, the gallery offered the most immediate reading of the country's most powerful jury box - of jurors tasked with deciding whether to remove the president from office.
The historic trial, which began in earnest last Tuesday and will span six days a week until a verdict, created an extraordinary scene that most of the country won't ever see. With the access came unprecedented restrictions on reporting imposed by Senate leadership.
Thanks to the famously stubborn and arcane rules of the U.S. Senate, all electronic devices, including phones or recorders, are banned inside the chamber. No exceptions were allowed for journalists, over objections from the committee that oversees regulations in the press gallery.
The Senate also limited the movement of journalists to "pens" - a few tight spaces partitioned by ropes - when senators took short breaks. The rule effectively prevented reporters from asking questions of any senator who did not decide to walk over and share thoughts. (And there were not many who did so.)
Senate officials said the rules were necessary to ensure the safety of public officials, but reporters pointed out the rules exceeded those imposed during the president's annual State Of The Union speech in the House of Representatives.
The restrictions "fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill," read a statement from the Standing Committee of Correspondents, the group of reporters that self-police the press gallery.
The Regional Reporters Association, which represents Washington correspondents working for regional news organizations, including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said the rules "serve no purpose but to hinder the public from learning about their public officials and journalists from doing their job to provide that information."
Therefore, the chamber took on the center of the action. Most of the time, the grand room held a sober mood, with stony-faced senators confined to their wooden desks as if at a college lecture. The Senate sergeant-in-arms began each day with a warning - largely symbolic - that senators were required to be silent "under pain of imprisonment."
No coffee was permitted, only glasses of still or sparking water and - thanks to another obscure Senate precedent - milk. (No milk was spotted last week.)
Some senators wrote notes to each other to communicate without speaking. Many senators occasionally stood up stiffly to stretch their legs and to use the bathroom.
The long sessions and short breaks leave little time for senators to interact with their staff, let alone confer with each other, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., told reporters last Thursday.
"When we're in that chamber, everyone is for the most part, with the exception of rare interactions, people are quiet and listening," Mr. Casey said. "I think it our obligation to sit and listen every minute."
Throughout the day, reporters rushed from the gallery seating, where they took notes on U.S. Senate stationery, back to the gallery's crowded workspace to continually update stories online. While many reporters have assigned desks, some crammed themselves onto communal sofas and into phone booths - a relic that gallery reporters use for privacy.
Trash cans overflowed with coffee cups and scraps from the Senate Carry-Out in the basement.
A sampling of the Senate floor's so-called "candy desk," currently manned by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., were brought to the gallery at the start of the trial. Provisions brought by Mr. Toomey's staff included Hershey's bars, Rolo caramels, Milky Ways and 3 Musketeers bars.
In a television interview last Thursday, Mr. Toomey explained he chose to sit at the "candy desk," which is closest to the doors used by most senators to enter the floor.
"Pennsylvania is the confectionary capital of America," Mr. Toomey explained in a television interview last week.
"We've kept it very well stocked," he said. "It is a popular stopping-off place. It's of course available to all senators, irrespective of party."
The debates carried on well into the evening, as North Capitol Street clogged with traffic below the gallery's windows. Outside the Capitol, a fleet of black SUVs idled in the cold, waiting to whisk away the senators.
At its core, the impeachment proceeding was like any other trial: long hours demanding focus, a blend of memorable lines, key testimony and evidence, perhaps an interruption every now and then.
On Wednesday, an anti-abortion protester, well-known on Capitol Hill, the proceedings from the public gallery on Wednesday, shouting that Sen. Chuck "Schumer is the devil!" as he was escorted out by police.
The twists and turns of the trial will continue this week. And reporters will continue to be there to bring it to the American public.

Texto completo: My grandmother would have hated Vessel & Vine.
Always a routine eater with a particular penchant for boiled meats and canned vegetables, Grandma Ross probably wouldn't have had any idea what to make of chef/owner/proprietor Nikaline Iacono's short, spice-propelled menu of organic proteins, foraged ingredients and local produce.
Take her terrific sweet potato "hummus" ($7) - a dense, sesame-sprinkled spread that she whizzes up with tahini, lemon juice and freckles of sumac she finds growing wild not far from the restaurant's downtown Brunswick location. Scooped into an amber, Depression-glass dish and plated with cracker-thin slices of Standard Baking sourdough, the unconventional riff on the classic chickpea puree unspools threads of tartness in each bite.
Or the delightful Lacinato kale salad ($11), a teetering tower of nubbly greens and ribbons of maroon carrots from nearby Six River Farm. Glistening with maple-chile vinaigrette, the structure threatens to collapse at the first touch of your fork, sending quartered, maple-soy-pickled eggs tumbling down onto the plate.
My grandmother would have dismissed it all as "Wizard of Oz food," her favorite way to reject anything edible that was beyond her ken. And she would have been partly right - the streamlined menu at The Vine can feel a little fantastical, with dishes and cocktails that seem like they must have come to Iacono in a dream.
Under many (perhaps most) chefs, this eccentricity might spin out of control, but Iacono understands her flavors. Perhaps more importantly, she harnesses that same dangerously wobbly gyroscope that powers the food and beverage menus and unleashes it to animate the other facets of her business: a (mostly natural) wine shop, cocktail-making and cooking classes, vintage clothing and quirky barware.
"I see lots of places that are very linear, very focused. That's just not my personality. I have lots of interests and things I want to pursue. It's just my world in here," she said. "I don't really think of it as a restaurant. I want it to be a bar that has retail and really good food that you can piece together a meal at. People always want you to have more entrees, but I can't do that with my kitchen."
That's no mere excuse. Step around the mirrored, feather-garlanded bar and you'll discover that The Vine's back-of-house is more dormitory than diner, with equipment that totals two pressure cookers, an induction burner, a miniature crockpot and a toaster oven. No flat-top, no flame, no fryer.
These are constraints that would make the most resourceful chef blanch. But somehow, Iacono makes it all work seamlessly. She even bakes in her toaster oven, plating up squares of Southern-style (read: not very sweet) cornbread alongside a New Year's special to fill the "Comfort" slot on her menu: pressure-cooked pork with brothy black-eyed peas; delicate, smoky braised mustard greens and spinach leaves ($14). Nothing about this dish tips you off to the limitations of its creation.
"I find the idea of having all the ingredients and resources in the world to be overwhelming," she said. "The way I like to create my food and drink is to have restrictions and parameters."
So much so that she finds ways to introduce them into her beverage menu, where a do-it-yourself cocktail called "The Golden Ratio" ($12) challenges imbibers to mix and match components to create 256 drink possibilities from a preselected group of 12 base spirits, vermouths/aromatized wines and amari (herbal liqueurs that Iacono is so fond of, she offers an entire course about how to deploy them in cocktails).
Slyly, The Golden Ratio also teaches customers about equilibrating sweetness with bitterness and alcohol, using the 1:1:1 ratio of the Negroni as a starting point. "It's about understanding the classic principles, so that once you understand those rules, you'll know how to break them," Iacono said. "I want people to go home and play."
At times, The Vine's limitations ensnare the skeleton crew behind the scenes. On one recent visit, when there were just two staffers working (Iacono and a bartender), service lagged, leaving my two-top and the tables around me with empty water and wine glasses for long stretches.
I also wonder if the crush of 10-or-so new customers who suddenly overwhelmed the 30-something-seat dining room wasn't partly responsible for a carelessly overgenerous dose of salty black bean sauce on the mineral, toaster-oven-baked oysters (three for $12).
Impressively, it was the evening's only significant culinary misstep in a meal that yielded an unbelievably tender turmeric-spiced bread pudding, bathed in a pumpkin custard and topped with whipped cream goosed with a slug of Zirbenz Stone Pine liqueur ($8), as well as crisp, gremolata-topped "Fancy Toast" slathered with anchovy butter and sprinkled with teensy matchsticks of crunchy, winter-bitter Chioggia beet ($7).
My recent visit to The Vine also introduced me to one of my all-time favorite versions of dolma (rolled, ground-beef-stuffed cabbage leaves). Baked in a runny, aromatic sauce of sundried tomato and garlic, The Vine's dolma ($8) are spiced with Iacono's unique take on ras el hanout. Her reimagining of the Middle Eastern spice blend embroiders warming clove and paprika onto a scrim of rose petal, an inversion of the expected ras el hanout ratios, but one that seems to jolt the dish awake from a winter hibernation.
Grandma, if you're reading from above, I have a confession. I love The Vine for all the reasons that you probably would have despised it. But knowing how much you secretly enjoyed a seasonal tipple (and Depression glass), I'll toast to your memory with a cup of Iacono's The Fanciest Egg Nog Ever ($11), a custardy, saffron-scented cocktail made with natural rum, Fernet Gancia, spruce syrup and sweet sherry - the sort of Wizard of Oz concoction that even you would have begrudgingly adored.

Texto completo: In November 2017, three women told The New York Times that Louis C.K. had masturbated in front of them without their meaningful consent. Another woman told the newspaper C.K. had harassed her with a grotesque request to do the same. Rumors of his sexual misconduct with female performers and associates had dogged the comedian for years. The day after the Times report was published, he finally admitted, “These stories are true."
“I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want," he wrote at the end of his public statement. “I will now step back and take a long time to listen." He expressed his remorse and regret. He did not apologize.
Nine months later, C.K. was apparently done listening. He made a surprise appearance at the Comedy Cellar in New York in August 2018, and returned to the popular club for several sets thereafter. In a performance attended by a Times reporter, he even cracked a few jokes about his “weird year" after getting “in trouble." He lamented that the fallout from his misdeeds cost him $35 million in a single hour.
Now C.K. is back on the stand-up circuit. He kicked off his tour in Richmond, Virginia, in November and will perform on April 4 in Boston, where he launched his once-ascendant comedy career. To his ardent supporters, C.K. is due for a comeback. As Hannah Giorgis pointed out in The Atlantic , his friends and fans have invoked the language of criminal justice in their defense of C.K.'s return to the stage. C.K. “served his time," the argument goes. For how much longer should he be punished?
But time alone does not absolve an abuser of his misbehavior. Second chances are earned, not owed. In his time out of the spotlight, C.K. pledged he would listen. Who did he listen to and what did he hear? What, if anything, did he learn?
If the reviews of his new stand-up routine are an indication, it would seem C.K. spent his self-imposed exile stewing in self-pity. “If he's looking for redemption, he's doing so privately," Los Angeles Times columnist Glenn Whipp, who saw C.K. shows in Richmond, and in Raleigh, North Carolina, generously surmised. Any mention of his sexual misconduct scandal is limited to jokes about his “pariah status," according to Whipp. “I had to go to Poland to do shows," C.K. moaned.
C.K. certainly paid a heavy price for his actions. In the aftermath of the Times expose, his management and publicist dumped him; FX, HBO, and Netflix cut ties with him; and the release of his new movie was canceled by its distributor.
But what about the ramifications suffered by the women C.K. betrayed? What price did they pay for his decision to exploit his power over them — and their choice to speak out?
In the years since C.K. stripped off his clothes and masturbated in front of comedians Dana Min Goodman and Julia Wolov in his hotel room at the 2002 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, Goodman and Wolov “took themselves out of the running for the many projects" C.K.'s powerful manager, Dave Becky, was involved in, according to the Times, because by speaking openly to others about the incident, they heard they had run afoul of him. (Becky said he “never threatened anyone.") In an op-ed published in November by The Canadian Jewish News , Wolov wrote about the women “getting consistent hate mail from Louis C.K. supporters who tell them to kill themselves."
Comedian Rebecca Corry, who spoke to the Times about her encounter with C.K. on the set of a 2005 television pilot, wrote in an essay for New York Magazine' s Vulture that she has “received death threats, been berated, judged, ridiculed, dismissed, shamed, and attacked" since coming forward.
“Speaking out feels like standing in front of the world naked under fluorescent lights on a really bad day," Corry says in her essay. “I knew making myself so vulnerable would bring scrutiny from the outside, but my personal life has also been damaged by my decision to tell the truth."
The genius of C.K.'s comedy was his bracing and transgressive honesty — about his failings as a father and husband, for example, or his interminable self-loathing. His best work was rooted in empathy for others and for himself. What he has apparently failed to do since his abuses were made public is truly reckon with the harm he has caused. As many critics have acknowledged, C.K.'s failure to fully wrestle with his wrongdoing on stage in this post #MeToo era is a missed opportunity for a comic of his talent and stature. His self-centered riffs on his own fall from grace display a stunning lack of empathy for the women he hurt.
Louis C.K. is free to make a living however he chooses — with or without redemption. We are free not to laugh along.

SCHIFF'S FOLLY THE SWAMP IS POISED TO RENEW THE NATION'S IRE

Texto completo: As the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump opened in the U.S. Senate, Adam Schiff, visiting from the House of Representatives, implored the senators to honor the legacy of our wise, if flawed Founding Fathers.
He explained the gravity of impeachment and praised the founders for "insulat[ing] it, as best they could, from the crush of partisan politics."
He urged the Senate to provide a "fair trial" and to fulfill their duty "to the Constitution and to the rule of law."
Under all the lofty phrases and grave tone, what Mr. Schiff and his fellow Democrats seem to have forgotten is this: the fallout from the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
They've forgotten that if Americans smell a setup, if they see a cannon being rolled out when a rap on the knuckles would do, their sympathies shift to the accused.
The same national character that shaped our response to the Clinton impeachment will shape how we view this trial and its major players, including Mr. Schiff. Our shared character will also determine how we answer questions raised, perhaps accidentally, by his opening remarks:
Has the impeachment process actually been insulated from partisan politics, as he says the founders hoped? If not, who breached it?
What would a fair trial look like?
What outcome will do more to shore up confidence in our great republic?
Who has made the greater assault on our Constitution and the rule of law - Mr. Trump or his accusers?
Answers to some of these questions strike me as a draw. Each side has accused the other of putting a ridiculous spin on shifting "facts," hiding evidence and witnesses, unnecessarily redacting transcripts and so on.
A fair trial will require both sides to honor the same rules, to produce witnesses, to draw back the self-serving veil of secrecy, to allow the accused to face his accuser.
But as to whether the impeachment process has been insulated from partisan politics, the answer is a resounding no, and the responsibility for that breach lies with the Democrats - with Mr. Schiff himself.
Way back in October, even The Washington Post had to address Mr. Schiff's public lies about his committee not having had prior contact with the whistleblower, about not knowing who he was and more.
On Wednesday, even as Mr. Schiff opened the Senate trial, Paul Sperry's detailed report for RealClearInvestigations.com demonstrated anew, in appalling detail, how deeply entwined the whistleblower was with Mr. Schiff and his committee and how the "take-down" engine was already revving in 2017.
This reeks of bad faith, even to those of us who did not vote for Mr. Trump. And unless our partisanship is overwhelming, we Americans tend to judge people's actions instinctively and pretty fairly. We think the punishment should fit the crime, and we usually hold the person with more knowledge to a higher level of responsibility.
That's why public sentiment turned in favor of Mr. Clinton. He lied under oath, yes, but he was lying about having cheated on his wife and did so in response to questions that many people felt shouldn't have been asked in the first place.
Mr. Clinton won only 43% of the popular vote in 1992 and 49% in '96. Between those races, his party lost Congress to the "Republican Revolution." But after impeachment, his popularity soared and he left office in 2000 with Gallup approval ratings of 65%.
Similarly, only 46% voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but in 2018 voters gave only the House back to the Democrats. Now the 2020 elections loom.
Mr. Schiff knows the law, the rules of Congress and probably the protocols of the presidency far better than Mr. Trump does. The president's supporters knew this when they voted for him; in fact, this is precisely why he won their support - because he wasn't part of the self-dealing D.C. swamp whose denizens practice to-the-death politics.
If Mr. Trump's voters still feel that way, and if independents and centrists feel he's been railroaded, the Democrats have already lost.

WHEN THE OTHER AMERICA LIVES NEXT DOOR AN EMPATHETIC LOOK AT THE AMERICANS LEFT BEHIND

Texto completo: Fourteen pages into "Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope," we meet Molly, a middle-aged woman who lives in a recreational vehicle in rural Oregon. She dropped out of school in the eighth grade and gave birth to a daughter at age 15. Molly never talked much about who the father was, inciting public scorn that she was "loose'' and "careless.'' Years later, Molly told her mother that her pregnancy was the result of a rape by her father. Her mother wasn't exactly surprised. "Your dad raped me, too, and that's how you got here,'' she replied.
With great compassion and perception, Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, the authors of "Tightrope," introduce us to dozens of Americans like Molly teetering on the financial precipice. Mr. Kristoff and Ms. WuDunn, who are married, shared the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for their coverage of China for The New York Times. They have co-authored four books including "Half the Sky,'' a chilling examination of the oppression of women and girls in Third World nations.
After years of using his Times op-ed column to highlight human-rights abuses and social injustices around the world, Mr. Kristof has turned his attention to the millions of Americans living in Third World conditions. The authors tell us that, despite a roaring stock market and historically low unemployment, many Americans are ailing:
* 2.1 million Americans addicted to opioids;
* 500,000 homeless;
* Half of U.S. jobs pay less than $15 an hour;
* Life expectancy in the United States ranks behind Chile (if Mississippi were a nation, it would rank second to last, tied with Mexico);
* The United States accounts for 25 percent of all the incarcerated people in the world.
"Tightrope'' looks at how we got here, and it offers suggestions for closing the misery gap.
Although the authors claim to have visited all 50 states, the most intimate stories are centered on Mr. Kristof's hometown, Yamhill, Ore., a farming hamlet (pop. 1,024) southwest of Portland. Mr. Kristof, 60, says that one-fourth of the kids who rode on his high school bus are dead from drugs, suicide, alcohol, obesity, reckless accidents and other pathologies. Many of those still living are struggling with dead-end jobs and drug and alcohol addictions.
Mr. Kristof is a self-described "progressive,'' but he doesn't sugarcoat his classmates' mistakes. He acknowledges that many of them shirked their personal responsibilities and were at least partly to blame for their miseries. Nevertheless, he argues, none of them suffered from any afflictions or setbacks that could not have been overcome with a helping hand. He fulminates against a society and government that undermined unions, slashed education funding and eliminated social programs - and then criminalized the ills they created through draconian prosecutions and sentencings.
The authors contrast Geneva Cooley, a 71-year-old African American woman who was sentenced to life in an Alabama prison for drug possession, with the Sackler family, which pocketed $13 billion through Purdue Pharma's legal slinging of OxyContin. It recalls the Bob Dylan line, "Steal a little and they throw you in jail, steal a lot and they make you king.''
Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn mock conservatives such as former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan for saying that the poor should pull themselves up by their bootstraps. "To think that an obese, ninth-grade dropout with an outdated, blue-collar skill set could lift himself up by his bootstraps is magical thinking,'' they retort. The authors trace the roots of our affliction to the early 1970s and the rise of conservatism. They note that median wages for a majority of those without a college degree are lower today than in 1979, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; that if the minimum wage had kept pace from 1968 to today, it would be $22 an hour; and that the average hourly wage of $22.65 in 2018 was lower than the $23.68 in 1973 (adjusted for inflation).
Mr. Kristof and Ms. WuDunn write that the federal government could ameliorate the suffering through high-quality early childhood programs, universal health coverage, "baby bonds'' to help build savings, and a right to work. Anticipating conservative pushback, they claim that their proposals could all be paid for simply by returning to 1990s-level tax rates. "The United States has chosen policies over the last half century that have resulted in higher levels of homelessness, overdose deaths, crime and inequality - and now it's time to make a different choice,'' the authors conclude. Readers mourning the absence of empathy in the public square should grab a copy of "Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope.''

Texto completo: JOHNNY GANDELSMAN
Presented by the MIT Center for Art, Science & Technology. At Kresge Auditorium, MIT. Feb. 8, 7 p.m. www.eventbrite.com
January 2015. The violinist Johnny Gandelsman — Moscow-born, New York-based, and a member of such restlessly curious groups as the Silk Road Ensemble and the string quartet Brooklyn Rider — is on the small stage of MIT's Killian Hall. He has just finished playing Bach's complete sonatas and partitas, the summit of the solo violin repertoire, to an enthusiastic audience that fills the room. The ovation is well earned, as Gandelsman's performance is notable for the supple touch he brings to music that violinists often swath in layers of profundity. Even in the epic chaconne movement of the D-minor partita he emphasizes the music's dance roots.
Among the most enthused audience members is Gandelsman's Silk Road bandmate, Yo-Yo Ma. Ma is, in fact, loudly clamoring for an encore. With a sly smile, the violinist obliges by playing the first bar of Bach's Third Cello Suite. Lasting just a few seconds, it is both a subtle inside joke between friends and a perfect capstone to the evening.
But there's another, slightly fanciful, way to see that brief encore: as the origin of Gandelsman's latest project: all six of the Bach cello suites, transcribed for violin. His recording of this slice of the Bach solo string repertoire is slated for release on his own label (In a Circle Records) on Feb. 7; the next evening, he returns to MIT to perform all the suites, this time in the larger Kresge Auditorium. Might that brief encore half a decade ago — a salute to a cellist whose name has become almost synonymous with the Bach suites — have been the catalyst for this new undertaking?
Alas, the truth rarely fits into our stories as we might wish it would. In a recent e-mail exchange, Gandelsman explained that the MIT concert came at the beginning of his experience performing the sonatas and partitas, some time before he began thinking about the cello suites. It was only after performing them about 30 times, he wrote, that he realized that “I wasn't quite ready to stop working on Bach's music."
Fair enough. But why, you might ask, did Gandelsman feel compelled to make the suites, which have never lacked performance opportunities by cellists themselves for the past several decades, part of his repertoire?
It was actually a different cellist, Anner Bylsma, who provided the inspiration. Bylsma, a titan in the period instrument world who died last year at 85, and his wife, violinist Vera Beths, hosted Gandelsman at their home in Amsterdam a few times. This was a pilgrimage many musicians have made — to play for the master cellist and immerse themselves in Bach's world.
“I loved every moment spent in that house," Gandelsman wrote. “Anner's continuous and evolving learning of those pieces was infectious." During one visit, he noticed that one of Bylsma's books on the suites contained a transcription for violin. “It's possible that he intended it to be for practice purposes only, but after a while I thought, why not?"
Listening to Gandelsman's forthcoming recording, one recognizes up front the grace and agility that informed his interpretation of the sonatas and partitas. His account of the suites seems, if anything, even lighter and more dance-worthy. In part that's because of the violin's lighter timbre and his use of a lighter bow and gut strings for three of the violin's four strings. (For the sixth suite, which Bach is believed to have written for a five-string instrument, Gandelsman uses a five-string violin he found at an instrument shop in Queens.) But there's a new ingredient as well: his playing of the suites has an almost improvisatory sense of freedom, and some of the movements sound distinctly like folk music.
This was no accident. In fact, Gandelsman mentioned that over the last few years he's seen more and more commonalities between Baroque and folk musics. For the suites, he tried to learn the music by ear rather than by studying the score, the opposite of how he approached the sonatas and partitas. Doing so, he came to see in the suites “the implication for infinite possibilities, the way an incredible improviser can find endless variation within the simplest form."
One of his favorite improvisers is the Irish fiddler Martin Hayes, with whom Brooklyn Rider recently recorded an album. At one point in the e-mail exchange, Gandelsman described the suites as a place where all these currents of influence came together in a vision of music that balanced tradition, freedom, and the wonder of discovery.
“Like Bach, Martin is an incredible improviser, creating endless variation in expression," he wrote. “Similar to Anner's process, Martin's playing has the humble joy of a scientist's pursuit, finding out what else might be in there, what layers might still be hiding. Improvisation is not something I'm very comfortable with, but my goal is to get to a place where I can feel like what's happening in terms of bowings and phrasing is created on the spot."

Texto completo: Since 2014, clothing brand Aerie has featured real women in unretouched photos as part of its body positivity-focused #AerieREAL campaign. Beginning in 2016, several celebrities and influencers — including Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast and Needham native Aly Raisman — have signed on as #AerieREAL Role Models to “spread the brand's mission to love your real self — inside and out," according to the brand.
On Thursday, eight more Role Models joined the fold, among them Newton's Hari Nef , who's an actress, activist, and, per The New York Times, the first transgender model to be represented worldwide by IMG.
All of the 2020 Role Models — which also include actresses Lana Condor (“To All the Boys I've Loved Before") and Beanie Feldstein (“Booksmart") — chose a quick statement to explain what they hope to convey through their work on the campaign; Nef “encourages others to question and oppose the status quo — with empathy!"
The “Transparent" actress — who said she swaps stories with Raisman about growing up in Boston suburbs — told the Globe she wishes something like the #AerieREAL campaign had existed when she was a Boston-area teenager.
“When I was in high school at Newton South High School, I used to walk around with printouts of those skinny runway models in my folder because I wanted to look like them," said Nef, 27. “And somehow I kind of evolved into a version of one of them, but it was by sheer force of will. And I was never that tall, and I was never that thin. But I was welcomed in this industry that, at just the moment that I was ready, coincidentally and thank God, they were willing and ready to welcome something different. And I feel lucky to have been that thing, but I still feel like there's a long way to go in this industry of looking, I think, just beyond the surface, beyond the kind of boxes one ticks, whether that box aligns with the historic norm or opposing the status quo — that's become a box unto itself."
Nef said she feels “great" about Aerie's lack of retouching, but that wasn't always the case. Previously as a model, she was grateful for fashion industry retouchers.
“They would give me new faces, new bodies, and I would thank them for it, because I felt like they were doing me a favor," she said. “And at the time, that was how I was thinking about myself. I don't feel that way anymore. And I'm excited to be a part of this imagery that's going to be widely circulated that — I've got my hair in, and I've got my makeup on, and I know I look good, but not a single thing on my body has been touched by a blur tool, or, nothing's been nipped, nothing's been tucked. It's just me."
Nef has a bunch of work on her 2020 docket, including a “fun, little, weird, delicious television project dropping at some point this year as part of an anthology," as well as some screenwriting projects she's “been working [on] rather sneakily and under the radar for the past couple of years." She said she'll also be rolling out more events and collaborations with Aerie in the coming months.
Rounding out the 2020 class of Role Models are sustainability activist Manuela Barón , scientist and entrepreneur Keiana Cavé , DJ and wellness advocate Tiff McFierce , Tony Award-winning performer Ali Stroker , Smile On Me founder Dre Thomas , and previous Role Models Raisman, YouTuber and motivational speaker Molly Burke , Paralympic gold medal-winning snowboarder Brenna Huckaby , podcast host Jenna Kutcher , and body-positive model and activist Iskra Lawrence .

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar hit the 2020 campaign trail on Saturday during a break in the impeachment trial.
MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar dashed back to Iowa for a frenzied burst of campaigning on Saturday after a week in which they were confined to Washington for the impeachment trial of President Trump.
Their appearances took place amid signs of growing strength in Mr. Sanders's candidacy, particularly a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Saturday that showed him leading the field in Iowa. Given the fears of some Democrats that he could be portrayed as too far to the left to defeat Mr. Trump, his show of strength is likely to alarm some of his detractors as much as it pleases his own supporters coming so close to the Feb. 3 caucuses.
Pete Buttigieg's campaign sent a fund-raising email on Saturday warning that "Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party," followed by another email that cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's ability to beat Mr. Trump. And former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a tweet took an implicit jab at Mr. Sanders over his campaign's promotion of an endorsement from Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who has been criticized for comments he has made on race and about transgender people.
Mr. Sanders, sounding a bit congested, made it to Iowa in time to attend a rally in Marshalltown with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the filmmaker Michael Moore.
He made no mention of his poll showing, but he didn't have to.
"We're taking on the establishment, and the establishment is getting a little bit nervous," he told a modest but enthusiastic crowd.
But he did take a swipe at the impeachment trial for scrambling his campaign plans.
"As you well know, we have had to radically change our schedule in the last week -- kind of toss it into the garbage can and begin anew," he said. "But we are going to be back here in Iowa in the next week every moment that we possibly can."
Mr. Sanders plans to hold events across the northwestern part of Iowa on Sunday before the trial resumes on Monday.
Before he settled into his familiar talking points, Mr. Sanders also issued something of a warning, suggesting he was aware of the renewed attacks from rivals as he continued to display strength in Iowa and other early voting states.
"In the last week of a campaign, a lot of stuff is going to be thrown around -- that's what happens in campaigns," he said. "But I would hope that this state, New Hampshire and the country does not lose focus on what are the most important issues."
The day also brought good news for Ms. Warren, who returned to Iowa for the first time since the impeachment trial with a town-hall-style event at a middle school in Muscatine. "Good not to be in Washington," she told reporters.
She was working her way through her selfie picture line when the news broke that she had received the coveted endorsement of The Des Moines Register. In other endorsements Saturday, The New Hampshire Union Leader backed Ms. Klobuchar, and The Sioux City Journal in Iowa gave its support to Mr. Biden.
Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has struggled to gain traction in the primary race and has also been tethered to Washington because of the impeachment trial, traveled to New Hampshire on Saturday and planned to campaign there through the weekend.
Two other leading contenders, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, were not stuck in Washington this past week. Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., arrived in Iowa for the beginning of a 10-day sprint across the state before the caucuses. His first stop was a town-hall-style event before about 300 people inside of an old opera house in Fort Dodge.
Mr. Buttigieg began his remarks by reminding the audience that, after 13 months of candidate events, they were in "the final days" of the race in which he has outlasted a handful of adversaries who began the race better-known and better financed than the mayor of South Bend.
After a town-hall-style event in Storm Lake, he was asked about his campaign's reference to Mr. Sanders in one of the fund-raising emails as "a risk we can't take."
"I believe that we should be very mindful that one of the worst risks we can take at a time like this is to recycle the same Washington-style political warfare that brought us to this point," he said. "If we believe it's important to win, then the best thing we can do is put forward a candidate who offers something new, something different and something that will break us through the dynamics that have gotten us into this era that's just got to change."
Mr. Biden flew to Iowa after beginning his day with an event in Salem, N.H. Speaking in an elementary school gym, Mr. Biden alluded to the impeachment trial that is playing out in Washington and reminded the crowd that he had come under relentless attack from Mr. Trump.
"My guess if you go back and turn your TV on today, you're going to find the name 'Biden' mentioned many, many, many times," Mr. Biden said. "I wonder why he doesn't want to run against me."
Mr. Biden also received a boost on Saturday when he picked up the endorsement of Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa, a freshman Democrat who unseated a Republican incumbent.
"He is who I believe is the one sure bet to beat Donald Trump," Ms. Axne said in an interview.
Ms. Axne hails from the kind of swing district that was key to the party's takeover of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and will be crucial to its continued control of the chamber.
Ms. Axne appeared with Mr. Biden on Saturday night at an event in her district in Ankeny, a suburb of Des Moines.
"It's not just that Joe's been there, and he's been in the Situation Room," she told the crowd in Ankeny. "We also need somebody who's running on a message of hope, a message of unification of this country."
Mr. Biden has now been endorsed by two of Iowa's three Democrats in Congress. Representative Abby Finkenauer, another freshman who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018, endorsed him in early January. The state's other House Democrat, Representative Dave Loebsack, has endorsed Mr. Buttigieg.
Ms. Axne's district includes Iowa's most populous city, Des Moines, and covers the southwestern corner of the state. President Barack Obama won the district in 2012, but Mr. Trump carried it in 2016. Two years later, in the midterm elections, Ms. Axne unseated a two-term Republican, David Young.
Ms. Axne said she believed that Mr. Biden would drive turnout in districts like hers, and emphasized the importance of protecting the Democratic majority in the House.
She also nodded to what she suggested was Mr. Biden's broad appeal. "I truly believe that there are Iowans that would have some difficulty with some of the positions by other people running in this party," she said.

Texto completo: Christine Haughney is, quite simply, one of the nation's most accomplished reporters on the safety and sustainability of the food we eat.
The former New York Times reporter conceived, developed, and produced the web series that became Netflix's “Rotten," about our badly flawed food supply system. One reviewer said the series “manages to use the immediacy of the dinner table as a way to reshape the conversation about what we put in our bodies."
So when Haughney applied to be a Spotlight Investigative Journalism Fellow, the judges took notice. Haughney, along with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mike Stanton, were named Spotlight Fellows for 2019-20 from a field of nearly 100 other investigative journalists from around the country.
Haughney's resulting investigation about the growing risk of E. coli poisoning from seemingly innocent leafy green vegetables is in keeping with the tradition of The Boston Globe Spotlight Team, whose work was portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film “Spotlight." She exposes a danger that many victims don't even know about until they get sick and reveals the federal government's unreadiness to protect us.
Participant, the producer of “Spotlight," funds the fellowship, which just began accepting applications for its fifth year. Participant CEO David Linde said Spotlight Fellows “are proven defenders of the First Amendment who hold institutions accountable for their actions and behaviors. Their contribution to protecting democracy and everyday Americans is more vital than ever today."

Texto completo: Iowa's most influential newspaper called Ms. Warren "the best leader for these times," making its selection just over a week before the state's caucuses.
DES MOINES -- The Des Moines Register endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic presidential nomination on Saturday night, calling her "the best leader for these times."
The newspaper, Iowa's largest and most influential, gave Ms. Warren a boost just over a week before the caucuses on Feb. 3, when Iowans will take part in the first nominating contest of the primary cycle.
In its editorial, the Register praised Ms. Warren as "a thinker, a policy wonk and a hard worker."
"Warren's competence, respect for others and status as the nation's first female president would be a fitting response to the ignorance, sexism and xenophobia of the Trump Oval Office," the editorial stated.
After more than a year of campaigning, the Democratic race is extraordinarily volatile in Iowa, as residents continue to fret over which candidate can beat President Trump.
In recent days, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has shown momentum in the state, and he led a poll of likely caucusgoers published Saturday by The New York Times and Siena College, which showed him earning 25 percent support and his three top rivals clustered behind him.
His rise in Iowa has come at the expense of Ms. Warren, his fellow progressive, who dropped to 15 percent in the survey, down from 22 percent in the last survey conducted by the organizations, in late October, when she led the field.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was at 18 percent in the poll, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was at 17 percent. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was the only other candidate approaching double digits, at 8 percent.
The Register's endorsement landed as Ms. Warren worked her way through her selfie line after a town-hall-style event in Muscatine, Iowa.
She did not find out until after she took the final picture, when her communications director, Kristen Orthman, pulled her aside to share the news.
Ms. Warren leapt back in excitement -- pulling her hands to her chest, as if to say, "what, me?" -- and then pumped both hands in the air and did a little dance. Ms. Orthman then appeared to show Ms. Warren the editorial on her phone.
Ms. Warren gulped down a sip of coconut water, one of her campaign trail staples, and headed over to a gathered group of reporters and microphones with a smile.
"I just heard and I'm delighted," Ms. Warren said of the endorsement. "It really means a lot to me. I'm very happy."
In a tweet thanking The Register for the endorsement, she wrote that "Iowans are ready to make big, structural change -- and I'm going to fight my heart out for everyone in Iowa and across the country."
In its editorial, the Register praised Ms. Warren's approach to the economy, health care, climate change and other issues.
"She says corporations should have less Washington influence, children should be protected from gun violence, child care should be affordable, immigrants deserve compassion, mass incarceration should end and the wealthy should pay more in taxes," the editorial stated. "Those ideas are not radical. They are right."
It also argued that any of the Democrats campaigning in Iowa would be "more inclusive and thoughtful than the current occupant of the White House."
In making its decision, The Register's editorial board interviewed nine current Democratic candidates who have spent considerable time campaigning in Iowa, several candidates who have since left the race, and two Republicans who are challenging Mr. Trump. The Register is not endorsing in the Republican race.
The newspaper made clear that the endorsement was the product of its editorial board, and that its news staff, including the editors and reporters who cover the presidential race, had no involvement in the process.
The Register's endorsements, which began in 1988, are not predictions and have had a mixed record of swaying the caucuses. In 2016, the paper backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican primary, and Hillary Clinton in the Democratic one, when she was in a tight race against Mr. Sanders.
Nevertheless, the endorsements make national news. The paper also sponsors a closely watched poll of Iowa caucusgoers -- the last of which is set to be released on Feb. 1, two days before the caucuses.
The Register, along with CNN, also sponsored a Democratic debate this month, the last before caucusing and voting begin in February.

Texto completo: Sure, you'll remember gloves and a helmet. But there's other important gear to bring along for a successful day on the slopes.
A day spent skiing or snowboarding consists of fast-moving hits of glorious exhilaration interspersed with glacial stretches spent waiting in line and riding lifts. Often the key to maximizing the fun and minimizing the cold and boredom is how well you prepare. Along with a neck gaiter, waterproof gloves and, of course, snacks -- one Wirecutter staffer stashes mini Snickers bars in all his pockets -- consider bringing along the following items to ensure your day is memorable in all the right ways.
No-Ad Sun Care Sport Body & Face Sunscreen Stick
This has the same active ingredients as one of Wirecutter's favorite sunscreens, but it's a solid stick -- way easier to reapply without taking your gloves off. ( $ 7 from Walmart)
Platypus SoftBottle
Flat and floppy, this plastic collapsible water bottle is especially good for sliding into a bib pocket. ( $ 9 from Amazon)
HotHands Hand Warmers
These disposable packets are inexpensive, small enough to fit into a glove and reach temperatures as hot as 112 degrees Fahrenheit. ( $ 25 from Amazon)
Outdoor Technology Chips 2.0 Bluetooth Helmet Speakers
Eve O'Neill, a snowboarder and senior staff writer on Wirecutter's outdoors team, swears by these: "They're 100 percent better than Airpods or headphones." ( $ 143 from REI)
Hangtime Koala Super-Grip Phone Harness

Texto completo: The authorities had threatened a yearslong prison sentence for Philip Jacobson, who was jailed for three days. He is likely to be deported soon, but his movements remain restricted.
JAKARTA, Indonesia -- An American environmental journalist accused of violating the terms of his visa has been freed after three days in jail and is likely to be deported soon, a top Indonesian government minister said.
The journalist, Philip Jacobson, 30, who works for the nonprofit news site Mongabay and is known for exposing environmental damage and corporate misconduct, was arrested on the island of Borneo after attending a public meeting between officials and indigenous leaders.
Immigration officials said he had been conducting journalistic activities while on a business visa, which was not permitted, and that he faced up to five years in prison.
The minister for political, legal, and security affairs, Mohammad Mahfud MD, met on Friday with the United States ambassador to Indonesia, Joseph R. Donovan, and told reporters afterward that the case would be handled as an administrative matter punishable by deportation, not as a crime.
The minister set no timetable for deporting Mr. Jacobson and indicated that the authorities were still investigating whether he had broken any laws. Since his release on Friday, Mr. Jacobson has been free to move around the city of Palangkaraya, where he was arrested, but not to travel outside the city.
"We will try to just deport him soon if he didn't commit any other crime," Mr. Mahfud said.
A State Department spokesman said the United States Embassy in Jakarta had been in frequent communication with Mr. Jacobson since he was first contacted by Indonesian immigration authorities and that it was following his case closely.
A story posted on Mongabay's website said that Mr. Jacobson had been moved from the jail, where he had shared a cell with five other prisoners, to "city detention."
"We are grateful that authorities have made this accommodation and remain hopeful that Phil's case can be treated as an administrative matter rather than a criminal one," said Mongabay's founder and chief executive, Rhett A. Butler.
Indonesia requires visiting foreign journalists to obtain a journalist visa, a cumbersome and lengthy process that allows the authorities to question an applicant's reporting plan, deny a visa without explanation or take no action at all.
Mr. Jacobson was initially detained on Dec. 17 and ordered to remain in Palangkaraya. On Tuesday, the immigration authorities arrested him and put him in jail, signaling that he could face criminal charges.
Mr. Jacobson's reports for Mongabay include an article about a paper company that he said had illicitly set up a shell company to secretly clear forest in Borneo, and another that analyzed the environmental record of Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo.
Arvin Gumilang, a spokesman for Indonesia's immigration department, said Mr. Jacobson had visited Indonesia several times on a business visa, and that he had been arrested after being reported to the authorities by an interviewee. He was not arrested because of any articles published by Mongabay, Mr. Gumilang added.
Rights activists said Mr. Jacobson's case was disturbing and highlighted the need for Indonesia to loosen restrictions on journalists.
"This arbitrary arrest is an unacceptable attack on freedom of the press in the country," said Amnesty International Indonesia's executive director, Usman Hamid.
"Respect for the right to freedom of expression is a pillar of any rights-respecting society, whether it is holding institutions to account or highlighting environmental concerns."

Texto completo: One hundred years ago, newspapers, radios and fishmongers ruled the oldest neighborhood in New York.
It's no secret that Lower Manhattan has completely remade itself. Again. Over the past decade or so, the global financial center, which used to become a ghost town on evenings and weekends after business hours, has developed into a 24/7 neighborhood teeming with hotels, restaurants and young parents pushing strollers.
A new book, "A Century Downtown," out Feb. 4, reminds us that the area has always been in flux.
The author, Matt Kapp, a film producer, found himself with a surplus of archival materials and a newfound curiosity about the city's oldest neighborhood after wrapping a documentary film on rebuilding the World Trade Center following Sept. 11. He decided to document the district's many phases over the last 100 years in a book filled with vintage photographs.
The result is a visual time capsule that starts around 1920. Many of the book's pictures feature iconic buildings that are still standing today, while other locations are virtually unrecognizable.
The Wall Street Bombing
23 Wall Street
Craters the size of golf balls pockmark the marble facade of the former J.P. Morgan & Company headquarters. They are scars from a midday explosion on Sept. 16, 1920 that killed 30 people instantly and injured many more.
It was, up until that point, the deadliest terrorist attack in American history.
The perpetrator drove a horse-drawn cart loaded with 100 pounds of dynamite and cast-iron sash-window weights, all hidden under a tarp, right up to the Wall Street side of the bank building, then disappeared into the crowd. He was never apprehended.
Some historians believe the culprit was the Italian anarchist Mario Buda, an associate of the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, who were arrested for murder earlier that year. Soon after the blast, Mr. Buda returned to Italy.
Radio Row
Cortlandt Street
Blan the Radio Man and Cantor the Cabinet King were among the more than 300 mom-and-pop shops selling radios and electronic parts on and around Cortlandt Street beginning in the 1920s.
In Mr. Kapp's telling, it was a raucous place, with loudspeakers above store entrances blaring Big Band tunes and proprietors prone to shouting at customers.
The construction of the Twin Towers did the district in, requiring the demolition of 13 blocks, over protests by shop owners.
Little Syria
103-109 Washington Street
What became known as Little Syria was home to immigrants from a vast swath of the Middle East known as greater Syria, consisting of today's Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Beginning in the 1880s they crammed themselves into tenements on lower Washington Street and opened restaurants, bakeries and newsstands selling Arabic-language publications. Here was the place to buy Oriental rugs, smoke hookah or sample melt-in-your-mouth halvah.
Much of the community was demolished in the 1940s to make way for the entrance ramps to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
Today three buildings remain. But only one of them -- St. George's Syrian Catholic Church, at 103 Washington Street -- has landmark status. The church currently has no congregation, however; it is occupied by restaurants and residential tenants.
The nonprofit Washington Street Advocacy Group and others have sought landmark status for the church's neighbors: the Downtown Community House building at 105-7 Washington, which at one point became a Buddhist temple but is currently vacant, and a tenement building at 109 Washington, which is next to a lot where buildings have been demolished.
Absent any protections, the buildings are at risk for redevelopment.
Newspaper Row
Park Row
In the late 19th Century, the city's mightiest newspapers stood shoulder to shoulder across from City Hall, their proximity an implicit promise to hold that building's occupants accountable.
The first to go up, in 1858, was The New York Times Building at 41 Park Row. It started out a mere five stories, but later bulked up to the Romanesque granite-and-limestone tower it is today. To ensure that there was no interruption in covering the news, the bigger building was erected around the smaller one. At the end of the construction, the old building's exterior walls were removed.
Next to the Times was the Tribune Building, and then came the New York World Building, presided over by publisher Joseph Pulitzer, whose office was in its copper-domed top. The district, sometimes called Printing House Square, also included other publications.
Only the Times Building, which became a city landmark in 1999, remains (though the paper itself decamped to Midtown long ago). The tower is owned by Pace University, which recently renovated the lower floors into light-filled spaces that include an art gallery.
The basement, however, looks much like it did when the newspaper's printing presses still rumbled.
Fulton Fish Market
Fulton Street
The South Street Seaport was once the busiest port in the world, and its fish market on Fulton Street, around which its buildings were clustered, also flourished. As did crime, prompting repeated campaigns to clean up the place.
On the heels of one such effort, the New Market Building was erected. It was designed to promote a different sort of cleanup: a safer, more sanitary handling of fish. Bordering the East River, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip, the building was dedicated by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in 1939.
But in 2005, the fish market relocated to Hunts Point in the Bronx, and the New Market Building languished. Members of the community, preservationists and elected officials helped defeat a proposed tower on the site, and over the years many have called for the building to be saved. The New York City Economic Development Corporation, which has jurisdiction over the Seaport, is planning to tear it down.
Meanwhile, the landmark 1907 Tin Building, which occupies Pier 17 -- once home to burly fishmongers -- is being reincarnated as an upscale food hall and market overseen by the celebrity chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
The neoclassical building was dismantled temporarily while its supporting structure was rebuilt. Now it is being reassembled, complete with its original columns, beams and trusses.
When the Tin Building reopens next year, seafood will be among the options available.

Texto completo: Nontraditional Nigerian churches are safe spaces for young Christians -- if they aren't L.G.B.T.Q.
LAGOS, Nigeria -- Services at the Tribe Lagos church in Nigeria are held in a chic, urbane cafe resembling many others like it in the area: a long, fairly spacious room with stark white walls and light casings made from woven raffia palms.
On a recent Sunday morning, around 80 congregants in their 20s and 30s began trickling in for the 9 o'clock meeting, per usual. Their fashion choices were hip, personalized and elaborately conceived -- bright vintage tees paired with baggy, gently rolled-up jeans; colorfully patterned dresses flowing above high-rise sneakers. There was an undeniable metropolitan vibe suggesting an uncontested comfort in their skins.
It was my first visit to the Tribe, having learned of it through friends who are regular attendees and speak highly of its impact on their lives for its nontraditional approaches. I was curious to see if it might have the same effect on me, a queer millennial in search of fellowship in a country where homophobia has been written into law.
I observed an opening prayer, followed by musical performances by the church band. Everyone seemed to know each other, and the service moved freely from one form to the next -- at times it could have passed for an open-mic session or karaoke among friends. The casual and collaborative atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the Nigerian churches I grew up in, where authority is concentrated at the altar. Here at the Tribe, everyone seemed to be equal in their participation; even the pastors could easily be mistaken for congregants.
The Tribe began in 2017 as a weekly event called "Coffee and Conversations," with the intent of having "objective conversations around spirituality," according to its founder and pastor, Ferdinand Adimefe. Like many young Nigerians, Mr. Adimefe, 34, was conflicted about the conservative leanings within Christianity that dominate the country's culture and laws.
"The approach of the church didn't seem to have answers to modern problems," he told me during an hourlong chat, "or didn't even seem prepared to take up the questions" his generation seemed to be asking. He decided to take an indeterminate break from his Pentecostal church to question its beliefs and create a new narrative he felt needed to emerge within Christianity.
The Tribe has gained a steady following and grown to serve more than 150 members in Lagos and a smaller branch in Abuja, Nigeria's capital. The community is part of a larger wave, beginning in the early 2000s, of more progressive Nigerian Pentecostal churches led by young people that have risen up to fill the space conservative churches have left unexplored. Tapping into a generation's concerns about mental health, relationships, identity, sexuality and finances, these organizations ostensibly offer their congregants a friendly space to unpack whatever they might be dealing with alongside the teachings of God.
Like many queer people, my most defining contact with homophobia began at church. Though I was raised Catholic, at 15, I switched to a traditional Pentecostal church when I went to live with my older sister, who lived in a different Nigerian state, following the death of my mother. The experience was profoundly dispiriting.
I was subjected to conversion therapy after my family found messages I'd shared with my partner at the time, and it left me physically and emotionally scarred in ways I am still processing four years later. I stopped actively participating in my church's youth activities because it seemed dishonest and impossible for me to reject who I am and worship God at the same time. Prayer was used against my sexuality, and my personhood.
But faith dies hard. And I find that I am still drawn to church culture, particularly the singing and the small pockets of community it can provide. I have also always lived by the certainty of a higher being who affords me a spiritual footing. I still believe in God, or the faintest notion of its existence, and continue to seek out relatively healthier places of worship.
I first encountered a nontraditional place of worship when I visited Harvesters, another youth-oriented church that was founded in 2003, as a 19-year-old in search of a departure from my traditional Christian upbringing. I was able to attend services there only a couple of times -- the distance from my home makes it difficult -- though I appreciated the practical and objective conversations aimed at addressing the issues of the young congregants.
As a queer person, the existence of spaces like Harvesters and Te Tribe, which operate on the basis of a more open-minded kind of love and acceptance, can be refreshing.
But for all of the openness these new wave churches profess, the conversations around queerness have often played out via correctional undertones and are sometimes avoided all together. When I've tried talking about issues specific to being queer with other L.G.B.T.Q. people who attend these services, this avoidance seems to be a key motivating factor in their decision to keep returning.
They can worship without being subjected to hateful sermons condemning homosexuality. But how does silence equal equality?
Outside places of worship, queer Nigerians are frequently subjected to violent attacks, blackmail, extortion, indiscriminate arrests and public ostracism. It's risky to report these injustices to the police, who have openly advised queer people to leave the country or risk prosecution.
When I asked Mr. Adimefe about the Tribe's stance on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, I learned that while the church will not exclude queer people or pray against them, he encourages his congregants to be open to the possibilities of becoming straight when they meet with teachings from the Bible. "Acceptance is not an endorsement," he said.
This contradiction has posed a conundrum for me. A space like the Tribe could serve as an occasional refuge where my existence as a queer person isn't in constant negotiation, at least on its surface. But it's not a community I can honestly and completely call my own.
Friendships and relationships are formed here, and I want to be a part of it. But the corrective bent of the Tribe floats over my head like a bad cloud.
After I left that Sunday service with the Tribe and my conversation with Mr. Adimefe, I was reminded yet again of the privileges even the most progressive Nigerian churches continue to afford heteronormative identities. Such churches might provide safer spaces for young Nigerians, but they come with limits for young Christians who are queer. And in this way, they are one and the same with the conservative churches from which they try to distinguish themselves. It's just a more benevolent form of homophobia.
I still haven't found a fellowship where I can truly be myself -- but my faith in such a possibility hasn't been shaken yet.

Texto completo: The first season of "Generation Q" comes to a close on Showtime, and the 62nd Grammy Awards air on CBS.
What's on TV
THE L WORD: GENERATION Q 10 p.m. on Showtime. This reboot of the "The L Word," the pioneering series about lesbian life in Los Angeles, wraps up its first season. The mayoral candidate Bette (Jennifer Beals) is on the edge of her seat, waiting for the results on election night. While Shane (Katherine Moennig) and Quiara (Lex Scott Davis) face another bump in the road, Alice (Leisha Hailey) takes a risk with her show after a devastating drop in ratings. In her review for The New York Times, Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that while "The L Word" "now better reflects Los Angeles's ethnic and gender diversity," it still needs some fine tuning. The original series "always stood on shaky, uncritical ground when it came to money and class, and 'Generation Q' offers little progress in that regard." Fans who welcomed this sequel can breathe a sigh of relief: Showtime recently renewed it for a second season.
THE 62ND ANNUAL GRAMMY AWARDS 8 p.m. on CBS. A dark cloud hangs over Sunday night's ceremony: Deborah Dugan, the suspended chief executive of the Recording Academy, was recently placed on leave over accusations of bullying behavior and a request for a multimillion-dollar payout. Dugan has denied the charges and responded with her own allegations, saying the academy was punishing her for unveiling misconduct. As the intense showdown plays out behind-the-scenes, several of this year's nominees will take the stage for performances. Among them are Lizzo (with eight nominations), Billie Eilish (six) and Lil Nas X (also six).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
THE CIRCUS 8 p.m. on Showtime. This documentary series, which follows the biggest stories under the Trump administration, is back for Season 5. This premiere focuses on the early days of President Trump's impeachment trial: Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota make crucial appearances in Iowa before heading to the capital for the trial, while their opponents, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have the state all to themselves. For more political entertainment, tune into the third season premiere of OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT at 8:30.
What's Streaming
MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING (1997) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. This classic romantic comedy stars Julia Roberts as Julianne, a restaurant critic in New York who gets a troubling phone call: Michael (Dermot Mulroney), her best friend whom she made a marriage pact with, is marrying someone else (Cameron Diaz). Julianne suddenly realizes she's in love with him and sets out to crash his wedding in Chicago with only four days to go. Instead, she ends up becoming his bride's maid of honor, and her plan to tell Michael the truth goes haywire. Watching Roberts beam, Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times, "is a lot more fun than sitting through the film's bad karaoke episode."

Big Oscar Buzz For an Underdog

Texto completo: The movie from North Macedonia is the first to be nominated for both best documentary and best international feature.
The Oscar race is in full swing, and all eyes are on the big contenders: "Joker"! "Marriage Story"! "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"!
Yet one little-known movie amid the star-studded titles has quietly broken ground.
"Honeyland" is the first film to be nominated for best documentary and best international feature (the category formerly known as best foreign-language film). It follows Hatidze Muratova, a middle-aged beekeeper whose peaceful life in the North Macedonian countryside is disrupted when a chaotic family moves in next door.
The movie premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last year and came out on top with three awards, including the grand jury prize for documentary in the world cinema showcase.
It went on to win accolades at smaller festivals across the globe and is still riding high. It has a 99 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and, in December, The New York Times critic A.O. Scott named it the best movie of 2019.
The film, he wrote, "is nothing less than a found epic, a real-life environmental allegory and, not least, a stinging comedy about the age-old problem of inconsiderate neighbors."
"Honeyland" is the underdog in the international feature category. It's the feature-length debut of the directors Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov, and it's competing with two much-talked-about titles by veteran filmmakers: Bong Joon Ho's comedy thriller, "Parasite," and Pedro Almodóvar's drama, "Pain and Glory."
In the documentary category, it's up against "American Factory," the first Netflix film from Barack and Michelle Obama's production company.
So why has a movie about a poor woman in an isolated village from little-known filmmakers resonated with viewers around the world?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
At the outset, "Honeyland" captures Muratova going about her daily life. We see her singing to her bees; selling her honey in Skopje, the North Macedonian capital; and caring for her ailing, octogenarian mother, who is half-blind and hard of hearing.
Then we meet the new neighbors: Hussein Sam, his wife, their seven children and their cattle and chickens. Where Muratova is calm and cheerful, Sam's family is raucous and ill-tempered (not to mention foul-mouthed). Their differences become problematic when Sam takes a stab at beekeeping and breaks Muratova's golden rule: Leave half of the honey for the bees.
Sam may come off as the villain -- his ways threaten the fate of both Muratova and her bees. Then again, he's merely a father trying to provide for his family and satisfy an impatient buyer. His predicament, the directors said, is just one element that makes "Honeyland" a universal story.
"The film works like a mirror," Kotevska said in a phone interview. "Some people recognize themselves in Hatidze. Some recognize themselves in the other family."
Their quarrel propels the narrative forward. Then there are touching moments between Muratova and her bedridden mother, who is acutely aware of her daughter's heavy load. The filmmakers also capture the growing bond between Muratova and one of Sam's sons, who often escapes into her quiet world after shouting matches with his father.
The result is a nuanced tale that touches on loneliness, capitalism and a dying way of life. Most of all, Stefanov said, he and Kotevska wanted to show how greed functions on "a very basic level" -- in this case, on a remote patch of land inhabited by a handful of people.
Critics have been singing the film's praises. The Los Angeles Times wrote that few documentaries "have offered such an intimately infuriating, methodically detailed allegory of the earth's wonders being ravaged by the consequences of human greed."
The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "The chronicle that Stefanov and Kotevska have distilled abounds in moments of unguarded discovery -- moments that can be tender, humorous, rackety or serene."
Still, Stefanov and Kotevska had no idea they would be heading to the Oscars. "After Sundance, it was clear that the film is good and people love it," Stefanov said. "But we didn't expect two nominations."
They didn't even expect to tell the story to begin with.
The directors stumbled upon Muratova's beehives while doing research for an environmental documentary. After meeting her, they were intrigued by her beekeeping traditions, which go back generations.
They went on to shoot more than 400 hours of footage over the course of three years, working in rough conditions. Muratova lived in a small, ramshackle hut with no electricity. Stefanov and Kotevska would visit for a few days at a time and sleep in tents. Their only plan was to wait for compelling shots.
The movie's Oscar nomination for best international feature, Kotevska said, is proof that fiction and nonfiction work should not be judged separately. (Whether a documentary will ever be nominated for best picture is a different story.)
"Our understanding of film is that it shouldn't have boundaries," Kotevska said. "Good storytelling is good storytelling."

Devilishly Good At Playing an Angel

Texto completo: The Harlem-set "Blues for an Alabama Sky" finally arrives in New York, with a juicy role that has attracted African-American actresses across the country.
Pearl Cleage's drama "Blues for an Alabama Sky" drops the audience into the world of Harlem Renaissance artists after the Champagne has stopped flowing.
They include the tantalizing lounge singer Angel Allen and her roommate, Guy, a confident gay costume designer. Leland, an Alabama transplant, comes to be part of their dysfunctional family of artists, who are grappling with poverty, pregnancy, homophobia and how to create in desperate times.
First presented by Atlanta's Alliance Theater in 1995, "Blues" has been consistently produced regionally and at universities since, but Keen Company is staging the first major New York production beginning Feb. 4, directed by LA Williams. The show is slated to run through March 14 Off Broadway, at Theater Row.
"These characters have been moving around in New York," Cleage said by phone recently. "Now they are in New York."
It is Angel in whom many black actresses, including Phylicia Rashad, Robin Givens and Jasmine Guy, have found an ideal leading lady. She is straight-shooting and charismatic, a bit past her prime but slinking her way in and out of men's lives -- always to their detriment.
Rashad, a few years beyond "The Cosby Show," originated the part in a show directed by Kenny Leon. "Rashad's Angel is worn down by life but still a fighter, and still a full-blooded woman," The Washington Post wrote in its review when the production moved to Arena Stage there. "She's more sensual putting on a dress than most women are taking one off."
While writing "Blues," Cleage wanted to portray characters not typically found onstage. When Alliance remounted it on its 20th anniversary, she rewrote the ending, leaving Angel unredeemed. "People don't always see the light," the playwright explained.
On the eve of its New York premiere, The New York Times spoke to six actors who've played the role, including Alfie Fuller, who is starring in the Keen Company production. How did Angel help them take flight? Edited responses follow.
Phylicia Rashad
The Tony Award-winning actress and director has been friends with Cleage since they were theater students at Howard University in the 1970s. She performed in "Puppetplay," one of Cleage's earlier works.
"I had not seen or spoken to [Pearl] in some years when Kenny Leon approached me. The fact that Pearl had written it was enough to persuade me. The period in which the play is set, the world in which it takes place, during the Harlem Renaissance, is a very exciting time in human history. Angel is a beautifully complex human being who knows her physicality, but not her self. The role couldn't have come at a better time in my career."
Crystal Fox
The star of "Tyler Perry's The Haves and the Have Nots" on OWN and Perry's new Netflix film "A Fall From Grace," she understudied Rashad in 1995 and starred in the Alliance's 2015 revival, directed by Susan Booth.
"People tend to marginalize us; they don't show the varying shades of black women at all. The thing I love about Angel is that people want to make her sweet or downtrodden so you can root for her. Angel shakes you up. I love how people come to 'Blues for an Alabama Sky' and they fall in love with her all the way through. Then, at the end, they're side-eyeing Angel and you don't know where to put her. For me, that makes her human. That's a testament to Pearl."
Maryam Fatima Foye
Her first lead role was in the 2011 African Continuum Theater Company production of the work in Washington. She is now a performing-arts consultant and splits her time between Washington and New Orleans.
"The director, Walter Dallas, created these beautiful tableaus. In the final scene, he had Angel standing alone after everyone had departed. I was staring out into the audience beneath this beautiful blue light with gorgeous music playing behind me. It was hard as an actor to not be personally overwhelmed. I am a black woman and I have had to sacrifice a whole lot in life just trying to do well, be well and make myself proud."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Shinelle Azoroh
Played Angel in 2012 at the Lorraine Hansberry Theater in San Francisco just after graduating from the American Conservatory Theater. She co-starred in the 2019 feature film "Don't Let Go" opposite David Oyelowo.
"Angel gave me permission to trust my insecurities and strengths. [During rehearsals ] I was very emotional and didn't have the confidence to lead the play. [The director] Michelle Shay called a rehearsal with only me. She sat across from me -- quiet and regal -- and she said, 'Angel is scared too.' I believe she was giving me something each of those characters give one another: creative energy, freedom to be reckless and love."
Toya Turner
Played Angel in the 2017 production at Chicago's Court Theater, directed by Ron OJ Parson . It was her first leading role in a play and the experience motivated her to move to Los Angeles to expand her career. She is now a star of the forthcoming Netflix series "Warrior Nun," which is based on a manga graphic novel .
"At the time I played Angel, I was working on getting my own independence and changing as a woman, which in turn made me start evolving as an artist. I dug deep into the history of the time and listened to a lot of Bessie Smith ... During the rehearsal period we talked about what it would have meant for Angel to have to go back to the South [if things did not work out economically in Harlem]. She would've had to settle down, get married, have kids. For her, that's a death sentence."
Alfie Fuller
"Blues for an Alabama Sky" follows up her roles in the Off Broadway hits "Is God Is" at Soho Rep and "BLKS" at MCC Theater.
"It is not often that I come across a woman character who acts in her own self-interest, is unapologetic about the choices she makes. When we were doing table work, a lot of the male actors were very angry with Angel, describing her in ways that I thought were completely unfair, saying that she's an evil villain. How many times in the American theater have we watched men characters act in their own self-interest? All the time. We don't sit around the table calling them villains. These characters are celebrated. Men desire to play these characters.
[I asked my castmates] why is it that a woman, who in 1930 has agency over her own body and does not have any loyalty to the church, which is such a big thing in black stories, described as evil? I'm not saying she's perfect, but who is? Angel is a woman who is trying to do the best she can with what she has. She is figuring it out on her feet like everyone else."

Texto completo: The great Japanese animator Satoshi Kon died young in 2010 but his work continues to dazzle on the internet.
Looking over the lists critics have made of films and filmmakers that most impressed them during the past decade, I sorely miss the name of a 46-year-old director only hitting his stride at the time of his death in 2010, Satoshi Kon.
Kon's four adventurous anime features, "Perfect Blue" (1997), "Millennium Actress" (2001), "Tokyo Godfathers" (2003) and "Paprika" (2006) -- each film a further development -- established his reputation as one of the world's pre-eminent avant-pop filmmakers. Given his interest in the possibilities of cyberspace and the nature of mass media, Kon's films have as much in common with the work of David Cronenberg or Olivier Assayas as with that of Hayao Miyazaki.
The protagonist of his first feature, "Perfect Blue," is a vapid girl-group singer named Mima, who angers her fans when she leaves a successful trio for an acting career. To act, however, is to fall apart. Mima is driven mad by a demonic stalker and a computer-generated doppelgänger, both of which may be projections of her own insecurity.
"Perfect Blue" is a hodgepodge of murders, rapes and car crashes, larded up with abundantly animated blood, sweat and tears. The 1999 New York Times review was headlined, "This Cartoon Didn't Come From Disney." Upon its release, it exploded like a cartoon bombshell in the anime world and beyond. (Madonna used clips as a video interlude for the song "What It Feels Like for a Girl" in her 2001 tour.)
Fragmented, as well as brutal, "Perfect Blue" suggests a giallo horror remake of Ingmar Bergman's "Persona." It also proved prescient as Mima is trolled by a fake home page created by her sinister admirer. Grudgingly impressed, the Times reviewer Anita Gates wrote that the film "eventually turns into a very interesting play on levels and perceptions of reality."
The more likable "Millennium Actress" also takes a pop star as its subject. The focus is a retired movie actress named Chiyoko Fujiwara (perhaps inspired by the revered Setsuko Hara, who played a dutiful daughter in the films of Yasujiro Ozu). On one hand, the movie is devoted to solving the mystery of Chiyoko's past, dealing with lost loves and backstage rivalries. On the other, it pays homage to Japan's film industry. Chiyoko's movies range from war propaganda filmed in Manchuria through samurai films, geisha stories to rampaging Godzilla flicks.
"Millennium Actress" is circumscribed yet vast -- its title might refer to a thousand years of Japanese culture. Chiyoko's roles provide a chronicle of postwar Japan; unconstrained by chronology, she walks in and out of period movies. And the camera crew interviewing her for a TV documentary are present as anxious spectators in the various flashbacks.
The use of time-travel, memories and invented film clips in "Millennium Actress" suggest the modernist cinema of Alain Resnais cubed. More classical in its narrative, "Tokyo Godfathers" pays tribute to one movie in particular -- John Ford's 1948 western, "Three Godfathers," an insufferably cornball saga in which three cattle rustlers (John Wayne, Pedro Armendáriz and Harry Carey Jr.) find themselves as the three kings in an allegory about a Christmas foundling.
Although scarcely unsentimental, Kon transposes the Ford movie to the lower depths of Tokyo's skid row, raising the stakes by recasting the outlaws as three homeless outcasts -- a teenage runaway, a surly alcoholic, and (in the Wayne role) a transgender woman -- who find an abandoned baby nestled in the trash.
"Tokyo Godfathers," which the Times critic A.O. Scott called "a kind of neorealist cartoon," is Kon's most linear film. By contrast, his final anime "Paprika," is pure delirium. The surreal premise, taken from a novel by the science-fiction writer Yasutaka Tsutsui, has psychiatrists entering their patients' dreams through a device called the DC Mini.
"Paprika" plays out in a world that seamlessly merges the individual unconscious with a collective cyberspace. The protagonist. Dr. Chiba, is treating a police detective who once aspired to become a film director. The DC Mini is stolen, occasioning a battle royal in which the doctor's free-spirited computer avatar, Paprika, bends time and space with impunity and changes her identity at will (at one point to Disney's Tinker Bell, at another to the Sphinx).
Whenever the DC Mini is activated, the dream world erupts with a tumultuous "Pee-wee's Playhouse" parade of anthropomorphized toys, gadgets, religious icons, historical monuments and household products. The situation is resolved when, thanks to Paprika's intervention, the troubled detective becomes the star of his own movie. In the final self-reflexive joke, though, this "gorgeous riot," as Manohla Dargis called it in her Times review, ends with the detective visiting a movie house showing Kon's earlier movies.
"Paprika" has affinities to the montage gags in Buster Keaton's "Sherlock, Jr.," when a projectionist dreams his way into the world onscreen, but what Kon's film truly celebrates is the triumph of animation. Reality is as elastic and amorphous as in classic Max Fleischer cartoons like "Bimbo's Initiation" (1931) or "Snow White" (1933).
Trippier than the mid-60s comic book "Doctor Strange," as heady as Alan Moore's "Watchmen," "Paprika" is one of the great movies of the still young 21st century.
"Perfect Blue" is available on Amazon Prime , Google Play , and YouTube ; "Millennium Actress" is on all of these three plus Vudu . "Paprika" streams via iTunes , Google Play , Amazon Prime , Vudu and YouTube . "Tokyo Godfathers" can be found on Crackle .

Texto completo: For millions of children over generations, an introduction to the joys of reading has come courtesy of 'Pat the Bunny,' the classic 1940 picture book by Dorothy Kunhardt that beckons young readers to join its two protagonists, Paul and Judy, in such sensory thrills as smelling flowers, looking in a mirror, feeling Daddy's scratchy face and, naturally, stroking a bunny.
In an era before children's books came outfitted with blinking lights, music makers and other attractions that mix the concepts of toy and book, 'Pat the Bunny' " with its rabbit made from soft white fabric and sandpaper on the rugged father's cheek " was a sensation. It reportedly became the second-best-selling children's book in the United States, after Beatrix Potter's 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit,' and eight decades after its publication remains a staple of nursery bookshelves.
The 3-year-old girl who inspired 'Pat the Bunny' was Kunhardt's daughter and grew up to be Edith Kunhardt Davis, author of dozens of children's books, including a set of sequels to her mother's classic work. Ms. Davis died Jan.-2 at a hospital in New York City. She was 82 and had acute pneumonia and lung failure, said her daughter, Martha K. Davis.
Ms. Davis's success, and the sweetness of the books that made her and her mother famous, at times belied her private struggles. Ms. Davis emerged as a children's writer only after conquering alcoholism, which had afflicted her for years, including when she was pregnant with her son. Edward S. Davis Jr. " 'Neddy' to her " suffered from heart ailments and died at 27 in 1990.
Ms. Davis chronicled his life and her grief, as well as her torment over the possibility that her drinking might have contributed to his infirmity, in the searing memoir 'I'll Love You Forever, Anyway' (1995). Another memoir, 'My Mother, the Bunny, and Me' (2016), traced her life from childhood to motherhood and beyond, providing a nuanced portrait of the people behind one of the best-known works in children's literature.
Edith Turner Kunhardt was born in New York City on Sept.-30, 1937, and grew up in Morristown, N.J. Her father, Philip B. Kunhardt, worked in textiles. Her mother was the daughter of Frederick Hill Meserve, a renowned collector of photographs and artifacts from the life of President Abraham Lincoln.
Lincolniana became a family devotion carried through five generations. Dorothy Kunhardt and her son, Philip B. Kunhardt Jr., wrote 'Twenty Days' (1965), a noted photographic volume about Lincoln's assassination and its aftermath. Among Ms. Davis's children's volumes was 'Honest Abe' (1993), a picture book with artwork by Malcah Zeldis that traced Lincoln's odyssey from a Kentucky log cabin to the presidency.
Dorothy Kunhardt began writing children's books to help provide for her family during the Depression, when her husband was out of work. Her children recalled her as wildly creative, toiling in an unheated attic and ensconcing herself in a collection of secondhand books that became so voluminous it eventually blocked the sunlight from entering her bedroom windows.
'Part of me longed to have a mother like everyone else,' Ms. Davis told the New York Times in 1991. 'And part of me was very proud of her.'
Ms. Davis was in elementary school when she made her first attempt at a book, the story of a hippo named Rosie who lived in New York's Central Park Zoo. But she later recalled her humiliation when her mother penned her papers and other school work. As a senior in high school, she was caught giving a speech her mother had written.
'That moment was to haunt me for 30 years,' Ms. Davis wrote.
She attended the private Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., before receiving a bachelor's degree in art history from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in 1959. The same year, she married Edward S. Davis, with whom she had her son and daughter. The couple divorced in 1971, and Martha Davis, of San Diego, is Ms. Davis's only immediate survivor. (Ms. Davis's mother died in 1979.)
Ms. Davis stopped drinking in 1973 on what her nephew Philip B. Kunhardt III described as a 'watershed day' from which she proudly counted the following 46 years of her life. She became an editor with Golden Books, later telling the Los Angeles Times that she considered her mother the author and herself the editor until she tried her hand at writing and found success.
Ms. Davis wrote a shelf full of books " among them 'The Mouse Family's New Home' (1981) and 'Martha's House' (1982) " before an editor proposed that she write a sequel to 'Pat the Bunny.'
'My first reaction was, 'A spinoff of Pat the Bunny? No, no, never " don't do it!' ' Ms. Davis told Publishers Weekly. But in time, she warmed to the idea. 'Pat the Cat' was published in 1984, followed by volumes including 'Pat the Puppy' (1993) and 'Pat the Christmas Bunny' (1999), as well as 'Daddy's Scratchy Face' and 'Judy's Flower Bed' (both 2005).
Instead of Paul and Judy, there were Martha and Neddy " named in honor of Ms. Davis's children " who indulge in time-honored experiences such a smelling gingersnaps as well as more modern ones, such as withdrawing money from an ATM.
'How do mother and daughter compare?' Washington Post book critic Michael Dirda wrote in a review of 'Pat the Cat.' 'A survey . . . recently asked this question of a 5-month-old infant named Christopher and his somewhat older friends Mary, Katherine, Elizabeth, Joey, and Kerry. The results? An overwhelming consensus that Cat was fully the equal of Bunny in plot, character development, and gadgetry. . . . Clearly, the infant's bookshelf now requires two Kunhardt titles.'
Ms. Davis's other books for young readers included volumes exploring what it is like to be a farmer, a police officer, a firefighter and a veterinarian. She also wrote a history book, 'Pompeii . . . Buried Alive!' (1987).
She told the New York Times that she shared the gift of her mother's childlike sensibility but that 'it never would have occurred to me that I could write.'
'In a sense, I was freed,' she said. 'It was like a dam gave way.'
She found solace in writing after her son died, keeping a journal that evolved into her first memoir. It presented what New York Times reviewer Judith Viorst described as a 'journey from raging desolation to something she once believed was unattainable: the ability to remember her dead child 'with joy, or at least equanimity.' '
As Ms. Davis emerged from her grief, she made a painting of two rowboats " 'side by side but not touching,' she observed, just like 'Neddy and me.'

A call to abolish immigration detention

Texto completo: 'Migrating to Prison' reads like a dispatch from the maelstrom of U.S. immigration policy. Its author, César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, is like a reporter on hurricane duty, leaning into the wind while bands of chaos and destruction sweep the land.
His subject is immigration detention, whose obscene growth in the United States he illuminates and deplores. García Hernández, a law professor at the University of Denver, also publishes a blog called Crimmigration. The coinage enfolds this book's argument: Too many immigrants are being locked up like criminals, and no one " not even criminals " should be treated this way. Free them all. Give them lawyers and social workers and free them all.
Really? Yes. García Hernández is making a case that would have been far-fetched when Barack Obama was president and is delivering it to President Trump, who has abandoned all sense of lenity, humanity and justice when dealing with people who want to enter our gates, especially brown ones from poor countries. Dehumanization and violence have marked the administration's assault on immigration: taking children from their parents, brutalizing asylum seekers, fatally neglecting sick and vulnerable detainees.
Free them? How about just not kill them?

But detention abolition is García Hernández's dream, and he is sticking with it, into the teeth of the present immigration calamity. He begins with the history. Back when America was smaller and more improvisatory, foreigners could more or less walk in, especially you, Mr. Northern European Man. Eventual citizenship was little more than a formality, and hardly anybody went to prison merely for being a foreign transplant. But things changed after our first century, and immigration incarceration became a tool used against the Chinese, then certain Europeans, then people in our hemisphere " Cubans, Haitians, Mexicans and, most recently, Central Americans.
García Hernández depicts a country continually adjusting its immigration policies on the fly, toggling between two ugly impulses: exploitation (Get to work) and xenophobia (Now get out). Chinese laborers were welcome until the railroads were done and the racists had their way. Pearl Harbor was horrible news for Japanese Americans but an opportunity for Mexican men who entered by the thousands to work the fields while our boys fought overseas. No sense locking up migrants when you need them to pick onions.
America's treatment of immigrants has been erratic, but García Hernández argues that its arc has long bent toward injustice. Especially in the past three decades, when the detention 'obsession' he is talking about took hold.
Note the long time frame. Just as Walter White of 'Breaking Bad' didn't invent meth, Trump is not the original immigrant brutalizer. He has just deployed the machinery he inherited in a more lethal and reprehensible way, distilled to purest cruelty.
García Hernández outlines the history that gave Trump his xenophobe's toolbox. A 1996 law signed by President Bill Clinton redefined 'aggravated felonies' and became the pretext for locking up ever more immigrants for minor crimes. Militarized border security and the conflation of immigration with criminality flourished under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama, still the reigning deporter in chief. Obama tried to out-harsh the Republicans to win their support for immigration reform, a cruel-to-be-kind approach that was embraced and echoed over the years by Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and other establishment Democrats.
In the Obama years, the federal government conscripted local law enforcement in its immigrant dragnet, empowering people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who terrorized Latinos in Arizona for years with lawless policing and brutal imprisonment. Obama's administration worked with Arpaio. Trump pardoned him. He is a bloodstain on both their reputations.
García Hernández is an absolutist, for whom no denial of free movement to immigrants is acceptable. He thus sees the intolerable everywhere. Buses carrying people to detention centers are 'prisons on wheels.' Steamships that didn't let migrants disembark until they were inspected for entry were the first (floating) immigrant prisons. Ellis Island, that sentimental gateway, was also a prison, and so of course is today's archipelago of lockups " federal, local and privately run " that confine immigrants by the tens of thousands across the country.
'Migrating to Prison' is a long indictment that unfortunately reads like one. It's a lumpy digest of citations from news reports and other sources meant to show that immigration prisons don't do what politicians claim they do. They don't deter unchecked migration, eliminate predators or punish evildoers. They profit no one but the private prison corporations that feast upon our fears. They destroy untold lives, especially traumatized families fleeing here for asylum, who fit no rational definition of criminals or undesirables.
García Hernández is right about these things. But his book is still disappointing. It's too pedestrian for a moral exhortation. It's a song for the choir that reads like a memo, stating with flat affect how America has lost its way. We live in an era of caged children, of shattered families and suicidal parents. The administration's Orwellian 'migrant protection' policy has pushed thousands of asylum seekers to the wrong side of the border, desperately waiting just beyond the threshold of safety, vulnerable to kidnapping and murder. Activist doctors who try to bring flu shots to detainees are blocked and threatened with arrest.
Lady Liberty's lamp is guttering. This is the horrifying truth of our day, rendered dutifully but bloodlessly in this book.
I wish García Hernández had read some of his sentences after typing them. Some lines can almost flicker into focus if you read them a few times: 'Rhetorical fights over what is best to use as a marker of undesirability misses [sic] the point that everything about drawing lines around some people " figuratively and literally " is rife with complications and unintended consequences.'
I'm not sure what he means there. Nor do I know what he wants us to do.
I wish the author had attached more solutions to his diagnosis, instead of just an epigraph from James Baldwin ('the impossible is the least that one can demand') and a shrug. He relies heavily on the radical thinker Angela Davis in arguing for prison abolition but has no map for how to get there.
Two-thirds of the way through, he admits it: 'I don't pretend to have a step-by-step plan for getting from a policy that imprisons half a million migrants annually to one that ensnares zero.' But he says he doesn't like ankle bracelets and other jail alternatives 'that reek of punishment.'
By avoiding the step-by-step business, he ducks some difficult questions. How could this country eliminate its bloodsucking private-prison industry? How do we keep migrants safe while we wait for the prison walls to tumble down? How would wide-open asylum be managed? And isn't there a way to defend immigrants' dignity and right to be here more strongly than 'We are all a mixed bag'?
That sad phrase is García Hernández's way of asking that lawbreaking immigrants never be locked up. 'We need to stop demanding that migrants be exceptional and instead embrace their ordinariness,' he says. It's true enough. 'We should dream,' he says. He's right. But it's hard to see how this adds up to a strategy to upend federal policy on immigrant detention. I look forward to his next book showing us a clearer way to escape the present nightmare.

Texto completo: If you're not already a fan, your vision of jazz might contain a guy (always a guy) in a fedora playing tenor saxophone in a smoky bar. Or a self-satisfied aficionado waxing poetic about a rare free-jazz LP, acting as though he's the only one capable of decoding its knotty melodies as he pushes his glasses up his nose. Yes, jazz has an image problem: More than a century after its genesis, the genre remains shrouded in many of the same erroneous cliches that initially made it so controversial " as well as a slew of newer ones. The trouble comes when that mystique looms large enough to keep people from ever exploring the music.
Myth No. 1 Jazz is more serious than other genres. 'People, when they say that they 'hate jazz,' they just don't have context " they don't know where it comes from,' explains the exasperated protagonist of the 2016 hit musical 'La La Land.' Ryan Gosling's character is the exact kind of straw man that often represents jazz in popular culture, arguing that what makes the music good is an intrinsic complexity and importance that requires great intellectual rigor to comprehend. Whether in 'Jerry Maguire,' 'The Office' or 'Veep,' jazz's self-serious reputation has turned it into shorthand for snobbish orthodoxy. Even participants promulgate this notion. 'The greatness of jazz lies not only in its emotion but also in its deliberate artifice,' wrote Wynton Marsalis in a 1988 New York Times essay.
In fact, jazz requires exactly as much or as little expertise to listen to and appreciate as anything else.-Understanding the music's history can certainly inform the listening experience " as with music from any genre " but all you really need to appreciate jazz are open ears. Reverence and study are not prerequisites: After all, many of the most canonical jazz records were meant to be danced to.
Myth No. 2 Jazz was born in New Orleans. One oft-cited, very easy history of jazz begins with the relative musical liberation of New Orleans's Congo Square, continues with cornetist Buddy Bolden and pianist Jelly Roll Morton (who played in Storyville, the city's red-light district), and moves with Louis Armstrong up the Mississippi on the paddle wheel boats to Chicago. New Orleans was the most cosmopolitan city of its time, a place where African Americans had many more opportunities to participate in public life. This is the way Ken Burns tells it in his massively popular documentary 'Jazz,' and the way it was told for decades prior by everyone from renowned jazz historians like Marshall Stearns to the National Park Service.
But the trouble with this story is that jazz had no Big Bang. Its roots involve so many different kinds of music: blues, spirituals, West African rhythms as they had been reimagined in the Caribbean, European classical music and more. Those sources informed musicians around the country. As a result, music we would now identify as jazz emerged almost simultaneously in a number of different communities from Jacksonville to Kansas City around the turn of the century. Unfortunately, the documentation of jazz's earliest days is so poor that it might be impossible to ever truly understand them.
Myth No. 3 Jazz must swing. 'Most jazz is very rhythmic [and] has a forward momentum called 'swing,' ' explains the website for the National Museum of American History. (Now, name a music that is not 'very rhythmic.') Swing is a way of playing eighth notes unevenly to produce a shuffle effect. It was one of the initial innovations of jazz and quickly became one of its distinguishing features. 'Swing' and 'jazz' are often treated as interchangeable terms because of the assumption that swing is one of jazz's essential qualities: Jazz at Lincoln Center's education program, for example, is called Swing University.
But 'straight' eighth notes have been integral to jazz from the start, especially in jazz from the Caribbean and South America, such as mambo or bossa nova. Dave Brubeck combined 'straight' eighth notes and swing to monumental effect on 'Blue Rondo a la Turk' in 1959, and playing 'straight' has become popular among contemporary jazz artists " who, like Brubeck, are also prone to experimenting with unusual time signatures. Those experiments tend to be a little simpler rhythmically when musicians aren't trying to swing as well.
Myth No. 4 Jazz musicians were (or are) on drugs. 'Charlie Parker's heroin addiction helped make him a genius,' argued the New York Post in a recent article, just one of the countless places where jazz musicians' habits " not their work " are featured front and center. (Parker, like a number of jazz musicians, was a user; he died at 34 because of complications from drug use.) It's a sensationalized, romantic vision of the music, one that reinforces an imagined connection between addiction and superlative creativity.-And it's not new: Since the days of 'Reefer Madness' (1936) and 'The Man With the Golden Arm' (1955), jazz music and its practitioners have been linked in popular culture with illicit drug use.
But the majority of jazz musicians did not regularly use intravenous drugs, according to an anonymous survey conducted by Nat Hentoff in the late 1950s " even though heroin was in vogue while the music was most popular. Instead, the cliche plays into a long, racist history of disproportionately prosecuting black drug users. The now-humorous cannabis euphemism 'jazz cigarette' has its roots in early propaganda designed to paint black communities (and their artists) as dens of iniquity " and create reasons to arrest them. After various drug prohibition laws went into effect, they were enforced against black artists to seize their cabaret cards and thus keep them from performing. The notion lingers despite the fact that hard-drug users account for an even smaller proportion of jazz musicians today.
Myth No. 5 Jazz is dead. Jazz accounts for 1 percent of music consumption " album sales and streaming " in America, according to Nielsen. The Michigan Daily recently described jazz as 'a genre considered to be 'dying,' if not dead already.' Who can blame the student journalists, when outlets like CNN still grapple with the question: 'What was the cause of death, and when did it pass away?' it asked in 2016.
But people have said jazz is dead since Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk had the moldy figs aghast with their audacious bebop in the 1940s. Though there are real questions about whether the term 'jazz' is useful, the music it describes has always been diversifying and regenerating. If anything, streaming technology presents unprecedented opportunities for music makers and fans to learn more about-jazz's history, as well as the wide range of artists active today. It's integral to hip-hop (just listen to A Tribe Called Quest or Kendrick Lamar) " now the dominant form of pop music " and vibrant jazz scenes in Los Angeles, Chicago and London speak to a new generation of artists committed to live, local music. Physical album sales are growing incrementally thanks to the vinyl renaissance, and festivals remain generally well attended. In many ways, the music is healthier than it's been in decades.

Texto completo: DES MOINES — The Des Moines Register’s editorial board has endorsed U. S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, arguing her ideas are needed at a moment “when the very fabric of American life is at stake. ”
“She is a thinker, a policy wonk and a hard worker,” the board wrote in its endorsement. “She remembers her own family’s struggles to make ends meet and her own desperation as a working mother needing child care. She cares about people, and she will use her seemingly endless energy and passion to fight for them. ”
The endorsement, which appeared online Saturday, comes just days before Iowans go to caucus Feb. 3 and amid a still-unsettled field of Democratic candidates.
What it means
Rachel Paine Caufield, a professor of political science at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and author of the book “The Iowa Caucus,” noted there are two conversations going on around the election right now: A national conversation and a local one.
“The Des Moines Register is at the heart of that local conversation,” she said. “And they’re doing it long before most of America is paying attention. ”
So while the Iowa caucuses are definitely of national interest, they are also a very local thing, and the Register endorsement still carries local interest, Caufield said.
The Register has endorsed candidates since the 1988 caucuses. In 2016 the board endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Marco Rubio.
Caufield noted there are still many caucusgoers who are undecided about which candidate to caucus for and “(The endorsement) lends legitimacy and credibility to a campaign’s … case to the voters. ”
In the most recent Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa poll conducted earlier this month, only 40% of likely Democratic caucusgoers had made up their mind about who to caucus for.
In the next week-plus, while campaigns make their final pitch to caucusgoers, the endorsement can offer an injection of energy.
“These final days before the caucus, momentum matters a great deal, the energy behind a campaign matters,” Caufield said. “I think it really helps (campaigns) make that final case. ”
For the candidates who didn’t get the endorsement, “it could be disappointing to a campaign,” Caufield said. “It could undermine some of its central claims, particularly about electability. ”
Register executive editor Carol Hunter told USA TODAY, “The board starts with a very basic question: Who would be the best president? But also asks who would be the best president for these times? That’s one of the main factors that led us to Elizabeth Warren.
“We feel that income inequality and the tilting of the playing field so much toward the wealthy and away from the middle class has put the American dream at risk. ”
In the United States, there was always a belief that if you worked hard, you could offer your children a better life than you had, Hunter said. “We believe that is at risk.
“Elizabeth Warren is someone who has devoted her life’s work to rebuilding the middle class. That’s why we think she’s the best leader for these times. "
The New York Times’ editorial board a week ago punted on a firm decision, choosing instead to endorse both Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Hunter said that wasn’t an option for the Register’s board.
“We could certainly identify with the Times’ dilemma,” Hunter said. “We think there are many candidates in this field who could make a fine president.
“But we think that Iowans going to caucus face making a choice. They can’t stand in two preference groups. So we felt pressure to come up with one name. ”
But the board did assess many candidates, “because we do think that many offer different experiences and backgrounds and areas of expertise that also would recommend them for these times. ”
“A lot of what we want to do is offer people ways to think about these candidates as they work to arrive at their own decision. ”
The Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, published Saturday a separate opinion piece paired with the endorsement, that details the board’s thoughts and reservations about other candidates in the race.
Hunter noted the editorial board’s decision is “not telling anyone how to vote. We offer our views as another piece of information as Iowans go about making their choices. ”
Warren was campaigning in Iowa when staff informed her of the news. She looked surprised, and nearly shouted, "I did?!" before doing a little dance.
She soon after told reporters, “I just heard, and I’m delighted. It really means a lot to me,” according to POLITICO.
How the process works
The editorial board invited each of the candidates to meet at the Register’s offices for formal interviews. Nine current candidates accepted the invitation, as well as several who have since left the race. Two Republicans are challenging President Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee in his party. The Register is not endorsing a candidate in the Republican caucus. The news team is separate from the opinion staff and it did not play a role in making the endorsement.
The board wrote that Warren “is not the radical” some perceive her to be. Her ideas aren’t radical, the editorial said. “They are right. ”
The board’s members wrote that they like Warren’s plans to target corruption, expand health care, tackle climate change and ensure government works for the people.
But the endorsement did not come without qualification; some of Warren’s ideas “go too far,” it said.
“Some of her ideas for ‘big, structural change’ go too far,” the editorial said. “This board could not endorse the wholesale overhaul of corporate governance or cumulative levels of taxation she proposes. While the board has long supported single-payer health insurance, it believes a gradual transition is the more realistic approach. But Warren is pushing in the right direction. ”
The editorial praised Warren’s resilience and courage, saying she has “proven she is tough and fearless. ”
“But toughness can also be perceived as divisive, as can rhetoric that vilifies the wealthy, lobbyists and corporations that employ millions of people,” the editorial said. “Relentless attack mode threatens to further fracture a country riven by party, income and racial divides. Unifying the country may not be possible, but to gain the support required to govern, she must show that her vision will lift people up rather than divide them. ”
The Register editorial board also shared its thoughts about some of the other candidates in the 2020 field.
Former Vice President Joe Biden: The board said he “far outdistances the field in knowledge of foreign policy and familiarity with world leaders” and he has an “unrivaled experience in knowing how to get legislation passed through Congress. ” But, the board said it had reservations because he lacked a bold agenda, and in particular lacked expertise on income inequality issues.
Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg: The board described him as “a gifted speaker who demonstrates an impressive command of policy nuances and offers refreshing, common-ground approaches” but said his “eight-year tenure of heading a city the size of Davenport” was not enough preparation to be president. The board added: “His relative lack of support among communities of color also raises questions about his ability to unite the country. ”
U. S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar: The board wrote that her candidacy was appealing because she has a “proven record of working across the aisle to get things done. " But it questioned whether she would be bold enough in needed policies.
U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders: While the board wrote that his campaigns for president has benefited the nation by bringing attention to the “rigged” economy it expressed concern about his ability to build consensus and his routine opposition of trade agreements.
Businessman activist Tom Steyer: The board said it questioned whether “another billionaire businessman with no previous government experience (is) the best choice” after Trump.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang: The board said Yang has brought attention to the peril of the coming technological transformation but said his lack of any government experience and the radical nature of his universal basic income plan were drawbacks.
The editorial board also listed U. S. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California as “two voices that are missed. ” Both Democrats campaigned significantly in Iowa, including meeting with the editorial board, but dropped out of the race.
The board did not consider former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, or U. S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii because they have not focused on campaigning in Iowa.

Trump won't fight foreign election hacking. So private companies have to do it.

Texto completo: Journalist on the lousy options for campaign cybersecurity
The tech company Cloudflare announced Jan. 15 that it would now provide cybersecurity resources to political campaigns for free. That news might not seem like it has anything to do with the impeachment drama unfolding on Capitol Hill. Yet both events stem from the same core problem: As president, Donald Trump has failed at his most basic responsibility to protect the 2020 elections from foreign attacks and interference.
-The desperate need for better campaign cybersecurity should be clear just from the past few weeks, if it wasn't already, after reports that Russian hackers were digging around Ukrainian computer servers, possibly searching for dirt on Joe Biden, and that Pete Buttigieg's chief information security officer " the only known, dedicated cybersecurity staffer in the entire Democratic field " had departed, replaced only by an outside contractor.-
And yet, even with growing evidence of systemic vulnerabilities to foreign interference four years after Russia's unprecedented, expensive and expansive attack on the 2016 election, we're still relying on a patchwork of nonprofit and private companies to pitch in and protect us. Despite lots of words from well-meaning officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI, election security remains woefully undermanned and underfunded; former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was reportedly told not to bring up the issue with the president, on the advice of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who allegedly told her that it 'wasn't a great subject.'-
In the face of such high-level inaction and willful blindness, the fact that we need companies like Cloudflare to help defend candidates is a failure. Protecting our democracy shouldn't be the responsibility of civic-minded businesses. We strictly limit corporate involvement in other areas of campaigns: We wouldn't allow Blackwater to 'donate' protective details to candidates, nor would we let Chase 'donate' banking services. Boeing,-Lockheed Martin and Chevrolet aren't allowed to donate special planes, helicopters or armored vehicles to help keep candidates safe as they move about the country.
But after lobbying, the Federal Election Commission changed its rules last year to permit campaigns and candidates to accept discounted cybersecurity services. And no one seems troubled that cybersecurity companies will be able to develop special relationships with campaigns, as candidates entrust their biggest secrets to private firms with policy interests in how the winners will govern.
None of this is meant to slight Cloudflare or to impugn its motives; it's a great company and a critical part of the Internet ecosystem, and I'm friends with some of the firm's leaders. But the fact is that Cloudflare and other companies, including Microsoft, Wickr, Area 1 and Cybrary, needed to step up, and the FEC had to create special rules, because the U.S. government and the political parties are refusing " and don't know how " to do what's necessary to protect candidates and campaigns.-

Easy solutions are rarely as simple as they seem. Some suggest that the Secret Service " which, thanks to its mission of fighting financial crimes, has amazing expertise in cybersecurity " should protect presidential campaigns from hackers, just as it safeguards the top candidates themselves. But the Trump administration's extreme politicization of the Department of Homeland Security surely would make Democratic campaigns wary of accepting such help and granting the deep, unfettered access to email and networks that the Secret Service would need to provide digital protection. And it's not clear how wide a net the perennially underfunded and overworked agency could or should throw around a campaign: Does it protect only the candidate, only an inner circle, or should every Iowa volunteer be surrounded by a digital security blanket?-
On Capitol Hill, where the sergeants-at-arms of the House and the Senate are responsible for protecting the IT networks of lawmakers, well-meaning campaign finance rules legally prevent those officials from helping members of Congress secure their personal cellphones, email accounts or campaign networks " even though such accounts are probably the most valuable targets for hackers. Those same rules require legislators to maintain separate phones and email for official business and campaign business, all but guaranteeing that sensitive conversations occur on nonofficial accounts. When he was in the House, Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) included his Gmail address on his business cards, and it was, after all, John Podesta's personal Gmail account, not a campaign account, that was targeted by Russia in 2016.
The Democratic and Republican national committees, or their respective House and Senate campaign arms, could offer centralized cybersecurity resources. But recent Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee policy changes aim to limit primary challengers' access to such resources, meaning someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who challenged a Democratic incumbent, would have been cut off until at least after winning a primary contest, potentially leaving campaigns on their own until weeks before the general election. Advanced hackers often spend weeks or even months probing a system " and it can take an expert adversary like Russia just 19 minutes to break in. So that security would almost certainly come too late.-
Leaving cybersecurity choices to individual candidates and campaigns, which are often technically unsophisticated and strapped for cash, doesn't seem like the best answer when we're trying to protect the cornerstones of our elections from well-resourced threats by nation-state adversaries. Besides, many candidates don't really understand the threats or the necessary defenses. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a New York Times interview published this month, made clear he's not a typical digital citizen of the 21st century; he said he doesn't have any apps on his phone and didn't appear to know what two-factor authentication is. Instead, as he explained, he relies entirely on a woman in his office named Melissa to know what to do security-wise. Is his campaign prepared to deal with Russian incursions?-
The best security exists at the beginning and continues forever, but most campaigns " particularly new ones " start on a shoestring. It's hard to imagine using scarce dollars to fund bulletproof cybersecurity when candidates might not make it far enough for the investment to pay off. Similarly, campaign infrastructure mostly disappears after Election Day, yet the threat remains just as real; documents stolen from email accounts or file servers in odd-numbered years can be held and released closer to elections. And as 'digital natives' begin to run for office, people who have lived their entire adult lives with the same Facebook account, the same Gmail account, the same iCloud account may find that those are treasure troves for hackers seeking blackmail or embarrassment. (Former congresswoman Katie Hill will surely not be the last officeholder to face a 'revenge porn' scandal, either from a formerly trusted partner or a nation-state hacker.)-

These individual complications and competing agendas make clear that the best cybersecurity isn't done campaign by campaign, but instead is focused on overall deterrence. We need the federal government, starting with the president, to take the strongest possible stance " in the strongest possible language " to make clear to all adversaries that U.S. elections, candidates and campaigns are off-limits. The Trump administration has failed to do this. And in fact, Trump has done the opposite. A key factor in the impeachment proceedings is his call, on the White House lawn last year, for Ukraine and China to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden " making clear that he's fine with foreign governments meddling in domestic politics.
If Ukraine, Russia or China helped dig up dirt on his opponents, Trump would love it. Such foreign interference seems to be an important part of his reelection strategy. This active betrayal of democracy should chill Democrats and Republicans alike. As I've argued in the past, the GOP's willingness to tolerate Trump's inaction is confounding, in part because there's no guarantee that the next nation to attack our democracy will side with Trump or the Republicans. In light of the president's policy toward Iran, for instance, it seems likely that the Islamic republic's accomplished hackers might prefer to help his opponent win. Similarly, China's Ministry of State Security is surely considering that one easy path out of the trade war Trump started would be for a Democrat to win in November.
We can't allow our elections to become proxy battlegrounds, with the Russian GRU aiding the GOP as Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps seeks revenge for Trump's killing of Qasem Soleimani by helping elect Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden. Trump's refusal to acknowledge these stakes is the biggest indictment of his failure to protect our country. And that willful blindness underscores the historic necessity of his impeachment trial.
As the senators sit on the jury, they should all be wondering: What's the most embarrassing secret lurking in their email accounts or their camera rolls " and who's looking for it right now?-

Texto completo: It was yet another epic failure of political punditry. Go back to the early months of Joe Biden's presidential campaign and read what the consultants and commentators were saying about him: His support is just name recognition; he'll fade! He's too old! He's running a zombie campaign! The party has moved left and he's out of touch! He voted for the crime bill!
Almost everybody was bearish on Joe. But now look where we are, weeks from actual voting. If the polls are to be believed, Biden will win Iowa; he'll come in second in New Hampshire; he will easily win Nevada; he will dominate in South Carolina. He's now tied for the lead in California, and he's way ahead in Texas.
I don't know if he'll win the nomination (both he and Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six months ago thought we'd be.
It's the 947th consecutive sign that we in the coastal chattering classes have not cured our insularity problem. It's the 947th case in which we see that every second you spend on Twitter detracts from your knowledge of American politics and that the only cure to this insularity disease is constant travel and interviewing, close attention to state and local data and raw abject humility about the fact that the attitudes and academic degrees that you think make you clever are actually the attitudes and academic degrees that separate you from the real texture of American life.
Biden didn't just luck into this. He and his team grasped six truths:
Understand the year you are running in. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running the same basic campaign they would have run in 2012 or 2016. Biden's campaign is completely focused on the central problem of 2020: that Donald Trump is a steaming hot mess in the middle of national life.
Biden has fixated his campaign on the Trump problem and fighting for the soul of America. Nearly twice as many Democrats say it's more important to beat Trump than to have a candidate with whom they agree on all issues.
Understand your party's core challenge. All around the world parties on the left are losing because they have lost touch with the working class. These parties think they can reconnect with that class by swinging even further left. But Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and Bernie Sanders here are a doctoral student's idea of a working-class candidate, not an actual working person's idea of one.
Biden has criticized his own party for losing touch with this class. He emerged from it, is focusing his attention on it and is winning support from it.
Moderates are still powerful. The Democratic Party is moving left, but about half of Democrats still say they are moderate or conservative. No candidate has ever won a nomination without strong support from these voters, while college-town candidates - Howard Dean, Gary Hart - tend to falter. In every presidential general election that Democrats have won since 1988, they carried moderates by more than 12 percentage points. In every race they have lost, they failed to do that. Biden kept his moderate credentials when many other candidates saw A.O.C. on Twitter and decided to move left.
Many Democrats resent their own elites. There is a quiet tension between Democrats who wield cultural power and those who don't. The former are active on social media and clobber the latter - people who say or write the "wrong" thing.
The non-elites tend to feel judged and looked down on by the self-appointed savior class. "Politically correct" has become the phrase people use to define those who use cultural power to enforce ideological conformity. Seventy percent of Democrats who are not on social media say political correctness is a big problem. These are people silently but vehemently reacting against this social reign of terror. Biden communicates affection, not judgment, acceptance, not expulsion.
Have a better theory of social change. Sanders and Warren imagine they can rally movements of progressive supermajorities to transform American politics. The reality is that if they are elected we'll be stuck with the same 42%-to-42% stagnant political war we have now.
Biden starts with the understanding that we are a closely divided nation. He understands the elemental fact that if you want to pass laws you have to go through Congress. As Damon Linker pointed out recently in The Week, Biden's argument is that a center-left congressional coalition is the best we can do under present circumstances. That's a more realistic theory of change. A beloved legislator like Biden is more likely to transform the political landscape than a down-the-line progressive.
Connection. Connection. Connection. Many candidates pound the podium and lecture at their rallies. It's the big leader onstage and the passionate mass of followers down below. Nobody makes an individual connection as well as Biden. In a time when people feel exhausted, isolated and alienated, a candidate who seems normal and emotionally relatable is going to have a lot of appeal.
The ironic fact is that the candidate who can be vulnerable has a surprising power.

Texto completo: Indonesia
US reporter freed; deportation likely JAKARTA — An American environmental journalist accused of violating the terms of his visa has been freed after three days in jail and is likely to be deported soon, a top Indonesian government minister said. The journalist, Philip Jacobson, 30, who works for the nonprofit news site Mongabay and is known for exposing environmental damage and corporate misconduct, was arrested on the island of Borneo after attending a public meeting between officials and indigenous leaders. Immigration officials said he had been conducting journalistic activities while on a business visa, which was not permitted, and that he faced up to five years in prison. The minister for political, legal, and security affairs met on Friday with the US ambassador and told reporters afterward that the case would be handled as an administrative matter punishable by deportation, not as a crime. (New York Times)
Afghanistan
Killing of teen, father investigated KABUL — The Afghan government said on Saturday that it was investigating the fatal shootings by Afghan soldiers of a girl and her father in Kandahar province, amid complaints by residents that the security forces have for years been accused of extrajudicial killings and other abuses. The most basic details about the girl, named Naza, were conflicting. She was either 10, 13 or 17 years of age, according to different versions by at least three officials. One official said she had been out shepherding a herd of sheep near their home in Shah Wali Kot District in Kandahar when she was shot. Khalil Ahmad Mujahid, a member of Parliament from Kandahar, said she had been in the fields near her home collecting vegetables when the soldiers had opened fire. When her father carried her body to the gates of the army base in the village in southern Afghanistan the next day, he, too, ended up dead, officials said. Officials have remained tight-lipped about even the most basic details, once again raising concerns about a pattern of lack of accountability after Afghan forces have been accused of abuses against civilians during the years-long war. A spokesman for Afghanistan's Defense Ministry said it was looking into the episode and could not provide details. (New York Times)
Iran
Negotiations with US still possible Iran is not ruling out negotiations with the United States even after an American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the country's foreign minister said in an interview released Saturday. Mohammed Javad Zarif told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine that he would “never rule out the possibility that people will change their approach and recognize the realities," in an interview conducted Friday in Tehran.

After berating reporter, Pompeo says she lied

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lashed out Saturday at an NPR reporter who accused him of shouting expletives at her after she asked him in an interview about Ukraine. In a direct and personal attack, Pompeo said the journalist had “lied" to him and he called her conduct “shameful."
NPR said it stood by Mary Louise Kelly's reporting.
Pompeo claimed in a statement that the incident was “another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt" President Trump and his administration. Pompeo, a former CIA director and Republican congressman from Kansas who is one of Trump's closest allies in the Cabinet, asserted, "It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity."
It is extraordinary for a secretary of state to make such a personal attack on a journalist, but he is following the lead of Trump, who has repeatedly derided what he calls “fake news" and ridiculed individual reporters.
In Friday's interview, Pompeo responded testily when Kelly asked him about Ukraine and specifically whether he defended or should have defended Marie Yovanovitch, the US ambassador in Kyiv whose ouster figured in Trump's impeachment.
“I have defended every State Department official," he said. "We've built a great team. The team that works here is doing amazing work around the world. . . . I've defended every single person on this team."
This has been a sensitive point for Pompeo. As a Trump loyalist, he has been publicly silent as the president and his allies have disparaged the nonpartisan career diplomats, including Yovanovitch, who have testified in the impeachment hearings.
After the NPR interview, Kelly said she was taken to Pompeo's private living room, where he shouted at her “for about the same amount of time as the interview itself," using the “F-word" repeatedly. She said he was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.
Pompeo, in his statement, did not deny shouting at Kelly and did not apologize. Instead, he accused her of lying to him when setting up the interview, which he apparently expected would be limited to questions about Iran, and for supposedly agreeing not to discuss the post-interview meeting.
Kelly said Pompeo asked whether she thought Americans cared about Ukraine and if she could find the country on a map.
“I said yes, and he called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing," she said in discussing the encounter on “All Things Considered." “I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away. He said, 'People will hear about this."'

Biden picks up another endorsement in Iowa
MANCHESTER, N.H. — Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa is endorsing former vice president Joe Biden, giving him another prominent backer with just over a week until the state's caucuses.
Axne, a freshman Democrat who unseated a Republican incumbent, hails from the kind of swing district that was key to the party's takeover of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and will be crucial to its continued control.
Biden has now been endorsed by two of Iowa's three Democrats in Congress.

Texto completo: 3M has dramatically boosted production of respiratory face masks in its Chinese factories in response to the sudden rise of a deadly coronavirus in Wuhan, China.
Travelers worldwide armed themselves with respiratory face masks to shield themselves from the virus.
Chinese news agencies reported Friday that 3M had increased production after its plants ran out of stock in at least two locations in China. 3M officials would not confirm that they ran out of masks. The Maplewood-based giant, however, said it is working diligently to meet customers' needs, said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich in an e-mail. 3M makes respiratory protection
products at numerous locations around the world.
"We are working to continue respirator production during the Chinese New Year holiday," she said.
A statement from 3M said the company is working with distributors to meet inventory needs and "end-user demand."
"3M is committed to supporting the public health and governmental response to the coronavirus while maintaining supply to existing customers," the statement said.
So far, the virus has killed at least 41 people in China and infected more than 1,000 worldwide, according to the New York Times.
The United States has confirmed at least two cases, with both patients having returned from China with the virus. One is in Washington state, one in Chicago.
There are two suspected cases in Minnesota and an additional 63 suspected cases elsewhere in the United States, state officials confirmed Friday.
China has now banned travel from 13 of its cities, including Wuhan, which has 11 million residents.
The United States and other nations are aggressively screening travelers from China for fevers and other flulike symptoms that are common to the virus.
3M manufactures a number of products that are frequently used during natural disasters and health care emergencies, including hand sanitizer. Company officials said they did not yet know if hand sanitizer demand has surged as disease control experts race to contain the coronavirus.
St. Paul-based Ecolab, which also makes hand sanitizers as well as disinfectants and food safety chemicals, is preparing for beefed-up demand amid the latest outbreak, officials said Friday.
Ecolab's health care team has identified specific products and is now bracing to increase production, said Ecolab spokesman Roman Blahoski.
"We expect to see an increase in demand for many of our [cleaning] solutions, including disinfectant and sanitizing products," he said. "We are making sure that customers know that these products are available and can be used" to effectively kill the virus.

'Go to the police'; Perez recalls Sciorra's anguish

Texto completo: Prosecution witness Rosie Perez testified in chilling detail Friday about the phone call when her sobbing friend Annabella Sciorra finally identified Hollywood deal-maker Harvey Weinstein as the man who violently raped her just months before.
"She told me that it was in fact Harvey Weinstein," Perez declared as the clearly annoyed defendant fiercely chewed a wad of gum at the defense table. "[She said] he pushed his way through the door, and she was crying and saying, 'I tried to fight back. I tried, I tried!'
"And then she said that she ended up in the bedroom with her hands pinned over her head and that he raped her ... She swore me not to tell anyone, and I said, 'You should go to the police.' "
But Sciorra did not, instead waiting more than a quarter-century before testifying Thursday against accused serial sexual predator Weinstein. The Oscar-winning producer faces a potential life sentence if convicted of the top count in his trial for sexually abusing two New York women.
Perez told the Manhattan jury of seven men and five women that she "put two and two together" as Sciorra spoke from London about the wintry night of her assault a few months prior. Sciorra was saying that she was worried that an unspecified man "was harassing her ... she was afraid he was going to get her."
Perez said she too heard a rumor that Weinstein was stalking Sciorra, with the alleged victim bursting into tears.
"She started screaming, 'Oh my God! Oh my God!' and she started crying hysterically," recounted Perez. "That's when she started telling me detailed things about the rape ... and she was very, very very distraught."
Defense attorney Damon Cheronis, on cross-examination, suggested Perez's account of what happened hewed a little too closely to Sciorra's testimony, although the "Do The Right Thing" actress insisted the two never discussed the rape after the two initial phone calls in 1993-94.
Perez recalled how Sciorra first told her what happened "in a very strange whisper of a voice" without ever mentioning Weinstein shortly after the alleged rape inside the actress' Manhattan apartment.
Later, as her testimony wound down, Perez took note of Weinstein's dark demeanor.
"I suspect Harvey Weinstein is very angry on account of how hard he's chewing that gum," she said. "Looks tense."
Perez testified after the defense seemed to imply Sciorra had lied one day earlier during her five hours on the witness stand - although defense lawyer Arthur Aidala denied that was the case.
"The theory is that there was no fear, and obviously no force, and that everything was consensual," said Aidala. "Everything that happened was 100% consensual."
Earlier in the day, a private eye testified how Weinstein e-mailed him a "red flag list" with dozens of names to investigate as possible sources for reporters digging into allegations of his long-rumored aberrant sexual behavior. Alleged Weinstein rape victims Sciorra and Rose McGowan both made the hit list, said witness Sam Anson.
The name of actress Sciorra was highlighted in red, according to Anson.
The investigator recounted an August 2017 phone call from an "agitated, stressed, not happy" Weinstein in the weeks before The New York Times and The New Yorker magazine exposed his alleged sexual assaults on prominent women.
"Generally, Mr. Weinstein was concerned the people on the list might be providing information about him to journalists," said Anson, adding that he never investigated anyone in the end.
Day three of the trial began with a psychiatrist, called by prosecutors, explaining that most rape victims know their attackers and often hide the horrifying details from others.
Dr. Barbara Ziv offered her expert take on the popularly accepted myths surrounding rapes and other sex crimes.

Texto completo: Here's good news: The state of Florida is no longer in the climate-change denier club.
Southern coastal states are lining up for $16 billion of federal money to pay for resiliency projects to address sea-level rise, but only one state – that's right, Florida – is using the words "climate change" in its application to the feds, according to a Jan. 21 front-page New York Times article.
Louisiana, Texas and South Carolina state officials engaged in "linguistic acrobatics," to avoid using the term, according to the Times. It wasn't so long ago that such acrobatics were standard operating procedure in Florida, too, under former governor and now U.S. Sen. Rick Scott.
But no longer.
"Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to complicate the extent and threat of the hazards," wrote Florida state officials as they made their case for the state's fair share of the resiliency funding.
For people passionate about the issue, this could seem a baby step forward.
But make no mistake, real progress has occurred in Florida. Our state regulators and planners now have permission to plan for climate change without jeopardizing their careers if they do so. People can now talk freely to their representatives without having to fear that their climate concerns are disregarded.
One small example: Last week, a recently formed coalition of civic groups in Jacksonville voted to change its name to the Jacksonville Resiliency and Climate Change Coalition, from simply the Resiliency Coalition. The group had kept climate change out of its name for largely political considerations in this conservative region of Florida.
The words we use matter. What we call ourselves matters. It's progress that people now feel comfortable openly talking about climate change.
Time to raise the bar: Climate crisis, anyone?
John Burr has more than 30 years experience as an editor and reporter in Northeast Florida, and is a member of the Jacksonville chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby.
"The Invading Sea" is the opinion arm of the Florida Climate Reporting Network, a collaborative of news organizations across the state focusing on the threats posed by the warming climate.

CALIFORNIA, TEXAS TEXTBOOKS TELL THE TALE OF TWO AMERICAS

Texto completo: When former New York senator and scholar Daniel Patrick Moynihan died in 2003, he was celebrated for his hugely productive careers in both politics and academia, and admired for his wit. His aphorism - "You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts." - was often cited.
But as the 21st century careens along, Moynihan's premise has taken a beating. Technology has made it easier for ideologues to only get information that reinforces their existing views. Moynihan's assumption that people could carry on arguments over policy issues while agreeing on basic facts has been obliterated.
The most prominent examples: Those on the left like to cite the skepticism many conservatives have about climate change, which runs counter to the views of the vast majority of scientists. And those on the right often bring up the warnings many progressives make about the risks of genetically modified food, which also are contrary to the views of the vast majority of scientists.
This partisan framing goes far beyond such high-profile issues. Every day, Americans can watch TV shows, check out websites or listen to podcasts that present not just different opinions but different factual frameworks. And as a deeply troubling recent story in The New York Times pointed out, this fact shading is now common in school textbooks.
The New York Times analyzed eight of the most popular history textbooks used in both California and Texas public schools - textbooks with the same authors and same publishers. In both states, laws have been passed and teaching standards set that reflect the values of state lawmakers and members of the state board of education. As a result, there are now basic differences in how the history books in America's two most populous states deal with such profound issues as race and the economy.
In discussions of the "white flight" phenomenon from the 1950s and 1960s in which millions of white Americans moved from big cities to more homogenous suburbs, the California history textbook published by McGraw-Hill says some of these Americans were "driven by a desire to get away from more culturally diverse neighborhoods" - i.e., racism. The Texas textbook states that some of these Americans "wished to escape the crime and congestion of the city" - also loaded language.
In discussions of capitalism, The New York Times noted California textbooks "sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally." Those in Texas celebrate the wealth-creating free-market economy.
The same differences are apparent in how the textbooks deal with everything from gun rights and the Harlem Renaissance to immigration and gender. In California, The New York Times noted, education bureaucrats persuaded one textbook publisher to not use the word "massacre" to describe how 19th-century Native Americans responded to white settlers. In Texas, they got another publisher to emphasize religious values of America's founders.
The sad news is there is little reason to hope that this front in America's ongoing culture wars is going to change. A survey of 8,000 Americans released in 2018 by researchers at YouGov and the More in Common civics group found that while most Americans are generally centrist, 14% of residents are "starkly polarized" people on the left and right who tend to "dominate public debate in the digital age."
Such Californians and Texans likely love their state officials putting their thumbs on the scales in the teaching of history. But the rest of us should fear this as one more sign of the clout of a relative handful of Americans who reject ideas that don't fit in with their worldview, facts be damned or shaded.
American history has long been framed by those who write it. That's clearer the more divided we get.

Texto completo: Privacy doomsayers have always said that the failure to regulate surveillance technology would result in the end of anonymity. But we didn’t realize doom might come this soon.
The New York Times reports on a facial recognition tool that hasn’t made the news before — because it’s not from a Silicon Valley luminary with a big public footprint, such as Amazon or Google, but rather a tiny and secretive startup called Clearview AI whose impact is as high as its profile is low. More than 600 law enforcement agencies use the company’s tool, which depends on a database of more than 3 billion images gathered from millions of websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.
The facial recognition searches authorities conduct today are usually restricted to mug shots or driver’s license photos, and there are serious concerns even about those. Now, that database has expanded exponentially, and it could envelop any American whose face has ever appeared publicly on the Internet. Clearview’s results return not only a name but also phone numbers, addresses and more. The risks are familiar but amplified many times over.
There’s the possibility of false matches, especially because Clearview’s algorithm has never been tested by an outside authority. There’s the risk of a hack exposing a trove of human beings converted into identifiable lines of code. And, of course, there’s the risk of abuse - police at a protest, for example, training the tool on every participant, or a private buyer using it to stalk an ex-lover.
Clearview has pitched its product to entities with less credibility than law enforcement, including a professed “pro-white” Republican congressional candidate for “extreme opposition research.” The company can even monitor clients’ searches, and evidently it does: How else did Clearview know to flag the Times reporter’s face and display no matches after she asked officers to run her through the app? (A “software bug,” the founder replied.)
The case underscores with greater vigor than ever the need for restrictions on facial recognition technology. But putting limits on what the police or private businesses can do with a tool such as Clearview’s won’t stop bad actors from breaking them. There also need to be limits on whether a tool such as Clearview’s can exist in this country in the first place.
Top platforms’ policies generally prohibit the sort of data-scraping Clearview has engaged in, but it’s difficult for a company to protect information that’s on the open Web. Courts have also ruled against platforms when they have tried to go after scrapers under existing copyright or computer fraud law — and understably, as too-onerous restrictions could hurt journalists and public-interest groups.
Privacy legislation is a more promising area for action, to prevent third parties including Clearview from assembling databases such as these in the first place, whether they’re filled with faces or location records or credit scores. That will take exactly the robust federal framework Congress has so far failed to provide, and a government that’s ready to enforce it.

Michael Bloomberg has burrowed his way under President Trump's skin

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg may have entered the Democratic race too late to make a showing in the early primary states, but he can already claim one victory: baiting President Trump into a very public war of words.
Since Bloomberg’s team announced it was buying a 60-second Super Bowl ad spot to “get under Trump’s skin” two weeks ago, Trump has launched a string of Twitter broadsides against the former New York mayor, and his campaign has bought its own Super Bowl ad — valued at $10 million.
The result is two wealthy men, both of whom rose to prominence in Manhattan by slapping their names on their business empires, slugging it out in classic New York style. So where Trump has dismissed Bloomberg as a “clown” and made fun of his short stature, the Democrat targeted Trump where it hurts most, questioning his wealth.
“Who’s the other one?” was his response when asked about the prospect of two billionaires going head-to-head in the election.
Tweet
Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran political operative in New York, said Bloomberg, worth an estimated $60 billion, according to Forbes, was everything Trump, with his estimated $3 billion fortune, wanted to be.
“Mike Bloomberg is a real billionaire. He’s put together a real team, a real operation, and he’s built it fast,” he said. “There is no doubt he has got under the president’s skin. Trump is scared that Bloomberg could be the real thing.”
Bloomberg’s campaign says it is no accident.
When it revealed its Super Bowl buy, Bloomberg spokesman Michael Frazier told the New York Times, “The biggest point is getting under Trump’s skin.”
When Bloomberg announced his run, he bought ad time in the West Palm Beach, Florida, media market so that the viewer-in-chief would see his message during his time at Mar-a-Lago.
And this week, aides chose Trump’s favorite morning news show to unveil another a new anti-Trump ad. It meant viewers of Fox and Friends were the first to see a provocative clip about the “chaos” of an administration led by an “out of control president.” The ad is based on a new book, A Very Stable Genius, which describes how Trump verbally abused senior military officers during a Pentagon briefing in 2017.
The response came in short order — in the form of a presidential tweet deploying Trump’s favored nickname for his rival.
“Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is,” he wrote.
The attention does not reflect Bloomberg’s standing in the Democratic race, where he is still polling in single digits. However, he is spending big. Data from Advertising Analytics suggests he has spent almost a quarter of a billion dollars on commercials since announcing his run in November, far more than any of his rivals for the Democratic nomination.

Des Moines Register snubs Bernie Sanders amid Iowa surge, backs Warren for Democratic nod

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders has missed out on the Des Moines Register's endorsement in two consecutive election cycles despite a late surge in Iowa ahead of the Feb. 3 kickoff caucuses.
The newspaper announced late Saturday its editorial board was backing Elizabeth Warren, 70, in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, taking a dig at the Vermont senator, 78, in the process.
"With Warren, the Oval Office will be occupied by someone who has made rebuilding the middle class her life’s work," the board wrote of the Massachusetts senator.
The outlet, however, qualified its endorsement.
"Some of her ideas for 'big, structural change' go too far. This board could not endorse the wholesale overhaul of corporate governance or cumulative levels of taxation she proposes. While the board has long supported single-payer health insurance, it believes a gradual transition is the more realistic approach. But Warren is pushing in the right direction," it said.
The New York Times this week broke with precedent and declined to pick one candidate to back. Instead, the newspaper chose moderately center-left Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 59, and liberal firebrand Warren, overlooking the two front-runners in the race: former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, and Sanders, 78.
Yet Biden and Sanders may consider themselves lucky. Democratic Des Moines Register endorsees have a dismal record when it comes to winning the state's caucuses and clinching the party's nomination.
In 1988, the newspaper backed then-Illinois Sen. Paul Simon before the horn-rimmed glasses and bow-tie-wearing lawmaker lost in Iowa to Missouri Rep. Dick Gephardt. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis claimed the Democratic nomination that year.
Similarly, retired professional basketball player and New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley earned the outlet's support in 2000 before former Vice President Al Gore secured the most delegates in Iowa and the party's nod. Prior to admitting he had a love child with a staffer in the 2008 cycle, North Carolina Sen. John Edwards had the same experience with Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry in 2004.
Hillary Clinton was also endorsed by the Des Moines Register in 2008 and 2016. While she emerged victorious from the caucuses and became the party's standard-bearer in 2016 over Sanders, she lost both honors to future President Barack Obama in 2008.
With a little more than a week before the opening caucuses, less than 1 percentage point separates Biden and Sanders in Iowa, according to polling averages compiled by RealClearPolitics.
Yet in a slew of recent polls fielded in the state, the former Vermont congressman and mayor of Burlington has demonstrated leads on the rest of the White House hopefuls.
Earlier in January, he had a narrow advantage of 3 percentage points over closest rival Warren in the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll, considered to the gold-standard survey in Iowa. Then, on Saturday morning, the New York Times/Siena College poll had him at 7 percentage points ahead of second-most popular candidate former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, which was outside the margin of error.

'Do everything you can': Sanders rallies supporters as he surpasses Biden and Buttigieg in new Iowa poll

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is urging his supporters not to become complacent after a new poll finds him with a wide lead on the rest of the Democratic presidential pack a week out from the Iowa caucuses.
"We’ve got a long way to go. It’s going to be a tough fight and we can't take anything for granted. Knock on doors. Make phone calls. Do everything you can," Sanders, 78, tweeted.
Tweet
The Vermont senator, who suffered a heart attack last year, is the No. 1 pick for the 2020 Democratic nomination for a quarter of likely caucusgoers, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday. That support marks a jump of 6 percentage points for him since the survey was last conducted in October.
Pete Buttigieg, 38, is Sanders's closest rival as the first choice for 18% of Iowa Democrats likely to caucus on Feb. 3. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is followed by former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, who was the preferred candidate for 17% of those polled. Their share of the vote remains exactly the same compared to the fall survey.
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren, Sanders's ideological ally, has hemorrhaged support, dropping from 22% in October to 15% as White House hopefuls make their closing arguments to Democrats in the first-in-the-nation state. The Massachusetts senator, 70, topped the poll last time it was fielded, but she has struggled to regain momentum after she was confronted regarding her plan to fund her vision of "Medicare for all."
Although Sanders is experiencing a late surge in Iowa, finishing first in the gold-standard Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll earlier in January, Saturday's survey found 55% of Iowa Democrats wanted a standard-bearer “more moderate than most Democrats" in comparison to 38% who wished for one who was “more liberal than most Democrats," though 40% of respondents could still change their mind.
Researchers for the New York Times and Siena College polled 584 Democratic likely caucusgoers between Jan. 20 to Jan. 23. Its findings have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.

Texto completo: It was yet another epic failure of political punditry. Go back to the early months of Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and read what the consultants and commentators were saying about him: His support is just name recognition; he’ll fade! He’s too old! He’s running a zombie campaign! The party has moved left and he’s out of touch! He voted for the crime bill!
Almost everybody was bearish on Joe. But now look where we are, weeks from actual voting. If the polls are to be believed, Biden will win Iowa; he’ll come in second in New Hampshire; he will easily win Nevada; he will dominate in South Carolina. He’s now tied for the lead in California, and he’s way ahead in Texas.
I don’t know if he’ll win the nomination (both he and Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six months ago thought we’d be.
It’s the 947th consecutive sign that we in the coastal chattering classes have not cured our insularity problem. It’s the 947th case in which we see that every second you spend on Twitter detracts from your knowledge of American politics and that the only cure to this insularity disease is constant travel and interviewing, close attention to state and local data and raw abject humility about the fact that the attitudes and academic degrees that you think make you clever are actually the attitudes and academic degrees that separate you from the real texture of American life.
Biden didn’t just luck into this. He and his team grasped six truths:
Understand the year you are running in. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running the same basic campaign they would have run in 2012 or 2016. Biden’s campaign is completely focused on the central problem of 2020: that Donald Trump is a steaming hot mess in the middle of national life.
Biden has fixated his campaign on the Trump problem and fighting for the soul of America. Nearly twice as many Democrats say it’s more important to beat Trump than to have a candidate with whom they agree on all issues.
Understand your party’s core challenge. All around the world parties on the left are losing because they have lost touch with the working class. These parties think they can reconnect with that class by swinging even further left. But Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and Bernie Sanders here are a doctoral student’s idea of a working-class candidate, not an actual working person’s idea of one.
Biden has criticized his own party for losing touch with this class. He emerged from it, is focusing his attention on it and is winning support from it.
Moderates are still powerful. The Democratic Party is moving left, but about half of Democrats still say they are moderate or conservative. No candidate has ever won a nomination without strong support from these voters, while college-town candidates — Howard Dean, Gary Hart — tend to falter. In every presidential general election that Democrats have won since 1988, they carried moderates by more than 12 percentage points. In every race they have lost, they failed to do that. Biden kept his moderate credentials when many other candidates saw A.O.C. on Twitter and decided to move left.
Many Democrats resent their own elites. There is a quiet tension between Democrats who wield cultural power and those who don’t. The former are active on social media and clobber the latter — people who say or write the “wrong” thing.
The non-elites tend to feel judged and looked down on by the self-appointed savior class. “Politically correct” has become the phrase people use to define those who use cultural power to enforce ideological conformity. Seventy percent of Democrats who are not on social media say political correctness is a big problem. These are people silently but vehemently reacting against this social reign of terror. Biden communicates affection, not judgment, acceptance, not expulsion.
Have a better theory of social change. Sanders and Warren imagine they can rally movements of progressive supermajorities to transform American politics. The reality is that if they are elected we’ll be stuck with the same 42%-to-42% stagnant political war we have now.
Biden starts with the understanding that we are a closely divided nation. He understands the elemental fact that if you want to pass laws you have to go through Congress. As Damon Linker pointed out recently in The Week, Biden’s argument is that a center-left congressional coalition is the best we can do under present circumstances. That’s a more realistic theory of change. A beloved legislator like Biden is more likely to transform the political landscape than a down-the-line progressive.
Connection. Connection. Connection. Many candidates pound the podium and lecture at their rallies. It’s the big leader onstage and the passionate mass of followers down below. Nobody makes an individual connection as well as Biden. In a time when people feel exhausted, isolated and alienated, a candidate who seems normal and emotionally relatable is going to have a lot of appeal.
The ironic fact is that the candidate who can be vulnerable has a surprising power.

Tragedia en Chinatown de Nueva York en víspera de celebrar el nuevo año; alcalde ofrece ayuda

Texto completo: Unos 85,000 artefactos que cuentan la historia de la migración china a EEUU pueden haberse perdido en un voraz incendio que desde el jueves ha afectado Chinatown, en el Bajo Manhattan, donde la comunidad se apresta a celebrar el nuevo año lunar este sábado, su mayor fiesta.
El incendio comenzó el jueves por la noche y atravesó un edificio que albergaba la mayor parte de la colección del Museo de China en EEUU (MOCA).
Nancy Yao Maasbach, presidente del museo, le dijo a The New York Times que la mayoría de los miles de artículos históricos y artísticos de su colección probablemente se perdieron. Son piezas que datan de la Ley de Exclusión de China de 1882.
Un portavoz del Departamento de Bomberos dijo anoche que el incendio aún no estaba controlado, 24 horas después de que fue reportado, destacó Pix11.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio visitó la zona ayer y prometió reconstruir el edificio de 5 pisos destruido en el devastador incendio. Allí funciona el museo y otros centros comunitarios.
“El alcalde nos dio el compromiso de que este edificio será reconstruido”, dijo la concejal Margaret Chin.
La ubicación en 70 Mulberry Street fue una escuela durante décadas. Hoy, los inmigrantes chinos aprenden inglés y reciben capacitación laboral en las aulas. También sirven almuerzo para personas mayores. Y las tropas de baile, clave para la celebración de este fin de semana, ensayan allí sus rutinas.
Ocho bomberos sufrieron heridas leves luchando contra las llamas. Un hombre sacado del 5to piso está en condición seria, pero estable.
La causa del incendio aún se desconoce.

Texto completo: As the U. S. closed its consulate in Wuhan and prepared to extract all its diplomats, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Saturday of a "grave situation" in the rapid spread of the coronavirus that has claimed 56 lives.
The virus, which broke out in Wuhan last month, has infected at least 1,975 people in at least 29 provinces and cities and killed 56 people in China, according to the National Health Commission.
The figures reported Sunday morning cover the previous 24 hours and mark an increase of 15 deaths and 688 cases.
The government also reported five cases in Hong Kong, two in Macao and three in Taiwan. Small numbers of cases have been found in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the U. S. , Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia.
Among the victims is Liang Wudong, a 62-year-old doctor at Hubei Xinhua Hospital who died Saturday after treating patients in Wuhan, according to the state-run Global Television Network.
A hospital in Toronto confirmed Saturday that it is treating a patient with the deadly virus, Canada’s first.
A second case in the U. S. was confirmed Friday in Chicago, along with three cases in France. There have been no deaths outside of China.
The U. S. State Department arranged a charter flight for Tuesday to bring out all its diplomats and other U. S. citizens after temporarily closing the Wuhan consulate, the Associated Press reported. A notice Sunday from the embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport U. S. citizens on the flight that will proceed directly to San Francisco.
The reports followed a State Department notice on its website that all essential personnel had been ordered to leave the city of 11 million.
'Everything now is experimental. ': Here's how doctors are treating coronavirus
Xi addressed the issue Saturday at a special Communist party meeting where he called for stepped up moves to tackle the accelerating crisis.
“Confronted with the grave situation of this accelerating spread of pneumonia from infections with the novel coronavirus, we must step up the centralized and united leadership under the party central” leadership, Xi said.
A report issued from the meeting said that Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, "must make containment and control of the epidemic its top most priority, adopting even stricter measures to prevent it expanding within and spreading outward. ”
China has already halted all train, plane and other transportation links to the city, which has ordered a ban on all downtown vehicle traffic beginning at midnight Saturday, state media reported.
Only authorized vehicles to carry supplies and for other needs would be permitted after that, the reports said.
The city said it will assign 6,000 taxis to different neighborhoods, under the management of local resident committees, to help people get around if they need to, the state-owned English-language China Daily newspaper said.
Wuhan outbreak: Something far deadlier than the coronavirus lurks near you, right here in America
Elsewhere, the latest U. S. victim, a Chicago woman, returned Jan. 13 from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and began experiencing symptoms a few days after arriving home, said Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.
The 60-year-old woman called her doctor after symptoms arose. She was treated at St. Alexius in Hoffman Estates and placed in isolation, health officials said. Further testing confirmed the virus.
Arwady said the woman is "clinically doing well and in stable condition. " She did not have extended contact with anyone outside of her home, attend a large public gathering or use public transportation, Arwady said.
The woman was not symptomatic while flying, and Arwady told reporters at a Chicago news conference on Friday, "The CDC does not believe that, in the time before symptoms develop, the patients are able to be contagious. "
In Paris, the lead doctor treating two hospital patients for the new virus said Saturday that the illness appears less serious than comparable outbreaks of the past and that the chance of a European epidemic appears weak at this stage.
French officials on Friday reported three confirmed cases of the newly identified coronavirus in France, the first ones in Europe. The third patient is at a hospital in Bordeaux.
Dr. Yazdan Yazdanpaneh, a leading French expert who heads Bichat’s infectious diseases unit, said that cases imported from China were “not a surprise” and that France had prepared, including by developing a test that provides rapid results for suspected cases.
While most cases have centered in China, an increasing number of cases have been confirmed in other places, including South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Australia and Malaysia reported their first cases Saturday and Japan reported its third.
As the crisis increased, local Chinese authorities rushed to build a 1,000-bed hospital in six days to treat the growing number of patients. Authorities announced Saturday that 658 patients were being treated for the virus and 57 were critically ill, Reuters reports.
The state-run Global Television Network reported Saturday that the health commission was sending six groups of 1,230 medical staff to Wuhan, In addition, 450 military doctors, some with experience fighting the SARS and Ebola viruses, were sent to the city Friday.
The Xinhua news agency reported that additional medical supplies were being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits and 110,000 pairs of gloves from the central medical reserves as well as masks and goggles.
The virus has caused major public upheaval, with the government shutting down public transportation for roughly 36 million people in 13 cities in central China and major cities canceling events tied to the Lunar New Year celebration, a busy time for travel.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said all direct flights and trains form Wuhan would be blocked and that all schools would be closed in the city until Feb. 17.
Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland and sections of the Great Wall have also closed.
Rapidly-spreading respiratory virus: Drugmakers are hustling to make a coronavirus vaccine
What is coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to pneumonia. Common signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.
Health officials said the virus, which probably spreads through tiny droplets when a person coughs or sneezes, is low-risk. Officials urged people to take the usual cold and flu season precaution: frequent hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing and staying home when you don't feel well.
"These illnesses can pop up anywhere," said Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. "This is a dynamic situation that can dramatically change from day to day. "
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Many of the initial cases were linked to a seafood and meat market in Wuhan. Chinese health officials, which first reported the cases last month, said human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.

Texto completo: Yes, a woman can be elected president of the United States. It's time to put that non-issue behind us.
As Bernie Sanders pointed out in the Democratic debate in Iowa Jan. 14, "Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes."
Everywhere else, that would have been enough. Regrettably, the United States is burdened with an anachronism called the Electoral College, reflecting the mistrust of small states for large ones.
Just 77,000 more votes in three key states made the difference between a President Clinton and a President Trump four years ago; between having a First Man or a First Lady in the White House.
It used to be said that a Roman Catholic couldn't be elected president. Then John F. Kennedy was.
Divorce was assumed to be a disqualification. Ronald Reagan disproved that. Race was the next frontier. Then Barack Obama was elected.
In the current campaign, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a formidable contender. She'd be even stronger if she weren't contending with Sanders for the same voters. She scored points in the Des Moines debate by observing that the men on the stage had collectively lost 10 elections while she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were undefeated.
That Klobuchar remains in a dwindling field reflects her potential as the moderate alternative to Sanders or Warren if Joe Biden doesn't do well in the early caucus and primary states.
Male machismo and misogyny are hardly unique to the United States. Yet 59 other nations, spanning the world and every region and ethnicity, have had women as heads of government. Why hasn't it happened here?
One reason is that it took time to break the glass ceilings in Congress, state capitals and the vice presidency, which are the traditional proving grounds for presidential prospects.
Since women were enfranchised 101 years ago, only five Democratic women and two Republicans have attained enough political exposure and stature to be taken seriously as candidates in the two major parties. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was the first, opposing Barry Goldwater for the 1964 GOP nomination. Clinton gave Obama strong competition in 2008 before winning the nomination eight years later.
The Democratic debates should have put to rest the gender issue. As New York Times columnist Frank Bruni observed, questions could also be raised over age — Biden is 77 and Sanders is 78 — and over Pete Buttigieg's identity as a gay man with a male spouse.
"Doesn't that make them risky nominees in their own ways?" Bruni wrote. "If Warren and Klobuchar were less polite and restrained, they might have said so last night. Instead they just turned in debate performances that showed just how commanding women are."
So, can a woman be elected president?
Yes.
So can a man.
There is no material difference.
What really matters is who is qualified, competent and trustworthy.

Texto completo: Over the first week of November, the police in San Francisco and New York responded to a series of telephone calls claiming that hostages were being held in the homes of Adam Mosseri, a senior Facebook executive.
The calls appeared to be coming from inside the homes.
Officers arrived in force and barricaded the streets outside. Twice.
But after tense, hourslong standoffs, they realized the calls were hoaxes. There were no hostages, and no one in the homes had called the police.
Mosseri is one of a number of tech executives who have been targeted recently in so-called swatting incidents. Swatting is online lingo used to describe when people call the police with false reports of a violent crime of some sort inside a home, hoping to persuade them to send a SWAT team.
These episodes have become more common in communities rich with tech companies and their billionaire executives, like the Bay Area and Seattle, according to six police departments contacted by The New York Times.
Exact numbers are unclear, police say, because there is no central repository of information for these sorts of attacks.
But as online discourse has become more combative and more personal, some in the industry aren't surprised that tech executives -- the people who decide what is posted on social media and who is barred from it -- have become regular targets.
Swattings have spiked at Facebook in particular, according to local police departments and security officials at the company, which in recent years has cracked down on false accounts, threatening language and other types of content that violates its rules. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the attacks.
Mosseri declined to comment, and a Facebook spokesman, Anthony Harrison, said in a statement that "because these things deal with security matters and our employees, we are unable to comment."
The attacks have been aided by forums that have sprung up both on the public internet and on the camouflaged sites of the so-called dark web. These forums name thousands of people, from high-ranking executives to their extended families, who could be targets, providing cellphone numbers, home addresses and other information. Some even discuss techniques that can be used -- like cheap, online technology that can spoof a phone number and make the police believe a 911 call is coming from a target's home.
In the eight months since one online forum was started, nearly 3,000 people have joined.
"Who should we do next?" read one message on the forum last month. The responses included gun emojis -- the symbol, in swatting forums, for an attack in which the police were successfully called to the target's home. Many of the responses were laced with profanity, as well as suggestions for ex-girlfriends who should be swatted.
One forum names at least two dozen Facebook employees as potential targets. They range from executives to product engineers. Some forum participants said that they had been barred from Facebook or Instagram, and that Facebook employees were fair game because they "think they are god."
Swatting started in the combative world of online gaming. It was a way to terrorize someone more famous, get even with a rival or retaliate against someone with different political views.
Provoking a heavily armed police response presents obvious risks. Last year, a 26-year-old California man was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for calling in dozens of fake emergency calls, including one that led to the fatal police shooting of Andrew Finch, a Kansas resident.

Texto completo: HOA's are entitled to have and enforce certain rules. But shouldn't they also be expected to show some compassion for a tragically orphaned teen? ("HOA wants to kick orphaned teen out of grandparents' house," Jan. 15).
Would they force him to live on the streets? Or perhaps worse, be sentenced to years in the foster care system?
I wonder if any HOA board member would force his own grandchild out of the only family home left to him!

Not another stadium? Thank you for reporting on the Akimel 7 development project earlier this week. I was surprised to learn that tax credits are going to a project that includes plans for a new professional sports arena.
The article hints that the new arena may lure the Coyotes or Diamondbacks to the East Valley. That move would leave a vacant stadium downtown or in Glendale.
Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum is a near-vacant arena that is both close to downtown and on the west side. Since we already have a near-vacant stadium serving those areas, tax incentives should not be used to create another.

Classless leader in high-class city I'm a proud resident of Scottsdale, and we are touted as a high-class city. On the other hand, it's confounding why we continue to elect a low-class politician like Jay Lawrence — an admitted bigot, and purveyor of conspiracies?
Seems to me to be very low standards for an electorate I know is well educated and looking for the best for our city and state.

Virtue signaling at APS It's wonderful that APS plans on becoming carbon free by 2050 (even though they admit the technology to do that doesn't exist). However, APS's goal will be meaningless virtue signaling unless APS and the rest of us become China Free.
China is the worst climate criminal and, as the New York Times recently reported, is growing its coal-burning, climate changing CO2 footprint at home and abroad.
As long as APS and the rest of us keep buying products produced by China or unless China stops its evil ways (don't count on that), Arizona and America won't be carbon free.

What would Flake and McCain do? What if Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain were still our representatives during Trump's Senate impeachment trial? What would we Arizonans be facing?
They both butted heads with the president and perhaps would have sided with the facts instead of ignoring the truth. Nixon resigned not long after he'd lost the support of Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater and Rep. John Rhodes.
Country over party is sadly no more.

Texto completo: "All I can say is that the case has been settled."
Ken Norwick
Attorney for the Kauffmann estate
If the lawsuit from the estate of the late movie critic Stanley Kauffmann against the Rochester Institute of Technology were a film, Kauffmann likely would have panned it.
Sure, there were some intriguing characters — including a serial plagiarist who duped a college press — and some twists and turns, with the lawsuit once killed (or, in legal terms, dismissed) by a judge, only to be raised from the dead by an appellate court. Imagine Shattered Glass meets Night of the Living Dead.
The denouement, however, would surely get mixed reviews — especially were the critic the occasionally droll but always trenchant Kauffman.
In short, the federal copyright lawsuit settled this month, and no one is saying on what terms, whether there was money involved, and, if the latter, how much. The Sopranos ended with more clarity.
"All I can say is that the case has been settled," Ken Norwick, the attorney for the Kauffmann estate, said in an email. RIT spokeswoman Ellen Rosen also declined comment.
Kauffmann, who died in 2013, was a film critic for The New Republic for 50 years. He was a respected contrarian who rarely fell into the fold with his fellow cinephile scribes. (As The New York Times noted upon Kauffmann's death, he called Casablanca "a slushy romance.")
In 2017 Kauffmann's estate sued the college and RIT Press, which had published a volume of Kauffmann's writings. That book, The Millennial Critic: Stanley Kauffmann on Film 1999 - 2009, was edited by Robert "Bert" Cardullo, himself a former film critic and a collegiate teacher of criticism.
Cardullo, who turned out to have a history of plagiarism, did not have permission from the estate to sell or publish the essays, the 2017 lawsuit claimed. RIT Press, after learning of possible problems, halted publication of the book and tried to recall copies that had been sold.
In 2018, a federal judge tossed out the lawsuit, ruling that The New Republic, and not the Kauffmann estate, owned the rights to the reviews and essays. Last year, a federal appellate court determined that the judge's ruling was in error, and the lawsuit was revived.
Earlier this month, the lawsuit quietly settled — with, to date, no public record of the terms of the resolution.
So, since the legal imbroglio has provided no resolution for public access, let's instead end with some of Kauffmann's more controversial takes from his time at The New Republic:
On the original Star Wars: "About the dialogue there's nothing to be said. In fact the dialogue itself can hardly be said: it sticks in the actors' mouths like peanut butter."
On Forrest Gump: "I can't see how people with low I.Q.s or those who love them are in any way comforted by all this hogwash. I can easily see how such people might be offended by its smug unreality."
On Jaws: "The only performer worth mentioning is Robert Shaw as the old pro and I mention him only to hope that he is getting rich. This good actor certainly ought to get something out of all the non-acting he's doing these days."

Why? Because very soon, the American Library Association will announce the Youth Media Awards. View the winners live on Monday, Jan. 27, starting at 6 a.m. Arizona time at ala.unikron.com
The ALA Youth Media Awards honors the year's best original and creative work in children's literature, including the prestigious Newbery, Caldecott, Printz and Coretta Scott King awards.
To make the 2020 decisions, committees composed of librarians and other literature and media experts spent hours reading, reviewing, and discussing books. They were not alone! A quick internet search displayed numerous hearty deliberations. Everyone from teachers to parents to booksellers had opinions.
Oh, but what about children? Certainly, they have opinions. Perhaps surprisingly, they are NOT a part of the decision making process. So, before the announcements are made, let's review criteria for the two oldest awards: The John Newbery and the Randolph J. Caldecott.
According to the Association for Library Services for Children, the Newbery Medal is awarded annually for the most distinguished American children's book published in the United States in English during the previous year.
The idea was proposed on June 22, 1921, by Frederic G. Melcher, who suggested it be named for 18th-century English bookseller John Newbery. When approved, the Newbery Award became the first children's book award in the world.
The committee that reviews the books for any given year looks for both literary quality and superior presentation for children. The ALA further states that the author is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Along with the winner, honor books are announced.
The ALA indicates that the Caldecott Medal is awarded to the artist of the "most distinguished American picture book for children published in the United States during the preceding year." When you read any Caldecott winner, remember the award is for illustration, not story. Although, the words must be worthy of the illustrations.
As with the Newbery Award, the artist must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Recently, Leonard S. Marcus, distinguished American author and children's literature expert, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times recommending that the Caldecott receive a makeover, an international one! He proposes abolishing the rule that candidates must be American.
According to Marcus, in 1938, when the ALA introduced the Caldecott, the United States was still a "cultural stepchild of Europe." At that time, British picture books like "The Adventures of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix Potter had a stronghold on American children. By limiting Caldecott eligibility to American citizens and permanent residents, the ALA hoped to spark American creativity in illustration, just as they had done for the literary Newbery Award over a decade earlier.
Marcus insists that illustrations in picture books with their "beguiling cultural inflection" provide children with a universal language and the "American only" metric is pointless in today's world. Marcus is well respected, but redesigning the Caldecott Medal for worldwide eligibility is the sole decision of the ALA.
Presently, the Caldecott Medal remains uniquely American. This year, like previous years, the suspense and excitement of the announcement will bubble over in homes, libraries and schools. I hope you watch the unveiling ceremony!

Biden a stronger contender than many made him out to be OP-ED

Texto completo: It was yet another epic failure of political punditry. Go back to the early months of Joe Biden's presidential campaign and read what the consultants and commentators were saying about him: His support is just name recognition; he'll fade! He's too old! He's running a zombie campaign! The party has moved left and he's out of touch! He voted for the crime bill!
Almost everybody was bearish on Joe. But now look where we are, weeks from actual voting. If the polls are to be believed, Biden will win Iowa; he'll come in second in New Hampshire; he will easily win Nevada; he will dominate in South Carolina. He's now tied for the lead in California, and he's way ahead in Texas.
I don't know if he'll win the nomination (both he and Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six months ago thought we'd be.
It's the 947th consecutive sign that we in the coastal chattering classes have not cured our insularity problem. It's the 947th case in which we see that every second you spend on Twitter detracts from your knowledge of American politics and that the only cure to this insularity disease is constant travel and interviewing, close attention to state and local data and raw abject humility about the fact that the attitudes and academic degrees that you think make you clever are actually the attitudes and academic degrees that separate you from the real texture of American life.
Biden didn't just luck into this. He and his team grasped six truths:
* Understand the year you are running in. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running the same basic campaign they would have run in 2012 or 2016. Biden's campaign is completely focused on the central problem of 2020: that Donald Trump is a steaming hot mess in the middle of national life.
Biden has fixated his campaign on the Trump problem and fighting for the soul of America. Nearly twice as many Democrats say it's more important to beat Trump than to have a candidate with whom they agree on all issues.
* Understand your party's core challenge. All around the world, parties on the left are losing because they have lost touch with the working class. These parties think they can reconnect with that class by swinging even further left. But Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and Bernie Sanders here are a doctoral student's idea of a working-class candidate, not an actual working person's idea of one.
Biden has criticized his own party for losing touch with this class. He emerged from it, is focusing his attention on it and is winning support from it.
* Moderates are still powerful. The Democratic Party is moving left, but about half of Democrats still say they are moderate or conservative. No candidate has ever won a nomination without strong support from these voters, while college-town candidates - Howard Dean, Gary Hart - tend to falter. In every presidential general election that Democrats have won since 1988, they carried moderates by more than 12 percentage points. In every race they have lost, they failed to do that. Biden kept his moderate credentials when many other candidates saw A.O.C. on Twitter and decided to move left.
* Many Democrats resent their own elites. There is a quiet tension between Democrats who wield cultural power and those who don't. The former are active on social media and clobber the latter - people who say or write the "wrong" thing.
The non-elites tend to feel judged and looked down on by the self-appointed savior class. "Politically correct" has become the phrase people use to define those who use cultural power to enforce ideological conformity. Seventy percent of Democrats who are not on social media say political correctness is a big problem. These are people silently but vehemently reacting against this social reign of terror. Biden communicates affection, not judgment; acceptance, not expulsion.
* Have a better theory of social change. Sanders and Warren imagine they can rally movements of progressive supermajorities to transform American politics. The reality is that if they are elected we'll be stuck with the same 42%-to-42% stagnant political war we have now.
Biden starts with the understanding that we are a closely divided nation. He understands the elemental fact that if you want to pass laws you have to go through Congress. As Damon Linker pointed out recently in The Week, Biden's argument is that a center-left congressional coalition is the best we can do under present circumstances. That's a more realistic theory of change. A beloved legislator like Biden is more likely to transform the political landscape than a down-the-line progressive.
* Connection. Connection. Connection. Many candidates pound the podium and lecture at their rallies. It's the big leader onstage and the passionate mass of followers down below. Nobody makes an individual connection as well as Biden. In a time when people feel exhausted, isolated and alienated, a candidate who seems normal and emotionally relatable is going to have a lot of appeal.
The ironic fact is that the candidate who can be vulnerable has a surprising power.

Hail to the beach: A history of presidents visiting Cape May County

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump holds a rally in Wildwood on Jan. 28, he will be surrounded by cellphones, webcams and giant screens.
That wasn't the case the last time a president visited Cape May County.
But then again, it was the 1890s.
Benjamin Harrison was reportedly the most recent presidential visitor in the county that will host Trump next week.
Trump will be the first sitting president in Wildwood — a location chosen because it's in the district of U.S. Rep Jeff Van Drew, who recently switched to the Republican party.
But in the 1800s, neighboring Cape May was a big summertime draw for Harrison and a number of other presidents.
Most of them stayed at Congress Hall, which Harrison made his "summer White House."
"By the middle of the 19th century, Cape May had become a booming holiday destination, rivaling Saratoga and Newport for popularity," the Congress Hall website noted.
While Trump is coming to Cape May County to campaign, previous presidents sought seaside relaxation.
Here's a look at their time at the shore:
Franklin Pierce, 1855 Many find the ocean air restorative, and that was apparently what lured President Franklin Pierce and his wife, Jane.
A July 5, 1855, article in the Pittsfield Sun reported "President Pierce and Mrs. Pierce are on a visit to Cape Island, N.J., for the health of the latter. They arrived there from Washington on Thursday."
Cape Island was renamed Cape May in 1869.
James Buchanan, 1867 Health concerns also brought former President James Buchanan to the shore. "His health, we regret to say, is quite feeble," reported an Aug. 25, 1867, New York Times article.
"He is suffering from extreme debility, the effect of a bilious attack which occurred on his return from Cape May, where he has been passing some weeks," the article added.
His trip apparently ended on a better note, with the article noting "he was decidedly better yesterday."
Buchanan would only live until the following summer but the shore trip apparently brought short-term relief.
Ulysses S. Grant, 1873-75 Grant made four visits to Cape May with his wife, Julia, in the summer of 1873, staying at Congress Hall.
In July 1875, Grant arrived in Cape May about a U.S. revenue cutter along with dignitaries who included a judge, governor and general.
The visit was quite a big deal, reported the New York Times.
"Their arrival was announced by the booming of cannon and demonstrations of enthusiasm. The distinguished visitors will witness the grand regatta, which promises to congregate more people than ever previously assembled on the island."
Chester Arthur, 1883 Forget fighting shore traffic. Arthur traveled to Cape May by presidential yacht, the USS Despatch. "After being ceremoniously escorted along the beach front, now Beach Avenue, the President was welcomed at the Stockton Hotel by the strains of 'Hail to the Chief,' played by Hassler's orchestra and the Weccacoe Band," according to the nearly century-old book "South Jersey: A History 1664-1924."
A local newspaper article added that on July 23, the night of his arrival, Arthur "managed to shake hands with upwards of 2,500 people."
Afterwards, the president met with "a few gentlemen who desired to see him socially."
"He said that he was greatly pleased with Cape May," the New York Times reported.
Benjamin Harrison, 1889-91 Even presidents like having a buddy with a shore house. For Harrison, it was famous Philadelphia retailer and Postmaster General John Wanamaker.
First lady Caroline Harrison and her family were guests at Wanamaker's Cape May cottage in June 1889; the president also paid a visit during that time, according to a 1974 Cape May newspaper article.
The next summer, the Harrisons stayed in a new shore cottage, a $10,000 gift from Wanamaker and William McLean, editor of the Philadelphia Public Ledger (An 1890 New York Times article noted that the president later paid for the home). In the summer of 1891, Harrison spent all but one week of the summer season at Congress Hall, the "summer White House."
While the president found the shore a conducive environment for work, his wife enjoyed the leisure activities.
Caroline Harrison "was probably the most powerful and biggest booster of Cape May County in history," the 1974 article said. "Mrs. Harrison was caught up in the social life of the shore and often took carriage rides through the area."
The shore was an escape from the scrutiny the couple faced at the White House, the article noted: "Cape residents did respect the privacy of President and Mrs. Harrison and did fend off the hordes of reporters that swarmed over the area."

Why? Because very soon, the American Library Association will announce the Youth Media Awards. View the winners live on Monday, Jan. 27, starting at 6 a.m. Arizona time at ala.unikron.com
The ALA Youth Media Awards honors the year's best original and creative work in children's literature, including the prestigious Newbery, Caldecott, Printz and Coretta Scott King awards.
To make the 2020 decisions, committees composed of librarians and other literature and media experts spent hours reading, reviewing, and discussing books. They were not alone! A quick internet search displayed numerous hearty deliberations. Everyone from teachers to parents to booksellers had opinions. Oh, but what about children? Certainly, they have opinions. Perhaps surprisingly, they are NOT a part of the decision making process. So, before the announcements are made, let's review criteria for the two oldest awards: The John Newbery and the Randolph J. Caldecott.
According to the Association for Library Services for Children, the Newbery Medal is awarded annually for the most distinguished American children's book published in the United States in English during the previous year.
The idea was proposed on June 22, 1921, by Frederic G. Melcher, who suggested it be named for 18th-century English bookseller John Newbery. When approved, the Newbery Award became the first children's book award in the world.
The committee that reviews the books for any given year looks for both literary quality and superior presentation for children. The ALA further states that the author is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Along with the winner, honor books are announced.
The ALA indicates that the Caldecott Medal is awarded to the artist of the "most distinguished American picture book for children published in the United States during the preceding year." When you read any Caldecott winner, remember the award is for illustration, not story. Although, the words must be worthy of the illustrations.
As with the Newbery Award, the artist must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Recently, Leonard S. Marcus, distinguished American author and children's literature expert, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times recommending that the Caldecott receive a makeover, an international one! He proposes abolishing the rule that candidates must be American.
According to Marcus, in 1938, when the ALA introduced the Caldecott, the United States was still a "cultural stepchild of Europe." At that time, British picture books like "The Adventures of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix Potter had a stronghold on American children. By limiting Caldecott eligibility to American citizens and permanent residents, the ALA hoped to spark American creativity in illustration, just as they had done for the literary Newbery Award over a decade earlier.
Marcus insists that illustrations in picture books with their "beguiling cultural inflection" provide children with a universal language and the "American only" metric is pointless in today's world. Marcus is well respected, but redesigning the Caldecott Medal for worldwide eligibility is the sole decision of the ALA. Presently, the Caldecott Medal remains uniquely American. This year, like previous years, the suspense and excitement of the announcement will bubble over in homes, libraries and schools. I hope you watch the unveiling ceremony!

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the first week of November, the police in San Francisco and New York responded to a series of telephone calls claiming that hostages were being held in the homes of Adam Mosseri, a senior Facebook executive.
The calls appeared to be coming from inside the homes.
Officers arrived in force and barricaded the streets outside. Twice.
But after tense, hourslong standoffs, they realized the calls were hoaxes. There were no hostages, and no one in the homes had called the police.
Mosseri is one of a number of tech executives who have been targeted recently in so-called swatting incidents. Swatting is online lingo used to describe when people call the police with false reports of a violent crime of some sort inside a home, hoping to persuade them to send a SWAT team.
These episodes have become more common in communities rich with tech companies and their billionaire executives, like the Bay Area and Seattle, according to six police departments contacted by The New York Times.
Exact numbers are unclear, police say, because there is no central repository of information for these sorts of attacks.
But as online discourse has become more combative and more personal, some in the industry aren't surprised that tech executives - the people who decide what is posted on social media and who is barred from it - have become regular targets.
Swattings have spiked at Facebook in particular, according to local police departments and security officials at the company, which in recent years has cracked down on false accounts, threatening language and other types of content that violates its rules. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the attacks.
Mosseri declined to comment, and a Facebook spokesman, Anthony Harrison, said in a statement that "because these things deal with security matters and our employees, we are unable to comment."
The attacks have been aided by forums that have sprung up both on the public internet and on the camouflaged sites of the so-called dark web. These forums name thousands of people, from high-ranking executives to their extended families, who could be targets, providing cellphone numbers, home addresses and other information. Some even discuss techniques that can be used - like cheap, online technology that can spoof a phone number and make the police believe a 911 call is coming from a target's home.
In the eight months since one online forum was started, nearly 3,000 people have joined.
"Who should we do next?" read one message on the forum last month. The responses included gun emojis - the symbol, in swatting forums, for an attack in which the police were successfully called to the target's home. Many of the responses were laced with profanity, as well as suggestions for ex-girlfriends who should be swatted.
One forum names at least two dozen Facebook employees as potential targets. They range from executives to product engineers. Some forum participants said that they had been barred from Facebook or Instagram, and that Facebook employees were fair game because they "think they are god."
Swatting started in the combative world of online gaming. It was a way to terrorize someone more famous, get even with a rival or retaliate against someone with different political views.
Provoking a heavily armed police response presents obvious risks. Last year, a 26-year-old California man was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for calling in dozens of fake emergency calls, including one that led to the fatal police shooting of Andrew Finch, a Kansas resident.

What's ahead for the Orioles?

Texto completo: Mike Elias isn't saying much about the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal that rocked Major League Baseball, despite being a part of the organization when the incident occurred.
"I'm not going to give an in-depth comment on the topic, but we're going to do things the right way with the Orioles," he said.
Instead, Elias is focused on his second season as general manager of the Baltimore Orioles, acting as a guest speaker at the Delmarva Shorebirds' annual hot stove banquet on Thursday night.
The event serves as an opportunity for fans and officials to come together to talk baseball.
The Shorebirds are just four months removed from their historic 2019 season that saw the club win 90 games and advance to the postseason for the first time since 2005. The squad was led by a strong group of pitchers, highlighted by Grayson Rodriguez and Drew Rom, and solid position players, such as infielder Adam Hall and outfielder Robert Neustrom.
Delmarva also hosted 2019 No. 1 overall selection Adley Rutschman toward the end of the season. Elias said he would like to see the catcher start the upcoming season with the Frederick Keys, however it will depend on his performance in spring training.
But Thursday night was about 2020 and how the Shorebirds, and Orioles, would find ways to succeed.
Baltimore was the second worst team in the MLB last season, finishing the year with a 54-108 overall record. However, with a young core expected to make the big-league club, the Orioles' general manger is confident the organization's rebuild is going as planned.
"Some of the names we've been reading about are going to start to arrive in Camden Yards," Elias said. "It's still about player development and those individual performances and not necessarily the team's win and loss record. Those guys are taking steps forward, graduating to the big leagues and adjusting to big-league life."
Elias also expressed his satisfaction with Baltimore's minor-league system.
The Bowie Baysox — the Orioles' Double-A affiliate — also advanced to the postseason, while the Aberdeen Ironbirds — the short-season club — finished with some of their best numbers in history.
After leading the club in 2019, Shorebirds' manager Kyle Moore was promoted to Frederick, replacing longtime skipper Ryan Minor who was let go from the organization. Dave Anderson, who has been with the Orioles the last six years, most recently as a minor-league infield coordinator, will take over on Delmarva.
"It's exactly what you want to see, especially when you're in a rebuild," he said. "We're focused on that type of success. The success of teams like the Shorebirds is really going to dictate what we do the next couple of years in Baltimore."
In November, news broke that several minor-league teams throughout the country were on the chopping block as part of a new MLB plan to streamline its minor league system for efficiency and to improve conditions for players, according to a New York Times report. The Frederick Keys was one of 42 clubs on the list.
While nothing is official, minor-league officials have said they'll do everything in their power to prevent the loss of any team. Elias provided little information on the status of Frederick or how the Orioles will respond should they lose any club.
"All I know is that this is being handled at the league level," he said. "I think Major League Baseball wants to see a healthier player development environment, and minor-league baseball has a lot of interest as well, and I'm sure both sides will come up with a solution."
Though he couldn't say much, Elias did respond to questions about the recent situation regarding the Astros.
Recently, The Athletic reported the Astros had used technology to steal opposing teams' signs that allowed Houston batters to know what type of pitch was coming. The Astros would go on to win the 2017 World Series.
Once news of the scandal broke, Houston was fined $5 million by the MLB and forced to forfeit draft picks in the 2020 and 2021 MLB Draft. General manager Jeff Luhnow and field manager A.J. Hinch were fired following a suspension sent down by the league.
Elias served as Houston's assistant general manager and oversaw player development and minor-league operations before coming to Baltimore in 2018.
Elias said his primary duties in Houston were dealing with the minor leagues and scouting, noting the scandal doesn't detract from the work he and his staff did in those areas.
"I think there's a history of things happening in our sport and other sports, and that's why we have good people in the sport to get it fixed and be better," Elias said.
While one general manager spoke of the future, the other highlighted the success of 2019 and discussed some notable events taking place at Arthur W. Perdue Stadium next season.
Coming off a 90-win season, Shorebirds' general manager Chris Bitters is excited to have fans back at the ballfield watching some of the Orioles' top prospects.
"We're kicking off baseball for bird land right here in Salisbury," he said. "Last year was the cherry on top. We had all these great things going on and then boom, we catapult to best team record in team history.
"We had exciting baseball every night."
The Shorebirds also unveiled their promotional schedule for 2020, which includes several giveaways and theme nights.
A Trey Mancini Jedi bobblehead will be given away on May 8, while a Hawaiian shirt giveaway will take place on June 26. Theme nights include Harry Potter (May 22) and Nickelodeon Night (July 17).
"There's going to be great opportunities throughout the year for the fans to come out and enjoy a giveaway, fireworks night or a value night," Bitters said.
Delmarva kicks off its season April 8 at home against the Asheville Tourists. Team rosters will be announced following spring training.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump holds a rally in Wildwood on Jan. 28, he will be surrounded by cellphones, webcams and giant screens.
That wasn't the case the last time a president visited Cape May County.
But then again, it was the 1890s.
Benjamin Harrison was reportedly the most recent presidential visitor in the county that will host Trump next week.
Trump will be the first sitting president in Wildwood — a location chosen because it's in the district of U.S. Rep Jeff Van Drew, who recently switched to the Republican party.
But in the 1800s, neighboring Cape May was a big summertime draw for Harrison and a number of other presidents.
Most of them stayed at Congress Hall, which Harrison made his "summer White House."
"By the middle of the 19th century, Cape May had become a booming holiday destination, rivaling Saratoga and Newport for popularity," the Congress Hall website noted.
While Trump is coming to Cape May County to campaign, previous presidents sought seaside relaxation.
Here's a look at their time at the shore:
Franklin Pierce, 1855 Many find the ocean air restorative, and that was apparently what lured President Franklin Pierce and his wife, Jane.
A July 5, 1855, article in the Pittsfield Sun reported "President Pierce and Mrs. Pierce are on a visit to Cape Island, N.J., for the health of the latter. They arrived there from Washington on Thursday."
Cape Island was renamed Cape May in 1869.
James Buchanan, 1867 Health concerns also brought former President James Buchanan to the shore. "His health, we regret to say, is quite feeble," reported an Aug. 25, 1867, New York Times article.
"He is suffering from extreme debility, the effect of a bilious attack which occurred on his return from Cape May, where he has been passing some weeks," the article added.
His trip apparently ended on a better note, with the article noting "he was decidedly better yesterday."
Buchanan would only live until the following summer but the shore trip apparently brought short-term relief.
Ulysses S. Grant, 1873-75 Grant made four visits to Cape May with his wife, Julia, in the summer of 1873, staying at Congress Hall.
In July 1875, Grant arrived in Cape May about a U.S. revenue cutter along with dignitaries who included a judge, governor and general.
The visit was quite a big deal, reported the New York Times.
"Their arrival was announced by the booming of cannon and demonstrations of enthusiasm. The distinguished visitors will witness the grand regatta, which promises to congregate more people than ever previously assembled on the island."
Chester Arthur, 1883 Forget fighting shore traffic. Arthur traveled to Cape May by presidential yacht, the USS Despatch. "After being ceremoniously escorted along the beach front, now Beach Avenue, the President was welcomed at the Stockton Hotel by the strains of 'Hail to the Chief,' played by Hassler's orchestra and the Weccacoe Band," according to the nearly century-old book "South Jersey: A History 1664-1924."
A local newspaper article added that on July 23, the night of his arrival, Arthur "managed to shake hands with upwards of 2,500 people."
Afterwards, the president met with "a few gentlemen who desired to see him socially."
"He said that he was greatly pleased with Cape May," the New York Times reported.
Benjamin Harrison, 1889-91 Even presidents like having a buddy with a shore house. For Harrison, it was famous Philadelphia retailer and Postmaster General John Wanamaker.
First lady Caroline Harrison and her family were guests at Wanamaker's Cape May cottage in June 1889; the president also paid a visit during that time, according to a 1974 Cape May newspaper article.
The next summer, the Harrisons stayed in a new shore cottage, a $10,000 gift from Wanamaker and William McLean, editor of the Philadelphia Public Ledger (An 1890 New York Times article noted that the president later paid for the home).
In the summer of 1891, Harrison spent all but one week of the summer season at Congress Hall, the "summer White House."
While the president found the shore a conducive environment for work, his wife enjoyed the leisure activities.
Caroline Harrison "was probably the most powerful and biggest booster of Cape May County in history," the 1974 article said. "Mrs. Harrison was caught up in the social life of the shore and often took carriage rides through the area."
The shore was an escape from the scrutiny the couple faced at the White House, the article noted: "Cape residents did respect the privacy of President and Mrs. Harrison and did fend off the hordes of reporters that swarmed over the area."

Congress Hall was the "summer White House" for President Benjamin Harrison in 1891. Many other presidents stayed at the Cape May hotel. While Cape May County has hosted presidents since the 1800s, Donald Trump will be the first sitting president to visit Wildwood.

Why? Because very soon, the American Library Association will announce the Youth Media Awards. View the winners live on Monday, Jan. 27, starting at 6 a.m. Arizona time at ala.unikron.com
The ALA Youth Media Awards honors the year's best original and creative work in children's literature, including the prestigious Newbery, Caldecott, Printz and Coretta Scott King awards.
To make the 2020 decisions, committees composed of librarians and other literature and media experts spent hours reading, reviewing, and discussing books. They were not alone! A quick internet search displayed numerous hearty deliberations. Everyone from teachers to parents to booksellers had opinions.
Oh, but what about children? Certainly, they have opinions. Perhaps surprisingly, they are NOT a part of the decision making process. So, before the announcements are made, let's review criteria for the two oldest awards: The John Newbery and the Randolph J. Caldecott.
According to the Association for Library Services for Children, the Newbery Medal is awarded annually for the most distinguished American children's book published in the United States in English during the previous year.
The idea was proposed on June 22, 1921, by Frederic G. Melcher, who suggested it be named for 18th-century English bookseller John Newbery. When approved, the Newbery Award became the first children's book award in the world.
The committee that reviews the books for any given year looks for both literary quality and superior presentation for children. The ALA further states that the author is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Along with the winner, honor books are announced.
The ALA indicates that the Caldecott Medal is awarded to the artist of the "most distinguished American picture book for children published in the United States during the preceding year." When you read any Caldecott winner, remember the award is for illustration, not story. Although, the words must be worthy of the illustrations.
As with the Newbery Award, the artist must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Recently, Leonard S. Marcus, distinguished American author and children's literature expert, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times recommending that the Caldecott receive a makeover, an international one! He proposes abolishing the rule that candidates must be American.
According to Marcus, in 1938, when the ALA introduced the Caldecott, the United States was still a "cultural stepchild of Europe." At that time, British picture books like "The Adventures of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix Potter had a stronghold on American children. By limiting Caldecott eligibility to American citizens and permanent residents, the ALA hoped to spark American creativity in illustration, just as they had done for the literary Newbery Award over a decade earlier.
Marcus insists that illustrations in picture books with their "beguiling cultural inflection" provide children with a universal language and the "American only" metric is pointless in today's world. Marcus is well respected, but redesigning the Caldecott Medal for worldwide eligibility is the sole decision of the ALA.
Presently, the Caldecott Medal remains uniquely American. This year, like previous years, the suspense and excitement of the announcement will bubble over in homes, libraries and schools. I hope you watch the unveiling ceremony!

Texto completo: HOA's are entitled to have and enforce certain rules. But shouldn't they also be expected to show some compassion for a tragically orphaned teen? ("HOA wants to kick orphaned teen out of grandparents' house," Jan. 15).
Would they force him to live on the streets? Or perhaps worse, be sentenced to years in the foster care system?
I wonder if any HOA board member would force his own grandchild out of the only family home left to him!

Not another stadium? Thank you for reporting on the Akimel 7 development project earlier this week. I was surprised to learn that tax credits are going to a project that includes plans for a new professional sports arena.
The article hints that the new arena may lure the Coyotes or Diamondbacks to the East Valley. That move would leave a vacant stadium downtown or in Glendale.
Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum is a near-vacant arena that is both close to downtown and on the west side. Since we already have a near-vacant stadium serving those areas, tax incentives should not be used to create another.
Paul Franckowiak, Laveen
Classless leader in high-class city I'm a proud resident of Scottsdale, and we are touted as a high-class city. On the other hand, it's confounding why we continue to elect a low-class politician like Jay Lawrence — an admitted bigot, and purveyor of conspiracies?
Seems to me to be very low standards for an electorate I know is well educated and looking for the best for our city and state.
Jeff Jameson, Scottsdale
Trust schools with sex ed? I am skeptical of public schools teaching sex education. After all, these are the people that can't seem to properly teach their mandated curriculum of English, science and math. And you want to entrust them with sex education?
Kathy Diekelman, Chandler
Virtue signaling at APS It's wonderful that APS plans on becoming carbon free by 2050 (even though they admit the technology to do that doesn't exist). However, APS's goal will be meaningless virtue signaling unless APS and the rest of us become China Free.
China is the worst climate criminal and, as the New York Times recently reported, is growing its coal-burning, climate changing CO2 footprint at home and abroad.
As long as APS and the rest of us keep buying products produced by China or unless China stops its evil ways (don't count on that), Arizona and America won't be carbon free.
Jim McManus, Phoenix
What would Flake and McCain do? What if Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain were still our representatives during Trump's Senate impeachment trial? What would we Arizonans be facing?
They both butted heads with the president and perhaps would have sided with the facts instead of ignoring the truth. Nixon resigned not long after he'd lost the support of Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater and Rep. John Rhodes.
Country over party is sadly no more.
Armando Arvizu, Phoenix

Texto completo: When former New York senator and scholar Daniel Patrick Moynihan died in 2003, he was celebrated for his hugely productive careers in both politics and academia, and admired for his wit. His aphorism — “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” — was often cited.
But as the 21st century careens along, Moynihan’s premise has taken a beating. Technology has made it easier for ideologues to only get information that reinforces their existing views. Moynihan’s assumption that people could carry on arguments over policy issues while agreeing on basic facts has been obliterated. The most prominent examples: Those on the left like to cite the skepticism many conservatives have about climate change, which runs counter to the views of the vast majority of scientists. And those on the right often bring up the warnings many progressives make about the risks of genetically modified food, which also are contrary to the views of the vast majority of scientists.
This partisan framing goes far beyond such high-profile issues. Every day, Americans can watch TV shows, check out websites or listen to podcasts that present not just different opinions but different factual frameworks. And as a deeply troubling recent story in The New York Times pointed out, this fact shading is now common in school textbooks.
The New York Times analyzed eight of the most popular history textbooks used in both California and Texas public schools — textbooks with the same authors and same publishers. In both states, laws have been passed and teaching standards set that reflect the values of state lawmakers and members of the state board of education. As a result, there are now basic differences in how the history books in America’s two most populous states deal with such profound issues as race and the economy.
In discussions of the “white flight” phenomenon from the 1950s and 1960s in which millions of white Americans moved from big cities to more homogenous suburbs, the California history textbook published by McGraw-Hill says some of these Americans were “driven by a desire to get away from more culturally diverse neighborhoods” — i.e., racism. The Texas textbook states that some of these Americans “wished to escape the crime and congestion of the city” — also loaded language.
In discussions of capitalism, The New York Times noted California textbooks “sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally.” Those in Texas celebrate the wealth-creating free-market economy.
The same differences are apparent in how the textbooks deal with everything from gun rights and the Harlem Renaissance to immigration and gender. In California, The New York Times noted, education bureaucrats persuaded one textbook publisher to not use the word “massacre” to describe how 19th-century Native Americans responded to white settlers. In Texas, they got another publisher to emphasize religious values of America’s founders.
The sad news is there is little reason to hope that this front in America’s ongoing culture wars is going to change. A survey of 8,000 Americans released in 2018 by researchers at YouGov and the More in Common civics group found that while most Americans are generally centrist, 14% of residents are “starkly polarized” people on the left and right who tend to “dominate public debate in the digital age.”
Such Californians and Texans likely love their state officials putting their thumbs on the scales in the teaching of history. But the rest of us should fear this as one more sign of the clout of a relative handful of Americans who reject ideas that don’t fit in with their worldview, facts be damned or shaded.
American history has long been framed by those who write it. That’s clearer the more divided we get.

Texto completo: Author Nic Stone faced a challenge.
Her debut, young adult novel, "Dear Martin," became a 2017 New York Times bestseller and earned her praise for its of-the-moment take on the effects of racial profiling on young black men and teens, regardless of their economic status and level of academic achievement. Her portrayal was direct and searing.
But even as her next two YA novels, "Odd One Out," and "Jackpot: All Bet$ Are Off," were well
received, Stone still got comments from elementary school teachers and parents who'd read "Dear Martin," but wondered if she planned to deal with hard questions of race and identity in a novel appropriate for third through sixth graders.The Atlanta author and Spelman graduate understood. She and her husband have sons: 7 years old and 3 years old.
"I wanted to be able to address racism without calling it that," Stone said recently.
Her new and fourth novel, "Clean Getaway," does that in an inspired way. The protagonist is an 11-year-old middle school student, William "Scoob" Lamar, an African American boy who is gifted at writing computer code. But in the book, some are doubtful that a black kid can be good at something other than music and sports. More tumult ensues, and Scoob finds himself suspended from school. That's where the adventure begins.
Initiated by his grandmother, who is white, the two embark on a trip through the South in her Winnebago following stops listed in the real-life, and perhaps life-saving, "The Negro Motorist Green Book." The volumes were published from 1936 to 1966 to help African American travelers find safe lodging during the dangerous era of segregation.
But as the trip progresses, Scoob realizes there's something off about his grandmother. Why is she behaving so oddly? And why is she fixated on fine jewelry? The questions build from city to city, RV park to RV park. This is a kid's novel as much about secrets and presumptions as it is about race.
"We all have things our children don't know about us," Stone said. "There are some things my grandmother shared with me about my granddaddy once, that I was like, 'Whoa! I'm not sure I really wanted to know that, but now I do.' Once you run up against it, you have to address it."
Stone -- who made it a point to say the Green Book experience she constructed has nothing to do with the contentious 2018 film, "The Green Book" -- pulled other elements from her own life as inspiration. Just as Scoob's grandmother is white, so is Stone's mother-in-law, the grandmother to her two sons. Stone's husband has a Nigerian father and a Russian mother.
"She married a Nigerian man in Russia in the 1970s," Stone said. "Being in an interracial marriage during the civil rights movement was something I wanted to explore."
The author also wanted to introduce young readers to the idea that their grandparents were young once too. They lived full lives and did things they were proud of as well as things they wished they'd done differently.
"We completely erase a person's history," Stone said. "You just don't wake up 70 years old. It's our own shame as adults that keeps us from being honest est with the children in our lives. Just tell your grandkids grand- the truth of your life." As Scoob learns about the
evils of segregation and the courage it took to battle it, he also learns lessons that may help him confront more subtle forms of racism still alive and well. Just as important, he learns that presumptions, whether about race or age, can be restricting. Acknowledging them and dealing with them takes maturity and courage.

ACCEPTING THE SURVEILLANCE STATE FEW OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING TO PREVENT THIS CRISIS

Texto completo: There is much about the future that keeps me up at night - AI weaponry, undetectable viral deepfakes, indefatigable and infinitely wise robotic op-ed columnists - but in the last few years, one technological threat has blipped my fear radar much faster than others.
That fear? Ubiquitous surveillance.
I am no longer sure that human civilization can undo or evade living under constant, extravagantly detailed physical and even psychic surveillance; as a species, we are not doing nearly enough to avoid always being watched or otherwise digitally recorded.
Your location, your purchases, video and audio from within your home and office, your online searches and every digital wandering, biometric tracking of your face and other body parts, your heart rate and other vital signs, your every communication, recording and perhaps your deepest thoughts or idlest dreams - in the future, if not already, much of this data and more will be collected and analyzed by some combination of governments and corporations, among them a handful of megacompanies whose powers nearly match those of governments.
Why am I so pessimistic? Over the last year, as part of Times Opinion's Privacy Project, I've participated in experiments in which my devices were closely monitored in order to determine the kind of data that was being collected about me. The experiments have given me new insight into the psychology underpinning surveillance; I've realized how blind we are to the kinds of insights tech companies are gaining about us through our gadgets. Our blindness not only keeps us glued to privacy-invading tech - it also means that we've failed to create a political culture that is in any way up to the task of limiting surveillance.
Just consider the odd politics surrounding privacy invasion. Donald Trump and his supporters repeatedly argue that the FBI is corrupt and untrustworthy. Yet, like Barack Obama before him, Mr. Trump and the Justice Department are pushing Apple to create a backdoor into the data on encrypted iPhones - they want the untrustworthy FBI and any local cop to be able to see everything inside anyone's phone.
Apple, mercifully, is resisting, just as it did the request of Mr. Obama's Justice Department to create a loophole in iPhone security - but the fact that both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump agreed on the need for breaking iPhone encryption suggests how thoroughly political leaders across a wide spectrum have neglected privacy as a fundamental value worthy of protection.
Indeed, because of a dearth of laws protecting our privacy - and almost no high-profile political discussion about the stakes at hand - Americans are sleepwalking into a frightening future. I choose the word "sleepwalking" deliberately, because when it comes to digital privacy, a lot of us prefer the comfortable bliss of ignorance. As a result, much of the surveillance engine operates underground - just beyond where many of us dare to look.
I was recently confronted by this sort of cascade with my own smartphone tracking data. Late last year, with the help of Stuart Thompson, an Opinion editor, I set up my phone to monitor how certain apps were tracking me. I focused on apps that required me to grant them access to my physical location - among them apps to find cheap gas, coupons and nearby retail discounts, and to otherwise help me navigate and find deals as I wandered about the world.
The upshot: As the location-tracking apps followed me, I was able to capture the pings they sent to online servers - essentially recording their spying. I sent the data to Stuart and his team, who interpreted and mapped the pings the apps had collected about me. Their picture shocked me; the apps had followed me far more closely, capturing much more data and far more often, than I had imagined when I'd said yes to their tracking.
Like a lot of people, I've long justified my apathy about privacy through innocence: I'm a stand-up guy - what do I have to hide?
But looking at the God's-eye-view that a few coupon apps can glean about me, I can no longer pretend I've got nothing to worry about. Sure, I'm not a criminal - but do I want anyone to learn everything about me? And more to the point: Is it wise for us to let any entity learn everything about everyone?
Because those are the stakes. The remaining uncertainty about the surveillance state is not whether we will submit to it - only how readily and completely, and how thoroughly it will warp our society.
Will we allow the government and corporations unrestricted access to every bit of data we ever generate, or will we decide that some kinds of collections, like the encrypted data on your phone, should be forever off limits, even when a judge has issued a warrant for it?
In the future, will there be room for any true secret - will society allow any unrecorded thought or communication to evade detection and commercial analysis? And, if there can be no more secrets, how will we account for what we lose? How completely will living under surveillance numb creativity and silence radical thought? Can human agency survive the possibility that some companies will know more about all of us than any of us can ever know about ourselves?
I'm worried we'll soon be forced to find out.

Texto completo: Gov. Tom Wolf has proposed an increase of $12.35 million in state funding toward developing innovation in the region.
The governor made the announcement Friday, part of a rollout of specific goals of his 2020-21 budget before he releases the entire proposal at the beginning of February. Earlier this week, he outlined his plans to invest several million dollars in human service programs to protect vulnerable communities.
Mr. Wolf's most recent budget proposal focuses on creating a "statewide innovation strategy" with three main components: education, workforce development and economic development.
It includes a $5 million increase for the Ben Franklin Technology Development Authority, a program to promote an entrepreneurial business environment and a technology-ready workforce; a $2.5 million increase for Industrial Resource Centers, economic development organizations designed to support the manufacturing community; a $2.5 million increase for the PREP network, Pennsylvania's network of business assistance partners; and a $2.35 million increase for Invent Penn State, which funds collaborations to turn research into products and services.
The funding will be competitive among statewide organizations, and each group will be required to collaborate with universities in the region.
"It builds on what good things are already happening in Pennsylvania. We're not reinventing anything here," Mr. Wolf said. "These investments are not just blindly throwing money at an industry and saying, 'Eh, I hope it grows.' It's about building a culture."
He outlined the official proposal at an event Friday morning at Hazelwood Green, a redevelopment project that is fast becoming one of the city's innovation centers with tenants such as Carnegie Mellon University's Manufacturing Futures Initiative and Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute, as well as self-driving car company Aptiv.
Part of the reason for the investment was to keep Pennsylvania competitive with other states making a reputation for themselves as innovation centers. The governor, like many others involved in the tech industry, lamented the trend of innovators coming to Pennsylvania to learn, grow and experiment and then leaving the state, taking their talent and expertise with them.
"We need to do something to help Pennsylvania help itself before we lose any more ground to our competitor states in an area where we absolutely should be a leader," Mr. Wolf said.
Pennsylvania's tech sector accounts for $47 billion in terms of economic impact, the governor noted.
"We can not afford to fall behind," he said. "There are so many things Pennsylvania has done, and we need to recapture that innovative pioneering spirit. ...We've lost the mojo that we had once, and this is how we get it back."
State Rep. Jake Wheatley, D-Allegheny, who also spoke at the event, said it was important to recognize the investment in technology at a time when "we have to figure out how to tighten our belt and live more within our means."
But, he said, government officials also had a responsibility to make sure every citizen was benefiting from these new investments, no matter their background, career aspirations or ZIP code. The government had to look at the entire "pipeline," starting with K-12 education and moving through to state funding and initiatives like the Hazelwood Green redevelopment.
"You may not be able to afford this space, but that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of the partnerships," Mr. Wheatley said. "You don't have to wait to become someone to be an innovator."
The governor's proposal outlined several key initiatives to go along with the funding, including establishing an evidence-based statewide annual innovation report, encouraging development in rural areas, and increasing state resources for early stage companies and venture capitalists.
Earlier this week, the Wolf administration announced new funding that did just that.
The state approved Point Breeze-based Gecko Robotics Inc., a startup that creates wall-climbing robots to perform inspections of facilities such as power plants and paper mills, for $120,000 in state funding to expand its operations.
The funding was part of the Job Creation Tax Credit program, which awards approved businesses tax credits to encourage local job growth.
For Dennis Davin, secretary for the Department of Community and Economic Development, the investment in technology is a safety measure to make sure Pennsylvania maintains a diverse economy that doesn't depend on just one industry.
"I'm old enough to know what it was like to have a steel mill on this particular site," he said at the Hazelwood Green event. "And old enough to know what happened after those steel mills went away. I saw what it was like to rely on one industry, and it was devastating when that one industry had its issues and collapsed."
"Today, people want to live and get jobs here," he added. "And that means technology businesses want to grow here."
The 2020-21 budget is far from finalized, though. Before it goes into effect, the full budget must be approved by the state Legislature, which has historically pushed back on some of Mr. Wolf's funding proposals. The Legislature and the governor have until June 30 to agree on and pass a state budget.

Texto completo: Get the upper hand against closet clutter.
If you have a crammed closet, you already know the drill. To squeeze in one more thing, use all your strength to push back the wall-to-wall shirts, dresses, pants, coats and everything else carving out a sliver of empty space on the closet bar. Next, gingerly place your item on the rack and hop away as the bulky mass of clothing springs back to envelop it.
Sound familiar? Then it's probably time for an intervention.
The first step is obvious but necessary: Take stock of what you have, and purge what you don't need. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, spoke to experts who said there was no point in buying organizing tools until you know the scope of what you're dealing with. Only when you've pared down should you select a few strategic items to help keep your clothing visible and accessible, so you know what you have and can actually get to it. These five cheap(ish) things will help give you the upper hand against closet clutter and streamline your overstuffed space.
Divide a disorganized drawer
A too-big drawer might not seem like a problem, but if you're storing lots of different types of items, it can quickly devolve into chaos. Create order by subdividing your space, putting clothing like socks, underwear and lingerie in separate compartments so it's easier to grab what you need. Wirecutter recommends Dial's Dream Drawer Organizers from The Container Store. The spring-loaded dividers nestle neatly into drawers to create interior walls. They have just the right amount of give, so they are easy to adjust but stay firmly in place (as long as your drawer is between 12 inches and 18 inches long). They even come with vertical pieces to further divide your compartments.
Barely there hangers
Chunky hangers are a rookie mistake -- slim down and you'll get valuable inches back. Wirecutter's choice, the Joy Mangano Huggable Hangers, are slender, but strong enough to easily handle shirts and pants. Coordinating accessories like clips and hooks let you take advantage of vertical hanging space: Attach a pair of pants or a skirt to the bottom bar, or string multiple hangers together in a column, one below the next. The hangers are also coated with velvet flocking, better for grabbing gossamer blouses that can slide off smoother hangers.
Stack more on each shelf
Bulky stacks of sweaters or pants tend to topple over. Adding dividers to your closet's shelves lets you pile them high and take advantage of more vertical space. Wirecutter recommends the Lynk Tall Shelf Dividers, which slip easily on (or off) the shelf and stay upright without screws. The coated metal is strong but slim, so the dividers use very little space, leaving more room for your stuff. The dividers work best on shelves up to three-quarters of an inch thick. If you have thicker shelves, Wirecutter also likes the The Container Store's Clear Shelf Divider, which accommodates shelves from three-quarters of an inch to an inch and a half, and it has a handy built-in hook.
A sturdy spot for shoes
Space-hogging shoes can quickly clutter up a closet floor. The Seville Classics 3-Tier Resin Slat Utility Shoe Rack is Wirecutter's recommendation. It's super-sturdy, and it takes all of 30 seconds to set up. The iron frame folds open like a book, and the resin slat shelves quickly snap into place. A single rack holds up to nine pairs, and depending on what you have to store, you can stack multiple racks vertically or connect them horizontally to make a shoe system that is pretty close to custom.
A sleek closet system
If you are ready to invest a little more in your closet's design, built-in organization will make your space a whole lot sleeker. Wirecutter recommends Ikea's Algot system. It's a good-looking option with modern styling that costs a fraction of the price of similar systems. A 4-foot-wide closet costs around $ 100 to outfit, so the Algot system might even make sense for renters who plan to stay put for a few years. If you do need to reconfigure your setup later, Ikea sells lots of coordinating accessories so you can build on what already have.

California's Federal Funds Threatened Over Abortion

Texto completo: If the state doesn't stop requiring private insurers to cover abortions, the administration said it will cut off federal funding for certain health programs.
The Trump administration threatened on Friday to withhold federal money from California if the state does not drop its requirement that private insurers cover abortions.
In an announcement on the morning of the March for Life, the high-profile annual anti-abortion rights demonstration, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would give California 30 days to commit to lifting the requirement. If the state does not do so, the administration said it will take steps to cut off money from one or more federal funding streams.
"People should not be forced to participate, or pay for, or cover other people's abortions," said Roger Severino, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services.
The administration issued a notice of violation, declaring that California was not complying with the federal Weldon Amendment, which says that certain funds can be withheld if a state or local government discriminates against a "health care entity" for not providing or paying for abortions.
The announcement was intended as a warning shot to several other states that also require insurers to cover abortion, including New York, Oregon, Washington, Illinois and Maine.
"We're sending a message that if any state has done what California has done, they should expect to be found likewise in violation," Mr. Severino said.
The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said the state would not change the requirement.
"Despite a federal opinion four years ago confirming California's compliance with the Weldon Amendment, the Trump Administration would rather rile up its base to score cheap political points and risk access to care for millions than do what's right," Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. "California will continue to protect a woman's right to choose, and we won't back down from defending reproductive freedom for everybody -- full stop."
The California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, tweeted: "We will fight this by any means necessary."
In a briefing with reporters, administration officials would not say which funding streams might be cut off or how much money might be involved. Jocelyn Samuels, who served as director of the Office of Civil Rights for H.H.S. from 2014 through the end of the Obama administration, said that billions of dollars could potentially be at stake.
Ms. Samuels noted that the stark language of the Weldon Amendment says that "none of the funds" that Congress appropriates for the departments of Health and Human Services, Education and Labor can be made available to a state that is found to have violated the amendment. If the Trump administration wanted to impose a narrower penalty, like withholding funding from a specific health care grant, that might have to be determined by a court, she said.
If California is deprived of money because of its abortion coverage requirement, it would be the first time the federal government has withheld funding because of health care provider conscience laws, said Ms. Samuels, who is now the executive director of the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law.
"This is all uncharted waters," Ms. Samuels said, adding that in 2016, the Obama administration evaluated the same California insurance requirement and determined that it did not violate the Weldon Amendment because only the health insurers ordered to provide abortion coverage had standing to object, and none of them had. Mr. Severino cited two religious organizations that had complained that they felt compelled to obtain insurance that included abortion coverage for their employees: the Skyline Wesleyan Church and the Missionary Guadalupanas of the Holy Spirit, Inc. The latter organization, a Catholic order of religious sisters, previously sued the state of California over the requirement, a lawsuit that was dismissed by an appeals court in August.
"I don't know how this makes sense to anybody," Mr. Severino said. "Not only is it the wrong thing to do to force nuns to pay for abortion services for fellow nuns, it's against the law."
President Trump, who once said he was "very pro-choice" has worked to earn the support of anti-abortion groups with a series of actions, including preventing organizations that receive federal family planning money from referring patients for abortions and appointing judges to the Supreme Court who have a record of conservative rulings in abortion cases.
Last year on the day of the March for Life, the Trump administration levied a similar accusation against California, saying it violated federal conscience protection amendments with a state law that required religiously-oriented "crisis pregnancy centers" to inform women with unintended pregnancies about the option of abortion. But that federal action appeared to be largely symbolic because the Supreme Court had already struck down the California law on free speech grounds.
The Supreme Court said recently that it would hear a case in which the Trump administration is trying to allow a range of employers with religious or moral objections to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that most insurers provide free coverage of birth control.

THE GRAMMYS; Matter of the moment is 'Dugan-gate'; The ousted CEO largely dominated conversations at pre-awards parties.

Texto completo: Days before this Sunday's Grammy Awards ceremony, the music industry was doing what it could to kick the self-congratulation into high gear.
At a party thrown by Spotify in West Hollywood on Thursday night, 18-year-old Billie Eilish sang an acoustic rendition of her smash hit "Bad Guy" -- nominated for both record and song of the year -- and Rosalia led a crew of white-clad dancers through a set that made clear why the Spanish electro-flamenco star is up for best new artist.
Meanwhile, many of the industry's power players gathered for a Billboard event honoring the executives who helped steer the business toward double-digit growth in 2019.

Yet offstage few were talking about anything other than the escalating battle between the Recording Academy and its recently ousted chief executive, Deborah Dugan, involving explosive claims of corruption, gender discrimination and voting irregularities. The result is a Grammy Week like none other, with the usual celebration overshadowed by gossip regarding the latest developments and widespread uncertainty about how it all may affect the Grammys telecast from Staples Center on Sunday night.
Insiders with valuable relationships to protect were unwilling to be quoted on the subject; many insisted they hadn't yet learned enough to comment.
"One, we don't know anything. Two, we don't know anything. And three, we don't know anything," said Yola, the British country-soul singer nominated for best new artist, at the Spotify bash.
"We've tried our best to keep up with it, but there's so much he-said/she-said to grasp what's happening," added Adrian Quesada, another best new artist nominee with the duo Black Pumas.
Privately, though, virtually all agree that the messy situation -- the phrase heard repeatedly at the Billboard event combines an expletive with the word "show" -- is diverting focus from a diverse field of Grammy nominees that had been hailed as a sign of progress for an academy long viewed as being out of touch with modern music.
The weeklong run-up to music's premier awards show has seen tumult before, as when Chris Brown was arrested for assaulting Rihanna in 2009 or when Whitney Houston died unexpectedly at the Beverly Hilton in 2012. But never has the institution itself been so shaken as it is now.
The drama began last week when Deborah Dugan, hired less than a year ago as the academy's first female chief executive, was suspended in the wake of what the organization called "a formal allegation of misconduct." Dugan -- who'd replaced the academy's longtime boss, Neil Portnow, following a controversy related to the Grammys' perceived bias against women -- fired back with a 44-page complaint of her own in which she detailed a rigged nomination process and said that a musician had accused Portnow of rape.
Dugan also alleged that she'd been sexually harassed by Joel Katz, a high-profile lawyer whose clients have included the Recording Academy. (Portnow and Katz have denied the accusations.)
The Grammys were roundly commended when nominations, as announced in November, highlighted work by women and people of color including Eilish, Lizzo, Lana Del Rey, Lil Nas X, H.E.R. and Tyler, the Creator. In contrast with Portnow's 17-year reign -- during which many observers criticized the academy for consistently rewarding aging white rockers -- some sensed the beginnings of Dugan's stated ambition to make the Grammys more inclusive.
Said Yola of the recognition of her work: "I made the decision to push beyond what's expected of women of color. To me that makes [the nomination] even more meaningful."
Yet Dugan's claims about the academy's voting process have called even those advancements into question. In her complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the former CEO said the nominations were manipulated by academy board members seeking to help themselves or their associates and by the Grammys' longtime TV producer, Ken Ehrlich. (Ehrlich, who plans to step aside after this year's show, told the New York Times, "There is no truth to what she alleges.")
How -- or whether -- any of this will be reflected in Sunday's telecast is unclear. Taylor Swift, who'd been expected to perform on the show, will not attend the ceremony -- a possible indication that artists are considering how closely they want to be aligned with the academy.
One publicist, when asked if they'd allow their clients to address the Dugan matter on the red carpet, said, "Sure, as long as I tell them exactly what to say."
Dugan said in an interview before she was suspended that she would appear on the Grammys (as Portnow did every year) only if she had something "important" to say. Her interim replacement, Harvey Mason Jr., may view Sunday's event as an opportunity to publicly address the recent chaos, though he was a no-show at Thursday's Billboard party, where he'd been scheduled to introduce an appearance by veteran record executive Clive Davis.
After accepting Billboard's award as executive of the decade, Universal Music Group Chairman and Chief Executive Lucian Grainge gave a pained look when asked by The Times about the week's developments.
"I'm just focused on our artists," he said. "That's what I have to do."

Texto completo: TECHNOLOGY
New Jersey Tells Police to Stop Using Face ID App
New Jersey police officers are now barred from using a facialrecognition app made by a startup that has licensed its groundbreaking technology to hundreds of law enforcement agencies around the country.
Gurbir S. Grewal, New Jersey's attorney general, on Friday told the state's 21 county prosecutors that police officers should stop using the Clearview AI app, an order first reported by NJ.com.
The New York Times reported last week that Clearview had amassed a database of over three billion photos across the web. The vast database powers an app that can match people to their online photos and link back to the sites the images came from.
"Until this week, I had not heard of Clearview AI," Mr. Grewal said. "I was troubled. The reporting raised questions about data privacy, about cybersecurity, about law enforcement security, about the integrity of our investigations."
In a promotional video posted to its website this week, Clearview included images of Mr. Grewal because the company said its app had played a role last year in Operation Open Door, a New Jersey police sting that led to the arrest of 19 people accused of being child predators.
Mr. Grewal's office sent Clearview a cease-and-desist letter that asked the company to stop using the office and its investigations to promote its products.
"We've received the attorney general's letter and are complying," said Tor Ekeland, Clearview's lawyer. "The video has been removed." KASHMIR HILL
RETAIL
Papyrus to Close Stores, but the Brand Remains
The latest victim of the retail apocalypse? Birthday cards.
Papyrus, the greeting card and stationery chain, will close all its stores in the United States and Canada after its parent company filed for bankruptcy.
Schurman Fine Papers, which operates 254 stores, including the Papyrus brand as well as the American Greetings and Carlton Card chains, filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday. All three store chains will close, but the branded cards they sell will still be available at other retailers.
In its filing, Schurman Fine Papers said business had declined as part of "the general downturn in the brick-and-mortar retail industry." But the store closings are not the end of the Papyrus brand.
While Schurman Fine Papers operates the Papyrus stores, the brand itself is owned by American Greetings, which supplies Papyrus products to more than 300 retailers, according to a spokeswoman for American Greetings, Patrice Molnar. DAVID YAFFE-BELLANY

U.S. Senator Urges Tesla to Rename Safety System
A United States senator on Friday urged Tesla to rebrand its driver assistance system, saying it has "an inherently misleading name" and is subject to potentially dangerous misuse.
But the electric automaker said in a letter that it had taken steps to ensure driver engagement with Autopilot and enhance its safety features. Tesla introduced new warnings for red lights and stop signs last year "to minimize the potential risk of red light- or stop sign-running as a result of temporary driver inattention," the company said in the letter
Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts called for "rebranding and remarketing the system to reduce misuse, as well as building backup driver monitoring tools that will make sure no one falls asleep at the wheel."
Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal crashes in the United States since 2016. REUTERS

Texto completo: Readers' feelings range from "restored hope" to fear of "overload."
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats Turn Focus to Trump's Intentions in Ukraine Aid Freeze" (front page, Jan. 24):
Listening to Adam Schiff and other House managers over the past few days has restored hope that, although they are fated to lose the impeachment battle, we will win the war to return to decency. Their cogent truth- and fact-based explanations leave no doubt as to why the removal of President Trump is necessary for the maintenance of our ongoing experiment in democracy. Their lesson may fall on deaf ears in the Senate, but the American public is listening.
Tom Miller
Oakland, Calif.
To the Editor:
In electrical conduction there is such a thing as "overload," when a surge of current beyond a circuit's ability to respond to it can render that circuit inoperable.
The combined impeachment deliberations and the coverage of the Democratic primaries seem to be approaching "political overload" for some of us.
Let's hope that this morning-to-midnight flow of political clashes doesn't "overload" voters with so much confusion that they become politically "inoperable" in November and freeze in place the status quo.
David L. Evans
Cambridge, Mass.
To the Editor:
Because I have taught for some 50 years, I'd like to offer some pedagogical advice to those arguing both for and against President Trump's removal from office.
First, do not lecture for 24 hours before a Senate audience that is commanded to stay silent. This is a sure recipe for boredom.
Second, do not insult those whose minds you hope to change. Those who worry about Mr. Trump's conduct are not simply sore losers who can't believe they lost the 2016 election. Nor are most Trump supporters anything other than hardworking folks who worry about the country's future.
Finally, cut back the quotes from the founding fathers. The issues here simply involve Mr. Trump's phone call to the president of Ukraine.
Any judgments should be made after, not before, the opposing lawyers have had their say.
Mr. Trump's trial is a test for our Congress and the voting public. I hope we pass it.
Peter Frost
Williamstown, Mass.
To the Editor:
If witnesses are permitted, the Bidens must testify because Donald Trump should be convicted. It would not be fair to allow us Democrats to call witnesses who we think are important and not to encourage the Republicans to call the ones who they believe will help make their case: Joe and Hunter Biden. The simplest calculations are usually the correct ones. Besides, the appearance of being unfair is a loser's game in the court of public opinion.
Michael Silberbach
Lake Oswego, Ore.
To the Editor:
Senate Republicans should realize that if Donald Trump is convicted and removed from office, they won't have to worry that he will make sure they are "primaried" in the coming elections.

Texto completo: During his tenure, 1980-93, the university was restored to financial health, divested from companies tied to South Africa and admitted women to its college.
Michael I. Sovern, an ebullient law professor who as president of Columbia University during the 1980s and '90s shored up the school's finances, brought about divestment from companies doing business in South Africa and opened Columbia College to women, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 88.
His wife, Patricia Sovern, said the cause was amyloid cardiomyopathy, in which clumps of protein build up in the heart tissue.
When Mr. Sovern was named to replace William J. McGill as Columbia's president in 1980, he faced numerous challenges. Columbia was not considered well-managed; an internal study by distinguished professors faulted the university for the erosion of standards in some departments, a loss of pre-eminence in social sciences and a growing paucity of elite faculty talent.
Buildings were in disrepair. New faculty had to be recruited.
"The predicate for everything was the financial condition: We were broke," he said in a 2014 interview before an audience at Roosevelt House, a public policy institute at Hunter College in Manhattan.
He achieved many of his goals. Most important, Columbia's endowment soared during his tenure to $ 1.7 billion, from $ 525 million in 1980.
One of his signature achievements was the $ 400-million sale of 11.7 acres beneath Rockefeller Center in 1985 to the Rockefeller Group, which had been paying the university rent since building the complex in the 1930s. The university had owned the land since 1814.
"As David Rockefeller was saying, this brings to a happy end 52 years of negotiation," Mr. Sovern told The New York Times when the sale was announced.
By the time he stepped down as president in 1993, he had opened the college to women (Barnard was the university's women's college); broadened the university's curriculum; increased scholarships and fellowships; made housing available to all undergraduates who wanted it; and severed ties to companies doing business in South Africa under its apartheid regime.
"Columbia is strong again," he wrote in a letter in 1992 announcing that he would resign the next year to spend more time with his wife, Joan Sovern, a sculptor, who was undergoing treatment for cancer. She died in September 1993. By then he had returned to Columbia Law School, where he had taught since 1957. He married Patricia Walsh in 1995.
Michael Ira Sovern was born on Dec. 1, 1931, in the Bronx to Julius and Lillian (Arnstein) Sovern. His father was a partner in a women's clothing company and died when Michael was 12. His mother became a bookkeeper for an extermination company after her husband's death and scraped by, augmenting her $ 25 weekly salary (about $ 380 in today's dollars) with $ 18 a month in a Social Security widow's benefit.
Michael graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and entered Columbia in the fall of 1949. After his junior year, he started classes at Columbia Law School under a program called "professional option," earning a bachelor's degree in 1953 and a law degree in 1955. He then accepted a job teaching at the University of Minnesota Law School.
One of his students there was Walter F. Mondale, the future Democratic senator from Minnesota and vice president; they developed a friendship that led Mr. Mondale, when he was running for president against President Ronald Reagan in 1984, to ask Mr. Sovern to play Reagan in mock debates.
Mr. Sovern stayed in Minnesota for two years before returning to New York as a professor at Columbia Law. He was teaching there when student protests erupted in 1968, set off by Columbia's involvement in weapons research during the Vietnam War and the university's plan, opposed by many Harlem residents, to build a gymnasium in nearby Morningside Park. Soon, activists occupied five buildings, including the president's office, and shut the campus down. Police arrested and removed the protesters in a violent melee.
In the following months, he headed a faculty committee that helped the school recover from the turmoil and proposed the creation of a University Senate, a policymaking body composed of faculty members, students, alumni and staff. It was formed in 1969 and still exists.
"We learned in 1968 how fragile an enterprise a university is," Mr. Sovern wrote in his autobiography, "An Improbable Life: My Sixty Years at Columbia and Other Adventures" (2014). The senate allowed for "a representative forum where all issues could be fairly heard," he said, adding: "There was no tinder waiting to be ignited."
His involvement in the University Senate whetted his appetite for administration, and in 1970 he was elected dean of the law school. While there, he recruited Ruth Bader Ginsburg as its first female law professor, and Kellis E. Parker as its first black law professor.
Mr. Sovern was named the university's provost and executive vice president for academic affairs in 1979. He became president a year later. But after a dozen years he decided it was time to leave. Not only was his wife ill, but he had also been criticized by arts and science faculty members for his handling of budget problems and strategic planning.
"Mike was a great president of the '80s, but the '90s pose a different challenge," one critic of his, David S. Kastan, who was chairman of Columbia's department of English and comparative literature, told The Times when Mr. Sovern stepped down. (Professor Kastan is now at Yale.)
In addition to his wife, Mr. Sovern, who lived in Manhattan and died in a hospital there, is survived by his daughters, Julie and Elizabeth Sovern; his sons, Jeffrey and Douglas; his stepson, David Wit; 10 grandchildren; and his sister, Denise Canner. His first two marriages, to Lenore Goodman and Eleanor Leen, ended in divorce.
During his time at Columbia, Mr. Sovern, drawing on his expertise in labor law and conflict resolution, mediated contract negotiations in the 1970s between New York City's transit workers union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and arbitrated a dispute between the Rolling Stones and their manager, Allen Klein.
After leaving the Columbia presidency, he served as the chairman of the Japan Society and the American Academy in Rome and as the president of the Shubert Foundation.
In 2000, he was named to succeed the chairman of Sotheby's, who resigned after the auction house was accused of price-fixing with its fellow auction house Christie's.
But his time at Columbia remained the focus of his pride.
"No savvy gambler would have bet that a fatherless adolescent from the South Bronx, the first in his family to graduate from high school," he wrote in his autobiography, "would grow up to become president of one of the world's great universities."

Texto completo: A Syrian documentary is on National Geographic. And "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina" returns to Netflix.
What's on TV
THE CAVE (2019) 9 p.m. on National Geographic. "There is no endgame here," Ben Kenigsberg said of this documentary in The New York Times. Feras Fayaad, who was born in Syria, directed most of the film remotely, relying on cinematographers to record the lives of Dr. Amani Ballour and her patients in a secret, underground hospital outside Damascus. A hero in the film and in her community, Ballour is one of the rare women doctors in the country, and she is constantly challenged for it. This is the least of her worries in the hospital, known as the cave. Above ground -- where war planes are zooming overhead -- the demolition caused by bombings, malnutrition and chemical attacks brings Syrians of all ages to her care, where all she can do is her best.
UFOS: TOP SECRET EVIDENCE REVEALED 8 p.m. on History. This feature adds to one of America's favorite conspiracy theories, and aims to expose any government involvement with and knowledge of extraterrestrial life. By presenting never-before-seen evidence -- a manual called SOM 1-01 -- experts discuss the possibility of a U.F.O. cover-up by the government and question if everything we've been told about aliens is true.
What's Streaming
CHILLING ADVENTURES OF SABRINA Stream on Netflix. In this Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa reboot of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch," the fate of hell, heaven and Earth sits on the shoulders of a girl who must choose between ruling the underworld and saving her boyfriend from Lucifer, who also happens to be her father. It's a lot for a teenage half-mortal who, when the series began three seasons ago, wasn't sure she wanted to submit her soul to the Dark Lord in the first place. Since then, Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) has defeated Lucifer -- though he is trapped within the body of her boyfriend, Nicholas (Gavin Leatherwood) -- which poses a problem. She now faces a coronation as Queen of the Underworld to save her town and coven from an evil prince and some destructive pagans. In her review for The Times, Margaret Lyons wrote that "Sabrina" "knows what 'The Craft' knew, which is that teenage girl rage is a powerful force."
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1947) Stream on Criterion. David Lean directs this Charles Dickens classic about a young orphan named Pip (Anthony Wagner/John Mills), who, with the help of a mysterious benefactor and motivation from his childhood love interest, undertakes a journey toward becoming a gentleman. It's the quintessential coming-of-age tale Dickens is known for, and Lean received praise for this adaptation. Bosley Crowther wrote highly of the film in his review for The Times, saying, "The fullness of Dickens, of his stories and characters -- his humor and pathos and vitality and all his brilliant command of atmosphere -- has never been so illustrated as it is in this wonderful film, which can safely be recommended as screen story-telling at its best."

Texto completo: Ms. Perez told jurors that, decades ago, her fellow actress Annabella Sciorra "swore me never to tell" that she was attacked by Harvey Weinstein.
One night, at the end of 1993, Rosie Perez called her old friend, Annabella Sciorra, looking to go out and have some fun. Ms. Sciorra, a fellow Brooklyn actress, answered the phone in a strange whisper. Ms. Perez asked her what was wrong.
"She said, 'I think I was raped,"' Ms. Perez testified on Friday at Harvey Weinstein's trial. Ms. Perez asked the inevitable question: "Do you know who did it?"
At the time, Ms. Sciorra could not, or would not, name her attacker. Instead, she broke into tears and said, "I can't, I can't, I can't," and she hung up the phone, Ms. Perez said.
But in another call a few months later, Ms. Perez added, Ms. Sciorra finally identified the man she claimed had assaulted her: It was Mr. Weinstein.
"She swore me never to tell anybody," Ms. Perez said. "I told her to go to the police, and she said: 'I can't. He will destroy me. He will destroy my career."'
Ms. Perez appeared in court on Friday as a prosecution witness, called to the stand at the trial, in Manhattan, to bolster Ms. Sciorra's own testimony that Mr. Weinstein assaulted her.
On Thursday, a tearful Ms. Sciorra, known for her work in "The Sopranos," told the jury that Mr. Weinstein pushed his way into her Gramercy Park apartment and raped her after giving her a ride home from a dinner party.
Mr. Weinstein's trial is widely seen as a watershed moment for the #MeToo movement and has delved into complicated issues of consent and power dynamics in professional situations. Ms. Perez's account touched upon another common theme of sexual assaults: how women often delay reporting attacks and live with them in silence.
On cross-examination, Damon Cheronis, one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, cut straight to that point. Under his questioning, Ms. Perez acknowledged that, even though one of her best friends had just said she was raped, they did not speak for a couple of days.
"I tried to -- she didn't want to talk about it," Ms. Perez told the jury. "She was still very upset."
As months went by, Ms. Perez said, Ms. Sciorra would mention the alleged assault at times, but did not want to share details.
"It was very, very traumatic for her," Ms. Perez said, "and it was traumatic for me."
Then in 1994, when Ms. Sciorra was in London filming "The Innocent Sleep," the two friends spoke by phone. Ms. Sciorra told Ms. Perez that Mr. Weinstein was "harassing her" -- he had banged on the door of her hotel room -- and that she was "scared he was going to get her again," Ms. Perez said.
It was during that call, Ms. Perez told the jury, that she "put two and two together" and guessed it was Mr. Weinstein who Ms. Sciorra said had attacked her months earlier. "She started screaming," Ms. Perez said. "And I tried to calm her down."
Six women are expected to testify against Mr. Weinstein at the trial. He is accused of five felony counts, including rape and predatory sexual assault, and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of the last charge.
His lawyers argue that the women who have accused him had sex with him willingly to advance their careers. Prosecutors claim he lured his accusers to meetings with promises of work, and then physically overpowered them.
The accusations against the producer came to a head in October 2017, when revelations about his alleged serial abuses were published in The New York Times and The New Yorker. More than 90 women have since come forward to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual misconduct.
As allegations about his mistreatment of women began to grow and circulate, the producer became increasingly concerned about "the nature of articles" that were set to be published about him, said Sam Anson, a private investigator who testified on Friday before Ms. Perez took the stand.
Two months before the articles in The Times and The New Yorker appeared, Mr. Anson said that he received an email from Mr. Weinstein asking him to investigate a list of "red flags," people who Mr. Weinstein thought were speaking about him to the media. Among the targets was Ms. Sciorra.
"He was concerned that people on the list might be providing information to journalists," Mr. Anson said, adding that Mr. Weinstein was also worried "that articles were being written about him that discussed his sexual life in a negative way."
Mr. Anson never undertook an investigation.
Mr. Weinstein was once a Hollywood giant, a feared executive who reshaped the independent movie industry with Oscar winners like "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction," and who was a big donor to former President Bill Clinton and other Democrats.
The indictment charges Mr. Weinstein with sexually assaulting two women: Mimi Haleyi, who was a production assistant on his show "Project Runway," and a hairstylist and aspiring actress from Washington State, whom The Times is not naming because she is an alleged rape victim.
Mr. Weinstein is accused of forcing oral sex on Ms. Haleyi in his TriBeCa apartment in 2006 and raping the aspiring actress at a Doubletree Hotel in Midtown Manhattan in 2013.
Ms. Sciorra was called by prosecutors to bolster the charge of predatory sexual assault. The five-year time limit for filing a separate rape charge in the attack she described has long passed.
Justice James A. Burke is permitting three other women to testify about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein attacked them, even though he is not charged with crimes in those cases.
Prosecutors hope to use their testimony to establish that Mr. Weinstein has a longstanding pattern of preying on women. A similar trial tactic helped lead to a conviction of Bill Cosby on a sexual assault charge in Pennsylvania.
Earlier on Friday, Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist who provided expert testimony in Mr. Cosby's second trial, explained to jurors in the Weinstein case why a woman might remain in contact with her attacker after an assault.
During opening statements, a defense lawyer told the jury that Ms. Haleyi and the aspiring actress from Washington State had stayed in touch with Mr. Weinstein for years after the alleged assaults. They have pointed to friendly emails the women exchanged with Mr. Weinstein as evidence that the sexual encounters were consensual.
But Dr. Ziv said it is common for sexual assault victims to stay in contact with their attackers if they know or work with them. One reason, she said, is a strong desire to move past the incident. Some victims also want to avoid hurting their jobs or reputations.
Sometimes, she added, the attacker will threaten the victim into silence.
"There's always a worry on the part of the victim that a perpetrator can invade other aspects of their life and ruin their life," she said.

Texto completo: A Pentagon spokesman said that eight of the affected service members returned to the United States from an American military hospital in Germany.
WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department said Friday that 34 American service members have traumatic brain injuries from Iranian airstrikes on Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, contradicting President Trump's dismissal of injuries among American troops this week.
A Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, told a news conference that eight of the affected service members have returned to the United States from an American military hospital in Germany.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump dismissed concussion symptoms felt by the troops as "not very serious," even as the Pentagon acknowledged that a number of American service members were being studied for possible traumatic brain injury caused by the attack.
"I heard they had headaches," Mr. Trump said at a news conference in Davos, Switzerland. "I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries I have seen."
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island and his party's ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, called on Mr. Trump to apologize for belittling the injuries suffered by the troops.
"It's plain wrong for President Trump to diminish their wounds," Mr. Reed, who served as an officer in the 82nd Airborne Division, said in a statement Friday. "He may not have meant to disrespect them, but President Trump's comments were an insult to our troops. He owes them an apology."
The comments of the president, who avoided the Vietnam War draft with a diagnosis of bone spurs, also drew criticism from veterans organizations.
"Don't just be outraged by #PresidentMayhem's latest asinine comments," Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, wrote on Twitter the day Mr. Trump spoke in Davos. "Take action to help vets facing TBIs," meaning traumatic brain injuries.
Traumatic brain injuries can result from the powerful changes in atmospheric pressure that accompany an explosion like that from a missile warhead.
The missiles were launched by Iran in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani, by an American drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3. The Trump administration at first said that there were no injuries from the Iranian attack on American troops.
Pentagon and military officials said subsequently that any delay in reporting the injuries was because it took time for the information to work its way up the chain of command to leaders in Washington. Officials also noted that symptoms from brain injuries do not always appear immediately.
Of the 34 service members who were told they have traumatic brain injuries, 17 were flown by medical evacuation aircraft to Germany. Nine remain in the military hospital there, while the others were flown to the United States.
One person was taken by medevac to Kuwait. Sixteen service members were treated for traumatic brain injury in Iraq and have returned to duty, officials said.

Texto completo: A reader strongly disagrees with Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, who said the #MeToo movement has gone too far.
To the Editor:
Re "She Is Putting #MeToo on Trial" (front page, Jan. 15):
There's a never-ending litany for why rape survivors shouldn't be trusted. Were they drunk? Or flirty? Wearing matching undergarments?
I was. And I knew that few would believe me.
When you've been raped, you find that the judicial process is stacked against you. Anything we said or did could be used against us. Even with eyewitnesses and DNA evidence, assault survivors rarely find justice.
The comments by Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, Donna Rotunno, that #MeToo has gone too far reminded me why I never reported being raped. It's often seen as more important to protect a man's reputation than to acknowledge the woman's suffering. No amount of proof is enough, and history shows that few rape cases will be prosecuted. Most attackers will walk free.
Ms. Rotunno suggests that #BelieveAllWomen is about trusting all accusations with impunity. It's not. Rather, it's the first step in bestowing credibility upon survivors who have constantly been denied legitimacy. It's the first time we've had a smidgen of hope, and it's largely due to the women who spoke out against a cycle of abuse by her client, Mr. Weinstein.
#MeToo has finally given survivors a platform, but it has only just begun to shake at a deeply rooted system.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders is on the move.
After stalling or slipping in the polls for most of 2019, Mr. Sanders is now closing hard just before Democrats cast their first votes. He is moving up in our national polling average, and the last few rounds of early-state surveys have confirmed that he is strongly positioned in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Combined with his formidable fund-raising, his movement in the polls suggests Mr. Sanders has a good chance of seizing an early advantage in the leadoff primary and caucus states.
Mr. Sanders continues to trail Joseph R. Biden Jr. in our national polling average, and the former vice president could prove difficult to dislodge even if Mr. Sanders bests him in the opening phase of the campaign. Mr. Biden's national numbers have been stubbornly flat and no other candidate has come close to matching his support with black voters, in crucial South Carolina and beyond. And Mr. Sanders's national gains also come from a small number of recent polls, so it is possible they are overstated in our average.
But as Mr. Sanders rises, Mr. Biden could face new pressure to show that he can unite the moderate wing of his party before his far-left rival gains a meaningful advantage. Right now, voters on the center-left are still fractured between several options -- not only Mr. Biden but also Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Michael R. Bloomberg and even Elizabeth Warren, whose following includes not just populist progressives but also more moderate women.
If Mr. Biden cannot consolidate support on the center-left against Mr. Sanders, it is not currently clear who else is best positioned to do so. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar have yet to demonstrate any appeal to minority voters, while Ms. Warren continues to struggle to regain the momentum that nearly made her a front-runner last fall. Tom Steyer, a wealthy wild-card candidate, has shown some signs of strength in Nevada and South Carolina but barely registers in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Should the early states produce a muddy outcome, Mr. Bloomberg's extraordinary campaign spending in the Super Tuesday primaries in March could take on new significance. Besides Mr. Sanders, Mr. Bloomberg is the only candidate to gain meaningful support in our national polling average since Thanksgiving, and his gains may be more pronounced in the subset of states where he is spending the most money. ALEXANDER BURNS
The Times Endorses Klobuchar and Warren
The New York Times editorial board, which is separate from the newsroom, endorsed not one but two candidates for the Democratic nomination: Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. The board wrote that "both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration" and that it was endorsing "the most effective advocates for each approach." Separately, The Des Moines Register's editorial board is expected to announce its endorsement for the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Saturday night.
Sanders vs. Biden Still the Story Line
From the start, this Democratic campaign has been a contest between the left and the center. As he rises in the polls, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is hoping to simplify matters, gunning for a two-person race against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Last weekend, Mr. Biden accused Mr. Sanders's campaign of promoting a "doctored" video that showed Mr. Biden appearing to support cuts to Social Security. (The video was short and did not include context, but did not appear to have been doctored.) Mr. Biden said he had been a "gigantic supporter" of Social Security "from the beginning," and pointed to a PolitiFact article calling Mr. Sanders's claims false. But he has supported Social Security freezes before.
Then, on Monday, Mr. Sanders apologized on a separate matter, disavowing an op-ed by one of his surrogates, Zephyr Teachout, who argued that Mr. Biden "represents the transactional, grossly corrupt culture" of Washington. "It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way," Mr. Sanders told CBS News, "and I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared."
That same day, Mr. Biden responded forcefully -- and somewhat hyperbolically -- to a Vice News reporter who asked him why, according to a Vice poll, Mr. Sanders was leading among black voters under 35.
Sanders vs. Clinton Isn't Over Yet
Amid the tussle with Mr. Biden, and fresh off his confrontation with Senator Warren, of Massachusetts, over whether a woman can be elected president, Mr. Sanders found himself under fire on Tuesday from another political rival: Hillary Clinton.
"Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done," Mrs. Clinton said in a four-part documentary series scheduled to premiere at Sundance and air on Hulu beginning March 6. "He was a career politician."
In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Mrs. Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary, declined to say if she would endorse and campaign for him if he won the nomination this time. But a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, noted after the interview was published that she had only said she didn't support Mr. Sanders "yet."
"We all need to work our heart out for the nominee, whoever that is, and @HillaryClinton, as usual, won't be any exception," Mr. Merrill tweeted.
Asked to respond, Mr. Sanders told reporters in Washington: "Secretary Clinton is entitled to her point of view. My job today is to focus on the impeachment trial."
A Quick Check On the Polls
A CNN survey released Wednesday showed Mr. Sanders with a lead in a national debate-qualifying poll for the first time, but a Monmouth University poll released the same day showed Mr. Biden in front.
In the CNN poll, Mr. Sanders had 27 percent support and Mr. Biden had 24 percent. The difference between the two was within the margin of error. The Monmouth poll, by contrast, showed Mr. Biden at 30 percent and Mr. Sanders at 23 percent.
In both polls, Ms. Warren was in third with 14 percent support.
Infrastructure Plan From Bloomberg
Michael R. Bloomberg wants to fix America's potholes. Really.
His infrastructure plan, released Wednesday, includes a $ 1 billion annual "pothole fund" as well as $ 850 billion over 10 years for capital investment in roads, bridges, freight and other infrastructure; $ 100 billion over 10 years to fix water systems; and a tripling of federal investment in public transportation.
Mr. Bloomberg laid out the plan in a speech at the United States Conference of Mayors. Citing his experience as mayor of New York City, he promised to hold states accountable for finishing the projects they start, and maintaining their infrastructure. At the same time, he pledged to put more power in the hands of local authorities.
If elected president, he said, he would create a "national map" of all roads, trains, air, freight and other transit routes, and set clear metrics to measure the health of the nation's infrastructure.
In Other News
Ms. Warren released a plan to "restore integrity and competence to government." Among other things, she proposed establishing a Justice Department task force to investigate corruption under the Trump administration.
Mr. Biden outlined his foreign policy agenda in an essay for Foreign Affairs magazine.'

Harris Said To Consider Supporting Biden's Run

Texto completo: The move, which would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial, could enhance her chances of becoming vice president but could also anger liberals in California.
Senator Kamala Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to multiple Democratic officials familiar with her deliberations. Such a move could lift Mr. Biden's campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris's chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California.
An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.
Yet she and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.
"Senator Harris remains focused on the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump," said Chris Harris, a spokesman for the senator. "No decisions have been made about whether she will endorse, which candidate, nor when an endorsement decision will be made."
Democrats close to Ms. Harris said she wanted to carefully consider the potential impact of her endorsement; was mindful that two of her female colleagues, Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, were still in the race; and was uneasy about the prospect of backing a candidate only to see him or her lose California.
Mr. Biden has lavished praise on Ms. Harris since she departed the race, predicting she would have a wealth of political opportunities in the future. And when asked directly if he would consider her as his running mate, he said, "Of course I would."
A Biden-Harris rapprochement would represent an extraordinary turnaround in their relationship after she so memorably confronted him on the debate stage last summer. Yet their would-be alliance is less surprising on closer inspection.
At the outset of the Democratic contest, they were collegial with each other. That was in large part because Ms. Harris served as state attorney general in California at the same time that Mr. Biden's son Beau was attorney general of Delaware, and the two young, ambitious Democrats had bonded. (Beau Biden died in 2015.)
But Ms. Harris's friendship with the former vice president became badly strained after the first primary debate, in June, when she criticized him for his past opposition to school busing.
Ms. Harris was trying to loosen Mr. Biden's grip on African-American primary voters, and her searing reference to her own childhood experience with integration might have been the high point of her campaign. But it came at the expense of an older, white candidate who was already fending off questions about his record on matters of race. And Mr. Biden was personally stung by her attack, his advisers said, because he considered her a friend.
Yet Ms. Harris's surge in the polls did not last, and the two candidates never sparred again in the same way. By October, aides to both Democrats recall, they were getting along well when they ran into each other at the Des Moines airport before heading to Ohio for the debate there.
More significant than their personal rapport, a Harris endorsement of Mr. Biden would be politically useful for both of them.
A 55-year-old woman of African and Indian descent with law enforcement credentials, Ms. Harris was already likely to be on Mr. Biden's short list, should he emerge as the nominee. Yet she could bolster her chances to be his running mate if she backed his campaign at a critical time, particularly if he did not win in either Iowa or New Hampshire next month and needed a boost in Nevada and South Carolina. And even if she is not chosen for vice president, she would be a leading contender for a cabinet post, such as attorney general.
For Mr. Biden, who is working to consolidate support from Democratic leaders as Senator Bernie Sanders's progressive candidacy gains strength, an endorsement from Ms. Harris would signal that party leaders were rallying behind his candidacy and offer him a well-known surrogate to stump on his behalf as the race goes on.
The risk for Ms. Harris would be if she were to get behind Mr. Biden only to see him lose in California, which votes on March 3 as part of Super Tuesday. A survey of the state's Democratic voters, conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California survey, found that Mr. Biden was in second place to Mr. Sanders, of Vermont. But the poll highlighted the strength of the progressive bloc in the state: Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren combined were capturing 50 percent of the vote.
Rose Kapolczynski, a longtime Democratic strategist in California, said Ms. Harris would not damage her prospects for re-election in 2022 by backing Mr. Biden. But if Democrats were to lose the presidency this fall, supporting him could shape how she was perceived by the left, were she to run again for president four years from now.
"It just depends on where she wants to go," Ms. Kapolczynski said. "Is she interested in vice president or a cabinet position? Or is she looking ahead to another campaign and how she'll be positioned then?"
Bill Carrick, another California consultant and an adviser to Senator Dianne Feinstein, also said it would be unlikely that voters in the state would "make a judgment about the Senate race next time out based on who she endorsed in the presidential race." But Mr. Carrick added that Mr. Biden's multiracial coalition overlapped with Ms. Harris's own core base of support and that it would be logical for her to side with him.
"She's going to have a lot of people allied with her who will be for Joe," he said.

Texto completo: Christopher Ingraham's Jan. 12 Business Perspective article, 'What political commentators often get wrong about life in rural America,' stated that 'Rural Americans do care about the news,' essentially saying there was little difference in news- consumption habits and interest in major news topics between rural and urban Americans. Fair enough.
However, the article also declared that Americans in rural areas 'watch the same cable TV talk shows and read the same national news websites as people anywhere else' without providing any supporting data. Left unsaid was the percentage of-conservative-to-right-wing news sources (Fox News, National Review, Breitbart, InfoWars, etc.) compared with moderate-to-liberal-skewing news sources (NPR, Politico, the New York Times, the Guardian, etc.)-that these rural populations consume.
Given the degree to which specific news sources shape political opinions as well as determining a grasp of reality, a more in-depth comparative analysis of the rural vs. urban news sources would have given readers a better perspective on why the divide between these two populations continues.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the first week of November, the police in San Francisco and New York responded to a series of telephone calls claiming that hostages were being held in the homes of Adam Mosseri, a senior Facebook executive.
The calls appeared to be coming from inside the homes.
Officers arrived in force and barricaded the streets outside. Twice.
But after tense, hourslong standoffs, they realized the calls were hoaxes. There were no hostages, and no one in the homes had called the police.
Mosseri is one of a number of tech executives who have been targeted recently in so-called swatting incidents. Swatting is online lingo used to describe when people call the police with false reports of a violent crime of some sort inside a home, hoping to persuade them to send a SWAT team.
These episodes have become more common in communities rich with tech companies and their billionaire executives, like the Bay Area and Seattle, according to six police departments contacted by The New York Times.
Exact numbers are unclear, police say, because there is no central repository of information for these sorts of attacks.
But as online discourse has become more combative and more personal, some in the industry aren't surprised that tech executives - the people who decide what is posted on social media and who is barred from it - have become regular targets.
Swattings have spiked at Facebook in particular, according to local police departments and security officials at the company, which in recent years has cracked down on false accounts, threatening language and other types of content that violates its rules. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding the attacks.
Mosseri declined to comment, and a Facebook spokesman, Anthony Harrison, said in a statement that "because these things deal with security matters and our employees, we are unable to comment."
The attacks have been aided by forums that have sprung up both on the public internet and on the camouflaged sites of the so-called dark web. These forums name thousands of people, from high-ranking executives to their extended families, who could be targets, providing cellphone numbers, home addresses and other information. Some even discuss techniques that can be used - like cheap, online technology that can spoof a phone number and make the police believe a 911 call is coming from a target's home.
In the eight months since one online forum was started, nearly 3,000 people have joined.
"Who should we do next?" read one message on the forum last month. The responses included gun emojis - the symbol, in swatting forums, for an attack in which the police were successfully called to the target's home. Many of the responses were laced with profanity, as well as suggestions for ex-girlfriends who should be swatted.
One forum names at least two dozen Facebook employees as potential targets. They range from executives to product engineers. Some forum participants said that they had been barred from Facebook or Instagram, and that Facebook employees were fair game because they "think they are god."
Swatting started in the combative world of online gaming. It was a way to terrorize someone more famous, get even with a rival or retaliate against someone with different political views.
Provoking a heavily armed police response presents obvious risks. Last year, a 26-year-old California man was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for calling in dozens of fake emergency calls, including one that led to the fatal police shooting of Andrew Finch, a Kansas resident.

Searching for President Trump's political ancestors Hal Burdett

Texto completo: If politically polarized Americans agree upon anything, it is that they have never before seen a political figure quite like President Donald John Trump.
Early in his presidency, Trump embraced the image of Andrew Jackson as the historic predecessor with whom he most identified. Indeed, a portrait of the seventh president peers down in the background of many of the 45th president's oval office pronouncements.
Old Hickory's support of the Trail of Tears, marching thousands of Native Americans to their death or eternal incarceration on reservations, foreshadows Trump's obsession with a border wall to prevent the crossing of thousands of Latinos fleeing oppression, violence, and poverty in hope of finding a better life. And Jackson's steadfast backing of the 1828 Tariff of Abominations may be seen as a harbinger of Trump's taxes on imports from China and Europe.
But Jackson's persistent opposition to the electoral college - Trump's lifeline to the presidency - is a key issue over which the two presidents would obviously part ways. Moreover, the only president to serve in both the American Revolution and the War of 1812, most assuredly would not have pleaded bone spurs to opt-out of the Battle of New Orleans.
Historians and pundits have mined the past, literature, and mythology in search of a figure real or imagined whom Trump most resembles. The candidates offered range from Pitchfork Ben Tillman and Huey Long to Benito Mussolini and King Lear.
Writer and book critic Katy Waldman feels Lear is "strikingly archetypal, the consummate narcissist, the consummate chauvinist, the consummate unscrupulous businessman..." Waldman points out that Lear is "the capricious, brooding monarch, ensconced in melancholy. The vain king engaged in hollow self-flattery while his empire buckles under him."
Adrian Mercer, a London School of Economics professor, believes that the historic figure Trump conjures up is former Louisiana governor and U.S. Senator Huey Long. Mercer compares their "bombastic rhetoric, narcissistic personalities, cynical use of patronage, addiction to power, (and) calculated manipulation of the media."
He observes that both Long and the current president deployed executive action and used the power of their elective offices "to deflect criticism, obscure facts, intimidate opponents, and confuse critics who attempt to highlight the gap between their rhetoric and their actions."
New York Times columnist Jamille Bouie views former South Carolina governor and U.S. Sen. Pitchfork Ben Tillman as Trump's spiritual forerunner. Tillman weaponized racism to achieve political office and power. As much as any politician, he was the father of Jim Crowism in the south, seeing to it that poll taxes and literacy tests were codified to keep blacks out of voting booths.
Bouie finds similarities between Trump and Tillman in their capitalizing on racial tensions to launch their political careers, and their "coarse, vulgar, and violent rhetoric... to build a constituency among white men who feel ignored and disadvantaged, angered, and alienated."
Ruth Ben-Chiat, a scholar of Italian history, sees in Trump more than a little of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, from their unorthodox doctrines and tactics to their conviction that political systems in their countries were broken and only they could fix them.
Like Trump, Ben-Chiat claims, Mussolini was "a mercurial hothead (who) reveled in his role as a political disrupter. (Mussolini's) crisis mongering platforms contained a confusing blend of socialist and nationalist tenets, trafficking in contradiction and paradox, the better to challenge traditional ideas about politics."
Perhaps Trump's brand of policy confusion and political disorder defies comparison. Just as 'McCarthyism' - a synonym for accusations without regard to evidence - is red-baiting U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy's contribution to the English language, future generations may well have 'Trumpism' in their lexicon.
The only question is whether it will signify political chaos, a political messianic complex, or something else.
Hal Burdett is the former vice president of an international humanitarian organization and a political writer for newspapers and magazines in Washington, Baltimore, and Annapolis. He lives in Annapolis.

An ode to an actor of impeccable character

Texto completo: It's not often that I cry during the SAG Awards. But tears were shed on Sunday night, when Tony Shalhoub and his fellow cast members from 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' gave impassioned shout-outs to their colleague Brian Tarantina, who died in November.
Fans of the show remember Tarantina as Jackie, the irascible emcee at the Gaslight comedy club. But I remember him as Brian, an old friend with whom I had regrettably lost touch but whose career I had followed with rooting interest over the past 30 years.
The last time I saw Brian on screen was in 'The Kitchen,' an uneven urban crime drama set in Hell's Kitchen " where, coincidentally, we first met. I don't recall the specific circumstances, but it was probably at the Film Center Cafe, where writers, actors, musicians and other ne'er-do-wells would gather till the wee hours.
I was a fan of Brian's before I met him, having seen him on Broadway in 1985 in a play titled 'The Boys of Winter,' in which he played a U.S. Marine in Vietnam. (Frank Rich decimated the production in the New York Times, but singled out Brian and co-ensemble players D.W. Moffet and Ving Rhames for showing 'the most dignity under duress.') Like Rich, I was astonished by Brian's performance, and I was genuinely star-struck when I started bumping into him, harboring a not-so-secret crush that he humored with grace, calling me 'Annie' with an affectionate wink as he slung an arm around my shoulder to tell one more New York yarn in the raspy patois of his early heroes, James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. He caught and held me when I collapsed in tears at the wake of a mutual friend who died of AIDS in the early 1990s. He was, to put it simply, an all-time great hang.
Brian lived the life of a typical actor on the rise during those years, onstage and in movies and television " I remember running lines with him when he scored a small part in the John Candy comedy 'Uncle Buck,' and he had a running gig on the soap opera 'One Life to Live.' After I left New York, I would always brighten when I saw him show up in various movies " there he was in 'Donnie Brasco'! 'Summer of Sam'! 'Ghost Town'! If I saw him in a film I was reviewing, I would always try to name-check Brian, not only because he added an indelible comic touch, however brief, but as a sort of smoke signal across the years, to let him know that Annie was still his biggest fan.

As gratifying as it was to see him still working, I never thought Brian got the screen time an actor of his gifts and natural charisma deserved. Since seeing him onstage in 1985, I always thought he had the makings of a Bogart-esque leading man: rough-edged, unconventionally handsome, innately funny, a little bit dangerous. I was thrilled when he showed up as Bootsy the newsstand owner on 'Gilmore Girls,' and then on 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' " both shows created by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, who finally seemed to see Brian the same way I did. 'He came in with that voice and that timing, and he made every scene better. And weirder,' Daniel Palladino said in a statement issued after Brian's untimely death, recalling their early work together. 'Every moment was completely unique. You can't describe a guy like Brian, you just had to be there.'
One way to describe a guy like Brian is that he was a character actor " once a staple of classic cinema, now somewhat endangered. In film's Golden Age, supporting players and frequent Oscar nominees such as Walter Brennan, Peter Lorre, Agnes Moorehead and Thelma Ritter epitomized the distinctive artistry of character actors, who, with their unusual looks, exquisite judgment and fine calibration, weren't just the glue in the movies they were in but added crucial energy and visual interest. Decades later, J.T. Walsh, Jack Warden, Dianne Wiest and Linda Hunt would personify that ineffable combination of eccentricity and versatility that allows a great character actor to simultaneously stand out and disappear into a seamless whole.
Is there such a thing as a character actor anymore? Over the decades, casting decisions in Hollywood have come to hinge far more on preexisting fame than on raw talent or idiosyncratic x-factors; to get a movie financed, especially overseas, producers need stars, not just in leading roles but in supporting ones as well. And character actors are becoming stars in their own right. Thanks to the gritty aesthetic of the 1970s, would-be character actors such as Al Pacino and Gene Hackman became marquee names. And the independent films of the '80s and '90s helped nudge audience tastes enough that actors who might have once been limited to character roles became stars in their own right, from Willem Dafoe and Tilda Swinton to LaKeith Stanfield and Benicio Del Toro.
Today, gifted character actors are just as likely to swing between leading and supporting roles. And as Hollywood becomes more inclusive in its storytelling, performers who once might have been marginalized as 'ethnic' bit players are able to come into their own as the leads they deserve to be. Proliferating platforms and peak TV have proved to be a boon: Thanks to the obsessive culture of binge-watching, actors who might once have been forgotten are inspiring their own fan bases.
Hit shows such as 'Game of Thrones' and 'The Night Of' are providing sensational showcases for people such as Peter Dinklage, Gwendoline Christie and Bill Camp. Brian was one of countless character actors for whom 'The Sopranos' was a godsend. And 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' has made his fellow character actor Alex Borstein a breakout star, just as 'Girls' helped catapult the career of Adam Driver.
Of course, Driver is now a leading man, competing for an acting Oscar with the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio, Joaquin Phoenix and Antonio Banderas, while bona fide movie star Brad Pitt is competing in the supporting category alongside Tom Hanks and Pacino. Appropriately enough, Pitt is the front-runner in that race for portraying a stuntman in 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' Quentin Tarantino's ode to those legions of unsung not-quite-stars who know precisely what it takes to hold a movie together and make it better. And weirder.
I'd like to think Brian would approve. But I'd like even more to have seen him in the movie.

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have evidence indicating Jeff Bezos' girlfriend provided text messages to her brother that he then sold to the National Enquirer for its article about the Amazon.com Inc. founder's affair, according to people familiar with the matter.
The text messages, which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, were among the materials turned over to federal prosecutors as part of their investigation into whether American Media Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer, attempted to extort Mr. Bezos, the people said. The U.S. attorney's office has also been investigating whether Mr. Bezos' phone was hacked , according to the people.
The evidence gathered by federal prosecutors includes a May 10, 2018, text message sent from the phone of Lauren Sanchez, Mr. Bezos' girlfriend, to her brother Michael Sanchez containing a flirtatious message from the Amazon chief, the people said.
The Enquirer quoted the text in its January 2019 article about Mr. Bezos' extramarital affair with Ms. Sanchez. A July 3, 2018, text message sent from Ms. Sanchez's phone to her brother's includes a photo of a shirtless Mr. Bezos.
Mr. Bezos' security consultant, Gavin de Becker, suggested in an opinion article last year for the Daily Beast that Saudi Arabia might have had a hand in the Enquirer's reporting on Mr. Bezos. The claim resurfaced this week after a forensic audit commissioned by Mr. Bezos alleged that his phone was hacked using a WhatsApp account associated with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

How, if at all, might public and law-enforcement scrutiny of people and events related to Mr. Bezos' private life affect his stewardship of Amazon? Join the conversation below.
The text messages reviewed by the Journal, as well as a $200,000 payment Mr. Sanchez received from the Enquirer under an October 2018 contract the Journal also reviewed, supports American Media's earlier statements that he was the source for the National Enquirer's article.
The Saudi government said the allegation that the crown prince hacked Mr. Bezos' phone was absurd and called for an investigation.
"In September of 2018, Michael Sanchez began providing all materials and information to our reporters," a spokesman for American Media said Friday. He added that any suggestion that a third party, such as Saudi Arabia, "was involved in or in any way influenced our reporting is false."
Mr. Sanchez declined to comment on the texts or his contract with American Media. "With spoon-fed lies and half-truths, Wall Street Journal keeps getting it wrong," Mr. Sanchez said in an emailed statement.
Ms. Sanchez didn't respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Mr. Bezos declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors haven't charged Michael Sanchez, Lauren Sanchez or anyone else with a crime in the probe.
Mr. Bezos' affair with Ms. Sanchez, a former television reporter who started an aerial film-production company, was publicized the same month he and his now ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, said their 25-year marriage was ending . They agreed to a divorce settlement in April.
Mr. Bezos, the richest man in the world, made a public appearance with Ms. Sanchez at an event in Mumbai on Jan. 16.
The Amazon chief is the owner of the Washington Post, where the late columnist Jamal Khashoggi wrote critically of the kingdom's leadership before he was slain in October 2018 by a Saudi security team . The CIA, in a secret assessment reviewed by the Journal, said that Prince Mohammed likely ordered Mr. Khashoggi's death, although it acknowledged it didn't have direct evidence of a kill order by the Saudi crown prince.
On Wednesday, United Nations officials probing Mr. Khashoggi's death called on U.S. authorities to investigate the findings of the audit commissioned by Mr. Bezos.
The October 2018 contract between Mr. Sanchez and American Media gave the company exclusive rights to "certain information, photographs, and text messages documenting an affair between Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez."
Mr. Sanchez, a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges, declared in his contract with American Media that he acquired the texts and photographs lawfully, according to the agreement.
The New York Times earlier reported that American Media provided evidence to federal prosecutors that Ms. Sanchez sent texts to her brother involving Mr. Bezos.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Prosecution witness Rosie Perez testified in chilling detail Friday about the phone call when her sobbing friend Annabella Sciorra finally identified Hollywood deal-maker Harvey Weinstein as the man who violently raped her just months before.
"She told me that it was in fact Harvey Weinstein," Perez declared as the clearly annoyed defendant fiercely chewed a wad of gum at the defense table. "(She said) he pushed his way through the door, and she was crying and saying, 'I tried to fight back. I tried, I tried!'
"And then she said that she ended up in the bedroom with her hands pinned over her head and that he raped her ... She swore me not to tell anyone, and I said, 'You should go to the police.'"
But Sciorra did not, instead waiting more than a quarter-century before testifying Thursday against accused serial sexual predator Weinstein. The Oscar-winning producer faces a potential life sentence if convicted of the top count in his trial for sexually abusing two New York women.
Perez told the Manhattan jury of seven men and five women that she "put two and two together" as Sciorra spoke from London about the wintry night of her assault a few months before. Sciorra was saying that she was worried that an unspecified man "was harassing her ... she was afraid he was going to get her."
Perez said she too heard a rumor that Weinstein was stalking Sciorra, with the one-time star of "The Sopranos" bursting into tears.
"She started screaming, 'Oh my God! Oh my God!'and she started crying hysterically," recounted Perez. "That's when she started telling me detailed things about the rape ... and she was very, very very distraught."
Defense attorney Damon Cheronis, on cross-examination, suggested Perez's account of what happened hewed a little too closely to Sciorra's testimony, although the "Do the Right Thing" actress insisted the two never discussed the rape after the two initial phone calls in 1993-94.
Perez recalled how Sciorra first told her what happened "in a very strange whisper of a voice" without ever mentioning Weinstein shortly after the alleged rape inside the actress' Manhattan apartment.
Later, as her testimony wound down, Perez took note of Weinstein's dark demeanor.
"I suspect Harvey Weinstein is very angry on account of how hard he's chewing that gum," she said. "Looks tense."
Perez testified after the defense seemed to imply Sciorra had lied one day earlier during her five hours on the witness stand -- although defense lawyer Arthur Aidala denied that was the case.
"The theory is that there was no fear, and obviously no force, and that everything was consensual," said Aidala. "Everything that happened was 100% consensual."
Earlier in the day, a private eye testified how Weinstein e-mailed him a "red flag list" with dozens of names to investigate as possible sources for reporters digging into allegations of his long-rumored aberrant sexual behavior. Alleged Weinstein rape victims Sciorra and Rose McGowan made the Harvey hit list, said witness Sam Anson.
The name of actress Sciorra was highlighted in red, according to Anson.
The investigator recounted an August 2017 phone call from an "agitated, stressed, not happy" Weinstein in the weeks before The New York Times and The New Yorker magazine exposed his alleged sexual assaults on a number of prominent women.
"Generally, Mr. Weinstein was concerned the people on the list might be providing information about him to journalists," said Anson, adding that he never investigated anyone in the end.
While Weinstein would eventually face roughly 90 accusers, including some with stomach-turning tales of abuse, he only fretted during a 20-minute phone call that the people on his list "would discuss his sexual conduct in a negative way," recalled Anson.
McGowan has alleged that she was raped by Weinstein at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. According to Anson, Weinstein mentioned that McGowan was supposedly trying to extort money from him, although she had received a $100,000 settlement after the assault.
The 67-year-old Weinstein, sitting at the defense table in a black suit, greeted Anson with a wave before his testimony began.
Day three of the trial began with a highly-regarded psychiatrist, called by prosecutors, explaining that most rape victims know their attackers and often hide the horrifying details from others.
Dr. Barbara Ziv, who testified for the prosecution in the Bill Cosby and Jerry Sandusky criminal trials, offered her expert take on the popularly accepted myths surrounding rapes and other sex crimes inside a packed courtroom in the Weinstein trial.
Ziv particularly dismissed three of the most widely-accepted misconceptions: Rape most often happens between strangers, victims often resist their attackers, and victims always report the crime to law enforcement.
"At least 85% of sexual assault is perpetrated by somebody who is known to the victim," said Ziv. "Physical resistance, other than struggling, is pretty rare ... Screaming, yelling, hitting, punching, biting -- although that happens, it's rare."
One day after actress Sciorra testified about allegedly getting raped by Weinstein but never reporting the crime, Ziv explained that her reaction was typical.
"As devastating as sexual abuse is, most individuals think 'OK, if I can put in behind me, I can move on with my life. ... I can handle the trauma, but God forbid they ruin the rest of my life,'" she said.
Most women "want to put it in a box and forget about it," she continued. "But they can't."

Texto completo: LUANDA, Angola - Isabel dos Santos, Africa's richest woman and the daughter of Angola's former president, is set to be charged with committing crimes to enrich herself, after an investigation into embezzlement of millions of dollars from the state oil company, which she once headed, Angolan officials said.
Angola's attorney general, Hélder Pitta Grós, said late Wednesday during a news conference in the capital, Luanda, that dos Santos would be charged with "money laundering, influence peddling, harmful management" and "forgery of documents, among other economic crimes" committed when she ran the oil company, Sonangol.
"I can say that from the investigation we conducted, we will now move to criminal charges," Pitta Grós said in remarks that aired on the Angolan state-run television channel TPA.
Álvaro Joäo, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, clarified in a Thursday interview that formal charges had not yet been filed, but were likely, and that they were part of an investigation that began in 2018.
"These are notyet formal charges, as investigations continue, and if needed we will then charge her and the others," he said.
Dos Santos lives in Lisbon and London and owns luxurious homes in Monte Carlo and Dubai. She and four of her business associates, all Portuguese nationals, would face charges, Pitta Grós said, adding, "We have enough reasons to prosecute these people.
"At this moment our concern is that they be notified of the charges brought against them, and that they present themselves voluntarily to the court in order for them to be able to defend themselves in the best possible way, voluntarily," he said. "If we are not able to achieve this, then we will resort to existing legal instruments to bring them to court."
When asked if his office knew of dos Santos' whereabouts, he seemed unsure.
"We only know from the social media that she has been living in London and Russia," Pitta Grós said.
The announcement came days after a trove of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The New York Times revealed dos Santos' efforts to enrich herself through shady business dealings that helped build her estimated $2 billion fortune.
Angola has sought help from Portugal, its former colonial ruler, in the corruption investigation. Dos Santos has links to several Portuguese companies, including EuroBic, the European arm of an Angolan bank in which dos Santos owns a 42.5% stake.
On Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that a EuroBic banker who managed the Sonangol account, Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, was found dead Wednesday night at his house in Lisbon. Lusa reported that his death was most likely a suicide, citing a police source.
Pitta Grós traveled to Lisbon on Thursday to meet with the Portuguese attorney general, Lucilia Gago, and discuss the allegations against dos Santos, among other issues, according to Portugal's public service broadcaster, Rádio e Televisăo de Portugal.
Angola has immense oil and mineral wealth, but many of its people live in deep poverty without access to basic services, and the country is rife with corruption.
The recently leaked documents provide a detailed account of how dos Santos exploited her country's resources, acquiring stakes in Angola's lucrative diamond industry, banks, the leading cement manufacturer and the largest mobile phone company - often through orders signed by her father, José Eduardo dos Santos. She has denied any wrongdoing and has long maintained that she is a self-made woman.
The leaked materials revealed that in November 2017, when dos Santos was chairwoman of Sonangol, $57 million was transferred from the oil company to a Dubai company owned by a friend of hers. In the hours after her father's successor announced that she was being fired from Sonangol that month, an additional $38 million was transferred from the company, draining its account at EuroBic.
Pitta Grós said Wednesday news conference that dos Santos had not shown any interest in cooperating with Angolan authorities in their investigation and had fled the country the same day she was summoned for questioning.
Dos Santos recently denied any wrongdoing in an interview with the BBC, calling the inquiry into her finances a "political persecution."
"My companies are funded privately. We work with commercial banks. Our holdings are private holdings," she said, later adding, "You cannot just say because you are someone's child, you are immediately guilty."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Armed with rifles and explosives, about a dozen al-Shabab fighters destroyed an American surveillance plane as it was taking off and ignited an hourslong gunfight this month on a sprawling military base in Kenya that houses U.S. troops. By the time al-Shabab was done, portions of the airfield were burning, and three Americans were dead.
Surprised by the attack, U.S. commandos took around an hour to respond. Many of the local Kenyan forces, assigned to defend the base, hid in the grass, while other U.S. troops and support staff were corralled into tents, with little protection, to wait out the battle. It would require hours to evacuate one of the wounded to a military hospital in Djibouti, roughly 1,500 miles away.
The brazen assault at Manda Bay, a sleepy seaside base near the Somali border, on Jan. 5, was largely overshadowed by the crisis with Iran after the killing of that country's most important general two days earlier and is only now drawing closer scrutiny from Congress and Pentagon officials.
But the storming of an airfield used by the U.S. military so alarmed the Pentagon that it immediately sent about 100 troops from the 101st Airborne Division to establish security at the base. Army Green Berets from Germany were shuttled to Djibouti, the Pentagon's major hub in Africa, in case the entire base was in danger of being taken by al-Shabab, an East African terrorist group affiliated with al-Qaida.
"The assault represented a serious security lapse given how much of a target the base was and its location near the border with Somalia," said Murithi Mutiga, the International Crisis Group's Horn of Africa project director, based in Nairobi, Kenya.
Many details of the attack remain murky, and the military's Africa Command has released only scant particulars pending an investigation. But the deaths of the three Americans - one Army soldier and two Pentagon contractors - marked the largest number of U.S. military-related fatalities in Africa since four soldiers were killed in an ambush in Niger in October 2017.
The Kenya attack underscores the U.S. military's limits on the continent, where a lack of intelligence, along with Manda Bay's reputation as a quiét and unchallenged locale, allowed a lethal attack.
The deaths also signify a grim expansion of the campaign waged by the United States against al-Shabab - often confined to Somalia, but in this case spilling over into Kenya despite an escalating U.S. air campaign in the region. Kenya is a new addition to the list of countries where Americans have been killed in combat since the attacks of Sept. 11,2001, joining Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Niger, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.
The attack is raising new and complex questions about the U.S. military mission on the continent, where more than 5,000 troops serve, especially as the Pentagon weighs the potential withdrawal of hundreds of forces from West Africa to better counter threats from Russia and China. A Pentagon proposal to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Africa drew sharp criticism last week from senior lawmakers of both parties, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close adviser to President Donald Trump.
This article is based on interviews with a dozen U.S. military officials or other people who have been briefed on the attack. Several spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss aspects of a security failure that is now under investigation.
Early on the morning of Jan. 5, Dustin Harrison, 47, and Bruce Triplett, 64, two experienced pilots and contractors with L3 Technologies, a Pentagon contractor that helps conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions around the world, were taxiing their Beechcraft King Air 350 on Manda Bay's tarmac. They throttled down their engines, according to one person familiar with the attack. The two men reported that they saw animals darting across the runway.
They were wrong. The animals were in fact al-Shabab fighters who had infiltrated the base's outer perimeter-a poorly defended fence line - before heading to the base's airstrip. As the twin-propeller Beechcraft, loaded with sensors and video equipment for surveillance, began to taxi, al-Shabab fighters fired a rocket-propelled grenade into the plane, killing Harrison and Triplett. With the plane on fire, a third contractor, badly burned in the rear of the aircraft, crawled out to safety.
The al-Shabab fighters were not done. In the ensuing chaos, they made quick work of a significant portion of the U.S. fleet of aircraft - a mix of six surveillance aircraft and medical evacuation helicopters on the ground at the time. The al-Shabab fighters also destroyed a fuel storage area, rendering the airfield next to useless. The attack most likely cost the Pentagon millions of dollars in damages.
Spc. Henry Mayfield Jr., 23, of the Army was in a nearby truck acting as an air traffic controller when he was killed in the gunfight, according to a person familiar with the incident. His colleague inside the truck, another American, escaped and hid in the grass to avoid the insurgents. He was found hours later.
Manda Bay is at the southern edge of an archipelago of U.S. outposts used in the fight against al-Shabab in East Africa. It took about eight hours to fly the burned contractor to Djibouti for hospital-level care, according to the person familiar with the attack, underscoring a recurring vulnerability for U.S. personnel spread across the continent. Two U.S. service members were also wounded in the attack.

Texto completo: Headnote FOR THE CAUSE
Maya Moore, the WNBA star regarded as one of the greats of the sport, will sit out for a second straight season and remove herself from contention for the Olympics so she can continue to push for criminal justice reform and the release of Jonathan Irons, a man she believes is innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to prison.
"I'm in a really good place right now with my life, and I don't want to change anything," Moore, an eight-year Minnesota Lynx forward, told The New York Times in a telephone interview this week from her home in Atlanta. "Basketball has not been foremost in my mind. I've been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I've been able to be there for Jonathan."
Irons, now 39, whom she met in 2017 during a visit to the Jefferson City Correctional Center in Missouri, is serving a 50-year sentence after being convicted of burglary and assaulting a homeowner with a gun. Born into severe poverty, Irons was 16 when the incident occurred in a St. Louis suburb. The homeowner testified that Irons was the perpetrator, but there were no corroborating witnesses, fingerprints, footprints, DNA or blood evidence to connect Irons to the crime, his lawyers said.
Irons, who is African American, was tried as an adult and found guilty by an all-white jury.
Moore shocked women's basketball last winter by announcing that she was taking a season off to support Irons as he appealed his conviction. Only 29 years old at the time and still in her prime, she left the door open for a return to the Olympics this summer in Tokyo and the WNBA, where she has led the Lynx to four championships since her rookie season in 2011.
Moore said she was fatigued by the grinding year-round schedule that top female basketball players endure to supplement a WNBA salary of roughly $120,000 a season - about one quarter of what LeBron James makes in a single regular- season game. (A new labor pact will boost WNBA salaries and benefits in coming years.) Moore tried to maximize her earnings by playing in leagues around the globe throughout the year with little rest. Including the Olympics, she had rarely had time away from competition since her teens.
Now, her decision to take a second year off is a blow to women's basketball. Moore's haul of Olympic gold medals from the 2012 and 2016 Summer Games, WNBA titles and her leadership of two undefeated championship teams at the University of Connecticut qualify her as one of the greatest winners that basketball has ever known. She also has a charisma that has endeared her to fans and corporate sponsors.
Her absence will affect more than the marketing of the women's game.
The Lynx, who have lost in the first round of the playoffs the past two years, could use her leadership. So could the Olympic team, which was stunned by the University of Oregon in a November exhibition loss.
"We are going to miss Maya tremendously, but we also respect her decision," said Carol Callan, director of the U.S, national team. "A player of Maya's ability does not walk away from the gym lightly. Everyone feels it. The thing that makes her so special is her approach, her dedication, which has always been contagious for our team. We know how devoted she is to what she believes in, and that what she is doing is remarkable."
Asked during the Times interview this week if she would ever play again, Moore paused to consider her response. "I don't feel like this is the right time for me to retire," she said. "Retirement is something that is a big deal and there is a right way to do it well, and this is not the time for me."
Nonetheless, she added: "I have had such a unique experience in the game. I got to experience the best of my craft, and I did that multiple times. There is nothing more I wish I could experience."
Moore's family had come to know Irons through a prison ministry. He and Moore have become close friends, although she did not speak about their siblinglike bond until after 2016, when she began advocating criminal justice reform following a series of police shootings of unarmed black men and the killing of five law enforcement officers by a sniper in Dallas.
Moore, an evangelical Christian, spent much of her first year away from basketball ministering in Atlanta and spending time with her family. She spoke on panels and was interviewed multiple times on national television about Irons and changes she would like to see in the justice system, particularly in how it treats minorities and the poor.
She traveled often to her hometown Jefferson City, Missouri, to confer with Irons and his defense team, which she has helped pay for. Moore and her family also attended a series of courtroom hearings as Judge Daniel Green considered Irons' appeal.
In October, despite protests from state prosecutors, who argued that Irons' case should not be reviewed, Green heard nearly six hours of testimony. Moore watched as Irons took the witness stand in shackles to state his innocence and face cross-examination - something a public defender had kept him from doing at his original trial, citing his youth and lack of education.
Asked about the case this week, a spokesman for the Missouri Attorney General's Office declined to comment.

Fun with Family History

Hannah Barnes, 5, points to one of her great-grandparents as the family plays a family history trivia game during dinner Jan. 10 at the Barnes home in Vancouver. Charlotte Barnes said meals are often the only time they're all sitting together, so they like to tell family stories or play family history trivia games as they eat. Jonah and Charlotte Barnes' book “Turning Little Hearts,” an activity book “to connect children with their ancestors,” was recently released. It's available online and at Sunrise Bagels, 808 Harney St.
Samuel Barnes, 10, explains a map in his living room that shows where all of the family and extended family served their missions throughout the world.

‘Turning Little Hearts' workbook a page-turner
After Jonah and Charlotte Barnes learned about research linking children's knowledge of family history to their general well-being, the couple vowed to teach their own kids about their roots.
The Vancouver couple's new book, “Turning Little Hearts,” seeks to help other families do the same. The workbook contains 90-some activities to connect children to their ancestors.
“The point of the book is to help parents share stories in short, sweet, fun, engaging ways so children can learn the stories and not get bored by them,” said Charlotte, 34.
The effort doesn't have to be complicated for the parents, either.
“I'm terrified that people will think they have to be family history freaks or genealogists,” said Jonah, 36. “The point is just to tell more stories.”
The couple have six children, all younger than 10. They moved to Vancouver, where Jonah grew up, in 2017 after purchasing the Sunrise Bagels wholesale business. The book's origins, however, date to when the family lived in Arizona.
Jonah was working at his desk job when he felt his heart start to race and pound. At just 28, he thought he was having a heart attack.
“As a young guy, the illusion of invincibility and immortality vanished in an instant,” Jonah said.
He was diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, a type of irregular heartbeat that's not generally life-threatening.
“But I kept thinking, ‘What if I died?' Which made me think of my children. I wrote a history of who they are,” Jonah said. “I started looking at family history because I didn't know anything, and it changed the way I think.”
Charlotte noticed that their kids were keenly interested in the family tales. “The children could recite these stories to every detail,” she said.
Then Charlotte and Jonah happened upon Bruce Feiler's New York Times article “The Stories That Bind Us.”
The article cites research by Marshall Duke and Robyn Fivush. The psychologists developed a “Do You Know…?” scale based on 20 questions, including: Do you know how your parents met? Do you know which person in your family you look most like? Do you know some things that happened to your mom or dad when they were in school?
Duke and Fivush found that kids who know more about their family history have greater self-esteem and resilience.
“When we read that article, that's when it took off,” Charlotte said. “We started covering every wall with pictures.”
Charlotte and Jonah, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, already had experience researching their family histories. They met in the library at Brigham Young University doing just that. She thought he was cute, went up and said “hi.” A month later, they were engaged.
After his health scare, Jonah worked on a book about how family stories shape children, and he sent it to three publishers. One publisher was interested but didn't want the bulk of the book, just more activities like the 10 at the end that Charlotte developed. So she created many more.
“My sweet wife churned out over 90 of these things,” Jonah said. And those activities became the “Turning Little Hearts” workbook, published this month by Utah-based Cedar Fort ($14.99).
Some activities might be more pertinent for Latter-day Saints, for example the “Mission Map,” to mark where ancestors served as missionaries. But most activities would work for any family — drawing a map of ancestors' immigration routes, researching a namesake, or celebrating an ancestor's birthday.
Charlotte and Jonah stress that these activities can be easy. They are not about achieving Pinterest-levels of perfection.
For example, Charlotte's father, Robert Judson Clark, a Princeton University professor emeritus, died in 2011. To celebrate his birthday in August, the family ate his favorite treat, Pepperidge Farm Geneva cookies.
“You're always looking for things to do with your kids anyway. This is something that's meaningful. I have gained so much insight myself,” Charlotte said.
As she and Jonah delved into the benefits of knowing family history, they learned that ancestors' stories fill our need for belonging, while also lending a sense of uniqueness and strength. They show how ancestors' decisions affected their lives and even those of descendants, which can help young people develop forethought.
It's even good for kids to learn about the black sheep of the family, Jonah said. What's powerful is hearing about both ups and downs.
“Parents get hung up on teaching a lesson,” he said. “Don't overthink it. You don't have to have a great moral. It's letting kids know, ‘You're part of a bigger story. You're a chapter in a long book. You're more than some lonely kid in middle s

D.C. Memo: Got milk?

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week from Washington, the Senate impeachment trial, a look at Rep. Ilhan Omar’s time as Progressive Caucus whip, and a former EPA official on the PolyMet mine project.
Let’s get on with this.
A tale of two senators
The Senate trial is now in full swing and both sides are presenting opening arguments.
Due to Senate rules, which do not allow photography in the chamber, some outlets have hired sketch artists to visually represent the trial. Others are having fun.
The trial so far has involved long hours. Senators can only drink two things on the floor: water or milk.
Recently, I talked to Sen. Tina Smith about what she expects of the trial. For starters, Smith favors additional witness testimony during the trial: “I think trials have witnesses and we shouldn’t be afraid of the facts that these witnesses might bring forward.”
Back in Minnesota, MinnPost’s Peter Callaghan caught up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar at a GOTV rally on Friday.
“I don’t know how many days this is gonna last,” she said to reporters. “I just know that I have a constitutional duty to do my job.”
“I just want you to think: What can I do for Amy today?”
Ilhan Omar counts the votes
Rep. Ilhan Omar represents the Fifth District . She’s working on legislation. Constituent services. Fundraising. And she’s on television, responding to whatever remarks the President has made about her. But behind the scenes, and typically out of view, Omar has another job: Whip of the Progressive Caucus.
“Where nobody really expects you to do anything, there is actually more opportunity for you to do a lot more,” Omar said. “And that has been, and will always, I think, be part of my legacy as a freshman here.”
Read More at MinnPost.
PolyMet intrigue
A former federal official testified on Tuesday that state regulators asked his office to delay the submission of concerns about a key water permit for the PolyMet copper-nickel mine .
From MinnPost’s Walker Orenstein: “Kevin Pierard, who oversaw the permit at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said state officials asked him to submit concerns after a public comment period because those critiques would duplicate issues raised by environmental groups — but also because they would “create a good deal of press.”
By the numbers
* $342,870: The amount of money raised this year by the Committee For Stronger Rural Communities , a super PAC created by sugar beet interests to protect the Seventh District’s Rep. Collin Peterson.
* 15: The number of U.S House members involved in the Senate impeachment trial. Eight House Republicans were appointed to advise the President’s defense team. Seven Democrats were appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve as impeachment managers (effectively prosecutors). None are Minnesotans.
* 0: The amount of time Klobuchar will be able spend in Iowa during the Senate impeachment trial. Her daughter is working as an active surrogate for her while she’s out of state, temporarily taking over her Twitter account. Last night Klobuchar held a tele-town hall with Iowa voters.
The president next door
Manhattan is far from the Twin Cities, but The New York Times editorial board says Klobuchar is their candidate.
Kind of.
On Sunday, they endorsed both Klobuchar and Sen. Elizabeth Warren for President.
Before Klobuchar received the Times endorsement, she was touting an endorsement from the Quad-City Times, which covers two regions at the state-border: Davenport and Bettendorf in southeastern Iowa, and Rock Island, Moline, and East Moline in northwestern Illinois.
With the Iowa Caucus barely a week away (Feb. 3), The Des Moines Register will be releasing its endorsement this Saturday.
Zooming out a bit, here’s a snapshot of national opinion from the Morning Consult, which surveyed 12,402 Democratic primary voters, with a margin of error of +/- 1 percent.
* Former Vice President Joe Biden: 29%
* Sen. Bernie Sanders: 24%
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren: 15%
* Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg: 10%
* Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg: 8%
* Andrew Yang: 4%
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 3%
* Tom Steyer: 3%
* Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: 2%
In other news
* The Saudi crown prince hacked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s phone, according to a Guardian investigation.
* Glenn Greenwald, the journalist best known for releasing the Edward Snowden files, was charged with “cybercrimes” in Brazil that sound a lot like doing journalism.
* How worried should you be about this coronavirus outbreak?

Constance Grady for Vox : The controversy over the new immigration novel American Dirt, explained
If you’re not already following what’s going on with the newly released novel, American Dirt, this is a decent primer. In short: An author received a seven figure book deal to write a story about Mexican migrants. The book has had a large debut campaign, showing up on Oprah’s book list. The issue: Latinx writers, like Myriam Gurba, have widely panned the book, framing the portrayal as dehumanizing, insulting and distanced from reality.

Texto completo: Sorry, Adam Schiff, you're no John McCain. Unlike McCain, you sat on your hands when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014.
This truth bears pointing out in light of Rep. Schiff's reference Friday to the late Republican senator's comments on Ukraine. Speaking at President Trump's impeachment trial, Schiff played a video of McCain in which the former GOP presidential candidate explained why Vladimir Putin wanted to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty.
"Suppose Ukraine finally, after failing in 2004, gets it right, democracy, gets rid of corruption, economy's really improving, and it's right there on the border of Russia," McCain said, "I think it makes [Putin] very nervous if there were a success in Ukraine in bringing about a free and open society and economic success, which is not the case in Russia."
Schiff then capped off McCain's excerpt by taking credit for it. "Achieving the Ukrainian success that Sen. McCain and so many of us hoped for proved to be a daunting task," Schiff said. Rightly saluting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's election as a cause for anti-corruption efforts, Schiff argued that his, Zelensky's, and McCain's efforts in Ukraine have been catastrophically undermined by Trump.
This is a very creative retelling of history.
Yes, McCain was right to argue that the United States has a moral and material national interest in consolidating the democratic rule of law in Ukraine. But for Schiff to present himself as McCain's ally on this issue is simply absurd. Where McCain responded to Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine by calling on a "feckless" President Barack Obama to support Ukraine with lethal weapons and robust sanctions, Schiff's response was quite different.
When Russia first invaded Ukraine in March 2014, Schiff tried to deflect blame away from the Obama administration and onto the intelligence community. That same month, the California congressman cautioned against a tough response to Russia's aggression, warning, "The challenge is, we do need to have some kind of working relationship with Russia? And while we can impose these costs and take these steps, we’ve got to be mindful of the fact that they can impose their own costs on us."
A few months later, in July 2014, Russia-directed rebels used a Russian-provided missile system to down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 passenger airliner. How did Schiff respond to Obama's refusal to do anything about it?
Well, the 2020 impeachment McCain-Schiff was certainly nowhere to be seen. Things didn't improve much from there. A year later, Schiff was telling the New York Times only that "there has been a strong bipartisan well of support" for providing Ukraine with lethal arms.
The juxtaposition of Schiff 2020 and Schiff 2014-15 is thus pretty stunning. Where Schiff 2014-15 was happy to let Obama give Ukraine to a Russian invasion force and happy to restrain his own support for lethal weapons supplies to polite requests, Schiff 2020 pretends that he was the glorious ally to McCain's relentless opposition to Putin's aggression.
Schiff talks a lot about American leadership and his support for Ukrainian democracy. But, judged by his record before impeachment, from that point when the Russian guns first started firing, he has very little credibility.
The truth is clear. Sorry, Schiff, when it comes to Ukraine, you're no John McCain.

Texto completo: Bernie Bro-dom has broken out into civil war thanks to a single tweet shared by the presidential hopeful's Twitter account.
In a video later shared by Sen. Bernie Sanders, comedian and commentator Joe Rogan announced that he would likely vote for Sanders on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. Rogan didn't even stylize his suggestion as an endorsement, but Sanders reshared the video with his watermark in the corner. Chaos ensued. TweetRogan rests at a unique intersection of pop culture. He cut his teeth in stand-up and, after a number of other television gigs, became the host of Fear Factor and then a UFC commentator. As a result of his well-known and affable persona, as well as his refusal to take himself too seriously, his podcast earns hundreds of millions of downloads per month and features guests ranging from Mel Gibson and Alex Jones to Edward Snowden and Richard Dawkins. His politics have ranged from libertarian on issues like guns and drugs to outright left-wing on universal healthcare and foreign policy, and he's hosted just three candidates on his podcast this election cycle, all outsiders: Andrew Yang, Tulsi Gabbard, and Sanders.
Rogan is the exact cultural figure whom a candidate like Sanders needs in order to win the Democratic nomination. He's a bellwether of young people alienated by establishment politics and not terribly in touch with the concentrated cesspool of very online identity politics — to which most voters do not subscribe, by the way.
So of course, the most insufferable of the Bernie Bros went positively apoplectic.
Here's Eli Valley, the anti-Zionist "cartoonist" famous for depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raping President Barack Obama and deeming Bret Stephens and Bari Weiss of the New York Times "Nazi-friendly Jews."Tweet
Here's Carlos Maza, the self-described "Marxist pig" who curiously and quietly left Vox after deciding to wage war against YouTube for refusing to censor conservative comedian Steven Crowder and Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
TweetHere's Brianna Wu of Gamergate fame.TweetOther avid Sanders backers, such as Elizabeth Bruenig, Ryan Grim, and Krystal Ball, rightly noted that it would be moronic for Sanders to reject the endorsement of a figure as widely popular as Rogan. Meanwhile, opportunistic non-Sanders supporters on the Left, including an allegedly objective news reporter, clutched their pearls at the Rogan endorsement.
Here's Rolling Stone's Jamil Smith.Tweet
Here's gun-grabbing wannabe Shannon Watts.Tweet
And here's the Daily Beast's Sam Stein.
Tweet
The notion that Rogan is some sort of bigot is sheer lunacy. He routinely grills conservatives and liberals alike on his show, but his own views are quite left-wing, especially on social issues. He's supported gay rights for the entirety of his career, and he is broadly supportive of transgender rights as well. As a professional MMA commentator, the only bones he has ever picked with the contemporary transgender movement (or part of it, anyway) have been the push to put biological males who identify as women into women's contact sports (Rogan rightly notes that this poses severe risks) and the transitioning of young children.
But the worst people here are those who fail Rogan on their purity test while passing bigots who are backing or campaigning with Sanders.
Eli Valley has proudly defended both Linda Sarsour, the Louis Farrakhan buddy who found herself ousted from the Women's March for anti-Semitism, and Ilhan Omar, the congresswoman who can't go a month without accusing American Jews of dual loyalties to Israel or running cover for terrorism. Shannon Watts has also defended Sarsour, and Maza and Wu have repeatedly stuck their necks out for Omar. Smith and Stein, both respected journalists covering national politics, weighed in on a tweet about a popular podcast co-host yet did not utter a peep about Sanders bringing credibly accused domestic abuser Keith Ellison on the campaign trail, nor did they call on Sanders to reject the endorsement of flagrant misogynist Cenk Uygur.
Only Rogan failed the left-wing purity test, and it wasn't with all Bernie Bros or just Bernie Bros. The intersectional fissures in the Left's facade are deepening, and Rogan just marked the divide.

Dystopian: US college student imprisoned in China over satirical tweets criticizing Xi Jinping

Texto completo: A University of Minnesota student has been imprisoned over satirical social media posts about Xi Jinping in a chilling act of censorship that should make us all grateful for the First Amendment.
Chinese-born international student Luo Daiqing was originally detained in July, following his return home for the summer after completing his spring semester. He was then held until he was charged in November 2019. Axios just recently obtained the court documents which state that Daiqing is being punished for having posted images critical of the Chinese dictator to his anonymous Twitter account.
The news of this detention comes in light of the New York Times report on how people in China are being detained for their tweets. A human rights activist told the newspaper that they do not want to give up Twitter because “if we give up Twitter we are losing one of our last places to speak.” The report also said that the Chinese government deletes tweets itself when the activists refuse.
Sen. Ben Sasse released a statement calling on Xi Jinping to release the student immediately. The Nebraska Republican said, “This is what ruthless and paranoid totalitarianism looks like.” He was joined by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar who tweeted, “This is what ruthless totalitarianism looks like.” Seeing such similar condemnations come from across the U.S. political spectrum is a good sign that China is clearly in the wrong here. Tweet
Chinese censorship is nothing new, but this escalation to imprisoning someone with ties to the United States for satirical posts made while in our country should alarm us all. It’s part of a broader, dystopian trend of Chinese technological interference.
The social media app TikTok has drawn blowback for reportedly sending user information back to the Chinese government. A lawsuit even alleges that the app contains Chinese surveillance software. It is worth considering just how connected these two things may be.
The most harrowing aspect of this student’s struggles is that the Chinese government used technology to find the owner of an anonymous account and then have them detained for months before being charged for “denigrating the national leader’s image” and then being sentenced for “provocation.”
The reason that this story is so unthinkable for U.S. residents is because we are blessed to live in a country that continues to retain freedom of speech. The First Amendment is what allows us to criticize “national leaders” and post satire about President Trump without fear of impunity, much the same way it has protected political dissent since the very inception of the Bill of Rights. It is thanks to the First Amendment that any elected official who takes exception to criticism cannot send the offender to jail — a freedom those in China are not afforded and one we should never take for granted.

Texto completo: The New York Times and National Public Radio both referred to Friday's March for Life in Washington by using the term "anti-abortion rights" to describe the event and the people who attended.
In a New York Times piece on Friday titled "Trump administration threatens California over abortion," author Pam Belluck described the march as an "annual anti-abortion rights demonstration.”
Author Sarah McCammon joined the New York Times by describing the crowd as “anti-abortion rights activists” in an article titled “President Trump to face friendly crowd at March for Life."
Tens of thousands descended on the National Mall both to protest abortion and celebrate life during the 47th annual march that featured a speech from Trump.
"They are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and we are fighting for those who have no voice. And we will win because we know how to win," Trump, who became the first president in history to attend the event, told the crowd.
Trump has endeared himself to abortion opponents during his presidency. In 2019, the Trump administration announced that family planning clinics will not be able to receive federal Title X funding if they refer women to abortion providers.
Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, performed 345,672 abortions in 2019, which was 12,915 more than in 2018.

AOC keeps spreading the myth of stagnant worker wages

Texto completo: Famed journalist H.L. Mencken once observed that the entire aim of politics is to keep the populace in a state of alarm by menacing it with imaginary hobgoblins. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s latest antics reveal that little has changed.
The economy is currently enjoying one of its better runs in modern history: a record 125 months of consecutive growth, record low unemployment, and a stock market that recently closed at an all-time high. But some critics still are not impressed. AOC complained that wages aren’t growing fast enough. “The Dow soars, wages don’t,” the New York Democrat said. She called it “inequality in a nutshell.” Tweet
Claims that wages aren’t rising or aren’t rising fast enough are hardly unique. They are routinely rolled out by media figures, politicians, and a handful of economists who claim working people “haven’t had a raise” in years, if not decades. If true, this would be a stunning indictment of the economic system. Fortunately, such claims are built on half-truths and misdirections.
In fact, a simple look at Federal Reserve data shows that, over the last decade, average hourly earnings of all private-sector employees increased from $22.36 to $28.32. The crudest comparisons show at least a 2% increase in the past year, or at least 3% to 5% growth per year since 1990.
Importantly, it is not just the average wage that is rising. The nominal median wage went up by 3% to 4.5% each year, too. So, no, you cannot say that it is just “the rich getting richer,” as the median data solve that issue. This does not mean that every single person is earning more, as people lose jobs or take lower-paying ones every day, but, on average, workers are indeed earning more.
Still, the problem with crude comparisons is that money is getting less valuable, and things usually cost more now than they did last year or 30 years ago.
If we take into account price inflation, then the increase in earnings is not 4% this year, but 1.7%, or even as low as 0.6%. Measuring inflation is not an exact science, however. Economists will admit that it’s extremely difficult to measure changes in the value of goods and services over time, and this is evidenced by the wild variation between different measures of inflation.
Another significant piece of the wage puzzle is other forms of compensation, such as healthcare benefits, 401(k) contributions, profit-sharing, pensions, stock options, sick pay, bonuses, and other types of nonwage benefits. Such benefits, which don’t even include nonmonetary benefits such as working from home, free gym memberships, or “summer Fridays,” represent a sizable chunk of worker compensation, and a growing one. Importantly, these benefits usually are not reflected in wage statistics.
In 2019, workers received about one-third of their income from such benefits on average, up from 27% in 2000. For government workers, it’s even higher, at 42%. Rising healthcare costs account for about one-third of this increase, the New York Times pointed out, a fact that should surprise no one. It’s well known that surging healthcare costs are gobbling up a sizable portion of worker compensation.
Finally, and most importantly, politicians such as AOC use wage data to imply that individuals aren’t getting ahead, which is simply not true.
Sure, if you use a particular inflation index and ignore benefits, it will appear that wages have barely budged in decades. However, this doesn’t mean individuals are not moving up. They are.
Data show that people in the United States, like many Europeans, still enjoy great economic mobility. Yes, the public might overestimate the ability of the poorest to rise to the top — it’s been called America’s “civil religion,” after all — but the fact remains that two-thirds of those who start life in the bottom fifth of society will rise out of that socioeconomic quintile as an adult.
This could not happen if people were actually stuck in the wage purgatory many politicians claim exists. Recent surveys also show roughly half of people reported receiving a pay raise over the last 12 months, and just a small percentage of those, 26%, were “cost-of-living” adjustment raises.Tweet
Comparing stock market gains with wages is misleading, but for AOC's purposes, it is a great way to stoke class envy. It’s also a rather pointless and misleading exercise, since market indexes rise and fall faster than average wages. This fact does not in any way prove that there is something wrong with the economy. It’s akin to observing on a cold winter morning that, despite sunshine, it is still cold and concluding that there must be something wrong with the sun.
There are plenty of real economic challenges facing us, from the return of trillion-dollar deficits, the student loan bubble, and surging healthcare costs. AOC and her ilk need to realize we simply don’t have time to worry about wage hobgoblins.

David Brooks learns how to read campaign polls and notices Joe Biden is the front-runner

Texto completo: It's the mark of a great political pundit to declare the obvious with the absolute certainty that he or she must be the first person to have ever shared the bit of wisdom with the masses. David Brooks did just that on Thursday, doing New York Times readers a favor and explaining why Joe Biden is "still winning" the Democratic presidential primary:
"Almost everybody was bearish on Joe. But now look where we are, weeks from actual voting. If the polls are to be believed, Biden will win Iowa, he’ll come in second in New Hampshire, he will easily win Nevada, he will dominate in South Carolina. He’s now tied for the lead in California and he’s way ahead in Texas. I don’t know if he’ll win the nomination (both he and Bernie Sanders look strong), but this is not where a lot of people six months ago thought we’d be."
By "a lot of people," Brooks must be referring to the editorial board of his paper because anyone who has looked at a poll, any poll, over the last six months could see that Biden has been virtually unshakable as the leader for the nomination.
People in the national media, like Brooks, apparently thought Biden needed to do something wild to win popular approval, though he came out of the gate with a lead of at least 20 points over every other candidate.
That lead has narrowed in recent weeks, but no one serious has ever said that Biden wasn't the most popular candidate and the likeliest to make it to the end.
Brooks nonetheless donned his academic robe to explain that Biden "seems normal and emotionally relatable" and that therein lies so much of his enduring appeal.
Aren't you glad Brooks was here to explain that to you?
Brooks said that he and others didn't understand Biden's charm with Democratic voters because they spend so much time on Twitter, which "detracts from your knowledge of American politics."
Okay, so get off of Twitter, Brooks. The rest of us out here were under no delusion that after Biden jumped in the race, the nomination remained up for just anyone's grab. But thanks for explaining!

INSIDE A SHELTER FOR WOMEN FACING A CRISIS PREGNANCY: For the last 14 years, a maternity home called Mary’s Shelter in Fredericksburg, Virginia, has been helping more than 350 women get back on their feet after facing a crisis pregnancy.
The shelter offers housing, rent free, for women as they take classes and work, preparing for a life where they will live independently after they leave. It describes itself as a "pro-life ministry" that abides by Catholic teaching.
“Yes we want to save the baby, but we really want to see women have an opportunity to grow and succeed,” said Kathleen Wilson, the executive director of Mary’s Shelter. She has seen families reunited after staying in their residences. “There is such a trickle effect to these kinds of homes. It’s not just about that baby.”
Homes for pregnant women were better known during a different time in America, when getting pregnant outside of marriage was more stigmatized, even before the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.
But there has been a new iteration of maternity homes in the last 30 years set up by people within the anti-abortion movement who view them as a way to support women in difficult circumstances who choose adoption or motherhood, said Mary Peterson, housing specialist and facilitator for the National Maternity Home Coalition through Heartbeat International. Peterson has seen growing interest from organizations who want to open more homes, particularly among those who operate crisis pregnancy centers that work to dissuade women from having abortions.
The National Maternity Home Coalition has tracked roughly 400 faith-based homes around the U.S., but their programs vary because most are the result of small, community efforts that get funding from churches, individual donors, and some businesses, and aren't part of a centralized organization.
The shift is happening at a time when abortion advocates have become staunchly polarized along party lines and as they brace for whether the newly constituted Supreme Court will limit abortion rights. Mary's Shelter, and homes like it, are a reminder that despite what is happening in the nation's capital and state legislatures, the anti-abortion movement is composed of many different layers.

TRUMP WARNS CALIFORNIA TO STOP FORCING ABORTION COVERAGE: The Trump administration is warning California to stop enforcing its law obligating health insurers cover abortions, saying it will otherwise face the loss of federal funding. California has 30 days to go along with the order, said Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights within the Trump administration's health agency.
The administration is accusing California of violating a rule attached to spending bills, called the Weldon Amendment, that says states and other government entities cannot discriminate against healthcare providers that don't provide or pay for abortions if they receive federal funding. Severino warned states with similar laws would face similar actions, but didn't cite examples. Oregon, New York, and Washington state have similar laws obligating private insurers to pay for abortions.
TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAUNCHES ‘PRO-LIFE’ COALITION: The Trump campaign announced Friday that it is launching “Pro-life Voices for Trump,” led by Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser. Trump, who will be the first president to address the March for Life Friday, is looking to push voters who oppose abortion to the polls. In addition to Dannenfelser, Trump’s coalition includes Fr. Frank Pavone of Priests for Life and Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America. "While President Trump continues to protect innocent life every day and at every stage, 2020 Democrats stand in stark contrast and support extreme pro-abortion policies," Dannenfelser said. "Re-electing President Trump means keeping pro-life values in the White House.”
Azar to join: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Thursday that he is “immensely proud” to join Trump at the March for Life Friday. “As thousands from across the country gather to march for life, I am proud to serve as part of the most pro-life administration in this country’s history,” he said.
NEW SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST PAC AD CALLS DEMOCRATS THE ‘PARTY OF DEATH’: Women Speak Out PAC, the super PAC of SBA List, released an ad Thursday calling Democrats “more extreme than ever.” SBA List announced Jan. 17 it is launching a $52 million campaign to rally voters for Trump and members of Congress who oppose abortion.
THE LATEST ON THE WUHAN CORONAVIRUS: China has now imposed travel restrictions on 33 million people in response to the coronavirus outbreak that has surpassed 880 cases with 26 deaths reported. A second case in the US was also reported Friday in the U.S. by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a woman in Chicago.
Senators will be briefed: There will be an all-senators briefing Friday regarding the outbreak.
SURGEON GENERAL THERE’S NOT EVIDENCE E-CIGARETTES WORK AS CESSATION DEVICES: Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in delivering the latest report on tobacco use Thursday that there is not enough evidence to conclude e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation products. “E-cigarettes are a continually changing and diverse group of products that are used in a variety of ways… there is presently inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes in general increase smoking cessation,” Adams said.

Kamala Harris weighing Joe Biden endorsement

Texto completo: Kamala Harris, 55, is considering backing her former rival Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primaries, which could boost her chances of becoming vice president if Biden wins the nomination.
The California senator could potentially endorse Biden, 77, after the Senate impeachment trial, multiple Democratic officials told the New York Times. But Harris is also mindful that two of her female colleagues, Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are still in the race.
Biden and Harris have stayed in contact since she ended her presidential bid in early December, including a lengthy discussion immediately after she dropped out.
When asked if he would consider Harris as a running mate, Biden said, “Of course I would.”
Harris confronted Biden in the first Democratic presidential debate in June, slamming him for working with past segregationist senators in the 1970s to oppose integration busing. The attack gave her a bump in the polls, but she struggled to maintain the momentum.
“Senator Harris remains focused on the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump,” said Chris Harris, a spokesman for the senator. “No decisions have been made about whether she will endorse, which candidate, nor when an endorsement decision will be made.”

It's the March for Life: Which peaceful protesters will the media slander today?

Texto completo: When gun owners recently organized a peaceful protest of extreme gun control proposals, an NBC News reporter called it a “white nationalist” rally.
When pro-life Catholic school students wore Make America Great Again hats on the National Mall last year and were accosted by a racist hate group and anti-Catholic con man Nathan Philips, the Washington Post smeared the students, reporting without any reliable sources or evidence that the group of students had taunted Philips and blocked his path. Other reporters and commentators gleefully piled on with their own lies.
The New York Times falsely declared "Viral Video Shows Boys in 'Make America Great Again' Hats Surrounding Native Elder.”
Robby Soave at Reason sums up the awful coverage:
“The Detroit Free Press described the video as depicting ‘Phillips peacefully drumming and singing, while surrounded by a hostile crowd’ and suggested that this ‘illustrates the nation's political and racial tensions.’ The Daily Beast's story was filed under ‘AWFUL’ and described the video as ‘disturbing.’ Its first several paragraphs quote directly from Phillips. NPR asserted that the boys had mocked the Native American man. In story after story, news outlets claimed the Covington kids had shouted ‘build the wall.’ Again, the sole source of this claim was Phillips."
Then the real pile-on started. One popular viral anti-Catholic-school Twitter thread accused the school of being anti-woman and anti-gay. Others claimed to have pictures of students in blackface, or holding up white power symbols. NBC News carried a piece headlined, "Gay valedictorian banned from speaking at Covington graduation 'not surprised' by D.C. controversy,” a headline that might make you think the student graduated from, was barred from speaking at, or was the valedictorian at Covington Catholic. The student, in fact, never went to Covington Catholic.
Most of these smears weren't done out of dishonesty but out of a sloppiness that comes from confirmation bias. Throughout, the liberal commentators and national reporters were displaying, to varying degrees, their deep dislike of Catholic schools, pro-lifers, and white Trump-supporting males — and their willingness to believe anything bad about such folks.
So how will this same press (it sure hasn't improved in a year) cover the March for Life today? Which Catholic school or pro-lifer will they target?
Given the prevailing ideology among journalists, there is a lot for them to hate in marchers. First of all, basically every reporter and editor at the biggest news outlets favor liberal abortion laws. No honest journalist will disagree. That's why they do things like refuse to call it the "March for Life," but instead call it "The March Against Abortion Rights," which is not its name.
But there are deeper cultural issues here, as the Covington Catholic episode showed. Many of the marchers are from Catholic schools. Some of those schools are all-male or all-female, which clashes with the current push to dissolve all differences between boys and girls.
Some of those Catholic schools probably have codes of conduct that include such unpopular ideas as forbidding premarital sex or gay sex. Perhaps this religious school teaches the story of Noah’s Ark, which is to some in the elite media, a sign of deplorability.
There are a million reasons that your average reporter will hate your average pro-life marcher. Let’s see if the media can contain their hatred for a day and limit themselves to the facts.
Photo Caption:In this Friday, Jan. 18, 2019 image made from video provided by the Survival Media Agency, a teenager wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat, center left, stands in front of an elderly Native American singing and playing a drum in Washington. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Covington in Kentucky is looking into this and other videos that show youths, possibly from the diocese's all-male Covington Catholic High School, mocking Native Americans at a rally in Washington.

Nicholas Kristof: What if Trump gave Alaska to Putin?

Texto completo: Let’s not dismiss the Senate impeachment trial as a “kangaroo court.” That’s an insult to kangaroos, who lately have been suffering enough.
President Donald Trump and Senate Republican leaders seem to be planning a rushed, sham trial with no witnesses and limited evidence. This reminds me of a trial I once monitored of a Chinese journalist in Beijing: The proceedings were held in a majestic court building with high ceilings, plush courtrooms, crisp microphones and attentive security officers, all overseen by solemn judges — everything a justice system might want, except justice.
What’s at stake in this trial is the basic idea that America’s leader is accountable for misconduct. Without that concept, we may have a grand Senate chamber and eloquent speeches, but our democracy rings hollow. Without that principle of equality before the law, our grand Senate under Mitch McConnell simply becomes an American analogue of China’s rubber-stamp National People’s Congress.
McConnell’s grim determination to see no evidence and hear no witnesses is particularly hypocritical because in 1999, during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, he did favor allowing witnesses. “It’s certainly not unusual to have a witness in an impeachment trial,” he said then.
Lindsey Graham, a member of the House and an impeachment manager at the time, was even more blunt. “If there’s any doubt, call witnesses,” he urged.
“In every trial that there has ever been in the Senate regarding impeachment, witnesses were called,” Graham noted then. By the count of House Democrats, the average number of witnesses is now 33 for each of the past impeachment trials.
Knowing that John Bolton as national security adviser referred to the Ukraine mess as a “drug deal,” why would senators not want to clarify what he meant? Why risk covering up a cover-up?
There are less strained arguments that McConnell and others could make against removing Trump from office. They could say that the president’s conduct, while improper, did not rise to the level requiring removal.
Instead, Trump and his defenders are pursuing a line of defense that would create an imperial, unchecked presidency, because it’s not clear what would ever merit impeachment and removal by their standards.
Trump’s team even suggests that “abuse of power” itself cannot be grounds for impeachment, calling it the “House Democrats’ newly invented ‘abuse of power’ theory.”
Newly invented? Abuse of power was central to the discussions of impeachment at the Constitutional Convention. Alexander Hamilton said that impeachment was the remedy for “the abuse or violation of some public trust.” It was also the basis for articles of impeachment approved by the House Judiciary Committee against both Clinton and Richard Nixon (the full House rejected that article against Clinton, and Nixon resigned before a full House vote).
Frank O. Bowman III, a constitutional law scholar who is cited in the president’s legal brief, called that same brief “a well-crafted piece of sophistry.”
Trump and his supporters simply make assertions without regard to reality. This is an echo in the impeachment domain of the 16,241 false or misleading statements Trump made in his first three years in office, by the count of The Washington Post.
For example, Trump’s backers insist that impeachment and conviction require a violation of a particular criminal statute, even though most scholars agree that that is not the case. Indeed, one early impeachment was of a judge who presided while drunk, which was not a violation of criminal law.
Trump’s lawyers argue that removal from office would amount to “nullifying an election and subverting the will of the American people.” Under that reasoning, despite the Constitution, a president could never be removed — and in that case, a president is untouchable.
We all recognize that a president has the right to pardon criminals, but suppose he pardoned hackers in exchange for “investigating” the Bidens? Or what if Trump announced that he would pardon every Republican bank robber?
Or suppose Trump fawned over Vladimir Putin to the point of returning Alaska to Russia?
As it happens, Alaska isn’t my example, but that of Alan Dershowitz, the president’s lawyer. “Assume Putin decides to ‘retake’ Alaska, the way he ‘retook’ Crimea,” Dershowitz wrote in a 2018 book. “Assume further that a president allows him to do it, because he believed that Russia has a legitimate claim to ‘its’ original territory.” Even that would not merit impeachment and removal by Dershowitz’s standards.
Note to Alaska senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan: Your thoughts, comrades?
Do we really think that there should be no checks on a rogue president as he handed Alaska over to Putin — or Florida to Spain, while we’re at it — or even as he pardoned streams of Republican bank robbers? Must we tolerate an out-of control ruler who engages, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, in “a long train of abuses and usurpations”?
That’s the kind of system that we rebelled against in 1776, no?

Paul Krugman: Trump is abusing his tariff power, too

Texto completo: So here’s the story: Donald Trump has abused the powers of his office to threaten a U.S. ally. His threat is probably illegal; his refusal to produce documents about his decision process is definitely illegal. And his claims about the motivation for his actions don’t pass the laugh test.
You probably think that I’m talking about Trump’s attempt to pressure Ukraine into producing political dirt on Joe Biden by withholding aid, and the subsequent cover-up — you know, the stuff for which he has been impeached (and that half the country believes should lead to his removal from office). But there’s another, somewhat similar story: his repeated threats to impose prohibitive tariffs on imports of automobiles from Europe.
Granted, the auto tariff story isn’t as vile as the Ukraine story, and it poses less of a direct threat to a fair election. But it’s recognizably part of the same syndrome: abuse of presidential power, contempt for the rule of law and dishonesty about motivations.
Some background: U.S. tariffs — taxes on imports — are normally set the same way we set other taxes, through legislation that must pass Congress and then be signed by the president. The law does, however, give the president discretion to impose temporary tariffs under certain circumstances, for example to give U.S. industries breathing space in the face of sudden import surges, to counter foreign export subsidies or to protect national security (Section 232).
Until Trump, Section 232 cases were rare. He has, however, used the national security justification for tariffs with abandon and zero regard for plausibility. Canadian aluminum poses a national security risk? Really?
And so it was that in 2018 the Trump administration announced that it was beginning a Section 232 investigation of auto imports, especially from Europe and Japan. Every trade expert I know considered the notion that German or Japanese cars constitute a threat to national security absurd. Nonetheless, in 2019 a report from the Commerce Department concluded that auto imports do, indeed, endanger national security.
What was the basis for this conclusion? Well, we don’t actually know — because the Trump administration has refused to release the report.
This stonewalling is clearly illegal. The statute requires that all portions of the Commerce report that don’t contain classified or proprietary information be published in the Federal Register, and it’s hard to believe that any of the report contains such information, let alone the whole thing. Furthermore, Congress inserted a provision in a spending bill last month specifically requiring that the Trump administration turn over the report.
Why won’t Trump obey the law and hand over the document? My guess is that his people are afraid to let anyone see the Commerce report because it’s embarrassingly thin and incompetent. To be honest, I have some doubts about whether the report even exists. Remember, the Commerce Department is run by Wilbur Ross, whom readers of my colleague Gail Collins voted Trump’s worst Cabinet member, which is quite a distinction given the competition.
Beyond all that, why does Trump even want to impose tariffs on European cars? Obviously it has nothing to do with national security. But what’s it really about?
Part of the answer may be that the self-proclaimed Tariff Man still believes that protectionism will revive U.S. manufacturing, even though the evidence says that his trade war had the opposite effect.
Beyond that, it appears that Trump tried to use the threat of auto tariffs to bludgeon European nations into backing him up in his confrontation with Iran. This is, by the way, a clear violation both of U.S. law, which does not give the president discretion to impose tariffs for reasons unrelated to economics, and of our international agreements, which prohibit this kind of bullying.
And remember, the nations Trump was trying to bully are or were among our most important allies, part of the coalition of democracies we used to call the Free World. These days, our erstwhile allies can no longer consider America a reliable partner, on trade or anything else. Of course, that probably doesn’t bother Trump, who prefers autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman.
So how should we think about the auto tariff saga? At one level it’s part of the broader story of Trump’s trade war, which has raised prices for American consumers, hurt U.S. businesses and farmers and deterred business investment by creating uncertainty.
But these economic considerations are, I’d argue, much less important than the political aspects. Trump’s scofflaw behavior with regard to auto tariffs is part of a broader pattern of abuse of power and contempt for the rule of law. On every front, Trump treats U.S. policy as a tool he can deploy as he chooses, in his own interests, without seeking congressional approval or even informing Congress about what he’s doing or why.
Basically, the man in the White House operates on the principle that l’état, c’est Trump. It’s a principle nobody who believes in American ideals should accept.

Texto completo: Wow, Adam Schiff did a great job in Marathon Impeachment.
Schiff, one of the managers the House sent to handle the impeachment trial in the Senate, has been the rock star of the proceedings. (OK, suggesting this is a rocking experience would be ... overstatement. But you get the idea.)
On Wednesday, Schiff spoke for nearly 2 1/2 hours, nonstop, to open the Democrats’ case. Not a record, but really long, even for a politician. Donald Trump took up just a little over two hours at his impeachment-day rally, when he had enough time to suggest that the late Rep. John Dingell went to hell and to call Schiff “not exactly the best-looking guy we’ve ever seen.”
Schiff’s mission was to take the Senate — and better yet, the American public — through Trump’s impeachable behavior, step by step. It’s certainly an action-packed story, and the Democrats have the advantage of audiovisual aids. So much easier to keep the audience’s interest when you’ve got the title character on tape, saying stuff like, “I have the right to do whatever I want as president.”
Schiff elevated the saga with a lot of American history. He mentioned the Founding Fathers 28 times in the first 15 minutes. On this front, it doesn’t seem as if he’s going to get much competition. Earlier, when Republicans had a chance to talk, the founders only came up a handful of times, once in a quote from Chuck Schumer.
For much of our modern history Republicans have tended to be the ones continually quoting the Founding Fathers, usually in regard to the dangers of an over-powerful federal government. Now the tables have turned. Clearly Mitch McConnell and his minions need to come up with some early American heroes who wouldn’t have seen a problem with a president who tries to make secret deals with a foreign power in order to enhance his chances for reelection.
On Wednesday, Schiff concluded with references to George Washington crossing the Delaware, Thomas Paine, Washington’s farewell address and Benjamin Franklin announcing our government would be “a republic, if you can keep it.”
Other Democrats then picked up the story, and they’ll be doing it for quite a while. Senate Majority Leader McConnell was originally going to make everybody cram the 24-hour quota of speeches into two days, but the Democrats have now been given three days to make their case on a more reasonable schedule. The change was allegedly a result of complaints by a few moderate Republicans, notably Susan Collins of Maine, who wanted the process to look fair.
Definitely an improvement. However, voters of Maine, I am trusting that when you decide whether to reelect Collins this fall, you are not going to be moved by the news that before voting to keep Donald Trump in office, she used her powers to make the speaking schedule better.
Nobody has any real doubt about how this is going to end. McConnell is going to deliver his people and get Trump off the hook.
“I’m not an impartial juror. This is a political process,” he said recently. This was a few weeks before the start of the impeachment trial. Then suddenly Mitch transformed into a statesman, begging his colleagues to “put fairness, even-handedness and historical precedent ahead of the partisan passions of the day.”
Much talk about the need to show “some fairness.” Instantly the mind of every Democratic senator flashed back to the time McConnell refused to allow Barack Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court to even come up for a hearing. And the huge pile of other judicial nominations that he let pile up in a basement somewhere, so he’d be able to hand Donald Trump his biggest presidential achievement.
“Fair is fair,” McConnell continued on.
Keeping Donald Trump in office is, of course, critical for McConnell, the man who gets to actually run much of the country as long as a distracted doofus is in the alleged driver’s seat.
Lately said doofus has been in Switzerland, tucked away at the World Economic Forum, a pleasant annual get-together for people who like to talk about money in elevated terms.
He’s made the occasional burst into public — expressing the wish that he could be right there at the trial, where he could “sit right in the front row and stare into their corrupt faces.”
Really, try to imagine Donald Trump sitting still for 2 1/2 hours of anything. Let alone a recapitulation of all the disasters of his term in office. His handlers, in a perfect world, would have had him somewhere on a remote ice floe.
“All I do is, I’m honest,” he told reporters clamoring for an impeachment reaction. “I make great deals. I’ve made great deals for our country.”
How do you think the Founding Fathers would have felt about that? Just try to imagine if one of them got caught trying to trade taxpayer money for political dirt on an opponent. And George Washington calming a horrified colleague with, “Well yeah, Mr. Hamilton, but remember — he makes great deals.”

Page: After 10 years, ‘The New Jim Crow’ still has much to say about race, drug convictions and injustice

Texto completo: Every so often a book comes along that shakes up the national gabfest in a way that makes all of us talk about an old problem with a new urgency.
Jane Jacobs’ 1961 book “The Death and Life of Great American Cities” sparked a movement to preserve urban neighborhood diversity against developers’ bulldozers.
Michael Harrington’s 1962 “The Other America: Poverty in the United States” helped spur President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty.”
Rachel Carson’s 1962 “Silent Spring” gave flight to what became the environmental preservation movement.
Now 10 years have passed since another breakthrough book shook up the criminal justice debate: legal scholar Michelle Alexander’s “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness.”
Since hers was hardly the first study to claim racial bias in our nation’s criminal justice system, she recalls in an essay that she wrote for the book’s 10th anniversary edition, a lot of people told her not to expect much reaction. Instead, the book climbed the New York Times bestseller list, where it remained for nearly 250 weeks.
A decade later, it is easier to look back and see what made this book stand out—- and ignite another debate, even as states expunge thousands of minor drug convictions. With ample statistics and historical narratives, she gave voice to what many people had long suspected, especially in black communities. The surge in black incarceration that followed decades of wars on drugs had become, whether by accident or design, a “new Jim Crow,” she argued, metaphorically resembling the original version of racial segregation banned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The nation’s criminal justice system uses the war on drugs to enforce forms of racial discrimination, oppression and “social control” that most of us thought had gone away with the hard-won victories of the civil rights era.
For this, she has received some scholarly pushback, even from those who share her concern for racially disproportional incarceration rates. In his book “Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform,” John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor, argues that Alexander makes too much of the statistics for drug offenders, since they make up only a small part of the prison population — and nonviolent drug offenders an even smaller part.
Most prisoners have been convicted of violent crimes, he points out, and most American prisoners are in county and state justice systems, not the federal system.
Indeed, the federal system houses 221,000 inmates, compared with 1.3 million in state prisons and 612,000 in local jails, according to the Prison Policy Initiative in 2019.
Although the proportion of state prisoners whose primary crime was a drug offense rose sharply from 1980 to 1990, when it peaked at 22%, Pfaff writes, that leaves about four-fifths who were found guilty of some other offense. By 2010, it fell to 17%. Bottom line, says the statistics expert: Reducing the incarceration of drug offenders will not do much to reduce prison populations.
Other scholars have made similar claims. Jonathan Rothwell, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, tries nobly to reconcile the differences by comparing the time and length of sentences for different crimes. Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades, but those offenders tend to serve shorter sentences than those convicted of violent crimes.
“Rolling back the war on drugs would not totally solve the problem of mass incarceration,” he writes, “but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison.”
That makes sense. So do a number of black community residents who would like to see tougher law enforcement. The get-tough approach is much less popular now. That helps to explain why former Vice President Joe Biden seemed to be caught in a time warp as he tried to defend his support of the get-tough 1994 crime law that Alexander blames for making the mass incarceration problem worse.
As some of us remember, that bill was supported by a lot of black folks, including the Congressional Black Caucus, although with some reservations as they called for other reforms, too.
But today, years after the totally unexpected crime drop in the mid-1990s, more people of all races are asking questions about the role race plays in our justice system. After all, crack cocaine, primarily a plague in black communities, was treated as a crime problem. Opioid abuse, more closely identified with poor white communities, has been treated as a public health problem.
Racial disparities like that are not easily brushed off as coincidence. Nor should they be. Instead, they help to explain the popularity of Alexander’s book.

Texto completo: Jim Lehrer
NEW YORK - Jim Lehrer, longtime host of the nightly PBS "NewsHour" whose serious, sober demeanor made him the choice to moderate 11 presidential debates between 1988 and 2012, has died, PBS said Thursday. He was 85.
Lehrer died "peacefully in his sleep," according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983 and more recently, had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008.
For Lehrer, and for his friend and longtime partner Robert MacNeil, broadcast journalism was a service, with public understanding of events and issues its primary goal.
"We both believed the American people were not as stupid as some of the folks publishing and programming for them believed," Lehrer wrote in his 1992 memoir, "A Bus of My Own."
"We were convinced they cared about the significant matters of human events. ... And we were certain they could and would hang in there more than 35 seconds for information about those subjects if given a chance."
Tributes poured in from colleagues and watchers alike, including from Fox News' Bret Baier, who called Lehrer "an inspiration to a whole generation of political journalists- including this one." Dan Rather said "few approached their work with more equanimity and integrity than Jim Lehrer." And Jake Tapper of CNN called Lehrer "a wonderful man and a superb journalist." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called him a "champion for truth and transparency."
Many Americans knew him best for his role as debate moderator. For seven straight presidential elections, he was the sole journalist sitting across from the candidates for the first debate of the general election campaign. In 1996 and 2000, he moderated all of the debates - five of them - and a vice presidential contest to boot.
He told The Associated Press in 2011 that his goal was to probe the candidates' thinking and avoid "gotcha" questions. He felt his best debate performance was in 2004, with George W. Bush and John Kerry, not because of anything he did, but because the candidates were able to state their positions clearly.
"I didn't get in the way," said Lehrer, whose book "Tension City: Inside the Presidential Debates" told stories of his experiences. "Nobody was talking about what I did as a moderator. I didn't become part of the story."
He was lured out of retirement for his last debate in 2012 and it may have been a mistake; he received criticism that year for having too light a touch on the proceedings.
The half-hour "Robert MacNeil Report" began on PBS in 1975 with Lehrer as Washington correspondent. The two had already made names for themselves at the then-fledgling network through their work with the National Public Affairs Center for Television and its coverage of the Watergate hearings in 1973.
The nightly news broadcast, later retitled the "MacNeil-Lehrer Report," became the nation's first one-hour TV news broadcast in 1983 and was then known as the "MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour." After MacNeil bowed out in 1995, it became "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer."
"I'm heartbroken at the loss of someone who was central to my professional life, a mentor to me and someone whose friendship I've cherished for decades," said Judy Woodruff, anchor and managing editor of the PBS NewsHour, in a statement.
Politics, international relations, economics, science, even developments in the arts were all given lengthy, detailed coverage in their show.
"When we expanded to the hour, it changed from being a supplement to an alternative," Lehrer said in 1990. "Now we take the position that if you're looking for a place to go every 24 hours and find out what's happened and get some in-depth treatment, we're the place."
Lehrer moderated his first presidential debate in 1988 and was a frequent consensus choice for the task in subsequent presidential contests. He likened the job to "walking down the blade of a knife."
"Anybody who would say it's just another TV show is a liar or a fool," he once said. "I know how important it is, but it's not about me. It's what the candidates say that matters."
He also anchored PBS coverage of inaugurations and conventions, dismissing criticism from other TV news organizations that the latter had become too scripted to yield much in the way of real news.
"I think when the major political parties of this country gather together their people and resources in one place to nominate their candidates, that's important," he told The Associated Press in 2000. "To me, it's a non-argument. I don't see why someone would argue that it wasn't important."
Naturally, Lehrer came in for some knocks for being so low-key in the big televised events. After a matchup between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, David Letterman cracked, "Last night was probably the first and only that time Jim Lehrer (was) the most exciting person in the room."
But the real-life Lehrer - who had a tradition of buying a new tie for good luck before each debate - was more colorful than he might have seemed on PBS.
On the side, he was also a novelist and sometime playwright. His debut novel "Viva Max!" was made into a movie starring Peter Ustinov. He did a whole series of novels about the adventures of an Oklahoma politician known as The One-Eyed Mack.
"Hemingway said this, too: If you paid attention as a reporter, then when the time came to write fiction you'd have something to write about," Lehrer told The Associated Press in 1991.
"And it turned out I did. And I've got all these stories stored up after 30 years in the news business. And they're just flowing out of me."
As Lehrer turned 75 in spring 2009, PBS announced that the show would be retitled as "PBS NewsHour" later in the year, with Lehrer pairing up on anchor duties with other show regulars.
He said he approved of the changes, telling The New York Times that having a pair of anchors would "shake things up a bit," even as all sectors of the news business struggled to meet changing reader and viewer demands.
Lehrer was born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1934, the son of parents who ran a bus line. In addition to titling his memoir "A Bus of My Own," he collected bus memorabilia - from station signs to a real 1946 Flexible Clipper bus.
After graduation from college in 1956, he served three years in the Marines, later calling the experience so valuable that he thought all young people should take part in national service.
"I had no close calls, no rendezvous with danger, no skirted destinies with death," he wrote. "What I had was a chance to discover and test myself, physically and emotionally and spiritually, in important, lasting ways."
He went to work from 1959 to 1970 at The Dallas Morning News and the now-defunct Dallas Times-Herald. Lehrer jumped to television for a Dallas nightly newscast.
Lehrer wrote that it was ironic that the Watergate hearings helped establish the importance of public TV, since President Richard Nixon hated public broadcasting. He also recalled that the lengthy hearings gave him the chance to practice his new craft, and MacNeil, already a veteran, gave him valuable pointers on how to speak on camera clearly and conversationally.
He is survived by his wife, Kate; three daughters: Jamie, Lucy, and Amanda; and six grandchildren.

The legacy of Gordon Parks lives on

Texto completo: Legendary photographer Gordon Parks was the "cool uncle."
"One day he called me up and said, 'Baby, the New York Times called me America's sexiest great-grandpa,' " said his great-niece, Robin Hickman-Winfield. "Another time he called and said, 'P. Diddy, or whatever his name is, is gonna buy my Malcolm X portrait.' "
Hickman-Winfield and Parks, who died in 2006, had a deep and close relationship, talking about everything from heartbreak to depression. She promised Parks she would keep his legacy alive. That pledge fueled the exhibit "A Choice of Weapons, Honor and Dignity" now on view at the Minnesota Museum of American Art.
The show, curated by Hickman-Winfield, weaves 22 of Parks' photos,
spanning U.S. history from Jim Crow America through the civil rights era, along with 30 photographs by one of his artistic heirs, Jamel Shabazz, a street photographer who has documented New York's brown and black communities since the 1980s.
Parks' legacy also pops up outside of the exhibition space, with six prints by young Minneapolis photographer Den-Zell Gilliard, who cites him as an inspiration.
The exhibit is named after Parks' 1966 autobiography. In "A Choice of Weapons," he wrote about how, as a teen in the Twin Cities, he picked up a camera instead of a gun while struggling to survive, educate himself and live the dream.
The show includes interpretive wall labels written by students in a class Hickman-Winfield teaches at Gordon Parks High School in St. Paul. Founded nearly three decades ago as an alternative learning center to inspire kids to finish school, and renamed for Parks in 2007, it employs the arts as a tool against racism, poverty and homelessness.
A family relic
A well-worn, bright blue fleece sweater, covered in lint balls and speckled with white hairs, sits on a white pillar in an alcove near the exhibition entrance.
"I slept with it for months after he passed away," said Hickman-Winfield, gently and lovingly picking at the fuzz.
Parks' blue sweater may be sentimental, but the rest of the show is not.
His photos and Shabazz's complement each other, creating a visual flow through the exhibit. Parks' 1963 black-and-white photograph "Black Muslim Schoolchildren" peers in on five little kids looking up at an adult who has just arrived; it is paired with Shabazz's 1990 "Father and Sons," with the father in a red suit and his two kids standing in front of him in mini black tuxedos.
Each photo encapsulates a world, giving a momentary glimpse into black life in America, past and present. Shabazz's "A Soldier's Story, New York City" (2010) captures a sweet moment of a soldier in army fatigues smooching his love on a busy New York train while their little baby sleeps in a carriage, draped in a blue blanket.
Nearby, Parks' "Store Front, Mobile, Alabama," shot in 1956 for a Life magazine series about segregation, is a full-color image of a store in the Deep South, covered in red advertising signs. Women and children and a group of boys relax on the porch.
St. Paul beginnings
Born into poverty in Fort Scott, Kan., in 1912, Parks moved to St. Paul at age 15 after his mother passed away, living for a time with his older sister.
He started his career by taking photos for what is now the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder, the state's oldest black-owned newspaper. He went on to become a photographer with the federal Farm Security Administration, chronicling social conditions across the nation.
Parks freelanced for Glamour and Ebony magazines and in 1948 became Life's first African-American photographer, breaking the color line. A self-taught photographer whose personal style reflected a bent for social justice, he documented race relations, civil rights and urban life with his camera.
He also was a composer, writer and filmmaker, adapting his semi-autobiographical novel "The Learning Tree" for the screen, and scoring a box-office smash in 1971 with "Shaft," which is credited with launching the so-called "blaxploitation" movement.
Hickman-Winfield is collaborating with Twin Cities playwright Harrison David Rivers on a drama about Parks' life, set to open in the fall at the History Theatre in St. Paul.
Before her uncle's death, she worked with him on the HBO documentary "Half Past Autumn: The Life and Works of Gordon Parks." Denzel Washington was a producer.
"It wasn't always easy," she said. "I almost had a nervous breakdown. If he was upset, I'd get the call. But at the end of it he said, 'I'm proud of you, baby.' "
This exhibition, however, is not about Parks' life, but his legacy -- the people who learned from him, like Shabazz, who researched Parks' life as a source of guidance, and went on to win the Gordon Parks Foundation Award in 2018.
"What's gonna happen to black boys? What did I really do?" Parks asked Hickman-Winfield shortly before he died.
She reassured him that nothing he did was in vain. The exhibition is just one of the ways she's keeping that promise.

Texto completo: Manhattan federal prosecutors have evidence indicating Jeff Bezos' girlfriend provided text messages to her brother that he then sold to the National Enquirer for its article about the Amazon.com Inc. founder's affair, according to people familiar with the matter.
The text messages, which were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, were among the materials turned over to federal prosecutors as part of their investigation into whether American Media Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer, attempted to extort Mr. Bezos, the people said. The U.S. attorney's office has also been investigating whether Mr. Bezos' phone was hacked , according to the people.
The evidence gathered by federal prosecutors includes a May 10, 2018, text message sent from the phone of Lauren Sanchez, Mr. Bezos' girlfriend, to her brother Michael Sanchez containing a flirtatious message from the Amazon chief, the people said.
The Enquirer quoted the text in its January 2019 article about Mr. Bezos' extramarital affair with Ms. Sanchez. A July 3, 2018, text message sent from Ms. Sanchez's phone to her brother's includes a photo of a shirtless Mr. Bezos.
Mr. Bezos' security consultant, Gavin de Becker, suggested in an opinion article last year for the Daily Beast that Saudi Arabia might have had a hand in the Enquirer's reporting on Mr. Bezos. The claim resurfaced this week after a forensic audit commissioned by Mr. Bezos alleged that his phone was hacked using a WhatsApp account associated with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Join the conversation below.
The text messages reviewed by the Journal, as well as a $200,000 payment Mr. Sanchez received from the Enquirer under an October 2018 contract the Journal also reviewed, supports American Media's earlier statements that he was the source for the National Enquirer's article.
The Saudi government said the allegation that the crown prince hacked Mr. Bezos' phone was absurd and called for an investigation.
"In September of 2018, Michael Sanchez began providing all materials and information to our reporters," a spokesman for American Media said Friday. He added that any suggestion that a third party, such as Saudi Arabia, "was involved in or in any way influenced our reporting is false."
Mr. Sanchez declined to comment on the texts or his contract with American Media. "With spoon-fed lies and half-truths, Wall Street Journal keeps getting it wrong," Mr. Sanchez said in an emailed statement.
Ms. Sanchez didn't respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Mr. Bezos declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors haven't charged Michael Sanchez, Lauren Sanchez or anyone else with a crime in the probe.
Mr. Bezos' affair with Ms. Sanchez, a former television reporter who started an aerial film-production company, was publicized the same month he and his now ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, said their 25-year marriage was ending . They agreed to a divorce settlement in April.
The Amazon chief is the owner of the Washington Post, where the late columnist Jamal Khashoggi wrote critically of the kingdom's leadership before he was slain last October by a Saudi security team . The CIA, in a secret assessment reviewed by the Journal, said that Prince Mohammed likely ordered Mr. Khashoggi's death, although it acknowledged it didn't have direct evidence of a kill order by the Saudi crown prince.
On Wednesday, United Nations officials probing Mr. Khashoggi's death called on U.S. authorities to investigate the findings of the audit commissioned by Mr. Bezos.
The October 2018 contract between Mr. Sanchez and American Media gave the company exclusive rights to "certain information, photographs, and text messages documenting an affair between Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez."
Mr. Sanchez, a talent agent who has managed television pundits and reality-show judges, declared in his contract with American media that he acquired the texts and photographs lawfully, according to the agreement.
The New York Times earlier reported that American Media provided evidence to federal prosecutors that Ms. Sanchez sent texts to her brother involving Mr. Bezos.

Texto completo: An Iranian student who planned to attend Northeastern University but was flown out of the United States Monday night on the order of immigration officials is the latest in a growing number of students from Iran who have recently been denied entry at Logan Airport, according to lawyers and Boston-area colleges.
Mohammad Shahab Dehghani Hossein Abadi, a 24-year-old undergraduate student, had been detained by Customs and Border Protection at Logan after arriving Sunday. Dehghani Hossein Abadi's lawyers filed an emergency petition to block his removal Monday night, and Judge Allison D. Burroughs ordered a 48-hour stay.
But before ahearing took place, Dehghani Hossein Abadi was flown to France — in defiance of the judge's order.
Kerry Doyle, one of Dehghani Hossein Abadi's lawyers, called his removal “an outrage."
At the scheduled hearing Tuesday morning, Judge Richard Stearns said the case was now moot, since the student was already out of the country.
“There seems to be some history of CBP ignoring district court orders, which should concern the court," Doyle said during the hearing. She asked that Dehghani Hossein Abadi be returned to the United States, but the judge said there was little he could do to compel immigration officials now that the student was gone.
“I do not think I have the authority to do that," Stearns said.
Dehghani Hossein Abadi is one of at least three Iranian students barred from attending Boston-area schools since September. One of the students hoped to attend Harvard, and another was in the middle of earning an advanced degree at Northeastern. Nationwide, at least 11 Iranian students have been turned away since August at airports across the country despite having valid visas, according to the New York Times.
It was not immediately clear why the Dehghani Hossein Abadi was sent away after the emergency order was issued. According to his attorneys, Burroughs issued her order at 9:27 p.m. Monday, and the Air France flight carrying Dehghani Hossein Abadi to Paris took off soon after 10 p.m. He was not able to speak with his lawyers before he left the country.
Department of Homeland Security officials said that Dehghani Hossein Abadi was the last passenger to board the flight and that the government didn't have the court order at that time.
Customs and Border Protection have wide latitude at ports of entry, such as airports, and there are many reasons a non-US citizen can be denied entry, according to immigration experts. In Dehghani Hossein Abadi's case, customs officials indicated to his lawyers that he had been blocked because he intended to overstay his student visa.
Customs and Border Protection officials said on Tuesday that he was a candidate for expedited removal and ordered him on the Air France flight out of Logan.
But Doyle denied that he planned to remain in the United States longterm, noting that he has no family here.
Dehghani Hossein Abadi's family owns a private construction and export company in Iran, Doyle said. The company has no connection to the Iranian government or any “nefarious" ties. She also noted that he had received his student visa to come to the United States after a long vetting process and the US government would have likely flagged any concerns about Dehghani Hossein Abadi, his family, or any potential problematic activities then.
The Times, quoting an unnamed government official, said officers at the airport had found evidence that Dehghani Hossein Abadi had family members affiliated with a company that had been subject to U.S. government sanctions for providing weapons to Hezbollah. The Muslim organization is considered a terrorist group by the U.S.
Customs officials said Tuesday that applicants, “must demonstrate they are admissible into the US by overcoming all grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds."
But immigration lawyers said they are seeing more cases of customs officials at Logan Airport turning back Iranian students.
The refusal to admit the students comes amid deteriorating US-Iran relations.
US service members were injured after an Iranian attack on an airbase in Iraq this month — retaliation for the US killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani.
There were 12,140 Iranian students studying at US colleges and universities during the 2018-19 school year.
“This is not an isolated incident," said Susan Church, an immigration lawyer, who is representing Dehghani Hossein Abadi and others. “This is a pattern of misbehavior by this administration who lacks respect for the rule of law and lacks respect for the individuals here who are coming here to attend school and get a degree and further their knowledge."
In mid-September, Reihana Emami Arandi, 35, a Harvard Divinity School student, was denied entry to the United States after nine hours of questioning by customs officials.
In October, Mohammad Moradi, who was getting his doctoral degree in electrical engineering at Northeastern, was turned away at Logan upon returning from Paris after presenting a paper at a conference there.
Moradi had traveled back and forth to Canada to visit an uncle who is a Christian minister there in the months before without any problems, but he was stopped at Logan, said his attorney Laura Murray-Tjan.
Emami Arandi said she received little information about why she was turned away, except a suggestion that she wanted to stay in the United States, not simply study here.
Emani Arandi said she was eager to earn her religious studies master's at Harvard and had turned down other programs and quit her engineering job before she came to the United States.
But when she got to Logan, she was treated as “suspect not like a student." In addition to questions about her travel and work history, customs officials also asked her about the Quran she was carrying and political questions, such as what she thought about the recent explosion of oil fields in Saudi Arabia. When she went to the bathroom, two female government officials accompanied her, Emani Arandi said.
She was also not allowed to call Harvard for assistance, she said.
“I couldn't imagine such a thing could happen to me," said Emani Arandi, who is back in Iran and has asked a US district court judge to review the customs decision. “I couldn't imagine unfair behavior would happen to somebody who is coming to study."
Northeastern University officials said they are trying to get a better understanding of how customs officials are determining when to block the US entry of students with valid visas.
“It's unclear if this is a new policy or what is happening," said Jigisha Patel, an assistant general counsel at Northeastern. For students to get a valid visa and then within a week of traveling be turned away for reasons that aren't clear is upsetting, Patel said.
“It causes a lot of stress and a lot of anxiety, and it's not something that should be happening," Patel said.
Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said with so many colleges and universities in the Boston area, these immigration issues are worrisome.
“Think of the implications of this on a center of education like Massachusetts," Rose said. International students are unlikely to want to study here. “This is bad for our economy."

For some people, Super Bowl Sunday is devoted to watching a football game. For others, like me, you know the broad strokes of what to do on that first Sunday in February: Make a killer seven-layer dip, show up to a party, eat some wings, catch the half-time show, and evaluate the commercials. But what is a non-fan to do when the actual football game is on?
Play board games, that’s what. Take it from someone who knows: It is possible to be physically present at a Super Bowl party and not absorb one moment of the game itself—and be entertained by one of these board games, which are quiet, don’t take up a ton of space, and will keep you happily occupied till the last down.
1. For those who want to stay on-theme: Tabletop football
Tabletop football is commonly played with two pieces of folded-up notebook paper, a desk, and two hands. But you can give it an upgrade with this more official version, which comes with two plastic goal posts with suction-cup bottoms and 10 plastic “flickers” covered in logos of NFL teams. Because it’s small—the goal posts are 5 by 8 inches and the flickers are 1 by 2 inches—it’s easy to break out during any dull moment and, because it’s basically the same as what’s happening on the TV, football fans might even get in on the action, too.
Get the Flick It Football set on Amazon for $19. 77
2. For wordsmiths: Bananagrams
This classic portable wordplay game is perfect for anyone who wants to flex the same part of their brain as they would with Scrabble, without the time commitment or bulk. In Bananagrams, you race against opponents to build letter tiles into words until you use up all your tiles. The amount of time you dedicate to Bananagrams is up to you, depending on how many rounds you go through (each round is about five minutes). Up to eight people can play at a time, but you can also technically play Bananagrams by yourself—a version of the game the manufacturer calls “Banana Solitaire”—so if everyone else is glued to the TV, you’ll still have something to keep you occupied.
Get Bananagrams on Amazon for $14. 95
3. For those who’d rather be watching a movie: The Cinephile card game
If you’re like me, the real Super Bowl happens the following week, when the Academy Awards airs. For enduring a football game, the Cinephile card game is a movie lover’s must-have. The card set allows you to play at least five different games at three levels—“Movie Geek” (Easy), “Film Nerd” (Intermediate), and “Cinephile,” (Expert)—that include linking actors through a six degrees of separation test, trying to outdo your opponents in naming actors’ filmographies, and more.
Because it only requires one deck of 150 cards and two (or more) players, you can entertain yourself during the game, even if your usual favorite part of the Super Bowl is spotting actors in commercials.
Get the Cinephile Card Game on Amazon for $18
4. For those who’d think they’d make great spies: Codenames
There’s a reason why spy-roleplaying game Codenames is often at the top of Amazon’s best-selling games list: It’s a huge crowd pleaser. In it, players split into two teams and select one member to be the “Spymaster. ” The Spymasters then choose 25 cards bearing codenames at random and give out clues to get their teammates to guess the words. The team that gets through all their words first wins. Reviewers say the game is easy to learn, quick to play (about 10 to 20 minutes long), and works well with (but does not require) large groups, so you’ll be able to get in a few rounds—with as many or as few people who want to join—during each half.
Get Codenames on Amazon for $18. 78
5. For aspiring property moguls: Monopoly Deal
Want to play Monopoly, but don’t want to devote two-plus hours (and the inevitable resentment you feel for the friends and family you play with) to the game? Grab a Monopoly Deal card set, which should scratch your real estate-developer itch in about 15 minutes. The goal of the game is to be the first player to collect three full property sets of different colors—but your opponents can also serve you with cards that force you to give up certain cards, or pieces of property. It can be played by two to five people.
“I can't believe how much fun this game is within around 15 minutes for a round,” writes a reviewer. “This is such a great design to combine strategy, luck and excitement for school age kids and grown up together. Now the grown ups also have tons of fun because this game makes you think. The huge bonus is you can bring this card game to any place easily since it eliminates all the paper money and pieces. ”
Get Monopoly Deal on Amazon for $6. 26
6. For game watchers who also need a project: A football-themed puzzle
If you like the idea of sitting in front of the television while the game is on, but need something to do with your hands and mind at the same time—similar to what one might experience while knitting and watching TV—get a puzzle. As you do it, you can keep one eye on the game and one on the puzzle, and anyone who has a spare hand and moment can add in a piece when they see a fit. Plus, if you get this football-themed one, you’ll still technically be taking part in the event’s purpose.
Get the Football Jigsaw Puzzle for $32. 54
7. For vocab lovers: A crossword book
In a similarly semi-cerebral vein, a crossword book is a great pastime, especially if you’re alone in your pigskin apathy. All you need to work on it is a pen (OK, fine, a pencil) and your brain. You can make it more of a social experience by enlisting the help of fellow guests for tricky clues—particularly for sports-related hints, which may not be your forte. (I’m just guessing here. )
Get the New York Times Sunday Crossword Puzzle Book on Amazon for $10. 47
8. For the ones who have faith in their psychic ability: The Mind
In The Mind, two to four players work together to organize a deck of 100 numbered cards in ascending order. This sounds simple, until you consider the game’s main rule: no talking. Instead, you must communicate with your eyes and intuition to sort the cards. It being just a deck of cards make this game portable, and the silence factor means football-agnostic people can play in the main party area without distracting from the game.
Get The Mind on Amazon for $12. 99
9. For the ones who’d rather be playing Dungeons and Dragons: Dragoon
Dragoon is a strategy game for two to four people, in which players inhabit the mindset of dragons who live on an island and must compete among one another to end up with the most coins. When it’s your turn, you choose between claiming villages, which gives you periodic tributes from the island’s human residents, or destroying them to immediately receive a payout in the form of coins. You can also challenge other dragons/players to steal their gold, and the game ends when the last piece has been stolen. One reviewer says Dragoon is “fairly easy to explain to newcomers and even easier to pick up,” and comes with a cool cloth carrying bag. That, plus its 30 to 60 minute playing time—which should allow you to complete one game before halftime—make it a great game to tote along to your Super Bowl party.
Get Dragoon on Amazon for $4. 99
10. For anyone who wants to keep it simple: A standard deck of cards
If you’re not sure what you’d like to play but know you want to have something to do while the game is on, you can’t go wrong with a deck of cards. With it, you can play games that range from easy (Go Fish) to more complex (Blackjack or Poker)—or simple Solitaire, if no one else wants to join in.

More Fun with Impeachment History; The continuing effort to claim the Founders intended partisan convictions for non-crimes.

Texto completo: Arriving in the Senate to present neither a criminal allegation nor a bipartisan House judgment to remove the President, Democrats managing impeachment have repeatedly tried to claim that America's Founders would approve of their case. This appeal to authority is a bit strange from people who spend much of their time trying to undo the work of the Founders, especially when it comes to the Constitution's first two Amendments. It gets stranger when one examines the history of impeachment.
The Democrats' case is a heavy lift, so friends in media and academia have tried to help. On Thursday this column noted the effort to suggest that Alexander Hamilton would endorse the current partisan adventure. But he's not the only one being posthumously and dubiously enlisted in the anti-Trump campaign.
The basic idea is to suggest that partisan allegations of non-crimes are completely consistent with the history of impeachment. Charlie Savage writes this week in the New York Times:
One precedent — a high-profile case against a former British governor-general in India named Warren Hastings accused of mismanagement, mistreatment of locals and military misconduct — unfolded during the drafting and ratification of the Constitution and was reported in American newspapers.
His chief prosecutor, the famous parliamentarian Edmund Burke, argued that Mr. Hastings's actions violated the public trust even though they were not indictable. (Mr. Hastings was acquitted, but only many years later.)
The original draft of the Constitution had made only treason and bribery a basis for impeachment. But according to James Madison's notes of the Constitutional Convention, George Mason brought up the Hastings case and proposed expanding the definition of impeachment to cover something like it. After rejecting the term "maladministration" as too broad, the convention participants decided to add the English term "high crimes and misdemeanors."
A closer reading of that moment in history shows that Mason only said that Hastings wasn't guilty of treason, not that he hadn't committed any crimes. Readers will also note in the relevant passage that Madison explicitly warned against the type of case now occurring in the U.S. Senate.
At the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia on September 8, 1787 delegates debated the issue:
The clause referring to the Senate, the trial of impeachments agst. the President, for Treason & bribery, was taken up. Col. MASON. Why is the provision restrained to Treason & bribery only? Treason as defined in the Constitution will not reach many great and dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitution may not be Treason as above defined. As bills of attainder which have saved the British Constitution are forbidden, it is the more necessary to extend: the power of impeachments. He movd. to add after "bribery" "or maladministration."
Mr. GERRY seconded him.
Mr. MADISON So vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.
Mr. Govr. MORRIS, it will not be put in force & can do no harm. An election of every four years will prevent maladministration.
Col. MASON withdrew "maladministration" & substitutes "other high crimes & misdemesnors agst. the State"
Writing in Smithsonian magazine in 2017 Erick Trickey writes that Hastings had indeed been charged with crimes:
Hastings had been impeached in May 1787, the same month the U.S. constitutional convention opened. The House of Commons charged Hastings with a mix of criminal offenses and non-criminal offenses, including confiscating land and provoking a revolt in parts of India.
Remember that several months ago Democrats considered accusing President Trump of bribery but realized they had no evidence and no case. After the U.S. Constitutional Convention in 1787, over in the U.K. the Hastings trial proceeded and on February 18, 1788 Edmund Burke argued of Hastings:
We say, then, not only that he governed arbitrarily, but corruptly,—that is to say, that he was a giver and receiver of bribes, and formed a system for the purpose of giving and receiving them. We wish your Lordships distinctly to consider that he did not only give and receive bribes accidentally, as it happened, without any system and design, merely as the opportunity or momentary temptation of profit urged him to it, but that he has formed plans and systems of government for the very purpose of accumulating bribes and presents to himself. This system of Mr. Hastings's government is such a one, I believe, as the British nation in particular will disown; for I will venture to say, that, if there is any one thing which distinguishes this nation eminently above another, it is, that in its offices at home, both judicial and in the state, there is less suspicion of pecuniary corruption attaching to them than to any similar offices in any part of the globe, or that have existed at any time: so that he who would set up a system of corruption, and attempt to justify it upon the principle of utility, that man is staining not only the nature and character of office, but that which is the peculiar glory of the official and judicial character of this country; and therefore, in this House, which is eminently the guardian of the purity of all the offices of this kingdom, he ought to be called eminently and peculiarly to account. There are many things, undoubtedly, in crimes, which make them frightful and odious; but bribery, filthy hands, a chief governor of a great empire receiving bribes from poor, miserable, indigent people, this is what makes government itself base, contemptible, and odious in the eyes of mankind.
To this point the Trump case bears little resemblance to the impeachment of Warren Hastings. As for the Democrats' rendering of history, it may remind some Senate jurors of the impeachment of Morty Seinfeld.

Texto completo: This content is provided exclusively to the Citizen Times by staffers at Malaprop's Bookstore/Cafe, 55 Haywood St., Asheville. To learn more, call 828-254-6734 or visit malaprops.com. The events described are free.
'Why We Can't Sleep' "Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis" is a book for women like its Gen X author, Ada Calhoun, who "by virtue of being middle class, grew up with reasonable expectation of opportunity and success," but have had a hard time finding either. Calhoun makes the case that Gen X women, sandwiched between Baby Boomers and Millennials, face "a gauntlet of anxieties" about money ("Gen X has more debt than any other generation), divorce ("our generation are the beta-tested victims of the Boomers' record-high divorce rate"), and caring for young children and ailing parents simultaneously ("the caretaking rack").
Calhoun consulted data from the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Equality of Opportunity Project at Harvard and spoke with more than 200 women across America about the stresses that keep them, literally and metaphorically, up at night. Most of the women — a generation raised to "have it all" — were "exhausted, terrified about money, under-employed, and overwhelmed. Instead of being heard, they were told instead to lean, take 'me-time,' or make a chore chart to get their lives and homes in order."
Calhoun began her book because, much like the women she writes about, she was unhappy with her life. But though it was written for Gen X-ers, women of any generation will find a good deal to relate to in "Why We Can't Sleep." With both insight and humor, Calhoun offers readers useful advice on moving beyond this pervasive mid-life predicament.
Ada Calhoun will discuss "Why We Can't Sleep" with New York Times bestselling author Denise Kiernan to kick off Kiernan's new series, "CRAFT: Authors in Conversation." The event will take place at 3 p.m. Jan. 26 at Little Jumbo, 241 Broadway St. Doors open at 2:30 p.m.The event is free, but if you are not already a Little Jumbo member, there is a one-time $1 fee. A small number of reserved seats will be available to those who purchase "Why We Can't Sleep" from Malaprop's before the event. Additional seating and standing room will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

More 'Bad Kitty' What's new, pussycat? Plenty, when the cat in question is Nick Bruel's famous creation, "Bad Kitty." The sometimes grumpy feline began as the star of picture books (now numbering five). She's graduated to be the lead in a hugely popular series of New York Times-bestselling chapter books for young readers. But if you have kids, you know.
Nick is our kind of author and illustrator — one who began as a bookseller! His picture book, "Who is Melvin Bubble?," received the NC Children's Book Award (this is one that children vote on). He's also written other picture books, but Bad Kitty is the character kids clamor for. There are now a dozen chapter books. Nick's latest is the chapter book, "Bad Kitty Joins the Team."
When Kitty's owner realizes she's out of shape (and can't catch Mouse without wheezing), the prescription is exercise. Of course, Kitty cheerfully jumps on the workout bandwagon (ha, ha, only kidding).
When a Cats Versus Rodents competition becomes much more than organizer Strange Kitty and referee Uncle Murray plan for, will a newly-energized Bad Kitty be of help?
As with all the Bad Kitty books, the heavily-illustrated story is interspersed with "Uncle Murray Fun Facts." So in between giggles, kids learn about healthy exercise, the importance of drinking water, and about many unusual rodents who show up as ringers in the competition. But we won't tell them they're learning if you won't.
Nick Bruel visits Malaprop's Bookstore/Café at 6 p.m. Jan. 28. Come on in, kids! And if you want to wear kitty cat ears, go right ahead.

Texto completo: Years from now, as the no-trial impeachment trial of President Trump is reduced to lowlights by history, one image will indelibly symbolize the travesty: Idaho's Jim Risch asleep during the trial on the Senate floor.
Risch - who promised to keep an open mind while making it clear, along with his fellow Senate Republicans, that he would not - actually took a 15-minute siesta Tuesday on the first day of the trial.
Nothing so clearly represents the nothing-matters, say-anything nature of the GOP response to impeachment, the collective, cynical shrug in the face of a slam-dunk case, as Sleeping Beauty Risch.
"It is what it is," a refreshed Risch told a reporter for Boise's KTVB. "We are human beings."
It doesn't really matter, of course, whether Risch sleeps or not. He might as well put in ear buds and listen to whale songs while wearing an eye mask and silk jammies. He might as well Nyquil his way through the whole thing. He and his fellows in the Senate majority are making a mockery of their constitutional responsibility here, and there's no reason to think a little actual slumber during the facts will make any difference.
"Sleeping off the facts" is the whole brand now.
It's basically what Cathy McMorris Rodgers and her fellow "no" votes did in the House. McMorris Rodgers, reprising her frequent role as a Pez dispenser for talking points, has compliantly criticized the impeachment as a "sham" and as "political." The latter critique is especially empty coming from her - one of the many Republicans who have sold their principles on the political market and fallen in line behind a venal, corrupt dotard.
But, hey, give her some credit: She at least propped her eyelids open while sleeping off the facts.
Risch practically snored.
Risch, who got rich as a trial lawyer and whose history of political service to Idaho includes the governorship in 2006 and 2007, has been a staunch ally of the president and has earned a reputation as one who will tie himself into even more knots than others to ever avoid acknowledging anything even slightly off about the president.
His Tuesday nap came about four hours into the trial. Florida Democratic Rep. Val Demings was making an eventually unsuccessful argument that the Senate should subpoena the State Department - that it should, you know, seek and weigh facts.
More than one senator was spotted yawning after hours in the room, according to news reports, so he wasn't the only one whose wakefulness was tested. But Risch nodded all the way off. Several news accounts confirmed this, including a sketch artist for the New York Times and the NBC report that Risch was "most definitely sound asleep."
The Times sketch showed Risch, slumped in an apparent doze, "catching a few winks" between Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.
Oddly, a lot of the subsequent coverage focused not on the fact that a senator - a juror sworn to honestly render a verdict on the facts - was asleep, but that he was the first senator to fall asleep.
As though slumber was just to be expected.
In any case, Risch's office at first simply denied it. The senator, his office initially said, was just listening "with his eyes closed or cast down."
Later, Risch ramblingly acknowledged that that wasn't true.
"The media is keeping a list of those they believe dozed off and I think that list is up to about 20 Republicans and Democrats," he said. "Look, you can't deny that, you sit there for 11 hours on something like that. Do you slip off? Maybe. It is what it is, we are human beings."
That estimate of the list is off, so far as I can tell, by 19. But, like his snoozing, it fits right into this mockery of a presidential defense.
Nothing matters. Say anything. Go ahead and rest your eyes.

Texto completo: I'm USA TODAY editor-in-chief Nicole Carroll, and this is the Backstory, insights into our biggest stories of the week. If you'd like to get the Backstory in your inbox every Friday, sign up here.
Annabella Sciorra choked up Thursday telling a jury how Harvey Weinstein raped her: 'I was punching him, I was kicking him, I was trying to get him away from me. '
The "Sopranos" actress was the first accuser to take the stand in the Weinstein trial. The former Hollywood giant is charged with five sex crimes, including rape and sexual assault, from encounters with two women, one in 2013, one in 2006. He denies the accusations and says the encounters were consensual.
Sciorra's allegation is not included in the charges because it's too old to prosecute under the statute of limitations. Prosecutors had her testify to bolster the "predatory" charges against Weinstein.
More than 80 women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct or crimes since The New York Times and The New Yorker reported on accusations against him in October 2017.
The trial takes place in a Manhattan courtroom that holds about 100. Journalists start lining up outside at 4 a. m. to get one of 70 reserved seats. The public gets the other 30.
USA TODAY's Patrick Ryan waits in that line. He knows the importance of this story.
"Weinstein was the tipping point of the Me Too movement," Ryan says. “It opened the floodgates for so many other victims to come forward. "
So many accusations. So many denials. And a few apologies.
Hollywood. Media. Tech. Athletics. Military academies. Hospitality industry. Universities. Community organizations. Politicians.
One by one – tearfully, fearlessly or angrily – women (and men) shared their stories.
The country was listening.
Harvey Weinstein scandal: A list of accusers
The 94% project: How common is sexual misconduct in Hollywood?
The Harvey Weinstein story is about so much more than Harvey Weinstein.
USA TODAY investigative reporter Marisa Kwiatkowski was a lead reporter on the Indianapolis Star story that revealed the abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.
These cases are, in part, about power, she says.
"Nassar was a prominent sports physician. Some survivors felt that they wouldn’t be believed because of his reputation," she says. "Some adults did discount allegations because of who he was. "
By the time he was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in jail for criminal sexual conduct, more than 150 women had shared their stories of abuse.
Such cases are also often about negligence.
"You see this with Boy Scouts, who hundreds of accusers say have not made meaningful steps in resolving the crisis they’re facing and are now looking at potential financial restructuring, including bankruptcy,” investigative reporter Cara Kelly says. "You see it with Uber and Lyft, who are accused, and our reporting has backed, of putting public perception above their riders. "
Perhaps most of all, these cases are about deep breaths, brave conversations – and accountability.
In the first year after actress Alyssa Milano asked women who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to post "Me Too" on Twitter, according to Pew Research Center, the #MeToo hashtag was used more than 19 million times. (Activist Tarana Burke started the phrase and movement in 2006. )
"The Weinstein victims broke the dam of silence – and have made everyone from 21-year-old women assaulted by their Lyft drivers to 70-year-old men abused by their Scoutmasters feel empowered to speak," Kelly says.
Sexual abuse is horrific for the violation itself – and the shame it leaves behind. Shame thrives in secrecy. It paralyzes. When victims talk about their experiences, the grip lessens.
And, as a good friend says, courage is contagious.
"I’ve talked to so many grown men who were sharing their stories for the first time," Kelly says. "They were so deeply ashamed, they couldn’t have dreamed of telling anyone when it happened. And now they’re crying with a reporter they’ve never met, explaining the pain and trauma it caused.
"This never would have happened before Weinstein or #metoo went viral. And neither would the accountability. "
And that is why Ryan will line up with other reporters outside that courtroom each morning. The Harvey Weinstein story is an important one to cover. And it is about far more than Harvey Weinstein.

The NCAA will review policies on sexual misconduct after USA TODAY Network investigation.
Our investigation found that although college athletes can be punished for grades, drugs and accepting free meals or money, the NCAA Division I handbook has no punishments for sexual, violent or criminal misconduct. Athletes can even be suspended from one school for rape but transfer to another and continue playing.
In January 2019, investigative reporter Kenny Jacoby got a tip that a University of Oregon professor had documents detailing how the U. S. Education Department helped scrub the record of a former Duck football player expelled for raping two female students.
That athlete transferred from Oregon to a junior college, then to an NCAA Division I school in Texas, where he remains an NFL prospect. After convincing the professor to share the documents, Jacoby began to dig deeper into the NCAA’s lack of transfer regulations for dangerous athletes.
This review by the NCAA comes amid pressure from members of Congress. Days after the USA TODAY Network investigation, they filed a bill to conduct an independent study of the NCAA’s lack of accountability for such athletes.
"This is huge," says investigations managing editor Emily Le Coz. "The NCAA refused to answer our questions. They did not participate in the yearlong investigation. It was a complete stonewalling.
"The NCAA now realizes this is a problem bigger than themselves. And if they don't fix it, someone else will. "

Even the liberty-loving US is sleepwalking into a surveillance state

Texto completo: There is much about the future that keeps me up at night -- AI weaponry, undetectable viral deepfakes, indefatigable and infinitely wise robotic op-ed columnists -- but in the last few years, one technological threat has blipped my fear radar much faster than others.
That fear? Ubiquitous surveillance.
I am no longer sure that human civilization can undo or evade living under constant, extravagantly detailed physical and even psychic surveillance; as a species, we are not doing nearly enough to avoid always being watched or otherwise digitally recorded.
Your location, your purchases, video and audio from within your home and office, your online searches and every digital wandering, biometric tracking of your face and other body parts, your heart rate and other vital signs, your every communication, recording and perhaps your deepest thoughts or idlest dreams -- in the future, if not already, much of this data and more will be collected and analyzed by some combination of governments and corporations, among them a handful of megacompanies whose powers nearly match those of governments.
Why am I so pessimistic? Over the last year, as part of New York Times Opinion's Privacy Project, I've participated in experiments in which my devices were closely monitored in order to determine the kind of data that was being collected about me. The experiments have given me new insight into the psychology underpinning surveillance; I've realized how blind we are to the kinds of insights tech companies are gaining about us through our gadgets. Our blindness not only keeps us glued to privacy-invading tech -- it also means that we've failed to create a political culture that is in any way up to the task of limiting surveillance.
That's why, across the species, whether under American or European democracy or Chinese authoritarianism, few of our cultural or political institutions are even much trying to tamp down the surveillance state.
In China, the government is building a frightening surveillance dragnet in broad daylight, stitching together facial recognition, fingerprint and other databases into an all-seeing eye aiming to closely watch more than a billion citizens.
Yet the United States and other supposedly liberty-loving Western democracies have not ruled out such a future. Just consider the odd politics surrounding privacy invasion. Donald Trump and his supporters repeatedly argue that the FBI is corrupt and untrustworthy. Yet, like Barack Obama before him, Trump and the Justice Department are pushing Apple to create a backdoor into the data on encrypted iPhones -- they want the untrustworthy FBI and any local cop to be able to see everything inside anyone's phone.
Apple, mercifully, is resisting, just as it did the request of Obama's Justice Department to create a loophole in iPhone security -- but the fact that both Obama and Trump agreed on the need for breaking iPhone encryption suggests how thoroughly political leaders across a wide spectrum have neglected privacy as a fundamental value worthy of protection.
Indeed, because of a dearth of laws protecting our privacy -- and almost no high-profile political discussion about the stakes at hand -- Americans are sleepwalking into a future nearly as frightening as the one the Chinese are constructing. I choose the word "sleepwalking" deliberately, because when it comes to digital privacy, a lot of us prefer the comfortable bliss of ignorance. As a result, much of the surveillance engine operates underground -- just beyond where many of us dare to look.
In recent months my colleagues at The New York Times and other media outlets have published a series of shattering investigations into modern digital surveillance. Among other revelations: Advertising companies and data brokers are keeping insanely close tabs on smartphones' location data, tracking users so precisely that their databases could arguably compromise national security or political liberty. There are few meaningful checks on scanning for people using facial recognition, genetic profiles or other biometric data. Tracking technologies have become cheap and widely available -- for less than $100, my colleagues were able to identify people walking by surveillance cameras in Bryant Park in Manhattan.
This past weekend, The Times' Kashmir Hill reported on a company called Clearview AI that has created a tool that "could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously." By scraping pictures from Facebook, YouTube and other websites to create a huge database of faces, the company lets cops identify people just by snapping a photo. It's Shazam for faces, not very different from the kind of facial recognition tools we worry the authorities may be using in China -- and even though hundreds of police departments may have access to it, almost no one outside the company understands how it works.
The Clearview AI story suggests another reason to worry that our march into surveillance has become inexorable: Each new privacy-invading technology builds on a previous one, allowing for scary outcomes from new integrations and collections of data that few users might have anticipated.
I was recently confronted by this sort of cascade with my own smartphone tracking data. Late last year, with the help of Stuart Thompson, an Opinion editor, I set up my phone to monitor how certain apps were tracking me. I focused on apps that required me to grant them access to my physical location -- among them apps to find cheap gas, coupons and nearby retail discounts, and to otherwise help me navigate and find deals as I wandered about the world.
The upshot: As the location-tracking apps followed me, I was able to capture the pings they sent to online servers -- essentially recording their spying. I sent the data to Stuart and his team, who interpreted and mapped the pings the apps had collected about me. Their picture shocked me; the apps had followed me far more closely, capturing much more data and far more often, than I had imagined when I'd said yes to their tracking.
You can see the apps are essentially stalking me. They see me drive out one morning to the gas station, then to the produce store, then to Safeway; later on I passed by a music school, stopped at a restaurant, then Whole Foods. But location was only one part of the data the companies had about me; because geographic data is often combined with other personal information -- including a mobile advertising ID that can help merge what you see and do online with where you go in the real world -- the story these companies can tell about me is actually far more detailed than I can tell about myself.
Like a lot of people, I've long justified my apathy about privacy through innocence: I'm a stand-up guy -- what do I have to hide?
But looking at the God's-eye view that a few coupon apps can glean about me, I can no longer pretend I've got nothing to worry about. Sure, I'm not a criminal -- but do I want anyone to learn everything about me? And more to the point: Is it wise for us to let any entity learn everything about everyone?
Because those are the stakes. The remaining uncertainty about the surveillance state is not whether we will submit to it -- only how readily and completely, and how thoroughly it will warp our society.
Will we allow the government and corporations unrestricted access to every bit of data we ever generate, or will we decide that some kinds of collections, like the encrypted data on your phone, should be forever off-limits, even when a judge has issued a warrant for it?
In the future, will there be room for any true secret -- will society allow any unrecorded thought or communication to evade detection and commercial analysis? And, if there can be no more secrets, how will we account for what we lose? How completely will living under surveillance numb creativity and silence radical thought? Can human agency survive the possibility that some companies will know more about all of us than any of us can ever know about ourselves?
I'm worried we'll soon be forced to find out.

Texto completo: Dashing the hopes of thousands of families desperate for word about loved ones who went missing during Sri Lanka's long, grisly civil war, the country's new president has offered an unsparing rebuff to their quest for closure.
The missing are in fact dead, said the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and "I can't bring back the dead."
The government, eager to close a painful chapter in the country's history, plans to issue death certificates for the missing Sri Lankans, a number put at 24,000.
But not all Sri Lankans who are missing relatives in the 26-year war, which ended in 2009, were ready to accept that the cases are closed. Some rejected the notion that the years they had spent searching for loved ones in the hope that they survived had been in vain.
"Even after 21 years, I still do not accept that my son is no more," said Visakha Dharmadasa, whose son disappeared at the height of the civil war between the government and Tamil Tiger insurgents.
She said she planned to keep her son's certificate of absence, a document that allowed the families of the missing to make legal decisions on their behalf.
Sri Lanka is haunted by the scars of its civil war.
Even as the country tries to move on, devastating reminders of the carnage crop up. It is not uncommon for mass graves and old weapons caches to be uncovered during excavations to build shopping centers or upscale hotels in the country, which became a tourist hot spot after the conflict had ended.
Now, Rajapaksa appears to be seeking to usher in a new era for the country by trying to close one of the final chapters of the war: the file of the missing.
Rajapaksa was defense secretary during the last years of the civil war and was accused of gross human rights abuses as he crushed the insurgency and brought the conflict to an end. Thousands of civilians were killed. The president has consistently denied any wrongdoing during his time as defense secretary.
Not all missing-person cases are from the war years.
Several journalists and political dissidents disappeared off Sri Lanka's streets after the guns had gone silent, when Rajapaksa and his brothers were spearheading the government. When Rajapaksa was defense secretary, his brother Mahinda served as president for a decade.
The family lost elections in 2015, and in 2017, the country's Criminal Investigation Department told a court that during Gotabaya Rajapaksa's time as defense secretary, he ran a death squad that had targeted opponents. He denied the allegation.
After the family's 2015 defeat, police ended a kidnapping racket run by Sri Lankan navy officers that investigators said had killed 11 young men.
The Rajapaksas returned to power last fall. The president's assertion that there was no point in pursuing the search for the missing came over the weekend, at a meeting with a top United Nations official.
Most of the missing, Rajapaksa said, had been forcefully conscripted by the Tamil Tigers, who were seeking to establish their own state in the north, and most likely had died on the battlefield.
A statement from his office said that "steps would be taken to issue a death certificate to these missing persons."
But for some families, presidential finality was not enough. They want hard evidence, like remains.
"The Sri Lankan government cannot dismiss their grievances and simply issue them death certificates -- that is not only illegal but also unconscionable," said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, an Amnesty International researcher based in Colombo, the capital.
The government, she said, had acted "without conducting an effective and independent investigation, where the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the disappeared person is found and shared with relatives."
In 2013, a presidential commission to investigate missing-person complaints was appointed.
"The history of conflict in Sri Lanka is characterized by the agony of individuals and families who are seeking closure to the pain of not knowing what has become of their relations and loved ones," the commission declared in its final report.
The commission said it had registered 24,000 cases, at least 5,000 of them involving combatants who disappeared during the war.
Its report also pointed a finger at the Sri Lankan military. The evidence, it said, "had clearly established that several individuals who surrendered to the Sri Lankan military" were "among the disappeared."

Texto completo: Patton Oswalt has built a multifaceted career as a stand-up comedian, TV and film actor and best-selling author.
He's best known for playing Spence Olchin on "The King of Queens." He has also appeared in or voiced characters for "Ratatouille," "Two and a Half Men," "Veep" and "Veronica Mars." He won a Critics' Choice Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series for the role of Garth Blundin on "Parks and Recreation."
He wrote two New York Times best-sellers, "Zombie Spaceship Wasteland" and "Silver Screen Fiend."
Oswalt has done six stand-up comedy specials and released eight albums. He won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and a Grammy for Best Comedy Album for the Netflix special "Patton Oswalt: Talking for Clapping."
And he's a regular contributor to "Countdown with Keith Olbermann," "Real Time with Bill Maher" and "Lewis Black's Root of All Evil."
Oswalt will perform his stand-up show at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix on Jan. 25.
His stories are personal In his comedy, he often talks about topics personal to him, including his weight, quirks and love of sci-fi and comic books. He also discusses his family members, including his wife, daughter and parents.
He said his family members don't mind him talking about them because he doesn't represent them in a negative way.
"It clearly comes from love, so they're not upset about it," Oswalt said.
He has always been upfront about his political views and often delves into relevant social and political topics in his shows. He doesn't try to focus on politics, but he won't avoid talking about it.
"It's not like I'm looking to talk about politics, but sometimes you can't not talk about it. If I walk onstage and it looks like we're going to war, how do you not mention it? You look like you're insane if you don't acknowledge it," Oswalt said.
He tries to draw from his everyday experiences and observations in a way that others can relate to.
"What's always inspired me is everyday life and how I can connect it to something bigger and more universal, be it something really trivial, something pop cultural or something that feels trivial and personal but actually illuminates something about humanity," Oswalt said.
Strange moments in his life also inspire his stand-up routines. One of his stories revolves around a weird clown at a birthday party his family attended.
"Stuff like that obviously doesn't happen a lot, but when it does, you try to be as aware of it as you possibly can and then try to see if you can make a bit out of it," Oswalt says.
Getting comfortable on stage was a process It took time and practice to develop his ability to draw audiences in with his stories.
"It takes a while to get the confidence and stage presence to do that kind of thing. It just takes being comfortable onstage. ... It took five or six years for me to be comfortable with myself onstage, to be the same person I am offstage as on, not put on a persona and be that real," Oswalt said.
Each role he has played in TV and film has challenged him as a performer. Some roles, such as the mad-scientist sidekick TV Son of TV's Frank on "Mystery Science Theater 3000," have special meaning to him because of his lifelong love of science fiction.
"I grew up on that show in the early '90s, as I was starting comedy. I've always been a big Joel Hodgson fan ever since he was on 'SNL' in the '80s. To get to work with him up close, see how his mind works and watch how the writers riffed on movies was pretty fascinating to me," Oswalt said.
He will play the lead character in "MODOK," a Hulu streaming series coming this summer. It's based on a Marvel supervillain with an oversize head who has a knack for developing advanced weapons.
Oswalt doesn't have a predilection toward heroes or villains. He's interested in characters who are three-dimensional.
"I just prefer to play whatever is interesting, be it hero, villain or sidekick. It just depends on the project and depends on the script," Oswalt said.
He said his acting career has helped him in his stand-up.
"It gives you more exposure to help you to do more stand-up, and it also lets you flex different muscles that you find yourself using onstage when you are maybe acting out bits or doing a more complex joke," Oswalt said.
'I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me' From the time he was in high school, Oswalt had a natural gift for comedy. He hung out with other class clowns and watched comedians such as Steve Martin and Richard Pryor. Later, the comics he worked with influenced him.
"I was very lucky that I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me, because it made me work harder at what I did," Oswalt says.
Originally from Virginia, Oswalt started out in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s and went on to perform in San Francisco and Los Angeles. He said that all three scenes shaped him as a comedian.
"You're always influenced by the people that are around you and the people that you are working with. Dave Chappelle and I started on the same night, at the same club. People like Blaine Capatch. You're always influenced by the area that you are in," Oswalt said.
He says building a career like his requires putting in the work over many years.
"It takes constantly working on your craft and going onstage over and over again so that you get comfortable enough to keep doing newer and more challenging projects," Oswalt says.

Texto completo: Patton Oswalt has built a multifaceted career as a stand-up comedian, TV and film actor and best-selling author.
He's best known for playing Spence Olchin on "The King of Queens." He has also appeared in or voiced characters for "Ratatouille," "Two and a Half Men," "Veep" and "Veronica Mars." He won a Critics' Choice Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series for the role of Garth Blundin on "Parks and Recreation."
He wrote two New York Times best-sellers, "Zombie Spaceship Wasteland" and "Silver Screen Fiend."
Oswalt has done six stand-up comedy specials and released eight albums. He won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and a Grammy for Best Comedy Album for the Netflix special "Patton Oswalt: Talking for Clapping."
And he's a regular contributor to "Countdown with Keith Olbermann," "Real Time with Bill Maher" and "Lewis Black's Root of All Evil."
Oswalt will perform his stand-up show at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix on Jan. 25.
His stories are personal In his comedy, he often talks about topics personal to him, including his weight, quirks and love of sci-fi and comic books. He also discusses his family members, including his wife, daughter and parents.
He said his family members don't mind him talking about them because he doesn't represent them in a negative way.
"It clearly comes from love, so they're not upset about it," Oswalt said.
He has always been upfront about his political views and often delves into relevant social and political topics in his shows. He doesn't try to focus on politics, but he won't avoid talking about it.
"It's not like I'm looking to talk about politics, but sometimes you can't not talk about it. If I walk onstage and it looks like we're going to war, how do you not mention it? You look like you're insane if you don't acknowledge it," Oswalt said.
He tries to draw from his everyday experiences and observations in a way that others can relate to.
"What's always inspired me is everyday life and how I can connect it to something bigger and more universal, be it something really trivial, something pop cultural or something that feels trivial and personal but actually illuminates something about humanity," Oswalt said.
Strange moments in his life also inspire his stand-up routines. One of his stories revolves around a weird clown at a birthday party his family attended.
"Stuff like that obviously doesn't happen a lot, but when it does, you try to be as aware of it as you possibly can and then try to see if you can make a bit out of it," Oswalt says.
Getting comfortable on stage was a process It took time and practice to develop his ability to draw audiences in with his stories.
"It takes a while to get the confidence and stage presence to do that kind of thing. It just takes being comfortable onstage. ... It took five or six years for me to be comfortable with myself onstage, to be the same person I am offstage as on, not put on a persona and be that real," Oswalt said.
Each role he has played in TV and film has challenged him as a performer. Some roles, such as the mad-scientist sidekick TV Son of TV's Frank on "Mystery Science Theater 3000," have special meaning to him because of his lifelong love of science fiction.
"I grew up on that show in the early '90s, as I was starting comedy. I've always been a big Joel Hodgson fan ever since he was on 'SNL' in the '80s. To get to work with him up close, see how his mind works and watch how the writers riffed on movies was pretty fascinating to me," Oswalt said.
He will play the lead character in "MODOK," a Hulu streaming series coming this summer. It's based on a Marvel supervillain with an oversize head who has a knack for developing advanced weapons.
Oswalt doesn't have a predilection toward heroes or villains. He's interested in characters who are three-dimensional.
"I just prefer to play whatever is interesting, be it hero, villain or sidekick. It just depends on the project and depends on the script," Oswalt said.
He said his acting career has helped him in his stand-up.
"It gives you more exposure to help you to do more stand-up, and it also lets you flex different muscles that you find yourself using onstage when you are maybe acting out bits or doing a more complex joke," Oswalt said.
'I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me' From the time he was in high school, Oswalt had a natural gift for comedy. He hung out with other class clowns and watched comedians such as Steve Martin and Richard Pryor. Later, the comics he worked with influenced him.

Texto completo: Maya Moore is easily one of the greatest athletes of our time. In eight years in the WNBA, she has won four championships, one MVP trophy, another Finals MVP trophy and has been named an All-Star six times. She transformed the Lynx into a yearly contender.
That's GOAT level stuff. It all pales in comparison to what she's doing off the court.
Moore will skip her second WNBA season in a row and the Olympics this summer to focus on criminal justice reform, The New York Times reports. Specifically, the case of Jonathan Irons – a man who she believes was wrongfully convicted at age 16. He's 39 now.
Irons is in the middle of serving a 50-year prison sentence after being convicted of burglary and assaulting a homeowner with a gun in St. Louis. The homeowner was shot during the assault and testified that Irons was the perpetrator, but there was no evidence linking Irons to the crime.
Moore has been talking about this case since she met Irons in 2017. She took a year off from the game last year to minister in Atlanta and is doing the same this year.
This is unprecedented. We're not talking about this enough. This is Michael Jordan going into his first retirement, except for instead of sucking at baseball, Moore is being a boss in criminal justice.
She's 30. We have no idea how much basketball she actually has left in her where she's playing at a high level. We also have no idea when she's returning. But this is very clearly bigger than just basketball to her.
This is an opportunity for her to pull someone up and out of a trap that so many people fall into because of no fault of their own. They have no lifelines and no help. Moore is trying to be that for someone who truly needs it.
Over the last few years, athletes have found themselves pursuing the passions they have outside of their sport more and more. A lot have done real good with that newfound power. Add Moore to that ever-growing list.
Moore isn't retiring from the game just yet, but this is probably the closest thing to it. We might not ever see her play again. And if she comes back, there's no guarantee she'll be as good.
It's a massive sacrifice that she is choosing to make, but it's also one that could make a massive difference in somebody's world – bigger than any difference she could ever make on a basketball court.
If she never players a single minute in the WNBA again, it'll all be worth it.

Texto completo: Patton Oswalt has built a multifaceted career as a stand-up comedian, TV and film actor and best-selling author.
He's best known for playing Spence Olchin on "The King of Queens." He has also appeared in or voiced characters for "Ratatouille," "Two and a Half Men," "Veep" and "Veronica Mars." He won a Critics' Choice Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series for the role of Garth Blundin on "Parks and Recreation."
He wrote two New York Times best-sellers, "Zombie Spaceship Wasteland" and "Silver Screen Fiend."
Oswalt has done six stand-up comedy specials and released eight albums. He won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and a Grammy for Best Comedy Album for the Netflix special "Patton Oswalt: Talking for Clapping."
And he's a regular contributor to "Countdown with Keith Olbermann," "Real Time with Bill Maher" and "Lewis Black's Root of All Evil."
Oswalt will perform his stand-up show at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix on Jan. 25.
His stories are personal In his comedy, he often talks about topics personal to him, including his weight, quirks and love of sci-fi and comic books. He also discusses his family members, including his wife, daughter and parents.
He said his family members don't mind him talking about them because he doesn't represent them in a negative way.
"It clearly comes from love, so they're not upset about it," Oswalt said.
He has always been upfront about his political views and often delves into relevant social and political topics in his shows. He doesn't try to focus on politics, but he won't avoid talking about it.
"It's not like I'm looking to talk about politics, but sometimes you can't not talk about it. If I walk onstage and it looks like we're going to war, how do you not mention it? You look like you're insane if you don't acknowledge it," Oswalt said.
He tries to draw from his everyday experiences and observations in a way that others can relate to.
"What's always inspired me is everyday life and how I can connect it to something bigger and more universal, be it something really trivial, something pop cultural or something that feels trivial and personal but actually illuminates something about humanity," Oswalt said.
Strange moments in his life also inspire his stand-up routines. One of his stories revolves around a weird clown at a birthday party his family attended.
"Stuff like that obviously doesn't happen a lot, but when it does, you try to be as aware of it as you possibly can and then try to see if you can make a bit out of it," Oswalt says.
Getting comfortable on stage was a process It took time and practice to develop his ability to draw audiences in with his stories.
"It takes a while to get the confidence and stage presence to do that kind of thing. It just takes being comfortable onstage. ... It took five or six years for me to be comfortable with myself onstage, to be the same person I am offstage as on, not put on a persona and be that real," Oswalt said.
Each role he has played in TV and film has challenged him as a performer. Some roles, such as the mad-scientist sidekick TV Son of TV's Frank on "Mystery Science Theater 3000," have special meaning to him because of his lifelong love of science fiction.
"I grew up on that show in the early '90s, as I was starting comedy. I've always been a big Joel Hodgson fan ever since he was on 'SNL' in the '80s. To get to work with him up close, see how his mind works and watch how the writers riffed on movies was pretty fascinating to me," Oswalt said.
He will play the lead character in "MODOK," a Hulu streaming series coming this summer. It's based on a Marvel supervillain with an oversize head who has a knack for developing advanced weapons.
Oswalt doesn't have a predilection toward heroes or villains. He's interested in characters who are three-dimensional.
"I just prefer to play whatever is interesting, be it hero, villain or sidekick. It just depends on the project and depends on the script," Oswalt said.
He said his acting career has helped him in his stand-up.
"It gives you more exposure to help you to do more stand-up, and it also lets you flex different muscles that you find yourself using onstage when you are maybe acting out bits or doing a more complex joke," Oswalt said.
'I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me' From the time he was in high school, Oswalt had a natural gift for comedy. He hung out with other class clowns and watched comedians such as Steve Martin and Richard Pryor. Later, the comics he worked with influenced him.
"I was very lucky that I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me, because it made me work harder at what I did," Oswalt says.
Originally from Virginia, Oswalt started out in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s and went on to perform in San Francisco and Los Angeles. He said that all three scenes shaped him as a comedian.
"You're always influenced by the people that are around you and the people that you are working with. Dave Chappelle and I started on the same night, at the same club. People like Blaine Capatch. You're always influenced by the area that you are in," Oswalt said.
He says building a career like his requires putting in the work over many years.
"It takes constantly working on your craft and going onstage over and over again so that you get comfortable enough to keep doing newer and more challenging projects," Oswalt says.

Texto completo: Wednesday, the House Democrats began formal arguments in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
A number of people involved made not-quite-accurate claims over everything from Trump's phone call July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the Obama administration's aid to Ukraine.
Trump switches dates of Schiff's version of Zelensky phone call
President Donald Trump repeated one of his frequent factual errors Wednesday about Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff's exaggerated version of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky.
The president said the White House released its partial transcript of the call in response to Schiff's rendition, but it was released the day before, on Sept. 25. Speaking during an Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 26, Schiff did a "parody" of Trump's words on the call, and the president reacted by accusing him of treason.
"I'd watch his lies," Trump said in a Fox Business interview Wednesday. "I watch where they've actually played a rerun, which they shouldn't even do, it was so bad, where he goes before Congress, and he makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it.
"That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud," Trump said.
The president made a similar claim during a news conference in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. "When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say, 'Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.' "
Trump is correct that Schiff's version was not totally accurate, relative to the summary of the call released by the White House, but the administration could not have released the call summary in response to Schiff. Rather, Schiff's version was based on the summary.
Schiff gave "an embellished rendition of the White House memo of the July phone call," FactCheck.org said. "As we've explained before, Schiff said he was recounting 'the essence of what the president communicates' and 'in not so many words.' "
– Jeanine Santucci
Schiff: In 2016, Russia hacked Democrats after Trump's 'Russia, if you're listening …'
Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, said Wednesday, "In 2016, candidate Trump implored Russians to hack his opponent's email account, something the Russian military agency did hours later. Only hours later, they hacked his opponent's campaign."
Schiff referred to a remark Trump made July 27, 2016, during a news conference in Florida where he said he hoped Moscow could locate emails associated with his rival Hillary Clinton: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," he said. "I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."
The report on Russian interference in the 2016 election issued by special counsel Robert Mueller noted that "within approximately five hours of Trump's statement, [Russian military intelligence] officers targeted for the first time Clinton's personal office," including 15 email accounts at a specific domain, one of which belonged to a Clinton aide.
As noted by The New York Times, the events of that day in the summer of 2016 were part of an indictment against a dozen Russians charged with hacking by the Justice Department.
In written responses provided by Trump during the Mueller investigation, the president said he made the "Russia, if you're listening …" remark "in jest and sarcastically, as was apparent to any objective observer."
– Martina Stewart
Cruz: Obama administration sent 'blankets and MREs' to Ukraine
During a break in the trial Wednesday night, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the Obama administration "sent blankets and MRE's" to Ukraine, "but they wouldn't give lethal aid."
"I traveled to Ukraine in 2014, came back and urged Barack Obama to give lethal military aid to Ukraine. The Obama administration refused to do so," Cruz said. "Instead, they sent blankets and MRE's."
Cruz's remarks echo others by fellow Republicans. Trump said Obama provided Ukraine with "pillows and sheets." In 2015, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said, "The Ukrainians are being slaughtered, and we're sending them blankets and meals. Blankets don't do well against Russian tanks."
The Obama administration provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, according to CNN and PolitiFact.com.
Cruz is correct that lethal military aid began to be provided to Ukraine only during Trump's tenure. "The first lethal deliveries came from Trump," Jim Townsend, deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO Policy during the Obama administration, told PolitiFact.
– Martina Stewart and Savannah Behrmann
Were Republicans, Trump allowed to participate in the House inquiry?
In a wide-ranging pair of speeches on the Senate floor Tuesday, Jay Sekulow, a private lawyer for Trump, and White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused Democrats of seeking to remove Trump since he was elected.
Sekulow said Schiff committed a "trifecta" of improprieties by denying Trump access to evidence, counsel at hearings and the right to cross-examine witnesses during the House inquiry.
"That's a trifecta, a trifecta that violates the Constitution of the United States," Sekulow said.
House Democrats on three committees held closed-door depositions, but Republicans were allowed to attend and ask questions. The Judiciary Committee invited Trump's lawyers to participate in hearings by questioning witnesses, but the White House declined to participate in what Cipollone called a "baseless and highly partisan" inquiry.
– Bart Jansen
What the Mueller report found on obstruction of justice
Sekulow said Tuesday that "there was no obstruction," referring to the special counsel's report on Russian interference. The report detailed 11 episodes of conduct by Trump that might have constituted obstruction, but Mueller refused to make a firm conclusion on the issue.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump:
"I'm pleased to announce the United States will join One Trillion Trees Initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. We will continue to show strong leadership in restoring, growing and better managing our trees and our forests. This is not a time for pessimism; this is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action. Alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives."
Greta Thunberg:
"We are not telling you to 'offset your emissions' by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate. Planting trees is good, of course, but it's nowhere near enough of what is needed, and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature."
Tom Rogan,
Washington Examiner:
"Why are we acting as though Thunberg's words have the same import as those spoken by President Trump? We saw that on Tuesday when Trump and Thunberg separately addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Thunberg is not the prime minister of her native Sweden. Trump is the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. Each of his statements offers insight into policies that have profound relevance for the global economy, international security and any other issue Trump is addressing. Thunberg is just a 17-year-old with a large soapbox. So yes, praise Thunberg's commitment to her cause. But let's stop pretending these two voices are equally relevant."
Kara Swisher,
The New York Times:
"Reports outline a multitrillion dollar opportunity in renewables, software and artificial intelligence to help us understand climate data, the food production ecosystem and even the way we construct our buildings. The United States and Europe lag in investment and innovation far behind China, which has a staggering lead in solar photovoltaic module production and also a big head start in other renewable technologies, including hydropower and lithium-ion batteries. (Lithium referred to as the 'white petroleum.') Those who jump into this climate space will make the next great fortunes in tech. More like 'profits of boom.' And if it takes Trump's unruly ranting to get our greatest minds focused on stopping our environmental suicide, so be it."

Texto completo: More than 150 years after the 14th Amendment guaranteed all people “equal protection of the laws” and 56 years after the Civil Rights Act banned racial discrimination, we must confront the reality that the median black family in the United States is still almost 10 times poorer than the median white family. This isn’t a white problem or a black problem. It’s an American problem.
I’m reminded of a line from Martin Luther King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail: “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. ”
This racial wealth gap tears at the fabric of our society. We need a real leader in the White House who will unite the country and bring us all together to close this gap so every family in America has the opportunity to thrive.
The pernicious legacy of slavery and Jim Crow disadvantages the African American community in many ways — from education to employment to housing to the criminal justice system. Let’s look at the data:
The average black student attends a school at the 37th percentile for test score results, while the average white student attends a school in the 60th percentile.
The unemployment rate for black Americans is nearly twice as high as for white Americans, and the average black worker earns about 28% less than the average white worker.
Only 43% of black Americans own their homes, compared with 73% of white Americans.
And the imprisonment rate for black men is almost six times that of white men in the United States.
Alarming racial disparities
All these factors contribute to the racial wealth gap in our country that gets passed down from one generation to another, making it harder and harder for African Americans to get ahead. Upward mobility is much less likely for black than white Americans. Of black Americans born into the lowest fifth of the earnings distribution, 51% remain there at age 40, compared with only 23% of white Americans.
These disparities in opportunity for African Americans are alarming, and interconnected. It makes no sense to me to tackle an issue like educational inequality in isolation. That’s why I founded the Harlem Children’s Zone. I’ve always believed that the success of our children and the strength of our communities go hand in hand. To break the cycle of generational poverty and give our kids a real shot at the American dream, we have taken on not just some but all of the issues children and families in Harlem face — crumbling apartments, failing schools and gun violence, to name a few.
Slavery legacy: How to shrink the wealth gap for minorities and everyone else while we study reparations
There are distressed neighborhoods like Harlem in every corner of our country. We need innovative and comprehensive solutions nationwide to address the generational poverty that prevents too many of our young people from reaching their full potential.
President Donald Trump said last year that the opportunity-zone provision in the Republicans’ 2017 tax-cut legislation provided “massive new incentives for investment and job creation in distressed communities. ” But, as The New York Times has reported, these “opportunity zones” are primarily benefiting Trump’s family members, friends and other wealthy Americans. Instead of building affordable housing in distressed neighborhoods or grocery stores in food deserts, developers are building luxury apartments and hotels.
On Sunday, my friend and Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg unveiled his plan to significantly reduce the racial wealth gap for black Americans. Rather than giving tax breaks to his family and friends, he will invest $70 billion in the neighborhoods that need it most. This national initiative will lift up 100 of the country’s most disadvantaged communities.
Similar to our approach in Harlem, Bloomberg’s policy will address disparities in early childhood development, education, employment, and health and environmental conditions. And, like me, Bloomberg is a big believer in innovation and data. He’s willing to try new things and isn’t afraid to fail, and he will focus on evaluation to expand the programs that work.
Bloomberg will reduce wealth gap
Bloomberg also has proposed steps to create 1 million new African American homeowners and start 100,000 new black-owned businesses.
In addition, Bloomberg will reinvigorate and reorient the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, requiring companies to report on hiring, pay and procurement data, and collecting lending data. Earlier this month, Bloomberg laid out his plan to protect and restore voting rights by addressing practices such as ID requirements, roll purging and gerrymandering.
I’ve known Mike Bloomberg for many years, and I know he will bring our country together to start closing the racial wealth gap in America. Again, let’s look at the data:
During Bloomberg’s time as New York City’s mayor, graduation rates for African American students rose and the black-white achievement gap shrank.
He launched an ambitious plan to expand affordable housing.
And he reduced the number of black New Yorkers in prison by reforming policies that disproportionately impact young men of color.
Housing emergency: Only the federal government can fix the affordable housing crisis. Where's the pressure?
Bloomberg also created the Young Men’s Initiative, the first municipal plan to focus on the persistent disparities experienced by young men of color in education, employment, health and crime. President Barack Obama later launched My Brother’s Keeper, with similar aims and branches in 250 cities.
I don’t want to look back four years from now to see that the racial wealth gap has stayed the same, or even worse, grown bigger. This year, we have the chance to elect a president who understands we are all tied in a single garment of destiny — and who will take bold action to end discrimination against African Americans and increase opportunity for every American. I’ll be casting my ballot for Mike Bloomberg to get it done.

Texto completo: Annabella Sciorra choked up Thursday telling a jury how Harvey Weinstein raped her: 'I was punching him, I was kicking him, I was trying to get him away from me.'
The "Sopranos" actress was the first accuser to take the stand in the Weinstein trial. The former Hollywood giant is charged with five sex crimes, including rape and sexual assault, from encounters with two women, one in 2013, one in 2006. He denies the accusations and says the encounters were consensual.
Sciorra's allegation is not included in the charges because it's too old to prosecute under the statute of limitations. Prosecutors had her testify to bolster the "predatory" charges against Weinstein.
More than 80 women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct or crimes since The New York Times and The New Yorker reported on accusations against him in October 2017.
The trial takes place in a Manhattan courtroom that holds about 100. Journalists start lining up outside at 4 a.m. to get one of 70 reserved seats. The public gets the other 30.
USA TODAY's Patrick Ryan waits in that line. He knows the importance of this story.
"Weinstein was the tipping point of the Me Too movement," Ryan says. "It opened the floodgates for so many other victims to come forward."
So many accusations. So many denials. And a few apologies.
Hollywood. Media. Tech. Athletics. Military academies. Hospitality industry. Universities. Community organizations.
One by one – tearfully, fearlessly or angrily – women (and men) shared their stories.
The country was listening.
The Harvey Weinstein story is about so much more than Harvey Weinstein.
USA TODAY investigative reporter Marisa Kwiatkowski was a lead reporter on the Indianapolis Star story that revealed the abuse by USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.
These cases are, in part, about power, she says. "Nassar was a prominent sports physician. Some survivors felt that they wouldn't be believed because of his reputation. Some adults did discount allegations because of who he was."
By the time he was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in jail for criminal sexual conduct, more than 150 women had shared their stories of abuse.
Such cases are also often about negligence.
"You see this with Boy Scouts, who hundreds of accusers say have not made meaningful steps in resolving the crisis they're facing and are now looking at potential financial restructuring, including bankruptcy," investigative reporter Cara Kelly says. "You see it with Uber and Lyft, who are accused, and our reporting has backed, of putting public perception above their riders."
Perhaps most of all, these cases are about deep breaths, brave conversations – and accountability.
In the first year after actress Alyssa Milano asked women who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to post "Me Too" on Twitter, according to Pew Research Center, the #MeToo hashtag was used more than 19 million times. (Activist Tarana Burke started the phrase and movement in 2006.)
"The Weinstein victims broke the dam of silence – and have made everyone from 21-year-old women assaulted by their Lyft drivers to 70-year-old men abused by their Scoutmasters feel empowered to speak," Kelly says.
Sexual abuse is horrific for the violation itself – and the shame it leaves behind. Shame thrives in secrecy. It paralyzes.
When victims talk about their experiences, the grip lessens.
And, as a good friend says, courage is contagious.
"I've talked to so many grown men who were sharing their stories for the first time," Kelly says. "They were so deeply ashamed, they couldn't have dreamed of telling anyone when it happened. And now they're crying with a reporter they've never met, explaining the pain and trauma it caused.
"This never would have happened before Weinstein or #metoo went viral. And neither would the accountability."
And that is why Ryan will line up with other reporters outside that courtroom each morning. The Harvey Weinstein story is an important one to cover. And it is about far more than Harvey Weinstein.
The NCAA will review policies on sexual misconduct after USA TODAY Network investigation.
Our investigation found that although college athletes can be punished for grades, drugs and accepting free meals or money, the NCAA Division I handbook has no punishments for sexual, violent or criminal misconduct. Athletes can even be suspended from one school for rape but transfer to another and continue playing.
In January 2019, investigative reporter Kenny Jacoby got a tip that a University of Oregon professor had documents detailing how the U.S. Education Department helped scrub the record of a former Duck football player expelled for raping two female students.
That athlete transferred from Oregon to a junior college, then to an NCAA Division I school in Texas, where he remains an NFL prospect. After convincing the professor to share the documents, Jacoby began to dig deeper into the NCAA's lack of transfer regulations for dangerous athletes.
This review by the NCAA comes amid pressure from members of Congress. Days after the USA TODAY Network investigation, they filed a bill to conduct an independent study of the NCAA's lack of accountability for such athletes.
"This is huge," says investigations managing editor Emily Le Coz. "The NCAA refused to answer our questions. They did not participate in the yearlong investigation. It was a complete stonewalling.
"The NCAA now realizes this is a problem bigger than themselves. And if they don't fix it, someone else will."

Ready to rock the boat Leslie Jones on the move in the comedy world after 'SNL' exit

Texto completo: NEW YORK - When Louis C.K. returned to the Comedy Cellar nine months after confessing to sexual misconduct, many criticized the club in tweets and articles, and a few protested and walked out of shows. But the only star comic to stop performing there was Leslie Jones.
She started spending more time at the Comic Strip on the Upper East Side near her home. "They took his picture down," Jones said of that club, adding, "Mine's up."
Jones, who has talked to the Comedy Cellar's management about her disappointment but has returned to the club after a long stint away, said it was a personal decision.
"I knew girls," she said, pausing and holding a stare, "and they got to walk into the club and see him talking to the owner. That ain't cool."
Using a metaphor she returned to a couple of times in our interview, Jones said she no longer cared about rocking the boat: "I am at the age when I will get off the boat and get on another damn boat."
Last year, she exited the biggest yacht in comedy, "Saturday Night Live," and when asked why, Jones paused, uncharacteristically cautious: "I'm 52 and tired. 'SNL' is a hard job. It's 100 hours a week," she said. "Also, it's an institution. I get bored. And I want to do different things."
So she is, with movie and television projects in the works this year (the "Coming to America" sequel and a reboot of "Supermarket Sweep," which she will host), along with a just-released Netflix special, "Time Machine," directed by the showrunners of "Game of Thrones," David Benioff and D.B. Weiss.
Onstage and off, Jones is not short on swagger.
"I want to be the next Johnny Carson," she said. "I want 'The Tonight Show' really bad."
But what about Jimmy Fallon?
"I love Jimmy, but Jimmy is going to leave in a minute," she said. "And who are they going to possibly fill that spot with?"
After clarifying "except Seth Meyers," she answered her question with a roar: "ME!" She then flashed a stern face that pushed defiance into a deliriously funny kind of self-parody.
Jones thinks a lot about funny faces. She has studied the greats - Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball, whom she said had "the best faces in the game" - and developed her own go-to expressions from hours of testing in front of a mirror. There's the withering glare that writers on "SNL" would write into scripts as "the Leslie Look." It was inspired by the exasperation of her late brother, while a photo of her father in Vietnam is the model for her most unhinged expression, eyes popped out, one more than the other, a glance she uses to intimidate audiences and tame hecklers.
When Jones kills at clubs - and she can lay waste to an audience in a way that few others today can match - it can seem like a force of nature, the work of raw charisma and a tornado of energy. But make no mistake: She's a veteran student of her craft, honing her act since 1987 when she started telling jokes onstage as a Colorado college student in a contest before moving back to Los Angeles. However, she describes her new hour as a reintroduction. Since rocketing to fame on network television, she has an entirely new audience, one that's far whiter than the crowds she played to early in her career.
When asked about the difference, Jones said white audiences are "so much easier," before cackling and assuring me she loves the high standards of her black fans.
"You know how they say if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere?" she said. "If you can make it with a black audience, you can make it with anyone."
In the last few years, Jones' comedy has also evolved, thanks to a collaboration with comic Lenny Marcus, a bespectacled Jewish tactician of stand-up who opens for her and gives notes on jokes.
Jones, 6 feet tall with a booming voice, has always been a ferocious and freewheeling performer, but Marcus persuaded her to make a set list for the first time, to stick to the same jokes at every show as opposed to improvising new lines, and also to be more strategic with crowd work.
"She is also so quick and even when just talking, she's captivating," Marcus said by phone.
The funniest moments in a Jones performance are not really the move from setup to punchline but the radically extreme pivots between emotions. No comic alive travels a greater distance between confidence and vulnerability. In her most ambitious bit in the new special, she dramatizes texting a boyfriend, veering from angry dismissals to heartbreak and desperation in mere moments. "It's not easy to date Leslie Jones," she said, a line written by Marcus.
Being lonely in love has been a common theme of her comedy since the start of her career. Her first reliable joke involved telling women who can't find a man to visit the produce section of the supermarket, before whipping out a cucumber and later taking a bite out of it. "Do you know how many rotten cucumbers were in my car?" she said, laughing at that early prop work.
As a famous black woman in comedy, Jones has taken more abuse than most. After the sexist controversy over an all-female "Ghostbusters," which she starred in, Jones became the target of trolls. Her phone was hacked, and nude photos were spread across the internet.
Jones quickly turned this incident into comedy on "SNL," but she said that the intensity of the backlash got to her, briefly. It didn't make her stop sending nude photos. "I remember the person I sent it to was like, 'You ain't learned yet? You learned nothing,' " she said, letting out a booming guffaw.
And when the trailer for another "Ghostbusters" was recently released, she saw it as vindication for the worst critics. "It pissed me off," she said. "It feels like, 'They did it wrong, and we know you guys were upset about that little girls' "Ghostbusters," so we're going to do it right now.' "
She added that her movie was hurt by studio interference and an edit that took out 20 minutes of strong material, and she wished she had spoken up in protest.
"If I was the Leslie I am now, I think it would have went different," she said, shifting her face into not exactly the Leslie Look but something adjacent. "Big franchise, don't rock the boat," she said. "I wish I would have rocked the boat."

Texto completo: Patton Oswalt has built a multifaceted career as a stand-up comedian, TV and film actor and best-selling author.
He's best known for playing Spence Olchin on "The King of Queens." He has also appeared in or voiced characters for "Ratatouille," "Two and a Half Men," "Veep" and "Veronica Mars." He won a Critics' Choice Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series for the role of Garth Blundin on "Parks and Recreation."
He wrote two New York Times best-sellers, "Zombie Spaceship Wasteland" and "Silver Screen Fiend."
Oswalt has done six stand-up comedy specials and released eight albums. He won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and a Grammy for Best Comedy Album for the Netflix special "Patton Oswalt: Talking for Clapping."
And he's a regular contributor to "Countdown with Keith Olbermann," "Real Time with Bill Maher" and "Lewis Black's Root of All Evil."
Oswalt will perform his stand-up show at the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix on Jan. 25.
His stories are personal In his comedy, he often talks about topics personal to him, including his weight, quirks and love of sci-fi and comic books. He also discusses his family members, including his wife, daughter and parents.
He said his family members don't mind him talking about them because he doesn't represent them in a negative way.
"It clearly comes from love, so they're not upset about it," Oswalt said.
He has always been upfront about his political views and often delves into relevant social and political topics in his shows. He doesn't try to focus on politics, but he won't avoid talking about it.
"It's not like I'm looking to talk about politics, but sometimes you can't not talk about it. If I walk onstage and it looks like we're going to war, how do you not mention it? You look like you're insane if you don't acknowledge it," Oswalt said.
He tries to draw from his everyday experiences and observations in a way that others can relate to.
"What's always inspired me is everyday life and how I can connect it to something bigger and more universal, be it something really trivial, something pop cultural or something that feels trivial and personal but actually illuminates something about humanity," Oswalt said.
Strange moments in his life also inspire his stand-up routines. One of his stories revolves around a weird clown at a birthday party his family attended.
"Stuff like that obviously doesn't happen a lot, but when it does, you try to be as aware of it as you possibly can and then try to see if you can make a bit out of it," Oswalt says.
Getting comfortable on stage was a process It took time and practice to develop his ability to draw audiences in with his stories.
"It takes a while to get the confidence and stage presence to do that kind of thing. It just takes being comfortable onstage. ... It took five or six years for me to be comfortable with myself onstage, to be the same person I am offstage as on, not put on a persona and be that real," Oswalt said.
Each role he has played in TV and film has challenged him as a performer. Some roles, such as the mad-scientist sidekick TV Son of TV's Frank on "Mystery Science Theater 3000," have special meaning to him because of his lifelong love of science fiction.
"I grew up on that show in the early '90s, as I was starting comedy. I've always been a big Joel Hodgson fan ever since he was on 'SNL' in the '80s. To get to work with him up close, see how his mind works and watch how the writers riffed on movies was pretty fascinating to me," Oswalt said.
He will play the lead character in "MODOK," a Hulu streaming series coming this summer. It's based on a Marvel supervillain with an oversize head who has a knack for developing advanced weapons.
Oswalt doesn't have a predilection toward heroes or villains. He's interested in characters who are three-dimensional.
"I just prefer to play whatever is interesting, be it hero, villain or sidekick. It just depends on the project and depends on the script," Oswalt said.
He said his acting career has helped him in his stand-up.
"It gives you more exposure to help you to do more stand-up, and it also lets you flex different muscles that you find yourself using onstage when you are maybe acting out bits or doing a more complex joke," Oswalt said.
'I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me' From the time he was in high school, Oswalt had a natural gift for comedy. He hung out with other class clowns and watched comedians such as Steve Martin and Richard Pryor. Later, the comics he worked with influenced him.
"I was very lucky that I was surrounded by people that were funnier than me, because it made me work harder at what I did," Oswalt says.
Originally from Virginia, Oswalt started out in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s and went on to perform in San Francisco and Los Angeles. He said that all three scenes shaped him as a comedian.
"You're always influenced by the people that are around you and the people that you are working with. Dave Chappelle and I started on the same night, at the same club. People like Blaine Capatch. You're always influenced by the area that you are in," Oswalt said.
He says building a career like his requires putting in the work over many years.
"It takes constantly working on your craft and going onstage over and over again so that you get comfortable enough to keep doing newer and more challenging projects," Oswalt says.

Texto completo: For something that everyone agrees doesn't matter much, the New York Times' endorsement of two candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination sure generated a big buzz.
Political analysts, serious journalists and activists on both sides of the partisan divide offered expert insights on what impact the Times' editorial endorsement of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar might have on the Iowa caucuses next month. There were wide-ranging opinions about not only the merits of the two candidates, but whether it was a cop-out for such a prestigious journal as the Times not to make one choice.
How they did it was really interesting. The editors released video of their roundtable discussions and recaps of what candidates said in interviews with the board. Members of the editorial board went on TV talk shows to discuss how they arrived at their split decision.
The written editorial was long and ponderous, explaining why the Times didn't pick any of the men running and exploring pros and cons of the Warren and Klobuchar candidacies.
Basically, it came down to recognizing that the Democratic Party has moved substantially to the left, and deciding how far the editors wanted to follow that movement. That left Warren, the more liberal of plausible contenders, and Klobuchar, a more moderate candidate with appeal in those Midwest states that tipped the balance to President Trump three years ago.
"Both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration," the editorial said. "If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it. That's why we're endorsing the most effective advocates for each approach."
Wow, that's a straddle to give Hamlet a headache. Traditional new ideas. Moderate radicalism. John Kennedy's New Frontier and Warren Harding's "return to normalcy."
Coverage of the Times endorsement competed for attention with events of Martin Luther King Jr. Day observances, the Second Amendment rally at the Virginia statehouse and — oh, yeah — trial preparations for an impeachment of the president. And one little detail mentioned again and again was that newspaper endorsements don't matter much any more.
If they ever did.
That comes as no surprise to those of us working in newsrooms. For years, we've heard readers complain about endorsements — either their candidate didn't get chosen, or they think an editorial pick shows bias in news coverage, or they just don't like being told how to vote.
Well, newspapers — not even the haughty Times — aren't telling you how to vote. They're expressing their own opinions.
A lot of people say they use newspaper endorsements as a guide for who will not get their votes. Well, that's their editorial opinion. The First Amendment is for you, too.
You may not believe it, but political endorsements don't influence news coverage. Reporters and editorial writers (and columnists) have separate and distinct duties.
Former Tallahassee Democrat publisher Skip Foster ended candidate endorsements several years ago.
Foster said it's better for a news organization to discuss issues and events, not people.

Texto completo: The Mars Area school board voted Tuesday to hire a search firm to find its next superintendent.
Board members voted 5-3 to hire Templeton Advantage LLC, at a cost not to exceed $16,900, to conduct the search to replace current Superintendent Wesley Shipley. The board had voted the previous week to notify Mr. Shipley that his contract would not be renewed when it expires June 30.
Templeton Advantage is run by a retired educator, Tom Templeton, who was a longtime deputy chief of the Pennsylvania School Boards Association.
Board members Rita Dorsch, J. Dayle Ferguson, Gordon Marburger, Sallie Wick and President John Kennedy voted for Templeton Advantage.
Christine Valenta and Kevin Hagen opposed the motion. Both expressed a preference for McPherson&Jacobson LLC, of Omaha, Neb., which is currently handling the superintendent search for Fox Chapel Area.
"I like the structure laid out by Jacobson," Mrs. Valenta said. "They have functionalities that we did not have the last two times we went through this process."
But Mrs. Dorsch said McPherson&Jacobson is "further away from the source than I would like them to be."
Mrs. Wick noted that McPherson&Jacobson had not placed anybody in Pennsylvania in the past five years. "That is a concern to me. Why haven't other districts used them?"
Templeton Advantage, on the other hand, found superintendents for Butler Area, Hampton, Avonworth and other districts in Western Pennsylvania. "He is someone who is used to Pennsylvania and knows Pennsylvania school districts," Mrs. Wick said.
Solicitor Tom King, who sought proposals from several individuals and firms that do superintendent searches, said a national firm is not necessary for a national search.
"You can ask them to advertise on the national school board site," he said. "You can ask them to advertise in The New York Times if you want."
In other business, the board tabled adoption of the 2020-21 calendar because it had not been released early enough to get public input. The proposed calendar starts school for students on Aug. 26 and ends school on June 2, 2021.
There is one snow makeup day on April 1, but any additional snow days, up to five, will be flexible instruction days, where students work from home on their district-issued devices.

James McCarthy, Harvard oceanographer, climate expert

Texto completo: Based partly on the observations of Harvard University oceanographer James J. McCarthy, the first paragraph of an August 2000 New York Times story was brief and blunt: “The North Pole is melting."
He was a lecturer on a natural history tour of the Arctic that summer and was surprised by what he saw — and more importantly, what he didn't see — when the ship reached the North Pole. The typical thick, multiyear ice was absent.
“What was really unusual was that over a period of two weeks we never had a day of what would be considered normal ice," he told the Times. “When we reached the pole and found open water, that simply punctuated what we were seeing everywhere. These were conditions that did not seem representative of a transient phenomenon."
An award-winning scientist whose observations about the pace and intensity of climate change inspired and informed students, colleagues, and politicians, Dr. McCarthy died Dec. 11 of pulmonary fibrosis. He was 75 and lived in Arlington.
“Dr. James McCarthy was an amazing man, a loyal friend, world-class oceanographer, a passionate advocate for science and for our climate balance," former vice president Al Gore wrote for a Harvard University Center for the Environment tribute webpage.
“Nobody communicated the importance of the climate crisis in the context of the oceans as eloquently and passionately as Jim," added Gore, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work focusing attention on climate change.
The Alexander Agassiz professor of biological oceanography and director emeritus of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Dr. McCarthy was awarded the 2018 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, whose presenters hailed him for having “fostered and led cooperative efforts among scientific disciplines to forge new, global-scale perspectives on environmental change."
In 2008, he received the Walker Prize from the Museum of Science in Boston, which honors “meritorious published scientific investigation and discovery."
Dr. McCarthy also had led a working group and was lead author on an assessment report for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Gore.
“Jim's own research on biological oceanography probed the nitrogen cycle in the oceans, seeking to understand how the ecology of plankton affected and was affected by nutrient cycling," Dan Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, wrote for the center's tribute page.
“But Jim's impact went far beyond his own research," Schrag added. “Jim promoted the best in all of us through his numerous leadership positions inside and outside of Harvard and also through his extraordinary devotion to students."
Dr. McCarthy formerly chaired the board of the Union of Concerned Scientists. On its website, the organization's current president, Ken Kimmell, called him “a passionate advocate for the essential role science plays in our democracy."
Though Dr. McCarthy witnessed the impact of climate change firsthand and was a leading voice insisting that the warnings of scientists be heeded, he remained hopeful — partly because of what he saw each day on Harvard's campus.
“This is the generation that will make a difference. I know college students. I live with 400 of them," he told the Globe in 2008.
“I'm inspired by them," he added. “I'm very optimistic."
Dr. McCarthy and his wife, Sue,were deans of Pforzheimer House at Harvard from 1996 to 2009.
“He always was a joyous person," she said. “He always was an optimist."
In the 2008 Globe interview, Dr. McCarthy said he believed humanity had “turned a corner. People are feeling the urgency, and our politicians are following the people."
And speaking at the event Harvard Thinks Green in December 2011, Dr. McCarthy reminded the audience that even incremental steps are important.
“Small changes, that often have no impact on our lifestyles, add up to significant change," he said.
James Joseph McCarthy was born on Jan. 25, 1944, and grew up in Sweet Home, Ore.
He was the second of four children whose parents were Dr. James McCarthy, a chiropractor, and Errilla Gearhart, an elementary schoolteacher.
In an interview last year with Steve Curwood for the Public Radio International program “Living on Earth," Dr. McCarthy recalled “a very formative moment" in childhood when he and his father were exploring a pond at the edge of the community. They collected water in a test tube and examined it under a microscope.
“I knew there were fish in those ponds and I knew there were bugs, but I had no idea what was living there in the microscopic realm," he told Curwood.
That experience helped form Dr. McCarthy's aspiration to pursue science and to be “inclined toward something that would have me involved in field work, rather than totally lab-based."
He graduated from Gonzaga University with a bachelor's degree in biology and received a doctorate in biological oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California.
At Scripps he met Mary Suzanne Tilsworth, whom he married in 1969.
“Jim was many things, but I think one of the driving forces in his life is that he was enormously curious about the world that he lived in and the people. There was so much to learn and know," she said.
“He also was an incredibly kind and compassionate person in the best possible way," she added. “He let people be themselves, but he was always encouraging them."
Away from work, Dr. McCarthy was drawn to the precise discipline of fly-fishing. He also made furniture and engaged in woodworking throughout his life.
He was a research scientist at Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at Harvard in 1974.
At Harvard, he helped found and had served as head tutor for the environmental science and public policy concentration.
“His commitment to students and to making the world a better place inspired me, and I am sure many others, to do more and to care more," Missy Holbrook, a Harvard professor who is now the concentration's head tutor, wrote for the university's tribute page.
For “Living on Earth," Dr. McCarthy said he believed the importance of climate change had become an integral part of the lives of those in the next generation.
“What more than anything else gives me hope is seeing the young people today, the college-age population who are learning about this subject," he said, adding that “wherever they go, whether they go into business and into the public sector, any position in any career, they're carrying with them an understanding."
In addition to his wife, Sue, Dr. McCarthy leaves their two sons, Jamie of Houston and Ryan of Brooklyn, N.Y.; a brother, Richard of Cottage Grove, Ore.; and two granddaughters.
A memorial service will be held at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Memorial Church in Harvard Yard.
Though optimistic, Dr. McCarthy stressed that addressing climate change is a task that can't be ignored.
“If you lose a day working on this problem now, it's not like you can work an extra day later and catch up," he told Curwood.
“The carbon dioxide we're putting in the atmosphere now, a portion of that will be in the atmosphere hundreds of thousands of years from now," he added. “So everything you can do to slow it today makes tomorrow easier."

In Iowa, a small voice has big clout

Texto completo: STORM LAKE, Iowa — Art Cullen has just finished his latest editorial, haranguing the governor this week for not spending more on natural resources. Soon Cullen will need to start laying out the pages before Thursday's print deadline, but for a moment, he takes a break.
Cullen, with his mop of white hair and matching handlebar mustache, is the editor of the Storm Lake Times, a family-run newspaper that for 30 years has been a progressive voice in this community of 10,000 in conservative northwest Iowa. Nearly a third of its residents subscribe to the print edition, which lands in their mailboxes twice a week.
Coastal elites bickered this week over whether The New York Times' double presidential endorsement of Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren was a cop-out. But just as they sought that coveted nod in a glassy Manhattan conference room, the Democratic contenders have also sought the endorsement of Cullen's paper, journeying to its own conference room, where the chairs are worn and the side table is equipped with coffee but also Milk-Bones for Peach, the newsroom dog.
“I don't know what endorsements mean," Cullen lamented Wednesday. But as he kept talking he answered his own question.
“We do them because I think we have a special window and especially so this year," he said of the intense Democratic race to find the best candidate to unseat President Trump. “We are able to meet these people and Joe the plumber is not. So I think it does have value to do an endorsement. And in our case, we have a point of view, so how could you not apply that point of view to the presidential candidates? I just couldn't sit there and bite my tongue."
In a year where the field is so large, so much seems at stake, and so many people are still undecided, endorsements like this one from local journalists who understand Iowa seem particularly important.
“Having those nuanced explanations in your local paper of why you should support this candidate could be particularly impactful this time around," said Pat Rynard, managing editor of Iowa Starting Line, a news outlet devoted to state politics he founded in 2015. “I'd certainly say that they are more helpful than the national ones for caucus-goers' minds."
Cullen, 62, has been a Storm Lake fixture for decades, and Iowa politicians have long been wary of his calls, but the rest of the world only took notice in 2017, when he won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials that challenged powerful corporate agricultural interests in the state.
“All of a sudden, rather than being an anonymous weekly newspaper editor . . . I was the sage of progressive Iowa," he said with an explosive laugh. He wrote a book and now pens columns for The Guardian.
So this year, Cullen has used his fame to nail down nearly every presidential candidate on how he or she would address the intersection of agriculture and climate change. The policy discussions are complex, but Cullen is an expert because sustainable agriculture has been his campaign for decades, long before anyone outside Iowa paid attention.
And he has been successful — he got all the Democratic candidates to agree on sweeping reforms for “regenerative agriculture" that would mean more sustainable farming practices, he said. In December, after he personally interviewed 15 candidates, the paper endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren.
“It's all I've been doing all year is trying to buttonhole these candidates, in a nice way, in a sort of a hick sort of way, throwing no sharp elbows, that's not my place, I'm just here to root for the home team," Cullen said.
Storm Lake feels a world away from the East Coast media outlets that now seem to drive coverage of presidential contests, parachuting every four years into the country's heartland. To get here from Des Moines, you have to zigzag nearly three hours on the long, straight highways that form a grid across the state. This time of year, the snow-covered cornfields disappear into the white sky, the horizon barely visible only because of a few barns and silos.
The Storm Lake Times is a family operation. Cullen's brother John is the publisher. His wife, Dolores, takes photographs and writes features. His son, Tom, is the reporter, authoring most of the stories on its website and in the paper, which has two sections and 16 pages.
Just below the box where the editorials run in each edition , the paper prints the text of the First Amendment and John 8:32 from the Bible: “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
Cullen's newsroom is a blue warehouse around the corner from Storm Lake's main street, where several blocks of shops and restaurants draw a steady stream of customers. Gridded streets of tidy homes stretch down toward the lake that gave the city its name, where fog makes it hard to tell if the water is frozen.
Cullen's desk is at the back of the newsroom and his computer is surrounded by yellowing newspapers and a coffee cup. He is a crusader for the importance of local journalism. That comes with the hallmark self-deprecation and cynicism.
“All my bragging goes by way of saying that even a little voice can make a big difference," he said. “I'm old fashioned enough to believe in an institutional point of view, and that institutions are important, and that a newspaper should have a voice of its own, and that implies editorials, and if you don't have that voice, then you're just the AP."
Warren earned the Storm Lake Times endorsement because of her stance on agriculture and conservation, her understanding of economic systems, and because Cullen believes that her other proposals, like universal health coverage, show that she understands the challenges of the area.
“I just look at it through the prism of rural America," he said. “The Boston Globe can look out for Boston. Somebody's got to look out for this fly-over country, and so while I have a voice I'm going to use it."
As for The New York Times, Cullen thinks it may have given Klobuchar a boost in Iowa, but if anything, he thinks her recent endorsement from the Quad Cities Times in eastern Iowa probably did more.
But Cullen, like most everyone else in this state, will tell you he has no idea who will win the caucuses in less than two weeks. The race is considered a toss-up between Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, former vice president Joe Biden, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
For the past 20 years, politics in Iowa has split geographically, with conservatives in western Iowa largely separate from more liberal voters in the eastern half of the state. Hillary Clinton didn't stop in Storm Lake in 2016, Cullen said, but the paper still endorsed her. Barack Obama came through twice when he was running for president, although Biden got the Storm Lake Times' nod in the 2008 race. Now Democrats are starting to realize that you must at least show up here, Cullen said.
Whether his endorsements have any real sway, Cullen claims not to know. But people in town will tell you they are paying attention.
“It was a big move," Linda Torres, who works at the Better Day Cafe downtown, said about Cullen's endorsement of Warren.
Storm Lake is “Steve King country," people say, referring to the ultraconservative US representative from this region who closely allies with Trump.
Torres, 22, is part of the new generation of residents in the city. She was born in the United States but her mother is from Mexico. Cullen has used his pages to trumpet the vitality that the city's new Latino residents has brought. Not everyone agrees.
“It gave us a lot of hope that OK, someone is out there, stepping up," Torres said about Cullen's endorsement. “I don't think he knows how much he means to us."
Cullen doesn't seem to spend much time thinking about sentiments like that. He is always working on the next editorial, needling the next politician. The flash of fame that came with the Pulitzer merely gave the rest of the world a brief glimpse into the battles that he and his staff have been waging in Iowa for decades.
The paper is one of few voices in rural Iowa for more conservation funding. On the wall in his conference room is a map of the lake that hugs the community and draws tourists to its water park in warmer months. After two decades of pushing, Cullen's paper finally succeeded in pressuring the state to spend $20 million to help conserve it, he said. He hopes his editorial Friday will persuade the governor to make a genuine effort for more conservation funding.
“We like to think that we've elevated the debate a little bit," he said, " but you don't want to start to believe your own press releases."

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday denounced immigration officials for denying Iranian students entry at Logan Airport and removing one student against a judge's orders this week. She said their actions were the direct result of President Trump's policies, which she would reverse immediately, if elected president.
“On the first day of my administration, I will lift the Muslim ban, and I believe that sends a message all across the country," Warren said during a video conference with The Boston Globe editorial board.
Mohammad Shahab Dehghani Hossein Abadi, a 24-year-old student, was detained by Customs and Border Protection after arriving at Logan Sunday. Though his lawyers filed an emergency petition and a judge ordered a 48-hour stay, he was flown out of the country before a hearing could take place.
Warren challenged the idea that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies are lacking federal oversight or operating without accountability in detaining Iranians.
“I think they have exactly as much oversight as the Trump administration wants them to have and they are doing exactly what the Trump administration wants them to do," Warren said.
At least three Iranian students have been barred from attending Boston-area schools since September, the Globe reported, and at least 11 students with valid visas have been turned away since August nationwide, according to The New York Times.
Trump's travel ban, which ignited protests at airports when he announced it three years ago, now restricts immigration from five majority-Muslim nations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as Venezuela and North Korea. The ban suspended visas to those countries but allowed for exceptions, like students.
But immigration lawyers told the Globe this week that they are seeing more cases of Iranian students being turned away at Logan. And they asserted that there is growing evidence of CBP ignoring district court orders.
If she is elected president, Warren said, she would reverse course and hold both agencies accountable.
“They are not entitled to break the law and I will make it clear as president where my priorities are," she said. “And my priorities are not in trying to hang out in neighborhoods and attack families and tear people apart. These are our neighbors and our friends, many of them, who have been terrified by this administration."
“I will make it clear – and I'm making it clear during my campaign – that when I am president, this will stop," Warren said.
Warren spoke with the editorial board, which is considering endorsements in the Democratic nomination for president.
The New York Times on Sunday endorsed both Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar in the Democratic race for president, calling Warren the most effective advocate of the “radical" approach and Klobuchar the “realist."
“I thought what a strange way to describe what I fight for," Warren responded when asked about it. She said she's focused her campaign on anti-corruption efforts and tightening up the influence of money.
“Asking your government to work for you — I just frankly don't think is radical," she said.
She acknowledged that she's proposing “big structural change" by introducing a wealth tax to invest in child care, public schools, and post-high-school education.

Texto completo: MASTER DRAWINGS NEW YORK AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS (Opening on Saturday) Painting and sculpture often overshadow drawing, or what Roberta Smith, the co-chief art critic of The New York Times, has called "the most intimate of art mediums." But this annual showcase on the Upper East Side, which takes place from Saturday to Feb. 1 at more than 20 locations clustered around Madison Avenue (as well as at Sotheby's and Christie's), spotlights works of paper and ink, charcoal or graphite. Among the highlights are Moeller Fine Art's "The Enchanted World of Lyonel Feininger," a collection of drawings and painted wooden pieces by that German-American artist, and the reunion of Guercino's recently rediscovered "Aurora" with its preparatory drawing (above) at Christopher Bishop Fine Art, where the pieces will remain on display until Feb. 15.

TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL; Bored senators find various coping mechanisms

Texto completo: No cellphones, no reading material, no talking. Not even coffee -- just uncomfortable chairs to sit in, water or milk to drink and the monologues of the House impeachment managers and President Trump's lawyers for eight or more hours per day.
These are the rules imposed on 100 senators as they proceed through what could be 10 or more long days of Senate jury duty. Lawmakers have been instructed by the Senate sergeant-at-arms to remain quiet "on pain of imprisonment" -- or, at the very least, the scourge of political backlash.
While weighing the heavy constitutional matter of whether the president should be removed from office in the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, senators also have to contend with the fragility of the human condition: How much pretrial coffee is too much? How does a senator accustomed to hitting 10,000 steps each day sit still for eight-plus hours straight? How did people combat boredom before cellphones?

Their coping mechanisms have varied.
Many senators, such as Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), are frequently taking notes to stay focused. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) had written more than 50 pages of notes as of Wednesday afternoon.
Senators such as Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) have taken to standing behind their chairs to stretch their backs. "It gets uncomfortable," Toomey said.
Sen. Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.) handed out fidget spinners to his fellow Republicans at a closed-door lunch before the trial resumed Thursday. He flicked a green plastic spinner on his hand while Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), one of the House impeachment managers, spoke about the conditions under which the Founding Fathers envisioned impeachment might be necessary.
Like Nadler, many politicians have been trying to channel the Founders' intentions in recent months - citing Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, for instance. But Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took it a step further: He brought an old-fashioned quill pen to the Senate floor, a gift to the sketch artists deployed by media companies to provide images from the chamber, where camera access is severely limited.
Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) admitted she was on the floor reading "Resistance (At All Costs)," a book detailing opposition to the president. "Busy mamas are the best at multitasking," she wrote on Twitter.
In a club where the average age is 63 -- and more than quarter of members are over 70 -- some senators were lulled to slumber. Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) was caught sleeping on Tuesday by a New York Times sketch artist who depicted the snooze. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) similarly examined the back of his eyelids on Wednesday.
Coffee and tea are out of the question. Senators can only drink water, sparkling water or milk while on the Senate floor, according to Senate practice (which for the stodgy old Senate may as well be written in stone). The limited beverages are served by Senate pages, high school students who study in Washington while working for the Senate. The full -- and thirsty -- Senate chamber meant those pages were furiously delivering drinks and the occasional note to senators this week.
Senators have largely stuck to water, but at least two -- Burr and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) -- were spotted with a glass of milk this week. The allowance for milk stems from the 1950s, when it was thought to be a good treatment for ulcers, according to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.).
The ban on coffee doesn't really faze him. The sludge in the Republican cloakroom is so bad "you'd wish it on a Democrat but no one else," he said, quickly adding "just joking."
Snacks and gum -- while technically banned -- have been heavily deployed. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) chewed gum with vigor in his first-row seat Thursday. In the back of the chamber, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) shared his supply with neighbor Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has a stash of Reese's in her desk.
But trial snacks don't come without risks.
"If this thing goes on, we're all going to gain like 10 pounds," said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis). "Another break? Gotta have another candy."
While the candy ban has been broken, senators have largely adhered to the cellphone prohibition.
It has served as a form of detox for lawmakers accustomed to frequently checking email and Twitter.
"It has been liberating," Leahy said. "I think it's great not to have the computer."
"It's kind of refreshing," said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). He's spending his time taking down questions he plans to ask the lawyers during 16 hours of question time expected next week.
He, like several other senators, have taken to slowly strolling around the back of the chamber. "I'm missing my workouts," he said.
The wooden, cushioned chairs, senators say, are old, square and uncomfortable. As the hours wear on each day, those walks by Kennedy and others have become more frequent. And senators have taken longer breaks -- going to the cloakroom for that cellphone check or a snack -- but for the most part, they have remained in the chamber.
One exception so far was Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who left the Capitol on Wednesday night an hour before the arguments ended because she was not feeling well , her spokesman said. She was back for the start of arguments Thursday but faced a backlash of Twitter outrage.
The Senate, an institution that tends to boast of its stodginess, never really entered the 21st century. Some of the desks are still the mid-19th century originals. Spittoons are stored underneath the desks of the top Republican and Democratic leaders (although there is no sign they've been used in decades).
Cellphones and other electronics have never been allowed on the Senate floor. Typically, that rule is flagrantly violated, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) have instituted a crackdown for the trial.
New cubbies -- just like in school -- were installed outside the chamber and in the cloakrooms to store iPhones -- or a real apple, if you're Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).
And in another throwback to middle school, senators and staff passed occasional notes. Most contained thoughts and musings that will probably be lost to Senate history. But a few have been revealed.
When Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) heard Nadler on Tuesday night accuse the Senate of engaging in a "cover-up," she fired off a note that made its way to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., asking whether the comment conformed to Senate rules. Shortly afterward, he condemned lawyers representing both the House and the president.
As Wednesday's arguments wore on, another piece of paper circulated urgently between a senior Republican staffer, a handful of senators and the president's lawyers.
Finally, the note landed on the desk of the Senate's presiding officer, in this case the chief justice, for a final ruling:
Is 6:30 p.m., the note asked in scrawling black Sharpie, the appropriate time to break for dinner?

CITY &amp; STATE; Glendale Unified may add Black Lives Matter Week; Board discusses holding observance in February to cultivate pride and self-worth.

Texto completo: Black Lives Matter, an activist movement created six years ago, could make its way into the Glendale Unified School District in an official capacity.
The Glendale Unified school board discussed last week a resolution that would formally observe Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action, which would be held from Feb. 3-7, in conjunction with Black History Month.
According to a draft of the resolution, the week would be meant "to cultivate in African American students a sense of pride, self-worth, and self-love; and to develop a widespread acknowledgment and appreciation for the contributions of African American people in our community."

The resolution also adds that workshops, cultural events and instructional activities will be offered in February.
The idea of bringing Black Lives Matter Week to the school district arose last year. During the final school board meeting of 2019, Glendale resident and parent Ingrid Gunnell urged formalizing such an effort.
"As I've heard from black parents and students from every geographical part of the district, from kindergarten to high school, I realize these kids are put into harm's way through subtle and more overt situations that arise at our school campuses on a nearly daily basis from both adults and children on campus," she said.
During the public-comment portions in the past two school board meetings, a number of speakers, including students and members of the community group Black in Glendale, voiced concerns about the treatment of black students in the district.
One student said a substitute teacher came into his class and told him to get off the plantation. He also said he was "bullied and harassed by Armenian kids" at Toll Middle School.
Another speaker said, "I'm a product of a predominantly white school system. I grew up in Southern California, in Burbank. And it's devastating to hear the stories of these young people here. Twenty years later, they are going through what I was going through."
A former Roosevelt Middle School student said she was called the N-word and faced harassment such as students pouring water in her hair. During her freshman year of high school, she said, she had anxiety and panic attacks that eventually led her to drop out.
Tanita Harris-Ligons co-founded Black in Glendale several years ago when her three sons expressed a lack of belonging in school. They told her stories about how their peers didn't want to sit next to them because they had dark skin. The group's purpose is to create a sense of community that promotes awareness and respect for black culture.
"I started Black in Glendale not to divide, but for my children and the other black children in the community to see other black faces and know they were supported -- to see other faces and know they were supported," said Harris-Ligons.
The school board's response to the speakers' testimony came in the form of the resolution on Jan. 14 that also includes a statement that Glendale Unified takes on a responsibility to understand and eliminate racism in its curriculum and classrooms.
"I'm glad to hear that this resolution is here and that it's not a phase. It's a commitment and also a lifelong promise," said Harris-Ligons at the Jan. 14 meeting.
Board members agreed that the resolution takes a step toward addressing perceived racial issues within the school district.
"These are teachable moments. We embrace this work knowing that these are difficult conversations, but they are teachable moments and we are not going to run away from challenges that we have in our school district but address them one at a time," said Glendale Unified Supt. Vivian Ekchian.
Shant Sahakian, board clerk, said he was pleased with the resolution, but it's really about the work that needs to be done 365 days a year.
According to board member Nayiri Nahabedian, Glendale Unified has slated dates for bias training for administrators, such as principals. Black in Glendale members provided the board with examples of materials that could be incorporated into the curriculum, including New York Times Magazine's 1619 project -- a 96-page magazine published in August 2019 examining the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.
"Glendale itself has a long history of deep racism, and ... that takes anti-bias training, it takes pausing, it takes curriculum to bring to light the racism, the biases both implicit and explicit, that we carry with us," Nahabedian said.
The resolution is expected to be brought back for possible action on Feb. 4.

Texto completo: The second season of "Shrill" debuts on Hulu. And a new Netflix series follows married monster hunters.
What's Streaming
SHRILL Stream on Hulu. Season 1 of this comedy series ended with its main character, Annie (Aidy Bryant), hurling a flower pot through a window of an internet troll's Cadillac S.U.V. She also quit her job. And she couldn't be happier. "I'm maybe the best I've ever been in my life," she declares at the beginning of the new, second season. Adapted from Lindy West's memoir of the same name, the series has been praised for its social commentary, and for Bryant's performance. "She radiates the wounded hopefulness of someone who's ready for the next chapter of her life," Margaret Lyons wrote in her review of Season 1 for The New York Times, "and by the end of the six-episode season, she's there." What that next chapter contains is something the second season will have to answer.
BEFORE SUNRISE (1995) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "I almost fell in love with him right there, but then Rick said cut." That's Julie Delpy speaking in a recent interview with The Times, talking about the experience of filming this indie romance, in which Delpy plays a French student who has a whirlwind romance in Vienna with a visiting American (Ethan Hawke). Directed by Richard Linklater, the film celebrates its 25th anniversary this month.
OCTOBER FACTION Stream on Netflix. Foul beasts and family drama coalesce in this violent fantasy series. Based on the comics by Steve Niles and Damien Worm, "October Faction" centers on a pair of married monster hunters (played by J.C. MacKenzie and Tamara Taylor) who have to keep their professional lives secret from their two teenage children (Gabriel Darku and Aurora Burghart). The first episode finds the family adjusting to a move to upstate New York. It includes humanoid villains that sprout fangs. Perhaps most frightening of all, it also includes a brief appearance by a Big Mouth Billy Bass singing plastic fish.
GHOST WORLD (2001) Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. For a very different book adaptation, see this Terry Zwigoff comedy, adapted from a graphic novel by Daniel Clowes. The film stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson as Enid and Rebecca, best friends and recent high-school graduates. They're both grungy, skeptical outcasts -- but Rebecca proves a bit more willing to engage with society. As the pair begins to drift apart, Enid develops a friendship with a middle-aged record collector (Steve Buscemi), whose disdain for most of the world rival's Enid's own.
What's on TV
CYMBELINE (2015) 11:35 p.m. on FXM. Shakespeare characters wear leather jackets and ride motorcycles in this contemporary take on a late Shakespeare play, "Cymbeline." Directed by Michael Almereyda, the movie casts Ed Harris in the title role, here reimagined as a drug kingpin (he's just the regular kind of king in the play). The ensemble also includes Milla Jovovich, Dakota Johnson, Penn Badgley, Anton Yelchin and Ethan Hawke, who's a long way from "Before Sunrise" here.

Texto completo: Ms. Williamson, a self-help author who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race this month, said she was not endorsing Mr. Yang per se, but wanted to help him get through the early primaries.
Marianne Williamson, the self-help author and spiritual adviser who exited the Democratic presidential race this month, said Thursday that she would support a fellow political outsider, Andrew Yang, in the upcoming Iowa caucuses to try to help him stay in the race beyond February.
In a three-part Instagram announcement in which she shared her opinions about the candidates still in the race, Ms. Williamson -- who delivered a campaign message centered around healing -- praised Mr. Yang for the "breadth of his intellect and the expansiveness of his heart."
"Andrew's personality is like a tuning fork realigning us with something we need to retrieve, taking us back to a more innocent time, making us remember to chuckle," she said.
And while she noted that she was not "endorsing anyone," she wrote: "I'm lending my support to Andrew in Iowa, hopefully to help him get past the early primaries & remind us not to take ourselves too seriously. We need that this year."
In a tweet later Thursday, Mr. Yang, who peppers his stump speech with jokes and has played basketball and crowd-surfed on the campaign trail, thanked Ms. Williamson and praised her approach. She is expected to appear with him and speak at a town hall event in Fairfield, Iowa, on Friday, his campaign said.
"I have learned a lot from Marianne and continue to do so," tweeted Mr. Yang, who became friends with Ms. Williamson during their months on the campaign trail, sometimes exchanging phone calls and texts. "She answers questions that many of us haven't even thought to ask. Very grateful for her friendship and support in this important time."
In a statement provided to The New York Times on Thursday afternoon, Ms. Williamson emphasized she was "not endorsing any presidential candidate at this time," adding that she supports "all the progressive candidates."
"I'm appearing with Andrew Yang in Fairfield because I know the institutional obstructions to his candidacy and I want to see him continue in the race past Iowa," she said in the statement.
After a modest but steady rise in the polls, Mr. Yang has struggled to get beyond the mid-single digits in both national surveys and polls of the critical early voting states. Those struggles kept him off the debate stage this month in Iowa, a first for his campaign. He remains two qualifying polls short of making the cut for February's Democratic debate in New Hampshire, a state that he has said he believes he can do particularly well in and from which he will need to gain momentum to fuel his campaign into later stages of the race.
On Thursday, the billionaire Tom Steyer, whom Mr. Yang publicly supported at an earlier debate, argued for Mr. Yang's inclusion in the February contest.
"You know who should be on the next debate stage with the rest of us? This guy," Mr. Steyer wrote on Twitter, adding a photo of himself and Mr. Yang.
Though Mr. Yang must earn just 5 percent support in forthcoming qualifying polls to make the February debate, he will need to amass 15 percent support in a congressional district to earn delegates that count toward winning the party's nomination -- a steep climb so close to the first nominating contests.
Aside from expressing her support for Mr. Yang, Ms. Williamson also used her Instagram posts to outline her views on the remaining field of Democratic candidates and on issues and characteristics that are important to her. "The most important one now is a psychological issue," she said, one about "which candidate will make the strongest emotional connection with the American electorate."
She mentioned Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders by name, calling them both "political treasures" who "would make spectacular presidents." She specifically noted that she related "to Elizabeth, as I related to Hillary, because I come from the same generation of women as they do."
But she also called Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders "transactional politicians" who "come from a political school of thought -- dominated by a 20th-century perspective -- which holds that who a candidate is, isn't nearly as significant as what they say they'll do."
"That's a huge mistake, because the part of the brain that rationally analyzes an issue isn't always the part of the brain that decides who to vote for," she said, adding later: "It's not a transactional politics, but a relational one, that will win in 2020."
Asked to clarify her stance on the two candidates, Ms. Williamson reiterated in an additional statement that she was a "huge fan" of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, but said they did not "need my help at this point."
"I'm highly critical of how certain candidates have been pushed to the side, and I want to support the leveling of the playing field," she said.

Texto completo: The trial of a lifetime. A constitutional crisis of historical proportions. A game-changer for American democracy.
President Trump's impeachment trial -- only the third in American history, the second since the advent of television and the first of a first-term president -- rolled into the Senate chamber this week with the promise of a made-for-TV spectacle. Drama! Conflict! Burisma Bada Bing!
What landed was more like a local cable co-op hearing, spliced with a jury-duty service instructional video, squeezed through an uninspired PowerPoint presentation.

Thank the government for the low-fi production of this high-stakes trial, which began Tuesday and will roll into next week with a series of all-day sessions featuring arguments for and against Trump's removal from office.
The artless staging and inert fixed camera angles are a result of the Republican-controlled Senate's request that no press photography or recording devices be allowed inside the chamber. The filmed record of this extraordinary period in our nation's history is being documented by what appears to be one fixed camera left behind after Bill Clinton's impeachment, equipped with a zoom feature and not much else.
Hours stuck in the same frame -- Representative X and Trump lawyer Y making their arguments in front of a marbleized wall whose cracks and fissures illustrate the glacial pace and weight of the trial -- make one yearn for the brilliance of C-SPAN and the Frank Capra-esque masterworks it's produced in these same chambers.
Presentations by impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and other Democrats arguing that the president abused his power were augmented by evidentiary documents and bullet-pointed timelines. Video clips of testimony during the House impeachment hearings from key players in Trump's administration, such as Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Gordon Sondland, were interspersed throughout the proceedings to back their charges that the president used his office to game the forthcoming election in his favor.
But when the audio slipped out of sync, as it did quite often, it evoked the dubbed hilarity of a midcentury Godzilla movie, and their meticulously planned attack was upstaged by memories of another monstrous battle, but involving Rodan.
Political pundits lamented the setup, arguing that Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) banked on a boring telecast to dissuade voters from watching the hearing. "They don't want the public to see this," said MSNBC analyst Michael Steele. "They don't want us to assess for ourselves."
The unintended result, however, was impeachment in the raw, a somber endeavor uncluttered by the flashy graphics and curated direction of news outlets tasked with entertaining their audiences. Reports of celebrities in the public seating area were just that, reports. Alyssa Milano was off camera.
The American political process, as messed up as it is today, was center stage and unadorned. Sans the bells and whistles, it was and is a study in paying attention when everything tells you not to, of staying attuned to a laborious process that's designed to make us look the other way.
Call it a January miracle, but the first day of the trial drew an audience of more than 11 million television viewers, according to ratings data compiled by Nielsen. And that's not accounting for those who live-streamed it on internet platforms. They'll have plenty more to watch in the coming days. Each side is allotted 24 hours in all for opening arguments, and Trump's legal team will likely begin its defense this weekend. Senators will then have the opportunity to pose written questions through Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial.
The state-controlled broadcast has been a great media equalizer. All news outlets and platforms have the same feed, no matter their political leaning, balance of punditry versus facts, or annual revenue numbers. The only differences were the network ID icons on the side of the screen and colorful backing graphics that struggled to make the dry affair look sexy.
Imagine if political campaigns were run this way -- if the candidates were allowed only the one setting to appeal to pollsters. If Bloomberg didn't own it, and Fox couldn't spin it. Congratulations, President Yang.
CNN and the New York Times sent sketch artists into the trial, who came back with illustrations of senators falling asleep in their chairs or vacating their seats like Lindsey Graham for the excitement of the cloak room.
On Wednesday, as Schiff finished up his roughly three-hour presentation, perhaps two dozen Republicans were out of their seats at once. It's a violation of the rules for senators to leave their seats during the trial, which may be another reason they wanted to control the narrative. Sens. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) reportedly loitered by the door while Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) was spotted sneaking chocolate from under his desk. If we're honest, we all needed a sugar boost at that point.
The no-frills production had even the jurors tuning out, which probably wasn't an anticipated detail in McConnell's suppress-the-checks-and-balances playbook. Trump is on trial, but so is the disappearing American attention span. Stay alert, because the last thing we need is a sequel of "Distraction vs. Democracy."

A novel 'earthquake lights' study goes dark

Texto completo: Aerospace engineer Tom Bleier tramped up a Bay Area hill on a recent weekday to inspect a sensor designed to detect whether the nearby San Andreas fault was about to shake the earth.
It was part of a network of 115 sensors deployed along the California coast to act as ears capable of picking up these hints, called electromagnetic precursors. If they exist, they could serve as an early warning system for earthquakes.
They could also provide a key to understanding spooky electric discharges known as "earthquake lights," which some seismologists say can burst out of the ground before and during certain seismic events.

Bleier had reason to look forlorn. After spending 20 years and $30 million, he and other engineers at Stellar Solutions Inc.'s QuakeFinder.com project never snared a clear indicator of a deadly seismic hazard. But that didn't keep them from trying.
A budget cutback did.
In December, Stellar Solutions slashed the project's operating funds -- a victim of the company's decision to focus on its more productive defense and satellite work. Its data analyses team was dismantled, indefinitely.
Bleier, 74, who recently retired, volunteers in a two-man skeleton crew tasked with simply keeping the sensors running through 2020. "If our funding goes completely dry," Bleier said, "we'll pull the sensors out of the ground, ending the only project of its kind in the United States."
Bleier's research is separate from the U.S. Geological Survey's early warning system that feeds apps such as MyShake and ShakeAlertLA, designed to warn people about expected shaking coming from distant earthquakes. But its demise shutters a project that originally held much promise.
Like the search for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, scientists have been hunting unsuccessfully for decades to establish the existence of precursors. Similarly, some researchers have faced derision for latching onto phenomena thought to precede quakes -- strange animal behavior, shifts in underground water pressure, electromagnetic emissions, weird lights.
The USGS acknowledges that tectonic stress may, under certain conditions, generate electromagnetic pulses which, upon reaching the surface, could create luminosities ranging from incandescent orbs to aurora-like curtains of blue and white light.
But a study to confirm their existence is out of the question.
"That would be a death knell of a career move, because earthquake prediction is not thought to be a promising path in general," said Susan Hough, a seismologist with the USGS in Pasadena.
Her book "Predicting the Unpredictable: The Tumultuous Science of Earthquake Prediction" points out that nobody sounded the alarm before the 2010 quake in Haiti that killed at least 100,000 people; the 2010 quake in Chile that killed 525 people; or the quake that rocked Japan in 2011 and triggered a tsunami, killing 15,000 people and severely damaging a nuclear power plant.
"Who wants to say, 'I'm going to be the world's greatest expert on earthquake lights?'" she asked.
The answer to that question is Bleier, for one.
"I'll never give up the search," said the self-described "geek in a positive sense" who persuaded Celeste Ford, chief executive officer and founder of Stellar Solutions, to take on the project as a humanitarian R&D initiative.
"We've given our hearts and souls to QuakeFinder," Ford said in an interview. "But pinning down precursors is not a one-company job."
The bottom line: It takes about $4 million a year to operate its sensors in earthquake-prone regions including California, Peru, Taiwan, Greece, Chile and Indonesia and pay staffers to process the data they gather.
"That's an awful lot of money for one company to shoulder forever," Ford said. "So we're hitting the pause button."
A month ago, the results of QuakeFinder's search for earthquake pulses from 2005 to 2018 were published in the scientific journal Computers & Geosciences.
To hear QuakeFinder tell it, the findings suggest that small precursor signals exist, but they are masked by natural and man-made background electromagnetic noise. "We need to figure out a way to extract that signal from all that noise," Bleier said. "That would require more funding."
The project's loyal supporters include John Derr, a former USGS geophysicist whose report on earthquake lights in the 1973 issue of the Geological Survey's Earthquake Information Bulletin drew widespread attention, including from the New York Times.
"Precursors could be used to develop an earthquake warning system," Derr, 78, said. "If that isn't important, I'll eat my hat!"
"Unfortunately," he added, "this subject is on the dark side of seismology and could destroy your career if you study it."
Another proponent is Friedemann Freund, a retired NASA scientist and adjunct professor at San Jose State University who has investigated dozens of accounts of earthquake lights.
Stellar Solutions provided the bulk of QuakeFinder's funding since it was launched in 1994, but other donors including NASA and billionaire Elon Musk pulled out their checkbooks.
Its sensors and a footlong satellite launched into orbit on a Russian rocket in 2003 were intended to be the first step toward development of precise earthquake forecasts.
But the satellite quit working after 18 months, and the sensors are so sensitive that engineers haven't been able to separate potential whispers of quake pulses from natural and man-made background noise.
The magnitude 6.0 South Napa earthquake of 2014 near San Francisco didn't pick up enough blips to indicate an imminent quake. "That was a giant disappointment," Bleier said.
Bleier is scrambling to keep the project alive. Proposals under consideration include a "contest" that would invite participants to sift through 70 terabytes of data collected over the last two decades. He remains convinced there is a breakthrough out there that could potentially save lives and property.

Texto completo: Let the EVs roll
Re "State's EV policy costs $32 million," Jan. 19
As an electric vehicle driver since 2017 and someone who's driven vehicles with at least 40 mpg since 1990, I'd gladly pay $100 a year to the state to help maintain roads, and so should others exempt from the additional fees and gasoline tax required by Senate Bill 1.

But there are more than 25 million registered automobiles in California and only 320,000 electric cars, so let's not lose site of the forest for the trees on this. The lost revenue of $32 million should be measured against the tangible benefits of having more zero-emission vehicles.
Also, if we pay workers more equitable wages, they can afford more efficient cars, but I see plenty of luxury vehicles on our roads, especially as income inequality grows. Why is electric vehicle affordability so often discussed when virtually nothing is said about drivers who can easily afford these cars but do not buy them?
Paul Spitzzeri
Chino Hills
::
Is the $100 fee for zero-emissions vehicle reasonable? Consider this.
Paying $100 in gas fees at the 17.6 cents per gallon added by SB 1 would require the purchase of 568 gallons of gasoline per year. If your car gets 20 mpg, that would be 11,000 miles of driving. If it got 40 mpg, you would have to drive 22,000 miles.
Most people don't drive 22,000 miles in a year, but some drive more than that.
A $100 fee seems reasonable, but it should be retroactive to all electric car owners.
Dennis Arntz
Laguna Niguel
::
Arguing that electric vehicle drivers should in effect pay a tax on gasoline is as counterintuitive as arguing that nonsmokers should pay a tax on cigarettes.
Taxes can and should be used to guide consumer choices in the direction of the greater good. Effectively raising the price of cigarettes helps decrease cigarette smoking. Raising the price of gasoline encourages consumers to find modes of transportation that burn less gas.
In the same way that policies resulting in fewer cigarette smokers is of general benefit to our collective health, so too are policies that result in fewer consumers of gasoline.
If you want to ask electric vehicle users to contribute to the maintenance of transportation infrastructure, call it what it is, a driver's tax, and charge by the mile.

Why the silence? Here's Exhibit A
Re "Weinstein's accusers now face the heat," Jan. 22
So the rich and powerful Harvey Weinstein has managed to put together an expensive defense team to try to undermine the credibility of his sexual assault accusers. The women he allegedly abused now must face more torture because they finally found the courage to accuse him formally.
And people wonder why it is so difficult for victims to come forward to confront their abusers.
The fact is, if even one of Weinstein's many accusers is telling the truth, he belongs behind bars (along with so many other rich and powerful men who have been playing this game with impunity for as long as anyone can remember).
The list of abusers is long. Some get caught. Some actually get punished. And some of these people manage to get away with it.
Isn't this a lovely story?

Jewish support for civil rights
Re "What we owe each other," Jan. 20
Rabbi Clifford M. Kulwin believes the assumption that there was a "special black-Jewish bond so significant to the civil rights era" is mistaken. As evidence, he cites the ambivalence of Southern Jews whose choice was usually to shut up about anti-black racism or leave the region (or worse).
Would that Kulwin had a bit more empathy for Southern Jews who faced that dilemma.
He also quotes historian Cheryl Lynn Greenberg's conclusion that "most Jews were white people, and held white people's attitudes." If Greenberg believes that "most Jews" shared the racially insensitive attitudes of other white people, she is not basing her belief on public opinion polls because virtually none asked about this.
One exception was a New York Times poll in 1964, just when the "white backlash" was gaining momentum. It found that 46% of the city's Jews wanted the pace of the "Negro movement" to "slow down," while 45% were either satisfied with the pace or wanted "more speed." This may seem disconcerting, but it must be viewed alongside the 63% of the city's Catholics who wanted the pace to slow down.
Kulwin is certainly correct that back then most Jews were not civil rights heroes. But as a historian who has studied African American-Jewish relations for 40 years, I am confident the suggestion that "most Jews" harbored the racial insensitivity typical of whites who were not Jews is dubious.

::
Kulwin courageously steps up and tells the hard truth about the American Jewish community of the 1960s in recognizing that support of civil rights within it was nowhere near monolithic.
Yes, the attacks at Pittsburgh and Poway have shaken our complacency and privilege, but Kulwin mirrors the same idea that my father would discuss at our Sabbath dinner table during that turbulent decade that we were (and still are) extremely lucky to be white in America.
Thanks to Kulwin for his honesty.

::
My parents survived the Holocaust and arrived in the United States without a racist bone in their bodies.
Kulwin's analysis of Jewish attitudes toward blacks is so full of misleading conclusions, I feel I could take it apart paragraph by paragraph. It infuriates me.
I don't know what he hopes to accomplish by belittling Jewish support for civil rights in this country. But drawing an imaginary wedge between African Americans and Jews will beget bad feelings and less cooperation between them, helping to create a destructive rather than constructive relationship.

Divvying votes undemocratically
Re "High court takes up electoral college case," Jan. 18
The U.S. Supreme Court is taking up the case of whether an elector can act as an individual in casting a vote in a presidential election. A much larger question remains unanswered: Why do most states use a winner-take-all system that goes against the principle of one person, one vote?
Only Maine and Nebraska have a method that resembles democracy. These two states award some of their electoral votes based on the winner of the popular vote in each congressional district.
The winner-take-all rule used everywhere else in the country gives great leverage to "swing" states. For example, the outcome of the 2000 race between Al Gore and George W. Bush came down to Florida, which Bush won by only 537 votes.
Getting rid of this inherently undemocratic rule used by most states is of greater urgency than what's at issue in the Supreme Court case.
John Lane
Stanton
::
The idea that individual "faithless" electors can override the majority vote of the state they've pledged to represent is nothing less than voter fraud. What's to prevent these electors from choosing Mickey Mouse or their mother-in-law?
The framers of the Constitution surely had no idea that an elector's right to choose might be allowed to overturn the intent of voters.
This smacks of the "freedom of religion" nonsense, where pharmacy employees could effectively overturn the decisions of physicians and their patients because someone's religious sensibilities might be offended.
Quite simply, this must be stopped.

Trump's era of fake prosperity
Re "The economy and voters," Jan. 18
This analysis hinted at the underlying reasons why what President Trump calls the "greatest economy in the history of our country" is not resonating with many voters.
Simply put, it is a fake prosperity built on a massive credit card. The very affluent can do well, but when the bills are due, everybody pays and the least well off are the main victims.

Texto completo: Also this week, strange scenes at the Davos economic forum
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
We get a lot of mail from readers who want to know how they can shrink their environmental footprints. That's why we started the One Thing You Can Do column.
Sometimes, though, other readers (we have a lot of them) write to say they're worried that individual actions like the ones we talk about in the One Thing section aren't enough to lower emissions to the level that scientists say is necessary to avoid the harshest effects of climate change.
Fair point. It's a fact that we, as individuals, are embedded in systems that affect how much greenhouse gas we emit. And, changing those systems is tougher than changing our own behavior. It's hard to ride a bike to work, for example, if your community doesn't have bike lanes.
That raises a question: In addition to our individual actions, what levers can we use to shift these systems so they're less carbon intensive?
Over the past few years, Ilona M. Otto, a resource economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and her colleagues have worked to understand those mechanisms. This week, they published a paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that identifies some possible levers, or social tipping interventions, that could put the planet on track to halve global emissions by 2030 and tip the scales to net zero emissions by 2050.
You can think of some of the interventions as variations on the theme "when you know better, you do better." These include: Highlighting the moral implications of fossil fuels, strengthening climate education and engagement, and disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions.
Dr. Otto points to movements like Fridays for Future as having put a spotlight on the morality of fossil fuels. "You have a new generation of young people and the majority of them have a completely different understanding of politics and of what has to be done," she said.
An example of information disclosure could be product labels that show the greenhouse gasses associated with an item's production and use.
The other interventions have to do with exposing the broader costs of fossil fuels and reducing their markets. For example, removing fossil fuel subsidies and encouraging decentralized energy (like microgrids, for instance); building carbon-neutral cities; and divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels.
One intervention missing from the list is a carbon tax. The researchers found that it would most likely lead to reductions that were too gradual. In the countries that have introduced a tax it has made an impact in some sectors, but, "in some, like in transportation, it just didn't make any difference," Dr. Otto said.
"If you commute by car, as many people do in the suburbs, you can increase the price by 5 percent, by 10 percent, if you have no choice you will pay more or save on other things."
Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the annual World Economic Forum, opened this year's conference Tuesday morning in Davos, Switzerland, with a warning to members of the global establishment.
"We do not want to reach the tipping point of irreversibility of climate change."
But then, minutes later, he offered a hearty welcome to the world's only head of state who has pulled his country out of the Paris climate accord and reversed a raft of climate policies in his own country: President Trump.
"We have arranged for you the best sunshine," Mr. Schwab went on to say.
It captured the strange, whiplash-inducing mood of this year's meeting.
Sustainability was the buzzword on everyone's lips. Snacks at the conference venue were all vegetarian for one of the five days, and images of threatened turtles were projected on the walls. Along the main promenade in Davos, pop-up pavilions focused on reducing waste, even as luxury gas-guzzling black cars ferrying conference delegates clogged the narrow roads that wind through the Alpine village.
Greta Thunberg on Wednesday afternoon rebuked the titans of business and politics for doing too little to address a problem she said they had helped create.
Mr. Trump, who spoke an hour earlier to a separate audience, told reporters that he wished that she would focus on countries other than his.
"We have to do something about other continents, other countries," he said at a news conference. "I think Greta ought to focus on those places. We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean. So I think Greta has to start working on those other countries."

Texto completo: The trio, members of a secretive group within Russia's military intelligence agency, are accused of trying to kill an arms dealer, his son and one of his top executives in 2015.
Prosecutors in Bulgaria announced criminal charges on Thursday against three Russian spies from a secretive assassination unit for the 2015 poisoning of a prominent Bulgarian arms manufacturer.
The three men slipped into the country using fake passports and, according to prosecutors, used an organophosphate poison in an attempt "to deliberately kill" the arms manufacturer, Emilian Gebrev, along with his son and a top executive in his company.
Though the victims survived, the poisoning in central Sofia, Bulgaria's capital, endangered the lives of numerous people, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement.
Prosecutors released few details about the Russian spies on Thursday. But an investigation published in The New York Times last month identified them as operatives from Unit 29155, an elite group within Russia's military intelligence agency that carries out assassinations and disruption operations in Europe.
Members of the unit have also been involved in an attempted coup in Montenegro and an operation in Moldova, as well as the poisoning in 2018 of a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, in the English town of Salisbury.
The Skripal poisoning touched off a geopolitical showdown between Russia and the West that continues to reverberate. In response, more than 120 Russian diplomats were expelled from the European Union and the United States, and Britain filed criminal charges against two operatives later identified as officers with Unit 29155.
Bulgaria had initially been reluctant to confront Russia, though experts and officials say Russian spies often use Bulgaria as a staging ground for operations throughout Europe. The Bulgarian government declined to expel any diplomats in the wake of the Skripal poisoning and had closed the inquiry into the Gebrev poisoning years earlier because of a lack of evidence.
But after the British presented evidence of Unit 29155's activities on Bulgarian soil, the authorities there reopened the case.
The Times identified six operatives from Unit 29155 who appear to have been involved in the operation to kill Mr. Gebrev and the others. The three charged on Thursday arrived in Bulgaria shortly before Mr. Gebrev fell ill at a dinner with business partners in late April 2015.
Though the men were not named by prosecutors, using travel information, The Times was able to identify them by their aliases: Sergei Fedotov, Sergei Pavlov and Georgi Gorshkov. (The operatives using the names Fedotov and Pavlov were also involved in overseeing and planning the Skripal poisoning, according to European security officials.)
In Sofia, the operatives checked into a hotel near Mr. Gebrev's offices and insisted on rooms with windows facing the entrance of an underground parking garage, investigators said. One of the men then slipped into the garage, and, according to grainy surveillance video, appears to smear a substance on the door handles of cars belonging to the victims.
That was just the first poisoning. Investigators say that after failing to kill Mr. Gebrev and the others, Mr. Fedotov and another operative returned a month later and poisoned him and his son again while they were convalescing at their home on the Black Sea. Again, they failed to kill their victims, though Mr. Gebrev says his business continues to suffer.
In the statement on Thursday, the Prosecutor General's office said European arrest warrants and Interpol red notices -- requests that other countries arrest suspects -- had been filed for the three men involved in the first poisoning. It is not clear whether investigators plan to charge the other men involved in the operation.
The Kremlin is unlikely to hand over its operatives to face prosecution. After Britain announced charges against the two officers accused of involvement in the Skripal case, the men went on Russian state television to explain that they were merely sports nutritionists who had visited Salisbury to tour its famous cathedral.
Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment, though in the past he has dismissed reporting on Unit 29155 as "pulp fiction."
At times, though, Mr. Putin, who signed a law in 2006 allowing Russian operatives to carry out assassinations abroad, has been less equivocal. When asked last month about Russian involvement in the assassination of a former Chechen rebel commander in Berlin last year, he pointedly declined to deny it, calling the victim "an absolutely bloodthirsty murderer."

Texto completo: The Times's restaurant critic wrote that noisy restaurants are not a problem. A former executive editor of The Times who prefers not to shout over his entree disagrees.
To the Editor:
Re "Noisy Restaurant? What's the Problem?," by Pete Wells (Critic's Notebook, Jan. 22):
I am the benighted editor who many years ago asked The Times's food critics to assess, among other things, the noise level in reviewed restaurants.
I discovered that I and a few others past middle age no longer enjoyed shouting over their entree and that conversation, and some distance from the conversation at neighboring tables, contributed mightily to the enjoyment of the finest dishes.
That your current critic prefers distracting noise and digests better in a din is understandable; he does not pay for his nightly ventures out and in fact is paid for obsessive concentration on the dishes before him. He may be so preoccupied that it never occurs to him that some folks incur the cost of restaurants because they want to savor the chatter of friends and hear the sound of breaking bread.
A good critic is also a reporter, and he is not required to be deaf to the concerns of other diners.

Texto completo: The Afghan leader said he had told President Trump that the United States could withdraw a third of its troops, even as a peace deal with Taliban remains elusive.
DAVOS, Switzerland -- Afghanistan is prepared for a major reduction in United States forces there, President Ashraf Ghani said on Thursday, adding that he had given that message to President Trump, a step toward winding down the costly American military presence as diplomats struggle to finalize a peace deal with the Taliban.
About 12,000 American troops remain in Afghanistan, down from a peak of about 100,000 eight years ago. The eventual withdrawal of those forces has been one of the strongest pieces of leverage American negotiators have in talks with the Taliban to end the 18-year war.
A gradual reduction in United States troops in the country has taken place over the last year, despite the absence of a settlement emerging from peace negotiations in the Gulf state of Qatar over the past year. Mr. Trump declared the talks "dead" in September, just as the two sides were on the verge of finalizing an agreement. They later resumed, but have since stalled.
Mr. Ghani has been a vocal critic of the United States' negotiations with the insurgents, because the talks have excluded his government. But speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, he said he had told Mr. Trump that the Afghan government was ready for a further reduction of 4,000 American troops, one-third of those remaining.
An official close to Mr. Ghani said his stance was in keeping with the Afghan government's longstanding efforts to offer cost savings to an American president who complains about the price of deployments overseas. In return, Mr. Ghani hopes the United States will reconsider what he sees as a rushed deal that legitimizes the Taliban and leaves the Washington-backed government to fend for itself.
"We are totally ready for a withdrawal of 4,000 troops anytime the president decides," Mr. Ghani told reporters at the economic gathering, a day after he met with Mr. Trump.
American negotiators have been in Qatar for the past several weeks, trying to kickstart the stalled peace process.
In exchange for returning to the pact that they were close to approving in September, they have demanded that the Taliban agree to significantly reduce violence before the deal is signed. The signing of the American-Taliban deal would open the way for negotiations between the insurgents and other Afghans, including Mr. Ghani's government, over power-sharing.
On a visit to Afghanistan in November, Mr. Trump caused confusion over United States policy toward the insurgents, repeating the Afghan government's demand for an extensive cease-fire before talks could resume. American negotiators had long believed that holding out for a cease-fire before announcing a troop withdrawal was too ambitious and that the Taliban was unlikely to agree to it.
In recent weeks, the Taliban came to the negotiating table with an offer of a brief period of "violence reduction," a vague term that officials say could amount to holding back attacks on major cities and highways.
As American diplomats evaluate that offer, Mr. Trump seems to have toned down his earlier demand, aligning it with his negotiators' position. An official summary of his Wednesday meeting with Mr. Ghani made no mention of a cease-fire, instead citing "the need for a significant and lasting reduction in violence by the Taliban."
But Mr. Ghani's government has insisted on pushing the Taliban for nothing short of a cease-fire to show that the insurgents are genuine about peace and negotiating a shared political future, saying that a "reduction of violence" is meaningless.
"It's like pregnancy," Mr. Ghani said. "We really can't be half pregnant."
In another sign that significant differences remain between the Afghan government and the White House over the peace process, a close adviser to Mr. Ghani lashed out at the Taliban on Thursday and said that "foreigners" would not be able to impose a deal on the Afghan people.
Speaking at the Kabul-based Institute of War and Peace Studies on Thursday, Amrullah Saleh, Mr. Ghani's running mate in a recent election whose result is being disputed, said that Taliban violence had predated the United States invasion in 2001, and expressed concern that a deal between Americans and the insurgents might not mean an end to the fighting.
"It is possible that the U.S. and Taliban negotiations in Doha might end the war between the U.S. and the Taliban, but it is impossible for those negotiations to end the Taliban's war with the Afghan nation," Mr. Saleh said.
In a response that signaled how fraught any direct talks between the Afghan government and insurgents would be, a former Taliban minister alluded to the barbarity that predated the Taliban government of the 1990s.
He said the Taliban had arisen to end the anarchy and violence created when several armed factions fought to fill a power vacuum left by the Soviet withdrawal.
Agha Jan Motasim, who was finance minister during the Taliban government, said all sides of the 40-year conflict, including the Taliban, had made mistakes. Reaching a peace agreement required looking beyond past grievances and thoughts of revenge, he said.
"If we repeat the Taliban's wrongdoings and not mention their good," Mr. Motasim said, "we will just be fanning the flames."

Texto completo: "He knew our city better than anyone else," a colleague said, "and made it his goal for everyone else to know it, too."
Lee Gelber, a Bronx-born urban sherpa known for his drollery and definitude and celebrated by his peers as the dean of New York City tour guides, died on Sunday in Schenectady, N.Y. He was 81.
His daughter, Janet Gelber, said the cause was complications of several strokes.
Distinguished by a woolly ear-to-ear mustache that a walrus would envy, Mr. Gelber mentored a generation of future colleagues and conducted sightseeing tours both for tourists unacquainted with New York and for others savoring unfamiliar venues, like gospel choirs in Harlem or enduring remnants of Dutch New Amsterdam.
From 1993 until he retired in 2018, he narrated a cityscape that evolved from the mean streets of a record murder rate through the 2001 terrorist attack and the 2008 recession into what has been categorized, for better or worse, as another Gilded Age.
He also survived the advent of audio tours, which replaced human guides on some sightseeing buses and walking tours, and the profusion of digital apps on personal phones and other devices.
"His eyes would twinkle when he shared some particularly obscure or salacious tidbit of New York City trivia," said Michael Miscione, a Manhattan borough historian and a former tour guide himself.
Guides like Mr. Gelber "are great storytellers, not just knowers of facts," Mr. Miscione said. "They make connections between places, objects, events and historical figures to tell those stories. And they do it with passion and humor."
Unlike some curbstone tour guides, Mr. Gelber was a stickler for the dates, names and places he invoked in describing the city's 400-year recorded history -- from the stand on West 55th Street that inspired the "Soup Nazi" episode of "Seinfeld," to the sites of the Civil War draft riots in 1863, and to the Hearst Building on Eighth Avenue, where Good Housekeeping tests its recipes.
Teaching for Gray Line and for the Guides Association of New York City (a certification course), he kept prospective guides up-to-date, adding answers to potential sightseer questions like "What does DK in DKNY stand for?" (The designer Donna Karan, as most stylish New Yorkers would know.)
And he took tourists to boroughs outside Manhattan as well -- to the Bronx, for instance, where he was from.
Lee Peter Gelber was born on Feb. 8, 1938, to Max and Rebecca (Spiegel) Gelber. His father managed a sporting goods store, and his mother was a secretary.
He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx and from Queens College, where he majored in history. He then joined the Army Reserves in 1961 and served as a truck dispatcher.
His marriage to Roberta Lazarus in 1965 ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, Joshua, of Schenectady, where Mr. Gelber had moved last year; a sister, Lenore Cahn; and two grandchildren.
Mr. Gelber worked as a toy buyer for Macy's and Gimbels, then as a sales representative for several toy and game manufacturers, promoting big winners like Mastermind, Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit. (He was a winner himself, collecting about $ 5,000 as a semifinalist in a senior tournament on "Jeopardy!" in 1993.)
He could instinctively predict which games would be passing fads and which would become recreational fixtures. Among the proposed games he rejected was one about a presidential campaign.
"People want to have fun," he told The Chicago Tribune in 1992. "It's like an accountant developing an income tax game, or a dentist creating something called 'Root Canal."'
When the toy business slumped, he volunteered for the free visitor service Big Apple Greeter. At a friend's suggestion, he then shifted from marketing toys to touting the city. Mr. Gelber said his second career had finally allowed him to put both his history degree and his training as a truck dispatcher to use.
He was certified by the Guides Association in 1993 and worked for Apple Tours and City Sights. He also began the double-decker sightseeing routes for Gray Line New York Tours, where he was manager for tour sales and services. Eventually he ran his own company, which he named Here Is New York Tours, in homage to E.B. White's classic 1949 ode to the city.
In 1997, The New York Times described him as "dean" of the guides at Gray Line, the city's biggest licensed bus tour company.
From 2007 to 2009, Mr. Gelber was a co-president of the Guides Association, which in 2016 honored him as the inaugural recipient of its Guiding Spirit Award. It has since been renamed the Lee Gelber Guiding Spirit Award.
"He was unfailingly generous with his knowledge, his experience, his stories and his jokes," said Emma T.K. Guest-Consales, president of the Guides Association. "He knew our city better than anyone else, and made it his goal for everyone else to know it, too."
When he received the Guiding Spirit Award, he confided to well-wishers that, thinking ahead, he had already chosen a musical eulogy for himself -- the last stanza of Cole Porter's "I Happen to Like New York":
And when I have to give the world a last farewell
And the undertaker starts to ring my funeral bell
I don't want to go to heaven, don't want to go to hell
I happen to like New York.
His daughter said that song would be played at his funeral on Friday.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'THE CONFESSION OF LILY DARE' at the Cherry Lane Theater (in previews; opens on Jan. 29). Seas level, regimes fall and the writer-actor Charles Busch stays glamorous. In this new show, directed by Carl Andress and influenced by pre-code cinema, Busch plays a convent girl who becomes a madam, with a few stations of the bejeweled cross transpiring in between. With original music by Tom Judson.
212-352-3101, primarystages.org
'FRANKENSTEIN' at Classic Stage Company (previews start on Jan. 30; opens on Feb. 17). The monster is alive, and running in repertory. Joining Kate Hamill's feminist "Dracula" at Classic Stage Company is Tristan Bernays's adaptation of Mary Shelley's science fiction chiller, directed by Timothy Douglas. Stephanie Berry plays both Victor Frankenstein and his murderous creature, with Rob Morrison as the chorus.
866-811-4111, classicstage.org
'MEDEA' at the BAM Harvey Theater (in previews; opens on Jan. 30). The visionary writer and director Simon Stone ("The Daughter," "Yerma") brings a modern version of an ancient tragedy to BAM. In this study of sexual jealousy and vengeance, Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale star as an estranged couple who could likely benefit from some counseling. It's a marriage story with a body count.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'THE TRANSFIGURATION OF BENJAMIN BANNEKER' at La MaMa (previews start on Jan. 23; opens on Jan. 24). The celebrated puppet maker Theodora Skipitares returns with a new show about an 18th-century free black man who distinguished himself as an astronomer, a horologist and a creator of almanacs. Assisting the puppets -- some of them 12 feet tall -- are members of the Soul Tigers, the marching band from Benjamin Banneker Academy in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.
866-811-4111, lamama.org
Last Chance
THE BIG APPLE CIRCUS at Damrosch Park (closes on Feb. 2). This popular local circus folds its big tent. The current iteration is sometimes racier than usual, but who can't help enjoying the Lopez Troupe riding bicycles on a high wire or Jayson Dominguez surviving the Wheel of Death? The real stars: the magnificent Savitsky Cats, balls of fluff with acrobatic chops.
212-257-2330, bigapplecircus.com
'QUEENS ROW' at the Kitchen (closes on Jan. 25). Richard Maxwell's play, set in the aftermath of a future civil war, ceases the hostilities. Ben Brantley wrote that this series of three monologues, each spoken by a woman, is a testament to the forms of faith "that allow human beings to endure amid unspeakable loss and privation."
212-255-5793, thekitchen.org
'SING STREET' at New York Theater Workshop (closes on Jan. 26). The musical adaptation of John Carney's 1980s Dublin romance, directed by Rebecca Taichman, steps away from its synthesizers -- for now. Producers have announced a Broadway transfer that will keep intact much of the original cast, who also sing and play their own instruments. Ben Brantley described the current version as a "promising but still unfulfilled adaptation."
212-460-5475, nytw.org
'THE THIN PLACE' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Jan. 26). Lucas Hnath's ghost story, directed by Les Waters, turns out the lights. Centered on a young woman who believes in other worlds and a medium who maybe doesn't, the play, Jesse Green wrote, "presses against the deepest human longings not only for connection but also for exposure." He added, "We want to know what's out there, yes, but we also want it to know us."

Texto completo: A St. Louis businessman and philanthropist, he helped Republican politicians, including his cousins George H. W. and George W. Bush.
George Herbert Walker III, a cousin of two presidents, a former United States ambassador to Hungary and a prominent St. Louis businessman and philanthropist, died on Saturday at a hospice facility in St. Louis. He was 88.
His son, George, said on Thursday that the cause was complications of a stroke that Mr. Walker had about a year ago.
Mr. Walker grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and graduated from the Groton School in Massachusetts before earning a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1953 and a law degree from Harvard in 1955.
After serving two years in the Air Force, he moved to St. Louis in 1958 to work for a financial services company founded by George Herbert Walker, the grandfather he shared with his first cousin, George H.W. Bush, who also grew up in Greenwich. Mr. Walker was later president and chief executive of the business, Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, which grew significantly under his watch and which he took public in 1982.
In 1992, as Mr. Bush sought a second term as president, Mr. Walker tried his own hand at politics, seeking the Republican nomination for a suburban St. Louis congressional district. He lost in the primary to James M. Talent, who won the seat and later became a United States senator; Mr. Bush lost the presidency to Bill Clinton.
Mr. Walker remained active in Republican politics, helping to raise funds and organize Missouri campaigns for Republican presidential candidates. Notably, he took part in the successful presidential campaigns of Mr. Bush's son George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.
George W. Bush appointed Mr. Walker ambassador to Hungary in 2003, about a year before Hungary withdrew its troops from the Iraq war. He worked to maintain positive relations with the country, serving as ambassador until 2006.
George Herbert Walker III was born on March 16, 1931, to George Jr. and Mary (Carter) Walker in St. Louis, moving later to Greenwich as a child. His mother was a homemaker; his father, an investment banker, was an original investor in the New York Mets and an executive with the team.
Mr. Walker's first two marriages ended in divorce. He married Carol Banta, with whom he lived in St. Louis and Kennebunkport, Me., in the mid-1980s.
In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife; four daughters, Mary Elizabeth Bunzel, Wendy Cleary, Isabel Walker and Carter Walker; a stepson, John Martin; two stepdaughters, Hilary Roach and Paige Martin; a brother, Ray Walker; a sister, Betty Holden; and 14 grandchildren.
Mr. Walker was active in Downtown St. Louis Inc., the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis and the Siteman Cancer Center. He was a trustee of Webster University in Missouri for 42 years; the business school there was named for him after he made a $ 10 million donation in 2005.
The New York Times contributed reporting.

A Bloomberg Ad on 'Fox and Friends' Hits Its Target Audience of One

Texto completo: The president's advisers have urged him not to pay attention to the low-polling Democratic presidential candidate. But as Michael Bloomberg poured cash into attack ads, he became harder to ignore.
For weeks, President Trump's advisers have urged him to ignore Michael R. Bloomberg's nationally televised needling, warning him that it would only help the low-polling late entrant to the Democratic presidential primary by elevating his standing.
Mr. Trump heeded the counsel for a while, according to several of his allies, even as he repeatedly expressed anxiety about Mr. Bloomberg's spending. But as he has tuned into coverage of his Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump has been pricked by a deluge of television ads funded by the former New York City mayor -- a far wealthier billionaire who has made clear in his public remarks that he doesn't fear the president.
The ads have been everywhere, appearing when Mr. Trump catches up on television viewing in Washington and following him to Florida when he visits his new home state. But on Thursday morning, when the spending migrated to Mr. Trump's favorite morning show on Fox News, Mr. Bloomberg's aides all but spoke to the president through the television screen.
The show, "Fox and Friends," aired without commentary a new ad from Mr. Bloomberg's team that is based on reporting from a new book, "A Very Stable Genius," describing the language Mr. Trump used to excoriate military generals during a Pentagon meeting in 2017. The ad described him as "erratic" and pointed to the "chaos" in his administration.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, appeared on the show to unveil the ad, saying the military is an "institution that everyone respects. I think people want our commander in chief to respect the institution, and I think he weakens the country by attacking it."
The ad struck Mr. Trump, with its focus on a topic he has often been concerned about -- maintaining support among members of the military. So the president, who is notorious for reacting to what he sees on Fox News, did just that.
"Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals," Mr. Trump tweeted. "He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is."
He added: "By doing this, he figures, they won't hit him as hard during his hopeless 'presidential' campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these 'clowns' because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right!"
The president's focus on Mr. Bloomberg is not commensurate with the former mayor's standing in the polls so far. Mr. Bloomberg is still below double digits in nearly every survey after spending more than $ 256 million on ads in less than two months.
Mr. Bloomberg has benefited, however, from being mostly ignored by his primary rivals, some of whom don't want to elevate him in the race, but also don't want to alienate him and his ability to support the Democratic nominee in the general election. And most Democratic strategists remain skeptical that a candidate who once supported aggressive policing policies, who has switched parties three times and who endorsed President George W. Bush in 2004 will be able to win the nomination.
From Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, to his polling team and other advisers, the president has been told repeatedly that Mr. Bloomberg isn't worth his attention.
Meanwhile, even for some Democratic observers who are uncomfortable with how much money Mr. Bloomberg is flooding into the system, there is a relief in watching the candidate get into Mr. Trump's head in a way that few have.
"Trump fears Bloomberg because Bloomberg is actually the guy who Trump played on TV -- a fantastically wealthy, self-made success with unlimited resources and a willingness to spend it," said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama.
The Trump campaign played down any worries about Mr. Bloomberg.
"It's a free country and he can set his money on fire if he wants to," said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. "He's still in a statistical tie with the back of the pack in the Democrat field."
The Trump campaign is dismissive of the idea that Mr. Bloomberg could be an ongoing threat as anything other than the nominee, despite his pledge to spend to support the Democratic standard-bearer through Election Day. And officials have taken note that Mr. Bloomberg's team is trying to mirror the Trump campaign's playbook with online spending.
But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers see a void that the candidate is filling, in a primary race during which the candidates have sometimes struggled with whether to depict Mr. Trump as an existential threat or to ignore him altogether. The president, meanwhile, continues to try to set the terms of engagement in the election, threatening to attack them in demeaning, and deeply personal, ways.
Howard Wolfson, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said that Mr. Trump had been "essentially running unopposed until Mike entered the race."
"While the other Democrats are fighting and sniping with one another in Iowa, we are running a nationwide campaign that is taking the fight directly to President Trump on issues where he is extremely vulnerable," he said.
As for Mr. Trump's nickname for Mr. Bloomberg -- "Mini" -- Mr. Wolfson called it "irrelevant" and said, "If you want to think about small, Trump could fit in Mike's pocket. The stature gap, the wealth gap, the success gap, the experience gap, the achievement gap between these two men is vast."
The Bloomberg campaign has been ratcheting up its attacks as Mr. Trump has reacted to the spending.
Guided by extensive internal polling, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign first began directly attacking Mr. Trump with an ad on health care, accusing the president of ruining insurance for millions of Americans and undermining coverage of pre-existing conditions. The ad about pre-existing conditions immediately drew a Twitter rebuke from the president.
From health care to the environment to impeachment, the Bloomberg campaign has been running ads attacking Mr. Trump's record nationally, particularly in key swing states. The ad about pre-existing conditions, for example, was backed by more than $ 1.2 million in the Orlando, Fla., market alone.
But, in a further tweak to Mr. Trump, the campaign is also running ads in his strongholds, such as $ 14 million worth of ads attacking the president in Texas. The state is also a Super Tuesday state, where Mr. Bloomberg hopes to amass delegates.
And the Bloomberg campaign confirmed that the ad about the Pentagon that set off Mr. Trump on Thursday morning would continue airing on Fox News.
Every television ad attacking Mr. Trump concludes with a contrast to Mr. Bloomberg, whose mayoral record and subsequent activism are portrayed glowingly; none of the ads are simply a takedown of the president.

Texto completo: A day after President Trump suggested he was open to cutting entitlement programs in a second term, he insisted he would protect Social Security.
When President Trump suggested to an interviewer at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland that he would, "at some point," look at cutting entitlement programs, his Democratic critics seized on the comments as evidence that Mr. Trump would gut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in a second term.
"Even as the impeachment trial is underway, Trump is still talking about cutting your Social Security," Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said at the beginning of a news conference that was ostensibly about the Senate impeachment trial.
The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA posted on Twitter about Mr. Trump's remarks, and others contrasted his statement with his 2016 campaign pledge not to touch entitlement programs.
On Thursday, the president tried to clean up his own mess.
"Democrats are going to destroy your Social Security," Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before leaving the White House for a campaign-related event in Florida. "I have totally left it alone, as promised, and will save it!"
Advisers said the president's comments in Davos, Switzerland, came as he is keeping a wary eye on the ballooning deficit, which he promised to eliminate within eight years if elected. Under Mr. Trump's watch, the federal budget deficit has risen rapidly as his tax cuts and increased spending necessitate more government borrowing.
Last year, the deficit topped $ 1 trillion for the first time since 2012, and it is projected to stay above that mark for several years. Even with a strong economy, the deficit has grown nearly four times as fast, on average, under Mr. Trump than it did under President Barack Obama.
Still, senior administration officials insisted that Mr. Trump was not seeking to make a new policy announcement. They also insisted that he was not making a significant break with anything he has said before. They described proposals he has made in previous budgets as efforts to grapple with the growing costs of social safety net programs without breaking his campaign pledge.
A Trump administration official familiar with planning for the upcoming the White House budget said that the president was not expected to announce any draconian cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid when the document is released next month.
However, Mr. Trump's budget proposal could outline some of the administration's plans for additional tax cuts. While those cuts have yet to be detailed, they would invariably add to the deficit unless they were offset with other spending cuts or tax increases. That fiscal reality could spur Republicans to renew calls for cutting entitlement programs, whose costs are estimated to grow as an aging population relies more on Social Security and Medicare.
Some Republicans argued that Mr. Trump was continuing with a longstanding practice of making vague but sometimes contradictory statements that allow people to select what they want to believe from what he has said.
But Democrats spied an opportunity to highlight the disparity between Mr. Trump's messaging and what his government does.
Mr. Trump's understanding that entitlement programs, particularly those for older Americans, are a political land mine was clear in 2016, when he broke with other candidates vying for the Republican presidential nomination and promised unequivocally to protect Social Security.
"I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is," Mr. Trump said during a March 2016 debate, adding that he would solve the problem of the program's solvency by making the United States a wealthier country.
At the time, Mr. Trump was also blunt about the political realities of cutting safety net programs, noting that Democrats want to bolster Social Security benefits for retirees.
"And that's what we're up against," he said. "And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against."
Despite that promise, Mr. Trump has made several moves to chip away at America's social safety net programs.
The Trump administration has already tried to cut food stamps, rental assistance for low-income housing, and Medicaid through efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, said Chye-Ching Huang, the director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The most recent White House budget proposed a $ 10 billion cut to the Social Security Disability Insurance program, which provides benefits to disabled workers.
"This is just the latest of many instances of the Trump administration making clear through statements, budgets, legislation and administrative actions that their basic policy goal is tax cuts for the well-off hand-in-hand with targeting critical programs, including those that support low- and moderate-income people," Ms. Huang said.
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to cost the government more than $ 30 trillion through 2029, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The combined annual outlays represent more than 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product and threaten to weigh on long-term economic growth.
The programs themselves face a financial predicament. The cost of Social Security, the federal retirement program, will exceed its income in 2020 for the first time since 1982 and its reserve fund is projected to be depleted in 16 years, according to an annual government report released last year.
Medicare's hospital insurance fund is projected to be depleted in 2026. At that time, doctors, hospitals and nursing homes will not receive their full compensation from the program and patients could face more of a financial burden.
Cutting entitlement programs, which are funded by workers through payroll taxes, has long been considered the "third rail" of American politics. Suggestions of trimming benefits or raising the retirement age to make programs more sustainable has been a nonstarter with older voters, who more reliably show up at the polls. In 1981, when President Ronald Reagan proposed a plan that would have reduced the benefits paid to early retirees, he was rebuffed by Congress and dealt a political blow. It took a bipartisan commission two years to agree to overhauls for the program.
Republican lawmakers who consider themselves fiscal conservatives have long wanted to restructure America's safety net programs, but they have generally held their tongues under Mr. Trump. Last year, however, some lawmakers started to press the president to tackle the issue.
"We've brought it up with President Trump, who has talked about it being a second-term project," Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, told The New York Times last year.
The need to find cuts could become more pressing if the administration tried to push through another tax cut.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday that Mr. Trump had asked him to begin developing a plan for more middle-class tax cuts to further stimulate the economy.
"The president feels that we need to continue to incentivize the middle class," Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. "That their taxes have been too high historically."

Re "Robert Caro's Papers Find a Home" (Arts pages, Jan. 9):
The acquisition of the biographer Robert Caro's papers by the New-York Historical Society is like the acquisition of Julia Child's kitchen by the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Julia had outlines of her pots and pans on the wall, and Mr. Caro has outlines of his book chapters in his office, presumably to be included in the historical society's exhibition.
Both people demonstrated their organizational skills with precision. My motto: Eat first, then read.

'DEBATE CLUB' at Caveat (Jan. 27-28, 9:30 p.m.). National Lampoon presents this new series hosted by Jordan Klepper ("The Daily Show With Trevor Noah," "The Opposition With Jordan Klepper"), in which he moderates amusingly educational arguments about serious matters. At Monday's show, the comedians Kenice Mobley and Michael Cruz Kayne will discuss reparations with Coleman Hughes, a philosophy student at Columbia University whose work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, and Nelini Stamp, the national organizing director for the Working Families Party. The question for Tuesday's debate will be "Should we forgive student loan debt?"
212-228-2100, caveat.nyc
8TH ANNUAL PATRICE O'NEAL COMEDY BENEFIT at New York City Center (Jan. 27, 7 p.m.). Bill Burr started his comedy career in Boston in the early 1990s at the same time as O'Neal, and has organized a benefit each year in O'Neal's honor since his death in 2011 at the age of 41. Joining Burr this time around are Ronny Chieng, Roy Wood Jr., Judy Gold, Sam Morril, Andrew Schulz, Cipha Sounds, Paul Virzi and Rich Vos. Ticket availability to the event is limited.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
HARI KONDABOLU at Carolines on Broadway (Jan. 23, 7 p.m.; Jan. 24-25, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). This stand-up, a Queens native, wrote and starred in a 2017 documentary for TruTV, "The Problem With Apu," which explores how that animated character's thick-accented stereotypical depiction on "The Simpsons" impacted young Americans of South Asian descent. (Just last week, the actor Hank Azaria announced he would stop voicing the character.) Kondabolu's satire has plenty of bite: He offered several shrewd observations about our nation's racial politics, with a healthy dose of self-awareness, in his 2018 Netflix comedy special, "Warn Your Relatives."
212-757-4100, carolines.com
DREW MICHAEL at Littlefield (Jan. 24, 8 p.m.). A former writer for "Saturday Night Live," this stand-up released an unorthodox special on HBO in 2018, in which he performed his routine as a monologue, mostly straight to camera and without a live audience. For this showcase, though, you're more than welcome to watch Michael share what he has got on his mind these days.

'SIDESHOW GOSHKO' at KGB Bar (Jan. 30, 7 p.m.). Leslie Goshko will celebrate the 11th anniversary of her storytelling showcase with tales from Kevin Allison, Andy Christie and Katina Corrao. To sweeten the deal, 11 audience members (one for each anniversary) will win a free bottle of wine.

Texto completo: Readers praise his eloquence. One even muses, Mr. Schiff for president?
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats Assert Trump Was Trying to 'Cheat' in '20 Bid" (front page, Jan. 23):
The brilliant opening presentation on Tuesday by Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, should be required reading or viewing not only in high school civics classes but also in law school constitutional law and advocacy classes. It is a tour de force, framing the fundamental constitutional principles of separation of powers and its historical underpinnings, examined through the narrower prism of the events surrounding the Trump impeachment.
He presented a comprehensive and compelling recitation of the president's breaches of the Constitution and abuse of power on a remarkable scale, which continued with equal force on Wednesday.
Mr. Schiff's final appeal to the Senate and the American people not to accept as the new normal the executive's flouting of the Constitution's checks and balances, to not simply "get over it" and face the dire threat to our republican form of government, put in plain language before the jurors and the entire country the stark choice confronting us in this trial. At the end, he placed the ultimate responsibility upon, and trust in, the Senate jurors in the trial and the American people in the coming election to do the right thing.

To the Editor:
We are leaving out a particularly able, intelligent, articulate and tough Democrat who could really go head to head against President Trump. It's Representative Adam Schiff. If only he would run. The Democrats could still draft him.

To the Editor:
At Davos, President Trump said: "Honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material." In doing so, he openly admitted to obstruction of justice. Case closed.

To the Editor:
Re "Whisked Away From the Stump, Senators Leave a Lane for Rivals" (front page, Jan. 23):
It seems only fair that those presidential candidates who do not have to be in attendance at President Trump's impeachment trial cease their on-the-ground campaigning until all candidates have equal opportunity for hand shaking, baby holding, door knocking, kaffeeklatsching, etc. It would be a welcome example of solidarity in the Democratic Party.
I like to believe that we are all working toward the same end, and that is to get Mr. Trump out of the White House. Many of us really don't care which of the Democrats ends up winning the election; we just want one of them in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: The vow follows a New York Times investigation showing how one of the world's largest subsidy programs enriches far-right leaders, bankrolls oligarchs and underwrites Mafia tactics.
BRUSSELS -- The European Union's new top agricultural official promised on Thursday to introduce anticorruption measures in response to a New York Times investigation that revealed how the bloc's huge farm subsidy program underwrites a system of political patronage and land grabbing.
The $ 65-billion-a-year fund is one of the world's largest subsidy schemes. The money, which many farmers regard as a birthright and which dates to the founding of the European Union, has helped transform the continent into a dominant agricultural producer.
But the Times investigation showed how populist far-right politicians have used the program to enrich themselves and their political allies at the expense of small farmers. It also showed how the program has contributed to devastating environmental problems -- among them rising greenhouse gas emissions, polluted rivers and sharp reductions in bird populations.
The bloc's new agricultural commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, told members of the European Parliament on Thursday that he would work to tighten controls. "I would like to introduce a list of preventive anticorruption measures," he said.
He was responding to a question about the Times investigation from Francisco Guerreiro, a European lawmaker from Portugal.
Mr. Wojciechowski's response, if short on specifics, signaled that top officials in Brussels are considering direct steps to combat corruption in the subsidy program. European officials had previously said that it was up to national leaders -- including those who have manipulated and benefited from the subsidies -- to institute reforms or crack down on abuses.
The Times tracked at least $ 49 million in subsidies to companies controlled by Prime Minister Andrej Babis of the Czech Republic, for example. And reporters mapped government farmland sales in Hungary that made the family and friends of the prime minister, Viktor Orban, eligible for millions of dollars in subsidies.
Despite such problems, any significant changes proposed by Mr. Wojciechowski are likely to be hotly contested. Some of the European lawmakers who write the subsidy policy also benefit personally from the program, a situation that is allowed by Europe's weak and murky conflict-of-interest rules.
Cracking down will also be difficult because much of the abuse documented by The Times can be traced to the subsidy formula itself. The European Union pays farmers based on how much land they control, a system that encourages farmers to acquire more and more property.
In Hungary, leaders have doled out huge swaths of government-owned farmland, making the new owners eligible for subsidies. In Bulgaria, a handful of grain barons receive most of the subsidies. Slovakian farmers have reported being beaten and extorted for farmland. These sorts of abuses are typically left to the national governments to police.
Just this month, Italian officials arrested 94 people suspected of being involved in a Mafia scheme to make millions from European farm subsidies.
Mr. Wojciechowski reiterated his office's longstanding support for a subsidy cap, a measure intended to reduce the amount of subsidies that go to the biggest farmers. Currently, about 80 percent of subsidies go to the wealthiest 20 percent of recipients. But such a change would need approval from national leaders, many of whom are organizing against it.
"I think large farms -- at some level this is more of an enterprise than a farm, so financing such holdings should be limited," Mr. Wojciechowski said. "Whether it happens or not, that's up to member states."
The subsidies are at a crossroads this year as lawmakers in Brussels debate their renewal.
European leaders have not said how the farm program fits into their ambitious new environmental agenda, known as the Green Deal. Agriculture is by far the biggest item in the European budget, accounting for roughly 40 percent of all spending.

Angola to Charge Africa's Richest Woman With Financial Crimes

Texto completo: Isabel dos Santos, Africa's richest woman and the daughter of Angola's former president, is set to be charged with committing crimes to enrich herself, after an investigation into embezzlement of millions of dollars from a state oil company she once headed, Angolan officials said.
Angola's attorney general, Hélder Pitta Grós, said on late Wednesday that Ms. dos Santos would be charged with "money laundering, influence peddling, harmful management" and "forgery of documents, among other economic crimes" committed when she ran the oil company.
"I can say that from the investigation we conducted, we will now move to criminal charges," Mr. Pitta Grós said, speaking at a news conference in Luanda, the country's capital.
The announcement came days after a trove of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with The New York Times revealed Ms. dos Santos's efforts to profit on business dealings tied to the Angolan government. Those connections helped her build a fortune worth over $ 2 billion, according to Forbes.
The heart of the Angolan investigation involves her tenure at Sonangol, the state oil monopoly, particularly during November 2017, the month she was fired as its chairwoman. More than $ 57 million was withdrawn at the time from Sonangol's account at EuroBic -- a Portuguese bank where Ms. dos Santos is the biggest shareholder -- to pay for a flurry of invoices issued by a Dubai company owned by her friend.
On Thursday, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that a EuroBic banker who managed the Sonangol account, Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, had been found dead on Wednesday night at his house in Lisbon. Lusa cited a police source saying it was probably a suicide.
Mr. da Cunha's name appears extensively in the leaked documents as a banker facilitating business for Ms. dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo. The couple increasingly relied on EuroBic, the Portuguese arm of an Angolan lender, as bigger, global banks declined to do business with her. Lenders in the European Union and the United States are bound by rules constraining their ability to work with politically exposed persons and are required to report suspicious transactions to regulators.
The banker's name is on an email confirming a payment to a Dubai shell company on Nov. 15, 2017. Ms. dos Santos was fired from Sonangol that day, and some of the funds were paid out after the new Angolan president, who had replaced her father, announced her dismissal, the documents show.
Ms. dos Santos, 46, speaking to the BBC earlier this month, said the payments were earmarked for firms including the Boston Consulting Group, PwC and McKinsey & Company, with the shell company acting as an intermediary overseeing their work with Sonangol. None of the firms, when asked, would provide billing information to verify her claim.
EuroBic announced on Monday that it was ending its "commercial relationship" with Ms. dos Santos, and would be investigating transfers worth tens of millions of dollars.
Ms. dos Santos said in a statement on Thursday that the leaking of the documents, and their subsequent publication, stemmed from "a very concentrated, orchestrated and well-coordinated political attack, ahead of elections in Angola next year."
"It is an attempt to neutralize me and to discredit the legacy of President dos Santos and his family," she said. Her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, was president for 38 years until he stepped down in 2017.
As scrutiny of Ms. dos Santos increased in recent months, she turned to lawyers and public relations professionals to defend her record. In December, she hired a Washington lobbying firm, Sonoran Policy Group, to set up "meetings and interactions" in the United States and Britain, according to a disclosure the firm filed. That contract, as well as another one signed with the firm on Jan. 2 to work with the media on her behalf, total more than $ 2 million.
Sonoran, founded by the lobbyist Robert Stryk, leapt to prominence in the early days of the Trump presidency when it landed big contracts with foreign governments and leaders -- including a Saudi ministry -- eager for help navigating the administration, The Times reported in 2017.
Ms. dos Santos and several business associates, all Portuguese nationals, would face charges, Mr. Pitta Grós said, adding, "We have enough reasons to prosecute these people."
"At this moment our concern is that they be notified of the charges brought against them, and that they present themselves voluntarily to the court in order for them to be able to defend themselves," he said.
When asked if his office knew of Ms. dos Santos's whereabouts, he seemed unsure. "We only know from the social media that she has been living in London and Russia," he said. Ms. dos Santos owns homes around the world, including in Dubai, Lisbon, London and Monte Carlo.
Álvaro João, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, clarified in a Thursday interview that formal charges had not yet been filed, but were likely, and that they were part of an investigation that began in 2018.
"These are not yet formal charges, as investigations continue and if needed we will then charge her and the others," he said.
Angola has sought help in the corruption investigation from Portugal, where Ms. dos Santos has links to several companies. Mr. Pitta Grós traveled to Lisbon on Thursday to meet with the Portuguese attorney general, according to Portugal's public service broadcaster, Rádio e Televisão de Portugal.
Angola has immense oil and mineral wealth, but many of its people live in deep poverty, without access to basic services, and the country is rife with corruption. The recently leaked documents provide a detailed account of how Ms. dos Santos exploited her country's resources, acquiring stakes in Angola's lucrative diamond industry, banks, its leading cement manufacturer and its largest mobile phone company -- often through orders signed by her father. She has denied any wrongdoing and has long maintained that she is a self-made woman.

Texto completo: Ms. Arthur, previously the publisher at Little, Brown, succeeds Sonny Mehta, who died late last year.
Alfred A. Knopf announced Thursday that Reagan Arthur is its new publisher, succeeding Sonny Mehta, who died at 77 in December after more than three decades at the helm of the august literary imprint.
Arthur, 55, becomes just the fourth head of Knopf, following Knopf himself, Robert Gottlieb and Mehta. The imprint, which has published presidents and popes along with several Nobel Prize winners, celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2015.
Gottlieb, who left Knopf to become the editor of The New Yorker, had chosen Mehta as his successor, in 1987, and last fall Mehta had identified Arthur as his first choice to replace him. Arthur said that while she had long admired Mehta's work, she didn't know him well personally, and that "the opportunity came as a surprise."
She went to lunch with Mehta last fall to discuss the possibility of moving to Knopf. "I went in thinking that I do publish pretty commercial stuff in addition to literary stuff," she said, "and that's exactly what he pointed to as the strengths of Knopf: having that small-c catholic approach to reading and a basic love of storytelling."
Arthur had previously been at Little, Brown -- for the past seven years as senior vice president and publisher, and before that as a senior editor and then the head of her own imprint there. Authors she has published include Kate Atkinson, Michael Connelly, Rachel Cusk, Tina Fey, Malcolm Gladwell and David Sedaris. A more recent success at Little, Brown is Ronan Farrow's "Catch and Kill."
Arthur will be executive vice president and publisher of Knopf as well as the Pantheon and Schocken imprints at Penguin Random House, and will begin in her new role on Feb. 11.
"I love Little, Brown," she said. "I wasn't hankering for something else. It's been a very emotional time for me to think about leaving." But after nearly 20 successful years at the publisher, Arthur said she's ready for "a different set of opportunities and challenges," and that knowing some of the editors at her new house should make the transition easier.
"I worked with a couple of them way back when, in our early days," she said, referring to the start of her career, at the publisher St. Martin's, "and there's not an editor there whose books I haven't read at one point or another and loved."
The publisher also said Thursday that Maya Mavjee is the new president and publisher for the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. She will begin on March 2, returning to Penguin Random House after a year as president of publishing strategy at Macmillan.
Arthur has seen up close the many changes in the publishing industry over recent years -- she cited the rise of e-books and audiobooks as two of the most momentous, as well as the increase of "competing claims on readers' attention." The key to succeeding in that environment, she said, "is having the material itself, and obviously the great tradition of Knopf is these incredible writers and voices."
Given how few people have sat atop Knopf, its publishers tend to become synonymous with its already iconic name. Arthur said she's just eager to work with her new colleagues.
"I'm less interested in putting my own personal stamp on anything," she said, "than in continuing what's already a great publishing tradition."

Ex-Editor of Daily News To Resuscitate Deadspin

Texto completo: Jim Rich, who presided over a Pulitzer, will take over at a freewheeling sports site that has posted almost nothing since its staff quit last fall.
The publisher of the irreverent sports website Deadspin tapped a former editor in chief of The Daily News on Thursday to lead rebuilding efforts, nearly three months after a staff exodus over what employees characterized as editorial meddling.
Admirers credit Jim Rich, the site's new editor in chief, with revitalizing The News as a sharp liberal counterpoint to its conservative rival, The New York Post. At The News, Mr. Rich also presided over an investigation into police evictions that won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
G/O Media, Deadspin's owner, said Mr. Rich would work in Chicago, where Deadspin recently moved after 15 years in New York.
Deadspin, which promises "Sports News Without Access, Favor or Discretion," occupies a distinctive place in sports media. It earned acclaim for a 2013 investigation that exposed as a hoax the death of the college football star Manti Te'o's long-distance girlfriend. (Mr. Te'o was fooled into thinking she was real.) The article epitomized the site's sardonic yet rigorous coverage of the sports world, which it defined broadly.
"One of the things that we will continue to do is take on the issues and the stories that other sites traditionally shy away from, even if they make people a little uncomfortable," Mr. Rich said in an interview.
Jim Spanfeller, G/O Media's chief executive, praised Mr. Rich in a statement, saying his "extensive experience as a reporter and editor will enable him to rebuild and lead Deadspin into the future."
That ability is also likely to depend on Mr. Spanfeller, who has been running G/O Media since April, when the Boston private equity firm Great Hill Partners bought Deadspin along with several other sites that Gawker Media once owned -- including Jezebel, Gizmodo and Lifehacker.
Mr. Spanfeller's firing in October of Deadspin's interim editor in chief, Barry Petchesky, who had refused to obey an editorial directive to stick to sports, prompted more than a dozen staff members to head for the doors. Deadspin has not published anything since Nov. 4.
This month, 97 percent of the G/O Media editorial staff members who are represented by the GMG Union supported a vote of no confidence in Mr. Spanfeller, the union said. In a statement posted to Twitter on Thursday, the union said it objected to the decision to move the editor in chief position away from New York without negotiating.
A spokesman for G/O Media declined to make Mr. Spanfeller available for further comment on Thursday.
G/O Media was profitable in its previous two quarters, for the first time since the sites were combined in 2015, the company said last month in an emailed news release.
Mr. Rich, who was ousted as the Daily News editor in 2018 when its owner halved the newsroom staff, said he sympathized with the former writers and editors.
"It's not a decision you make lightly when you're weighing your livelihood against your journalistic principles," said Mr. Rich, who has edited sports at both The News and The Post and was a Huffington Post executive editor.
He said that G/O Media had approached him and given him assurances that "led me to believe that I was not going to be constrained as far as my editorial decision-making, and that I was going to be able to go after whatever story I felt we needed to."
His next task is to build a staff, and he said he welcomed all applicants -- including those who left the site last fall.
Laura Wagner, a former Deadspin writer who covered media -- and who posted a long Deadspin article in August about G/O Media's management -- said, "I understand media is a tough industry, and I'm sympathetic to the fact that people may be desperate for jobs."
But she said she doubted that ex-Deadspinners would rejoin the site under current management: "That's not going to happen."

Texto completo: The Amazon founder's investigation did not find evidence to back his suggestion of a link between Saudi Arabia and the tabloid that gleefully exposed his affair.
Almost a year ago, Jeff Bezos hinted that Saudi Arabia had played a role in The National Enquirer's 11-page exposé of his affair with the Los Angeles television personality Lauren Sanchez. In making the case in a post on the website Medium, Mr. Bezos noted that his newspaper, The Washington Post, had published the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and had also covered the kingdom's suspected role in his murder.
In the post, Mr. Bezos said he had retained the security expert Gavin de Becker to investigate how the tabloid had obtained his text messages. This week, a forensic analysis commissioned by Mr. Bezos was made public, and it concluded with "medium to high confidence" that his iPhone X had been hacked after he received a video from a WhatsApp message sent to him from an account reportedly belonging to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, with whom the billionaire had swapped contacts at a dinner in Los Angeles.
The Bezos report, compiled under Mr. de Becker by the digital security firm FTI Consulting, was so juicy that it overwhelmed traditional journalistic skepticism at some news outlets. The details were hard to resist: an allegedly murderous crown prince, the world's richest man and his intimate texts splashed across the pages of a supermarket tabloid that has ties to Prince Mohammed and a longtime Bezos detractor, President Trump.
In the swirl of coverage, Mr. Bezos' allegations took on a life of their own, with some news coverage veering into speculation. "The report offers one explanation of how The National Enquirer, a tabloid, obtained and published text messages Bezos had sent to his mistress," CNBC reported. The BBC asserted that information extracted from Mr. Bezos' phone was "leaked to the American tabloid."
In fact, the report did not definitively link the hacking to the Enquirer exposé. Months of reporting by The New York Times and other publications, including information that has emerged in recent days, appears to refute the notion that The Enquirer, owned by American Media Inc., received the information for the exposé from a foreign hack of Mr. Bezos' phone.
The hacking of an American by a foreign leader would count as an affront to national sovereignty and security under normal protocols. It also has legal implications: American Media is under the watch of federal law enforcement officials in New York, who have agreed not to prosecute the company for its role in aiding President Trump's 2016 campaign as long as it does not break the law.
The widespread coverage of the report also has personal implications for Mr. Bezos, who has achieved something of a coup in this latest bit of news.
On Feb. 7, weeks after The Enquirer's exposé appeared in supermarket racks, Mr. Bezos published the Medium article suggesting a possible connection between Saudi Arabia and the tabloid scoop. He noted that The Post was energetically covering Mr. Khashoggi's murder by Saudi assassins weeks after he wrote the last in a series of columns sharply critical of the crown prince, who the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded had ordered his death.
About two weeks after Mr. Bezos' Medium post, Mr. de Becker hired FTI Consulting to do the forensic analysis of the billionaire's iPhone. In March, Mr. de Becker said he had "high confidence" that Saudi Arabia had hacked Mr. Bezos' phone. The FTI Consulting report that was made public this week did not offer evidence of a link between the hacking and the Enquirer story.
American Media has said that it obtained information about the affair from Ms. Sanchez's brother, Michael Sanchez, a Hollywood talent agent whom people at The Enquirer have described as a longtime source of information and tips.
Mr. Sanchez and American Media executed a nondisclosure agreement on Oct. 18, 2018, "concerning certain information, photographs and text messages documenting an affair between Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez," according to a contract between the two parties reviewed by The New York Times.
Eight days later, Mr. Sanchez granted American Media the right to publish and license the text messages and photographs he had provided in exchange for $ 200,000, according to the contract and four people with knowledge of the arrangement.
"The single source of our reporting has been well documented," American Media said in a statement. "In September of 2018, Michael Sanchez began providing all materials and information to our reporters. Any suggestion that a third party was involved in or in any way influenced our reporting is false."
After federal agents and prosecutors examined allegations of wrongdoing by American Media in connection with the Bezos story last year, the company provided evidence showing them that Ms. Sanchez had provided text messages and compromising photos of Mr. Bezos to her brother, who passed them along to the tabloid, according to four people with knowledge of the situation.
That does not preclude the possibility that Saudi Arabia could have sent other useful information to The Enquirer. Nor were Mr. Bezos and his investigators off-base in suspecting a possible link between the tabloid and the kingdom. American Media and Saudi Arabia had both tried to build relationships with Mr. Trump, and one way to the president's heart could have been an attack on Mr. Bezos, whom Mr. Trump once referred to as "Jeff Bozo" in a Twitter post.
At the same time, the American Media chairman David J. Pecker sought business opportunities and financing in Saudi Arabia. He met with Prince Mohammed in Saudi Arabia in 2017 after attending a White House dinner with a well-connected contact of the crown prince. In March 2018, American Media published a 97-page glossy magazine, "The New Kingdom," essentially a promotional brochure for the crown prince and the nation.
Starting in September 2017, The Post had published columns by Mr. Khashoggi in which he excoriated Prince Mohammed for "unbearable repression," "behaving like Putin" and "squeezing" the Saudi news media.
Mr. Bezos, who had sought to build data centers in the desert kingdom before Mr. Khashoggi's murder, met Prince Mohammed in person at a dinner in Los Angeles in April 2018. The two chatted and exchanged contacts. Mr. Bezos' forensic team said that Prince Mohammed sent Mr. Bezos the suspect video shortly afterward.
The relationship between Mr. Bezos and the Saudis deteriorated after Mr. Khashoggi was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018. The Post demanded answers amid a growing consensus in the intelligence community that Prince Mohammed was involved.
Mr. Sanchez has said that The Enquirer was already onto the story about the affair before he discussed it with the tabloid, suggesting there was another source. Saudi Arabia has said it had nothing to do with it and has also called suggestions it hacked Mr. Bezos' phone "absurd."
Two people with knowledge of The Enquirer's reporting process said that its staff started trailing Mr. Bezos after one of its reporters received a tip on Sept. 10, 2018, from Mr. Sanchez that a well-known billionaire was having an affair with an actress. Mr. Sanchez didn't disclose their identities, but the tabloid staff suspected he was referring to Mr. Bezos.
On Oct. 18, The Enquirer's photographers snapped pictures of Mr. Bezos with Ms. Sanchez. That same day Mr. Sanchez and American Media executed their agreement to prevent him from shopping the story elsewhere.
The following month, according to the FTI Consulting report, which was reviewed by United Nations experts, Mr. Bezos received another message on his phone from the crown prince, this one featuring a photograph of a woman with a resemblance to Ms. Sanchez and a misogynistic joke: "Arguing with a woman is like reading the Software License agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree." FTI interpreted the message as a veiled suggestion that the crown prince knew about his relationship with Ms. Sanchez, which had not yet been made public, according to the report.
At the time, American Media had just emerged from a cloud of suspicion for its role in buying and burying information from the former Playboy model Karen McDougal about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump. After American Media executives admitted that they had effectively paid her hush money to help Mr. Trump's campaign -- in violation of federal election law -- they cooperated with an investigation into the payment. Federal prosecutors in New York agreed not to prosecute, at least as long as the company did not break the law again.
The Enquirer's story about the Bezos affair, including intimate text messages sent by Mr. Bezos and photographs of the couple on the terrace of what the tabloid described as Ms. Sanchez's "love nest," upset the company's majority investors, according to two people with knowledge of American Media.
In his Medium post, Mr. Bezos revealed that his team had received threatening emails from American Media's chief content officer, Dylan Howard, that described revealing photos of Mr. Bezos that the tabloid had yet to publish.
In the letter from Mr. Howard and a second letter from an American Media lawyer that Mr. Bezos included in his account, the company said that it would not publish the compromising selfies if Mr. Bezos publicly stated that he did not believe that the tabloid publisher was politically motivated in publishing the exposé.
Mr. Bezos called the offer "extortion and blackmail" in his Medium post. He added that he was motivated "to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out," and Mr. de Becker went to work.
The evidence in the resulting report shows evidence of Saudi intrusions into his iPhone X. But a direct link from the kingdom to the tabloid tale remains elusive.

Re "Cuts to Food Stamps Squeeze West Virginia's Poor" (front page, Jan. 14):
In the world's richest country and one in which we throw away a distressingly large amount of our food, why should we deny government help to the hungry?
Even if they are able-bodied, let's feed them, not punish them. A punitive attitude toward those who need food is nothing to take pride in.

Texto completo: Newly restored, his first feature, "Guns of the Trees" documents the city's bohemian youth with gloom and gusto.
The threatening atom bomb casts a baleful shadow over the serious young people who inhabit "Guns of the Trees," the first feature made by the hugely influential filmmaker and activist Jonas Mekas. Shot in and around New York in the early 1960s, the 75-minute, black-and-white movie projects a sense of beatnik doom as evocative as it is dated.
In notes distributed at the movie's premiere, Mekas, who died last year at 96, called it his "meditation on love and death in a period of darkness," and "Guns" is a period piece. That it is showing, at Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan through Jan. 29, in a 35-millimeter restoration print made from the original negative, burnishes its anachronistic quality.
When "Guns" opened commercially in February 1964, two-and-a-half years after its first screenings, The New York Times critic Eugene Archer cautiously noted that the movie "has been sparking controversies among observers of its genre at private screenings here and abroad" and called it "one of the farthest out of far-out films."
Essentially, the movie concerns two couples. One pair Barbara and Gregory (Frances Stillman and the filmmaker's brother Adolfas Mekas) is white and gloomy. The other Argus and Ben (named for their actors, Argus Spear Juillard and Ben Carruthers, a principal in John Cassavetes's "Shadows") is black and life-affirming.
Argus is happily pregnant. Barbara has committed suicide, and thus the movie is largely a flashback. Militantly sullen, Barbara rails against the ugliness of the world and the spirit of autumn while her lover, the black-clad Gregory, tries to figure the meaning of existence. Meanwhile Argus and Ben frisk through various locations and make love in what looks like a cold-water loft.
The action is punctuated with blasts of high-frequency noise and white light and underscored by Allen Ginsberg reciting "Sunflower Sutra" and intermittent folk songs provided by Sara Wiley, Caither Wiley, and Tom Sankey (who three years later composed the pioneering Off Off Broadway folk-rock musical "The Golden Screw"). To add to the existential drama, two satirical mimes occasionally appear, and a monk (Frank Kuenstler) wanders through the proceedings searching for his lost faith.
Even Ben has a crisis, ranting about strontium 90 in the rain and Caryl Chessman in the gas chamber. And he exclaims, "Nixon (Nixon!) running for president." While these topical references might require footnotes, the interpolated footage of peace marches, the lashing the city received from Hurricane Donna and the so-called beatnik riot of April 1961, when folk singers battled police in Washington Square, speak for themselves. The shots of despoiled industrial landscapes in and around New York are mutely eloquent.
Mekas never made another dramatic movie, yet "Guns of the Trees" was key to his development as a filmmaker. It anticipates his diary films in its use of a poetic voice-over, focus on the artist's friends and interest in recording their scene. Indeed, while the movie's over-articulated angst may be tiresome, one need only look through the two-dimensional drama to see a raw and heartfelt document, a homage to a sooty, ungentrified New York and the hard rain falling on its earnest bohemian inhabitants.

Texto completo: A former executive editor of The Times prefers not to shout over his entree. Also: Cuts to food stamps; master organizers.
To the Editor:
Re "Noisy Restaurant? What's the Problem?," by Pete Wells (Critic's Notebook, Jan. 22):
I am the benighted editor who many years ago asked The Times's food critics to assess, among other things, the noise level in reviewed restaurants.
I discovered that I and a few others past middle age no longer enjoyed shouting over their entree and that conversation, and some distance from the conversation at neighboring tables, contributed mightily to the enjoyment of the finest dishes.
That your current critic prefers distracting noise and digests better in a din is understandable; he does not pay for his nightly ventures out and in fact is paid for obsessive concentration on the dishes before him. He may be so preoccupied that it never occurs to him that some folks incur the cost of restaurants because they want to savor the chatter of friends and hear the sound of breaking bread.
A good critic is also a reporter, and he is not required to be deaf to the concerns of other diners.

To the Editor:
Re "Robert Caro's Papers Find a Home" (Arts pages, Jan. 9):
The acquisition of the biographer Robert Caro's papers by the New-York Historical Society is like the acquisition of Julia Child's kitchen by the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Julia had outlines of her pots and pans on the wall, and Mr. Caro has outlines of his book chapters in his office, presumably to be included in the historical society's exhibition.
Both people demonstrated their organizational skills with precision. My motto: Eat first, then read.

Texto completo: PRIVACY DOOMSAYERS have always said the failure to regulate surveillance technology would result in the end of anonymity. But we didn't realize doom might come this soon.
The New York Times reports on a facial recognition tool that hasn't made the news before " because it's not from a Silicon Valley luminary with a big public footprint, such as Amazon or Google, but rather a tiny and secretive start-up called Clearview AI whose impact is as high as its profile is low. More than 600-law enforcement agencies use the company's tool, which depends on a database of more than 3-billion images gathered from millions of websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube.
The facial recognition searches that authorities conduct today are usually restricted to mug shots or driver's license photos, and there are serious concerns even about those. Now, that database has expanded exponentially, and it could envelop any American whose face has ever appeared publicly on the Internet. Clearview's results return not only names but also phone numbers, addresses and more. The risks are familiar but amplified many times over.
There's the possibility of false matches, especially because Clearview's algorithm has never been tested by an outside authority. There's the risk of a hack exposing a trove of human beings converted into identifiable lines of code. And, of course, there's the risk of abuse " police at a protest, for example, training the tool on every participant, or a private buyer using it to stalk an ex-lover.
Clearview has pitched its product to entities with less credibility than law enforcement, including a professed 'pro-white' Republican congressional candidate for 'extreme opposition research.' The company can even monitor clients' searches, and evidently it does: How else did Clearview know to flag the Times reporter's face and display no matches after she asked officers to run her through the app? (A 'software bug,' the founder replied.)
The case underscores with greater vigor than ever the need for restrictions on facial recognition technology. But putting limits on what the police or private businesses can do with a tool such as Clearview's won't stop bad actors from breaking them. There also need to be limits on whether a tool such as Clearview's can exist in this country in the first place.
Top platforms' policies generally prohibit the sort of data-scraping Clearview has engaged in, but it's difficult for a company to protect information that's on the open Web. Courts have also ruled against platforms when they have tried to go after scrapers under existing copyright or computer fraud law " and understandably, as too-onerous restrictions could hurt journalists and public-interest groups.
Privacy legislation is a more promising area for action, to prevent third parties including Clearview from assembling databases such as these in the first place, whether they're filled with faces or location records or credit scores. That will take exactly the robust federal framework Congress has so far failed to provide, and a government that's ready to enforce it.

Texto completo: Jim Lehrer, an understated television newscaster who co-founded what is now 'The PBS NewsHour,' which he anchored for 36 years, and who was dubbed the 'dean of moderators' for presiding over 12 presidential debates, died Jan. 23 at his home in Washington. He was 85.
PBS announced his death but did not provide further details. He had a heart attack in 1983 and heart valve surgery in 2008.
Mr. Lehrer began his career as a newspaper reporter in Texas before switching to broadcast journalism in the early 1970s. He came to Washington in 1972, quitting his first job over budget cuts at the fledgling Public Broadcasting Service.
After moving to WETA-TV, based in Arlington, Va., he began covering the Watergate hearings in 1973 with fellow reporter Robert MacNeil.
In 1975, they teamed up to launch 'The MacNeil/Lehrer Report,' a 30-minute broadcast that initially focused on a single topic each night.
The two anchors offered contrasting styles: The Canadian-born MacNeil, a onetime correspondent with NBC and BBC, had an air of urbanity, with a distinguished Mid-Atlantic accent. Mr. Lehrer, by contrast, had a windblown voice with echoes of his Kansas and Texas upbringing, and he never lost the laconic, slightly rumpled manner of the newspaper city editor he had once been.
'He did a great deal to improve my interview style,' MacNeil said of Mr. Lehrer in 1986. 'I painfully learned from Lehrer that some of the most effective questions are 'Why?,' 'I don't understand,' and 'Could you say that again?' His informality has eased me up a lot.'
'MacNeil/Lehrer' presented a sober approach to the news, often with experts debating complex issues in great detail. MacNeil and Mr. Lehrer were probing without being provocative. They were sometimes criticized for being bland.
'Admirers of 'The MacNeil/Lehrer Report' " and there are many of them,' political commentator Alexander Cockburn wrote in Harper's Magazine in 1982, 'often talk about it in terms normally reserved for unpalatable but nutritious breakfast foods: unalluring, perhaps, to the frivolous new consumer, but packed full of fiber.'
The program drew a loyal audience of several million viewers a week, often by focusing on stories that the commercial networks did not cover with as much depth, including international relations, economics, science and the fine arts.
The program grew to a full hour in 1983, making the renamed 'The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour' the first nightly hour-long newscast on any U.S. network. The format changed to cover a wider range of stories, but with no commercials to interrupt the broadcast, MacNeil and Mr. Lehrer could deliver a solid 55 minutes of news each night.
'We started off saying to ourselves 10 years ago that it is fairly easy to produce heat, but very tough to produce light,' Mr. Lehrer told The Washington Post in 1985. 'Sometimes we are criticized for . . . taking the passion out of issues. But if I am going to fail, I would rather do it that way.'
The journalists on 'MacNeil/Lehrer' and its later incarnations included, at various times, such distinguished names as Roger Mudd, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, foreign correspondent Elizabeth Farnsworth, Ray Suarez, Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff, the current host of 'The PBS NewsHour.'
When MacNeil retired in 1995, the program was renamed 'The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.' By then, Mr. Lehrer was already well established as a moderator of political debates, and between 1988 and 2012, he was the lead or only questioner at a dozen presidential debates.
He had long since adopted a policy of strict political neutrality and had not voted since 1964.
'It's not a badge of anything. It's just a personal idiosyncrasy,' he told The Post in 2000. 'Any outside thing that gets in the way " 'Hey, do I like this guy or not? Do I think he's right or not?' " is two, three, four, 10, 100 things I don't need when I'm doing the job.'
His avuncular, nonconfrontational style won both admirers and detractors.
'He's followed the cardinal rule of the moderator: Nobody's tuning in to see or hear you,' ABC journalist Hal Bruno told The Post in 1996.
Media critic Jack Shafer, however, described Mr. Lehrer in a 2000 interview with The Post as 'so vacant, so impassive that you can end up mapping onto him anything you want. . . . Fairness is overrated if fairness means challenging nobody.'
Mr. Lehrer was undeterred.
'If somebody wants to be entertained, they ought to go to the circus,' he told the New York Times in 2000. 'My job in moderating a debate is different than if I were interviewing these men. It is their job to debate. It is not my job to debate. It is my job to facilitate their exchanges.'
James Charles Lehrer was born May 19, 1934, in Wichita to a working-class but entrepreneurial family. His father worked for the Santa Fe Trailways bus company and, after Marine Corps service in World War II, created the Kansas Central Lines, with three buses. The business went bankrupt after a year, but young Jim Lehrer would retain a lifelong fascination with bus travel.
The Lehrers moved to Texas, settling in San Antonio.
Inspired by the writing of Ernie Pyle and other World War II correspondents, Mr. Lehrer worked at his high school newspaper and studied journalism at the University of Missouri, from which he graduated in 1956.
After three years in the Marine Corps, he began working at the Dallas Morning News in 1959, drawing attention for his investigations of the John Birch Society and other conspiracy-minded groups.
He quit the paper over a dispute with the publisher and moved to the rival Dallas Times Herald, where he became a columnist and city editor. He also began writing fiction, publishing the novel 'Viva Max!,' about a Mexican general's quixotic attempt to recapture the Alamo, in 1966. It was turned into a 1969 movie starring Peter Ustinov and Jonathan Winters.
In 1970, he began working at a public television station in Dallas before moving to Washington. He retired from 'The PBS NewsHour' in 2011.
After a heart attack in 1983, Mr. Lehrer gave up smoking, altered his diet and became devoted to a daily noontime nap.
He also renewed his commitment to writing, publishing more than 20 novels and several plays and memoirs. Several of his novels were mysteries, and others featured a character named One-Eyed Mack, who wore an eye patch and went from being a Gulf Coast pirate to being elected lieutenant governor of Oklahoma.
One of his later books, 'Tension City' " a phrase drawn from President George H.W. Bush " chronicled Mr. Lehrer's experiences as a moderator of presidential debates.
He called himself 'truly a written-word person' in a 1995 interview with The Post. 'That's what got me into this business in the first place. The way you arrange words has always been the driving force in my life, professionally.
Survivors include his wife since 1960, the former Kate Staples, a novelist; three daughters; and six grandchildren.
Mr. Lehrer decorated his home and office with what he called 'the finest collection of bus depot signs in America' and kept a working commercial bus at his weekend farm in West Virginia.
Over the years, he repeatedly turned down lucrative offers to join other networks, preferring the lower profile of PBS. He was praised by many colleagues for his uncompromising sense of journalistic integrity.
'I have an old-fashioned view that news is not a commodity,' Mr. Lehrer told the American Journalism Review in 2001. 'News is information that's required in a democratic society, and Thomas Jefferson said a democracy is dependent on an informed citizenry. That sounds corny, but I don't care whether it sounds corny or not. It's the truth.'

Texto completo: Arriving each morning at 1-a.m., dressed in a skirt and heels and ready for work in the rough-and-tumble of the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, Frieda Caplan stood out " an exotic exception, much like the wares she began selling there in 1962.
Among the many merchants peddling tomatoes, onions and other mainstays of the traditional American dinner table, Mrs. Cap lan was for many years the lone woman. The staples of her stand were not staples at all. Rather, she dealt in rarities " the kiwi when the furry brown fruit was known as a Chinese gooseberry, alfalfa sprouts before they were a favorite of health-food nuts, and avocados before the brunch crowd began eating them on toast.
With her ever-evolving array of offerings, which she sold to specialty shops as well as to chains including Safeway, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Costco, Mrs. Cap lan was credited with whetting the American appetite for dozens of once-rare fruits and vegetables that today are commonplace in groceries, kitchens and restaurants.
Mrs. Caplan " known to admirers as the 'Kiwi Queen' for her role in popularizing the fruit in the United States " died Jan. 18 at her home in Los Alamitos, Calif. She was 96. Her daughter Karen Caplan, the president and chief executive of Frieda's Specialty Produce, which is based in Los Alamitos, confirmed her mother's death but did not cite a specific cause.
Mrs. Caplan had no experience in produce sales when she entered the trade in the 1950s as a bookkeeper for the wholesale operation run by her husband's aunt and uncle. She had recently given birth to Karen, her first daughter, and was seeking work that would provide the flexibility necessary to nurse the baby. The early-morning hours of the wholesale fruit-and-vegetable trade suited her perfectly.
As Mrs. Caplan told the story, she was managing the stand while the owners were on vacation when a client placed a request for a quantity of mushrooms in the neighborhood of 500 pounds. Frantically searching for a supplier able to satisfy such a large order, Mrs. Caplan personally drove to a mushroom farm to procure them.
Her spunk and grit so impressed the wholesale market landlords that they invited her to open her own stand. She did, in 1962, and it grew into the modern-day company with annual sales of $60 million, according to Karen Caplan.
When she was starting out, mushrooms and pineapple were considered exotic.
'We didn't have innovative produce departments,' she told the New York Times in 1985. 'The mind-set of produce merchandisers was potatoes, onions, grapefruit and apples. It was a matter of finding people who were innovative and progressive and getting them together with people who had something to offer.'
Chief among them was Mrs. Caplan, and chief among her early successes was the kiwifruit " according to a profile of Mrs. Caplan published last year in The Washington Post, 'the first commercial fruit . . . introduced to the United States since the banana in the 1880s.'
When a client first requested the Chinese gooseberry, six months went by before she could locate one, Mrs. Caplan told the Los Angeles Times. In an attempt to increase sales, she marketed the item as kiwifruit " a name suggested by a colleague in the supply chain because the fruit, which was grown in New Zealand, looked like the local kiwi bird.
The fruit took time to catch on " 18 years, by Mrs. Caplan's count " but today it is scarcely harder to find than a peach or pear. The New York Times once dubbed the kiwi 'the Horatio Alger of exotic fruit.'
Other fruits reportedly introduced or popularized by Mrs. Caplan included spaghetti squash, sugar snap peas, shiitake mushrooms, shallots, habanero peppers, sunchokes, purple potatoes, Meyer lemons, mangoes, passion fruit and star fruit.
'I couldn't compete with all the boys on the big items,' Mrs. Caplan told the Pasadena (Calif.) Star-News in 2003, 'so I built the business selling things that were different.'
She further distinguished herself from other vendors by packaging and labeling her more unusual offerings, a godsend to head-scratching grocery store clerks as well as to consumers who might not know how to serve jicama, or how to slice into a kiwano. (Late-night television host David Letterman, who once featured Mrs. Caplan on his show, jokingly pronounced the latter fruit, also know as the horned melon, as 'd--- near inedible.') Customers were invited to send away to Frieda's for recipes; everyone, she said, received a reply.
Mrs. Caplan stopped selling items when they became standard fare; by then, she reasoned, her work was done. She once received an industry award honoring the Produce Man of the Year. She declined to accept it until it was renamed the Produce Marketer of the Year.
Frieda Rapoport, a daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia, was born in Los Angeles on Aug. 10, 1923. Her father was a pattern-cutter for a clothing factory, and her mother was a homemaker. She once recalled to USA Today that when she brought home $2 in earnings from her after-school job at a five-and-dime store, her mother exclaimed, 'How wonderful. You'll never be dependent on a man again.'
She studied political science at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she was active in student government and graduated in 1945. In 1951, she married Alfred Caplan, a labor relations consultant. He died in 1998.
As she was growing her business, Mrs. Caplan once told the Orange County Register, she slept four hours a night. 'The opportunity to introduce people to new fruits and vegetables was very exciting,' she said. One fruit she could not enjoy was the kiwi; she was allergic to it.
She was featured in the 2015 documentary 'Fear No Fruit,' by filmmaker Mark Brian Smith, and said that she 'never had a problem with the men on the market, at all.'
'Once they got over the fact that I was a woman and they learned they could make money with the items I was selling,' she said, 'I had no problems.'
Mrs. Caplan continued reporting to work into her 90s, long after she sold her business to her daughters in 1990. In addition to her daughter Karen, of Seal Beach, Calif., survivors include another daughter, Jackie Caplan Wiggins of Long Beach, Calif., who is the company's chief operating officer; and four grandchildren.
For all her success stemming from her entrepreneurial spirit, Mrs. Caplan sought to give credit where she thought credit due, and that was to the fruits and vegetables she sold.
'There have always been exotic food items,' she told the Los Angeles Times in 1972. 'We just showcased them, dressed them up and sold them.'

Portuguese Banker Named in Angola Fraud Case Is Found Dead; Prosecutors called him a suspect in probe of alleged money laundering by ex-president's daughter

Texto completo: A Portuguese banker was found dead after being identified as a suspect in a fraud case against Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's former president.
Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, 45 years old, apparently hanged himself and had attempted suicide earlier this month, Lisbon police said. His death came after Angola prosecutors identified him Wednesday at a press conference in Luanda, the African nation's capital, as a suspect in a wide-ranging investigation of alleged money laundering and fraud by Ms. dos Santos.
She and three business associates were also named suspects.
Mr. Ribeiro da Cunha was a private-banking director at EuroBic, a Portuguese bank that Ms. dos Santos partly owns, according to press reports in Portugal. His body was discovered Wednesday in a garage in an upscale Lisbon neighborhood, police said in a statement Thursday. Representatives for EuroBic didn't respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors in Angola allege that Ms. dos Santos and others carried out transactions with government-owned companies that resulted in a $1.14 billion loss for the state. In December, an Angola court froze her assets in the country, according to a court order reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The allegations are "completely unfounded," Ms. dos Santos said earlier this week in a statement.
"I have always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators," she said. "I am ready to fight through the international courts to defend my good name."
On Sunday, news outlets including the New York Times and BBC began a series of reports about Ms. dos Santos's business empire, based on what they said were more than 700,000 leaked documents. The reports have focused on how Ms. dos Santos allegedly got preferential access when her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, was president to invest in land, oil, diamond and telecommunications deals and then shielded her riches with assistance from consulting firms, law firms and Portuguese banks. Forbes estimates her wealth at $2.1 billion.
At EuroBic, Mr. Ribeiro da Cunha allegedly approved $58 million in payments from the Angola state oil company, Sonangol, to companies linked to Ms. dos Santos in November 2017, according to a report by Quartz, citing leaked documents and bank statements. That month, Ms. dos Santos was dismissed as Sonangol's chief executive.
Ms. dos Santos's father was president of Angola for 38 years until September 2017. His successor, João Lourenço, launched an anticorruption drive, and Angola prosecutors have also investigated other dos Santos family members and their associates.
On Wednesday, EuroBic said Ms. dos Santos would sell her stake in the bank "in the very short term." Earlier this week, it said it would terminate commercial relationships with entities controlled by Ms. dos Santos and her close associates and would investigate earlier transactions.
Ms. dos Santos, 46, was born in the Soviet Union, where her father was studying engineering. She earned her degree in the same field at King's College London and returned to Angola in the early 1990s during a lull in the country's civil war.
In 2016, the Journal reported that some members of the European Parliament had raised questions about the purchase of a majority stake in a company in Portugal, where Ms. dos Santos has many investments. They suspected that the Angolan state might have indirectly financed major acquisitions for Ms. dos Santos, according to a letter they sent to the European Commission.
Ms. dos Santos denied the allegation, telling the Journal that she started Miami Beach, now one of Luanda's most expensive nightclubs, with some savings. Her business empire grew from there.

Texto completo: The New York Times basically pioneered the opinion section as we know it today, but plenty of newspapers and publications have their own thoughts about opinion writing. Below, a handful of quotes from a number of key players in Pennsylvania and the U.S.
"THE PURPOSE of the Op. Ed. page is neither to reinforce nor to counterbalance The Times's own editorial position. The objective is rather to afford greater opportunity for exploration of issues and presentation of new insights and new ideas by writers and thinkers who have no institutional connection with The Times and whose views will very frequently be completely divergent from our own." - The New York Times statement on newly minted Opinion section, 1970
"We've retained the ambition to have a really wide range of voices there, to create an environment of collegial combat among different points of view dealing with consequential questions. The goal is to supply readers with a steady stream of big ideas and provocative arguments, and to entertain them. It should be an exciting experience and often a challenging one." - James Bennett, current New York Times editorial page editor, 2017
"The world today is awash in opinion. ... No one expects to see just one opinion on a subject. Op-Ed writers express their own points of view, which are not necessarily consistent with those of the paper's editorials. We publish authors who will challenge, provoke and even affirm the wide range of views held by our readers." - The Wall Street Journal, opinion.wsj.com
"It's all about conversations. Readers having conversations with their neighbors. Editorial writers having conversations with their readers. A newspaper having conversations with the community." - Tom Waseleski, Pittsburgh PostGazette, "Inside the Opinion Pages"
"The goal of the opinion pages is to provide a platform for a variety of voices and viewpoints - including our audience and civic leaders. ... Readers should feel like they can find pieces that affirm as well as challenge their points of view. The value of this is that it allows readers to gain a deeper and richer understanding of how the news impacts people's daily lives and to explore viewpoints that they might not have previously considered." - Erica Palan, deputy opinion editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, in an interview with Tom Gralish
"An Op-Ed by a Republican criticizing the Democrats, or vice versa, is easy to come by and not that interesting. But a Democrat who takes issue with his or her party, or a Republican who does that, is more valuable." - Andrew Rosenthal, former editorial page editor, The New York Times
"We are looking for: Insightful commentary and opinion on the issues of the day; well-written essays, both weighty and whimsical; well-reasoned, expert analysis. We are not looking for: ax-grinding, spleen-venting tirades; direct rebuttals of or responses to news stories or other op-ed articles; self-serving advocacy pieces." - Chicago Tribune, op-ed submission guidelines
"The separation of news columns from the editorial pages is solemn and complete. This separation is intended to serve the reader, who is entitled to the facts in the news columns and to opinions on the editorial and op-ed' pages. But nothing in this separation of functions is intended to eliminate from the news columns honest, in-depth reporting, or analysis or commentary when plainly labeled." - The Washington Post, "Policies and Standards" *

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL NEWS FOR SAN FRANCISCO
IN BROWN TYPE
Janet Tom greeted me at the underground parking lot of the San Francisco Public Library, a slight woman with short cropped hair, a concerned look and refreshing enthusiasm. As we walked to her office, I congratulated her on receiving the 2019 "I Love My Librarian" award, given to the 10 best librarians in the country every year, sponsored by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the New York Public Library and the New York Times.
She thanked me, "How thrilling it was to have my name in the New York Times!" she remarked, with a wide smile.
Tom, of Asian origin, grew up in North Beach, one of six children. Her parents had an arranged marriage. Tom's father, who was living in America at the time, made a quick decision by selecting one of the two pictures of women presented to him. He later took a ship to Guangzhou and got married, but had to leave his bride behind because of the Chinese Exclusion Act. So, the newlyweds communicated through letters in Chinese. "Dad was a soldier, and it was only after the War Brides Act in 1945 that my mother came to join him in America," Tom said.
Her dad was a bookkeeper who became a small business owner after he bought E & M Market - a mom and pop store on Valencia. She remembers working at the store after school. "We ate a lot of candy," she said smiling impishly, recalling how the candy was placed on the counter within reach of young hands.
After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in sociology and a minor in journalism in 1973, Tom worked at local radio and television stations in the Bay Area before moving to New York to work on Broadway productions including West Side Waltz with Katharine Hepburn. But soon she came to the realization that she didn't like the "commercial" aspect of her job. "I was really a community gal," she said chuckling softly.
Tom went on to get a degree in library science in 1999 and began her career as a librarian. She did a stint at Queens Public Library before coming back to San Francisco.
Sure, there's more people, more cars, and the homeless and the new wealthy are more visible, but San Francisco is still a great place to live with a "terrific, thriving performing arts scene, from the largest (SF Opera, SF Ballet, SF Symphony) to the smallest dance, theatre and music companies," Tom remarked.
She indulges her love for community by spending most other free time volunteering as an usher for local productions. "I started 19 years ago and I'm still doing it."
"It's not necessary to be married to be a whole person," Tom said, explaining her decision to remain single, using an apt metaphor to clarify: "You have all these books on the shelf, and you don't have room to put anything in between," referring to her life rich with work, friends, family and activities.
Tom became a reference librarian at City College of San Francisco in 2001 and at the San Francisco Public Library in 2002. The most interesting aspect of working in a library is the "human connection," said Tom. "[W]hen a person comes to the Reference Desk to ask a question, look for a book, ask for recommendations for what to read about a subject they are interested in. I like helping people find things and it's quite gratifying when they get something and are excited and happy about it." At the library she is responsible for making recommendations on books to buy on the subjects that she manages - health and wellness - and these include books on holistic health, aromatherapy, healthy diets, medical exam books, vegetarianism and even "craniosacral therapy." She remembers recently ordering Dr. Michael Greger's books, "How Not to Diet," and "How Not to Die," both bestsellers that cut across her abiding interests on healthy living and healthy dying.
It's fascinating to observe how the topic of dying animates Tom. One of the reasons she was nominated for the "I Love My Librarian" award was for the Death and Dying discussion series that she curated. The topics in the series ranged from the different traditions and rituals surrounding death and grieving to "How to Die" and "What Happens to My Body When I Die?"
"I think it would be an easier process if we knew what to do," she explained the rationale behind the series. Tom, who is in her late sixties, said that she'd like her body to be used for science or to have a green burial, one that emphasizes environmental sustainability by using biodegradable materials, and a more cost-effective alternative to traditional burials. "My wish is to have my close friends and family around me. I would like to have some music, perhaps some Hildegard. I would like to know that I lived a good life," she said, ending her death musings with her hope that she died "making the world a little tiny bit better."
Her zest for life is evident in the observations Tom makes and on the reactions she elicits. "I see small acts of kindness all the time, on the Muni, on the street, in shops, in public places," she wrote in an email to me. As we walked around the library I observed how friendly she was with colleagues and patrons, eager to introduce me to those she knew. Goodwill appears to be her stock-in-trade. As Sheila Malkind, the director of the Legacy film festival on aging said of Tom, "Isn't she wonderful? Creative, intense, caring, and indefatigable!"

Texto completo: Headnote OPINION
Black folk have a real dilemma building up over the 2020 elections like thunderclouds over the Midwestern plains.
There is no question that we need to resist the re-election of Donald Trump with every fiber of our beings. Allowing him another four years to try to destroy every hard-fought gain won over the past 70 years will pose a dangerous threat to lives and our liberty. Without question, Trump most go.
The question then becomes, "After Trump, then what?"
Some people suggest that we replace Trump with Joe Biden. After all, he was Obama's vice president. But the problem is that Joe Biden is Joe Biden, not Barack Obama. Biden created so many problems for the African American community during his political career that should disqualify him from serious consideration by black voters.
During the 1970s, Biden was chums with segregationists, opposed busing to integrate schools and voted to bar the use of federal funding for abortions. In the 1990s, his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings was abhorrent, and he drafted the 1994 crime bill that has resulted in the U.S. having the world's highest incarceration rate.
Biden wants us to believe that his days of racially toxic behavior are behind him, but the words that come out of his mouth are evidence that he is still a danger to African Americans.
During one of the presidential debates in September, Biden claimed one reason for the achievement gap between white and black students is the so called "word gap" between them. This notion of a word gap is a discredited theory based on a flawed 1990s study claiming that poor children hear 30 million fewer words than their middle-class counterparts during the early years of life. He suggested that the achievement gap can be fixed if black parents "make sure the record player is on at night" so their "kids hear words."
The 30-million-word gap theory rose to prominence during the 1980s due to inappropriate testing and research. It also appears that research was underpinned with implicit racism. This theory was clearly debunked by 2018 using more efficient testing and research and a contextual approach to the issue. As early as 1972, experts were exposing flaws in the word gap theory. In a June 1972 Atlantic article titled "Academic Ignorance and black Intelligence," linguist William Labov wrote: "Our work in the speech community makes it painfully obvious that in many ways working-class speakers are more effective narrators, reasoners, and debaters than many middle-class speakers..."
Labov went on to say about the word gap:
"Unfortunately, these notions are based upon the work of educational psychologists who know very little about language and even less about black children. The concept of verbal deprivation has no basis in social reality; in fact, black children in the urban ghettos receive a great deal of verbal stimulation, hear more well-formed sentences than middle-class children, and participate fully in a highly verbal culture; they have the same basic vocabulary, possess the same capacity for conceptual learning, and use the same logic as anyone else who learns to speak and understand English."
Forty-seven years after Labov's Atlantic article, Biden still does not have a clue.
When questioned about these outdated beliefs during a New York Times editorial board interview in December, Biden attempted to support his position by claiming that black parents are reluctant to participate in the education of their children because of their embarrassment over the lack of their own education and their inability to speak well.
Think about this craziness when you consider placing Joe Biden in the White House.
In 2012, the Survey Research Institute at the University of Houston conducted interviews of 1,200 individuals and concluded that African Americans are the most likely demographic to value post-secondary education.
Apparently, it did not occur to Biden that racism and disparities in resources have a hand in the achievement gap. But he wants a job where he will decide how the nation's resources will be used to overcome the effects of racism. Would there be a danger of our tax dollars spent to distribute voice recordings because of a debunked and racist theory? We need a president who has a better understanding, not only of the causes of racially motivated educational disparities, but all the disparities in this country caused by bigotry and ignorance.
Trump is a cancer on democracy. But can't we do better than Joe Biden?

Texto completo: Headnote Neurodivergent actors take the stage at ArtsEmerson
This Thursday, Jan. 23, five actors with intellectual disabilities will take the stage in Back to Back Theatre's "The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes" at ArtsEmerson. In 70 minutes, the powerful performance vacillates from hilarious to heart-wrenching to deeply intellectual and back again.
Running through Jan. 26, the show follows a group of activists holding a public meeting. They touch on topics as far and wide as factory farming, human rights and the social impact of automation. In a world where those with intellectual disabilities are considered less able than others, how will that status shift when artificial intelligence becomes more able than every person?
"The show is incredibly entertaining and funny. Which sounds perhaps hard to believe, given the description of it," says Bruce Gladwin, artistic director of Back to Back Theatre. "Our objective is to make great art, and advocacy is a kind of byproduct of that. Our objective is to engage and hold the audience and also to deliver a kind of theatrical experience that they've never seen before."
Back to Back Theatre routinely has a cast of actors with intellectual disabilities. But this particular performance was inspired by a New York Times story from 2013 wherein 39 men with intellectual disabilities were found to have been effectively enslaved in a turkey processing plant in fowa. Though significant advancements have been made for the rights of differently abled people, abuse remains a constant problem. From Back to Back's discussion of this incident grew "The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes."
Scott Price, one of the show's performers, says he thinks the biggest misconception about those with disabilities is that their voices are not a part of the cultural conversation. "I think people are so scared of the not-normal," says Price. "I want them to hear our story and see we're human as well. We're human beings just like you."
"The Shadow" serves to normalize people with disabilities as actors on stage, a position into which they are not traditionally welcomed. The show also allows viewers a better understanding of the needs and challenges facing differently abled people, and further, to consider how these standards may be applied to themselves when artificial intelligence is the reigning thought standard. "Get used to having a label around your neck," says Simon Laherty in the show. "You will be surrounded by low expectations." Who's to say there's more than a twist of fate between the general populace and the judgments people with disabilities already live with?
Sidebar I think people are so scared of the not-normal. I want them to hear our story and see we're human as well. We're human beings just like you."

HYPOCRISY RUNS AMOK IN BASEBALL HALL BALLOTING

Texto completo: Integrity, my Astro.
This will be the last time I write about Baseball's Hall of Farce, about how sports writers invoke the "integrity" clause - reportedly written into the ballot by a segregationist - in order to keep two of the greatest players of all time locked out of a museum that already includes, as the New York Times' Bill Pennington put it, "multiple virulent racists, drunks, cheats, brawlers, drug users and at least one acknowledged sex addict."
If the idea is to keep the bad guys out, it's a little late.
Cheating is as rampant as it ever was, as rampant as it always will be, whether it's the 1951 New York Giants using an elaborate sign-stealing system, or the 2017 Houston Asterisks doing the same. Whether it's players pumping amphetamines or anabolic steroids - or who knows what these days?- to gain an edge.
But you go, sports writers. Cast aside Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens while Bumblin' Bud Selig, who kept one eye closed and both ears covered as artificially jacked-up sluggers saved his sport, slides in (thanks to a vote that included current Hall of Famers, executives and media members).
This much is clear: Bonds and Clemens missed the cut again Tuesday and have no momentum toward gaining the necessary 75% of the vote.
Harold Baines is in. Barry Bonds is out.
ESPN's David Schoenfield: "The totals from the publicly revealed ballots - which are almost all from active baseball writers - are much more favorable to Bonds and Clemens [both had more than 70% on the public ballots] than the private voters, who tend to be the retired writers or football writers who used to cover baseball and the like."
The miracle in all this is that sports writers were somehow designated as arbiters of morality. I happen to know many sports writers - I am one - and I can tell you that not unlike a lot of professions, this one is riddled with hypocrites, weirdos, jerks, jock-sniffers, back-stabbers and narcissists. And that's just the Penguins beat over the past 20 years.
You have some fine people, too, and from afar I've always considered ESPN's Buster Olney one. Here's Olney from 2012 on the wording of the so-called "character" or "integrity" clause, which states voters are to "base their vote not just upon a player's record and ability but also his 'integrity, sportsmanship [and] character.' "
"The truth is that the character clause has been an almost entirely obsolete entity in Hall of Fame voting except when writers wield it like zealous vice principals and pluck one or two decorum violators from a hallway of humanity and assign them detention in baseball purgatory. The wording is believed to have been written by longtime baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The fact that Landis was a segregationist who endeavored to keep blacks out of baseball should have compelled writers to ignore the questions of character and integrity."
It didn't, although legendary baseball writer Peter Gammons is one who finally saw the light two years ago, writing, "The Hall of Fame is the museum of baseball history, hence I am at the point where the best player in the last 40 years [Bonds] and arguably the pitcher ever [Clemens] need to be parts of that museum, with whatever addendum is deemed necessary for their plaques."
It's not like the voters are bathing themselves in glory on other fronts. One decided it would be cool to reject Derek Jeter on Tuesday (at least the other 396 got that one right), and Larry Walker somehow went from receiving 15.5% of the vote in 2016 to getting elected. Did I miss Walker's MVP season of 2018, at age 52? What did he do to change so many minds in four years?
Some voters checked something like 10 boxes on their ballot this year. Why not just go ahead and induct Aki Iwamura and his knee brace while you're at it, guys?
By all means keep Bonds and Clemens on the porch. Because they apparently used steroids during an era in which Jose Canseco estimated up to 85% of all players did the same.
Let's take those two and punish them forever.
I'm sure Kenesaw Mountain Landis would be proud.

Texto completo: The “King of Paranoia Rock” was on to something.
When Rockwell sang Somebody’s Watching Me in 1984, the song became a smash hit, though not everyone could relate to its level of paranoia. Now, we all can.
The FBI and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies in the United States have been using technology that allows them to ascertain your personal information from just a photograph. According to a new report from the New York Times, an app called Clearview AI lets users snap a photo of someone, upload it to the database, and wait for the eerily accurate results.
Once Clearview has your photo, it can find matching images from its database of 3 billion photos, culled from sites such as Facebook, Venmo, and YouTube, and link to wherever those photos originally appeared. That could reveal people’s information, including their names, locations, and more. The system, according to the report, “goes far beyond anything ever constructed by the United States government or Silicon Valley giants.”
Yes, your photos from Facebook really can be used against you.
Luckily, your next-door neighbor can’t up and decide to use the app to start stalking — yet. But Clearview has been employed by more than 600 law enforcement agencies as well as a handful of companies. If you trust the government to use it well, this could sound like a good thing. Federal and state law enforcement officers say they’ve used the app to solve crimes from shoplifting to murder.
But it could easily backfire. Last year, one New York man sued Apple for $1 billion, alleging that its facial recognition technology had led to his wrongful arrest.
As for the risk of misuse, Clearview inventor Hoan Ton-That says, “Our belief is that this is the best use of the technology.”
In short, anti-Big Tech and anti-big government sentiment may unite against an incredibly invasive form of facial recognition technology. When Rockwell sang, “I always feel like somebody's watching me / Who’s playing tricks on me?” he was probably asking a rhetorical question. But now, we have an answer: Big Brother and his tech contractors.

Agudath Israel of America fails New Jersey on measles’ vaccines

Texto completo: (JNS) Victims of the yearlong measles’ outbreak that raged in the United States between September 2018 and September 2019 concentrated in New York were the 1,487 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the highest number of measles cases in America in single year in a generation. This is after the disease was accorded the status of “eliminated” in 2000, thanks to the nation’s decades-old vaccination program resulting in more than 91 percent of young children, ages 19 to 35 months, being protected against measles in 2017.
Not surprisingly, of the 1,163 cases of measles connected with the 2019 outbreaks, only one out of every 10 sufferers had been vaccinated. We also learned that three of every four cases were incubated, eventually becoming manifest in “large and close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities” in New York state and threatening “the ‘eliminated’ status of measles” in America. In New York City, the outbreak was largely confined to the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, home to the Satmar Chassidic sect that views modern culture and Zionism as noxious and inimical to its interests.
Little wonder that just after the height of the outbreak, the New York State legislature passed a law that prohibited parents from citing religious beliefs to exempt their children from the mandatory immunizations required for school. Still, that happened after bipartisan concerns about the potential violation of the constitutional religious freedom protections threatened the bill, which despite vigorous debate, passed in the Assembly and was approved by the Senate.
Just before the bill became law, a crowd of 200 impressionable ultra-Orthodox Jews attended an anti-vaccine “conference” in a Brooklyn haredi wedding hall, where they heard Hillel Handler—the disreputable “kooky anti-vaxxer” rabbi known for his extremism and toxic conspiracy theories—make common cause with a vile but charismatic figure lionized by the wider “anti-vaxx” community just hours before the CDC announced the 2019 measles tally had surpassed 1,000. The receptive audience lapped up the propagandist claim that vaccines cause autism and other diseases (universally discredited by the medical profession). A month earlier, Handler had told the same lies to a similar audience in Monsey, N.Y., the Jewish enclave an hour north of Brooklyn where the recent Hanukkah-party stabbing occurred.
Yet earlier in the year, researchers again proved the absence of any link between the MMR (measles) vaccine and autism in a four-year study of more than 650,000 Danish children, one of the largest ever conducted.
That legislators would invoke First Amendment protections on free speech to defend the willful spreading of lies and misinformation about vaccines in the middle of the largest measles outbreak in a quarter-century is cynical and populist rhetoric at best, and, at worst, immoral and unconscionable behavior. It seems no more worthy of constitutional sanction than shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater.
The suggestion that the law ending “religious” exemptions to vaccination compliance somehow infringes one’s religious freedom—given that no major religion prohibits it—is equally absurd. Even if they did, since when does one’s religious beliefs trump medical advice that urges vaccination not only to protect the individual, but the protection of others? While one is able to keep one’s religious beliefs to oneself, no matter the belief, one cannot keep one’s contagious disease to oneself, no matter the contagion.
As the measles outbreak hit its peak in May, to its great credit Agudath was actively helping officials to promote abatement of new cases by making free measles’ vaccinations available in haredi neighborhoods in Brooklyn. It also lambasted Handler for his hate-filled propaganda and his appearance at the Monsey gathering to denounce vaccination.
With such a pristine record on vaccination, what made Agudath join anti-vaxx activists in their campaign to frustrate New Jersey’s effort to introduce New York State-style legislation—on the dubious claim that it would curtail religious freedom—causing the bill to collapse this past Monday after lawmakers had capitulated to it? Why did Agudath engage in similar action to that taken by the “kooky anti-vaxxer” rabbi, having denounced him for it in Monsey?
Agudath earned itself a good dose of unfavorable reportage in Thursday’s edition of The New York Times, which suggested that, having remained quiet during the breakout of measles emanating from Agudath’s own Brooklyn epicenter, rank opportunism enabled it to summon the courage to speak up after the danger had passed. Worse, it appears to have failed to understand its constituents’ role in the genesis of the outbreak.
While Agudath attempted to justify its concerns in an incoherent argument on its website, the Times made the organization’s position clearer, being that it belatedly decided that the “underlying principle of religious accommodation … was one worth fighting for, in part because there are rare cases in which a rabbi might decide a vaccination was unwarranted.”
Agudath’s moralizing evinces two main problems: First, its decision to adopt a stance on constitutional freedoms has nothing to do with Orthodox Judaism, calling into question the choice to fight when it has no skin in that game. Doing so at a time when its constituents are targets of anti-Semitic violence indicates that it was a serious miscalculation (it has been suggested that they are not unrelated). Second, Agudath must be well aware that no halachic, rabbinic or medical principle confers on rabbis, who are unqualified to render medical opinions, the authority to pass judgment on whether a vaccine is or isn’t warranted.
In their misguided fight for a principle that does not directly affect them, they have helped kill legislation, the effect of which will inevitably cause pain, suffering and perhaps death to others. Agudath Israel of America will rue the day it meddled in the affairs of the state.

Texto completo: (JNS) While there were no U.S. deaths as a result of last week’s Iranian missile attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers, 11 U.S. service members have now been reported as sustaining injuries, according to the Pentagon.
The New York Times reported on Monday that U.S. troops were treated for concussions following the attack. Confirming the report, the U.S. Defense Department said they were Medevaced to Germany this week for treatment.
“As previously stated, while no U.S. service members were killed in the Jan. 8 Iranian attack on Ain Al-Asad air base, several were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed,” said a Defense Department spokesperson on January 16th.
The Iranian attacks on Jan. 8 were retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, six days beforehand.

Texto completo: Every decision is precedent.
That which gets rewarded gets repeated.
Law students should know these basic rules of the legal system. That which has gone before inevitably is used to argue for or against what comes next.
Both rules should be uppermost in senators' minds as they consider the presentations of the House Democrats and President Donald Trump's legal team.
Having reviewed the House managers' trial brief and the one submitted by the president's legal team, I believe anything other than a rapid acquittal will be deeply damaging to the presidency. It will not injure this president at all to have witnesses and weeks and weeks of proceedings. It will damage the presidency.
If the purely partisan and reckless maneuvering of House Democrats receives more than it deserves — rapid disposition with a strong dose of senatorial scorn — future presidents, at least those who face House majorities from the opposite party, can look forward to the impeachification of all political disputes down the road.
The president's lawyers know this is the strongest argument even for senators who most dislike Trump, whether Republican or Democrat. If senators care about the Constitution, they have to think not in terms of the next hundred hours or days but of the next hundred years.
Political combat has been continually escalating, long before Trump became president. But the attempt to "flood the zone" with new charges and witnesses follows by less than two years the outrageous, late-in-the-process attacks on Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the closing days of his confirmation.
I know the pressures from the left wing weigh very heavily on Democratic senators, but some of them need to find the courage to speak about the dangerous precedents that threaten to be created in the next few days. Certainly every Republican senator should do so.
Armed with Footnote 565 of the president's trial brief, senators can quickly dismiss the idea of the necessity of new witnesses. In that footnote are citations to early press accounts of Ukrainian conduct that was indeed interference in our 2016 election (though nothing on the scale of the Russian attempt to sow discord in our politics).
These accounts include stories from Politico, The Financial Times, and The New York Times, and they reveal a predicate for the president's concern over some Ukrainians' conduct in 2016. There is therefore no doubt that a responsible president would request, if not demand, an inquiry by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The second article of impeachment is even more dangerous than the first. It would deprive the executive of its Article II status as a separate but equal branch and would oblige future presidents to yield their rights and privileges no matter how specious the claims against him or her.
The left is full of ominous warnings that history is watching. In fact, it will record only outcomes and brave votes from electorally endangered senators who would rather side with future presidents and the lasting and necessary separation of powers than the fleeting approval of media elites.

Texto completo: Can a woman be president of the United States?
Hell, yes.
I’ve covered the men who run the world my whole life. And there have been a lot of screw-ups, from Vietnam to Watergate to Afghanistan to Iraq to pushing the economy off a cliff. There has also been plenty of creepy behavior, culminating in the news that Donald Trump, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz have joined together in a pervy, hypocritical cabal to argue that Trump did not smirch the Constitution.
So please, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, stop whingeing about sexism and just show how you could wield power like a boss. Ibid: Nancy Pelosi.
Hillary Clinton did not lose because she was a woman. She faced sexism, of course, just as Barack Obama faced racism. She lost because she ran an entitled, joyless, nose-in-the air campaign and because she didn’t emulate her husband’s ethos of campaign till the last dog dies and the last bowling alley closes, and always make it about the voters.
Trump operates from the id, which is fitting because he represents a last-gasp primal scream from working-class Americans threatened by the changes transforming the country. Women are now a majority of the workforce and whites are heading toward a minority status.
Trump’s ascent does not make it harder for women to ascend — just the opposite. Look at the throng of women who were outraged enough about Trump to march and run and get elected in 2018.
Once a woman electrifies Democrats the way JFK, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did, she will win.
Trump is once more doing his part to energize women voters. On Friday, we learned that the president will get help from Starr and Dershowitz for the impeachment trial in the Senate.
The Starr chamber was a shameful period of U.S. history, with the prissy Puritan independent counsel hounding Monica Lewinsky and producing hundreds of pages of panting, bodice-ripping prose that read more like bad erotica than a federal report, rife with lurid passages about breasts, stains and genitalia. The prosecutor who sang hymns when he jogged became fixated on sex in an unhealthy, warped way.
Even Trump was appalled. “Starr’s a freak,” the bloviating builder told me back in 1999. “I bet he’s got something in his closet.” In other interviews, he expressed sympathy for Hillary having to stand by her man when he was “being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko.”
Starr, who once clutched his pearls over Bill Clinton’s sexual hijinks, is now going to bat for President “Access Hollywood.”
By 2016, Starr was being ousted as president of Baptist Baylor University for failing to protect women and looking the other way when football players were accused and sometimes convicted of sexual assaults. In other words, he’s a complete partisan hack who doesn’t give a damn about sexual assault.
And then there’s Dershowitz, whose clients have included such sterling fellows as Jeffrey Epstein, Claus von Bülow, O.J. Simpson and Harvey Weinstein.
Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew’s accuser, has also claimed that she was offered as a teenager to Dershowitz for sex — a contention that Dershowitz has denied in a countersuit.
You can bet that Trump and his buddies will continue to turn out the women’s vote.

Jamie Dimon explains why socialism fails

Texto completo: Jamie Dimon presented a prescient case against socialism, not only as it pertains to emerging sentiment in the Democratic Party, but also to its immediate ramifications abroad.
"I think we ought to educate younger kids — freedom and free enterprise are inextricably linked, they're not different," he said. "I mean, you can't tell people where you can work or how you're going to work, where are you going to — free enterprise was the pursuit of happiness. And, you know, once you have governments taking control of businesses, it ends up in corruption, in Venezuela and — and it rose over time because companies get used for political purposes, not to give you great products and services."
Although Dimon declined to weigh in on the specifics of the 2020 race, Bernie Sanders rightly viewed himself the target of the JPMorgan Chase CEO's warning about the economic system he said would "erode society."Tweet
Note that, contrary to the septuagenarian socialist's assertion, JPMorgan Chase accepted only $25 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds, as mandated by the federal government, and repaid it in full once given the green light by regulators.
Dimon argued that our strong consumer-fueled economy, which he noted would likely improve even further thanks to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the China trade deal, probably grew at half the rate it could have last decade. He blamed bad regulatory, tax, and infrastructure policy. But more alarming to him was the threat posed by increasingly centrally planned economies abroad.
"The only thing I have trepidation about is negative interest rates, QE, and the diversion between stock prices and bond prices and yields and stuff like that," he said. "It’s kind of one of the great experiments of all time, and we still don’t know what the ultimate outcome is. Do you know anybody who has actually bought a negative interest rate bond? The buyers are central banks and insurance companies or index funds or passive funds. I would never buy a negative interest rate bond, unless I was forced. In history, when you see something like that, it doesn’t necessarily end well."
Jurisdictions such as the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank have begun to employ negative interest rates to offset high rates of government spending and stimulate the economy. President Trump has entertained the notion, arguing that negative interest rates give nations an upper hand in currency wars. But Dimon is right to sound the alarm on negative interest rates.
Countries with negative interest rates have tried to game the costs of big government spending by cajoling banks into buying government bonds, creating what Dimon rightly brands a bubble of sovereign debt. The removal of the incentive to invest causes retirement plans to plummet and banks to bust. In countries such as Switzerland, the wealthy have already begun to withdraw from the banking system entirely. Although Sweden, the pioneer of negative interest rates, recently brought its interest rate back up to zero, the ECB has committed to it.
Make no mistake. This is exactly where a President Sanders would want to steer the economy. Although the Vermont senator has remained relatively mum on monetary policy this election cycle, he has stated his support for negative interest rates. He has repeatedly railed against the Federal Reserve for initiating important rate hikes, but most telling was his specific 2015 proposal.
"Since 2008, the Fed has been paying financial institutions interest on excess reserves parked at the central bank — reserves that have grown to an unprecedented $2.4 trillion. That is insane," Sanders wrote in the New York Times. "Instead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that would be used to provide direct loans to small businesses."
Dimon may refuse to say who he thinks should be president, but he's made it clear who shouldn't be.

Texto completo: While President Trump hasn’t made good on his fantastical threat to “open up our libel laws,” several disgruntled, petty politicians from across the political spectrum have taken up the torch.
Yesterday, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard joined the fray with a $50 million lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, who in October 2019 said about the Hawaii Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate: "She's the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far ... Yeah, she's a Russian asset.”
As a First Amendment attorney, I know that Gabbard’s lawsuit is not the craziest defamation case ever brought. It will nonetheless face substantial obstacles as it winds its way through the courts. The entire affair is political and doesn’t belong in the courts anyway.
First, Gabbard will have to prove that Clinton made a false statement of fact, an essential element of any defamation claim. Clinton may successfully argue that the term “Russian asset” is mere rhetorical hyperbole, similar to allegations of terrorism or corruption, which are afforded First Amendment protection due to “the reality that exaggeration and non-literal commentary have become an integral part of social discourse,” as one court explained.
Clinton might also successfully argue that, contrary to Gabbard’s complaint, she did not allege that Gabbard was working under the direction of, or in coordination with, the Russians. Her statement could just as easily be interpreted to mean that Gabbard is simply useful to the Russians. The theory being that if Gabbard divides the Democratic vote, there is a greater likelihood that Trump is reelected. An “asset” is not necessarily a witting accomplice, even if that’s probably the implication.
To be clear, Clinton's claims about Gabbard are completely without evidence. They are unsupported and almost certainly false. But the highest hurdle Gabbard will have to clear is proving “actual malice”: that Clinton made her comment either knowing it was false or having entertained serious doubts as to its veracity.
This high legal standard applied to defamation cases brought by public officials reflects, as the Supreme Court noted in New York Times v. Sullivan, our “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”
Actual malice is a high bar, and it is unlikely that the claim Clinton must have known her statement was false simply because of the government posts she previously held will suffice. A court may well decide that the case is close enough to go to a jury — and with a jury, anything can happen. But I suspect that Gabbard likely doesn’t expect to win.
The point in such political lawsuits is often not to win, but rather to draw publicity — the damages claims in these cases are often so absurd as to beggar belief — and to burden a vocal critic with a cumbersome and expensive lawsuit.
Rep. Devin Nunes is no stranger to these tactics, either. The California Republican has filed a series of lawsuits seeking a whopping $760 million from Twitter and a variety of journalists, news outlets, and, bizarrely, a parody cow social media account, for expression that is in large part clearly protected by the First Amendment.
In a manner that can only be described as brazen and transparent, Nunes has filed these lawsuits in jurisdictions that do not have strong laws providing for prompt dismissal of meritless defamation suits brought to harass defendants for simply exercising their First Amendment rights (known as anti-SLAPP laws). The message is quite clear: If you say something I don’t like, I will make sure that even if you win the lawsuit, it will come at enormous expense to you.
This amounts to little more than an intimidation tactic.
Gabbard and Nunes would have you believe that their lawsuits are aimed at protecting the functioning of our democracy. In reality, it’s quite the opposite.
Chilling debate and curtailing the public’s ability to freely discuss issues pertaining to elected officials and candidates without fear of a ruinous lawsuit is a far worse fate than the risk of false information occasionally gaining traction. The true threat to the functioning of our democracy is the notion that the boundaries of acceptable political discourse should be determined not by the public but rather by a continuous stream of headline-seeking defamation lawsuits.
In their lawsuits, Gabbard and Nunes complain that their fitness to hold office has been unfairly impugned. But it is better to err on the side of free, unfettered debate and be thought by some unfit for office than to file petty, vexatious defamation lawsuits and remove all doubt.

Obituary: Terry Jones, 1942-2020

Texto completo: Terry Jones, the actor, writer, scholar, musician, and comedy legend, died last week at age 77 after a long and devastating battle with dementia.
Jones wasn't a legend in the abstract sense of the word. He, along with Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, and Terry Gilliam, founded Monty Python, a group that, quite frankly, invented British humor. He appeared in the group's television series, co-directed the landmark comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail with Gilliam, and directed the troupe's follow-up films Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life, all of which eventually became cultural monuments.
Jones grew up in the United Kingdom, first Wales and then Surrey, and met some of his Monty Python co-founders while studying at Oxford. He was a scholar, not a class clown, and shortly after Jones's diagnosis with dementia, Palin told media, "The first thing that struck me was what a nice bloke he was. He had no airs and graces. We had a similar idea of what humor could do and where it should go, mainly because we both liked characters. We both appreciated that comedy wasn't just jokes."
The friendship Jones forged with Palin was the foundation for a lifelong partnership. The pair were writing partners for years before creating Monty Python's Flying Circus, a "blend of satire, surrealism and silliness," according to the Houston Chronicle but maybe better described as hilariously and incredibly irreverent.
He was somewhat miffed, though, when the Oxford English Dictionary labeled his brand of humor "Pythonesque," telling the New York Times in 2009, "The one thing we all agreed on, our chief aim, was to be totally unpredictable and never to repeat ourselves," referencing the Monty Python troupe. "We wanted to be unquantifiable. That 'Pythonesque' is now an adjective in the OED means we failed utterly."
Jones often played female characters, "playing a succession of middle-aged battle-axes stomping across the screen in support hose and headscarves," per NPR, and frequently appeared in the nude — his idea, apparently, designed to reinforce the absurd nature of Monty Python's signature humor. He co-wrote Monty Python's iconic "spam" sketch, where a wartime waitress runs through a rationed menu that's mostly canned meat, starred as Sir Bedevere, who comes up with creative ways to identify witches in the kingdom ("Might we burn her?" the villagers ask. "How do we tell whether she is made of wood?" he famously responds), and headed the Spanish Inquisition as Cardinal Biggles.
But Jones had a life far beyond comedy. His family, in its statement about his death, labeled Jones a polymath. Indeed, he was a scholar of ancient and medieval history, a director, a musician, and a writer of more than just memorable sketches. He penned poetry, books about Geoffrey Chaucer, and children's literature. And that's what he wanted to be remembered for, he told an interviewer in 2011.
"Maybe a description of me as a writer of children's books or some of my academic stuff," Jones told a Welsh paper. "Or maybe as the man who restored Richard II's reputation. He was a terrible victim of 14th-century political spin, you know."
He was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a form of frontotemporal dementia, in 2014 after he found himself unable to remember lines written for him to perform in a Monty Python reunion event. It took his life slowly and cruelly, robbing him of his speech before, last week, finally taking his life.
His family released a statement saying simply that “we have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humor has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades.”
His Monty Python cohorts remembered him as only they could.
"HE WAS A VERY NAUGHTY BOY!! ... and we miss you," Terry Gilliam wrote on Twitter. "Terry was someone totally consumed with life ... a brilliant, constantly questioning, iconoclastic, righteously argumentative and angry but outrageously funny and generous and kind human being ... and very often a complete pain in the ass. One could never hope for a better friend. Goodbye, Tel."
"I loved him the moment I saw him on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963," remembered Eric Idle. "So many laughs, moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him. It’s too sad if you knew him, but if you didn’t, you will always smile at the many wonderfully funny moments he gave us."
"Farewell dear Terry J. Two down, four to go," Monty Python's official account tweeted. "Love Terry G, Mike, John & Eric."

Hillary Clinton should definitely keep talking

Texto completo: Liberals couldn’t hear enough from Hillary Clinton over the last three years, tracking her blaming of everyone but herself for her 2016 campaign’s dazzling defeat. Why should she stop talking now?
Yet, that’s what liberal New York Times editorial writer Mara Gay is begging her to do.
In a column for the paper on Tuesday, Gay wrote, “Listen, I get it. It must be hard, after a bitter defeat that kept her from being the country’s first female president, to see her former rival rise in the polls, beloved by his supporters. But considering the stakes, it’d be best if Mrs. Clinton worked through all that on her own.”
In short: Shut up, Hillary!
Gay’s angst comes in light of a recent interview with Clinton, wherein she said that “nobody likes” Bernie Sanders, her 2016 primary rival for the Democratic nomination. “Nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It’s all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.”
Not that it’s saying much, but this is probably the most useful thing Clinton has said since 2016. Not because I like the internal Democrat-on-Democrat drama but because it clashes the vision Sanders’s supporters must have — that he’ll be able to work with Congress to get any one of his radical proposals signed into law and that he’s in any way a Washington outsider.
Up until those remarks, Clinton was singing the same screeching song she had been singing all along about Russia fixing the election, James Comey fixing the election, and sexism fixing the election.
Most liberals remained “with her” through all of that, but now that she might actually be helping guide the party to avoid a potential disaster of a nominee, some want her to stop talking.
I think she should keep going.

Texto completo: The New York Times’s technology section doesn’t want you to deprive your children of hours upon hours of smartphone screen time out of concern for their mental health.
“Panicking About Your Kids’ Phones? New Research Says Don’t,” a recent headline read. The New York Times's tech writer made his case against caution based on two new studies. But the argument had quite a few holes.
The studies’ authors, as the newspaper put it, are “challenging the widespread belief that screens are responsible for broad societal problems like the rising rates of anxiety and sleep deprivation among teenagers.”
“The current dominant discourse around phones and well-being is a lot of hype and a lot of fear," one author claimed.
Of course anxiety and sleep deprivation are on the rise among teenagers. Of course the massive spike in depression symptoms, especially among girls, has coincided with the massive spike in hours teenagers spend on social media and smartphones.
How do the authors account for this epidemic of anxiety and depression? Their explanations: “How about climate change? How about income inequality?”
No, it can’t be the anti-social effects of a smartphone. It can’t be the dehumanizing nature of social media and the way these apps distill teenage cruelty and inject it straight into children’s veins. It can’t be the addiction and brain-addling of brilliant, bright, always-on devices. It can’t be the unfettered access to pornography. It must be the 1.8 millimeters a year in sea-level rise.
Jean Twenge at the Institute for Family Studies responded to the New York Times piece, rejecting its implication that “a majority of researchers have concluded that technology use isn’t related to mental health.”
For instance, data on high school students from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that “twice as many heavy users of electronic devices (5+ hours a day) compared to light users (1 hour a day) have attempted suicide (12% vs. 6%).”
So, while some researchers want you to chill, most of the data confirms what parents’ own eyes are telling them: Smartphones and social media are harmful for adults and can be devastating for children.

Revisionist history on the Iran deal

Texto completo: President Trump’s decision to eliminate Iranian terror master Qassem Soleimani followed Tehran’s repeated violent escalations aimed at the United States and the region. But to hear former Obama administration officials tell it, Iran’s continued violence is America’s fault. For Team Obama, the cause of Iran’s region-wide belligerence and attacks on U.S. targets is simple: Trump renounced the Iran nuclear deal.
Today’s crisis, wrote President Barack Obama’s top Middle East deputy Robert Malley, is “rooted in President Trump's ill-advised and reckless decision to exit the nuclear deal and embark on a policy of ‘maximum pressure.’” And it was all predictable, too. “This moment was nothing if not foreseeable the moment Mr. Trump abandoned the 2015 agreement, which was working,” added former Secretary of State John Kerry.
But what does Obama’s nuclear agreement have to do with stopping Iran’s destabilizing actions across the region? After all, the former president and his aides always insisted, when making their sales pitch for the deal back in 2015, there was no connection. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, they said, was simply about reining in Iran’s nuclear ambitions. It was a narrow arms control agreement that had nothing to do with Iran’s terrorism and adventurism around the Middle East and beyond. When critics pointed to Iran’s expansionist and destabilizing campaigns in the region, its ballistic missile program, and its sponsorship of terrorism, Obama officials waved them off dismissively: We have no illusions about Iran, but that’s not part of this.
So, why is Team Obama livid about Trump pushing back against Iranian attacks? It’s because the nuclear-deal sales pitch was insincere, cover for a strategic vision that it knew was politically indefensible. The accord was never just an arms control agreement. It was an instrument for geopolitical realignment designed to elevate Iran.
Even as Obama officials pitched it in 2015, the administration was simultaneously putting out a parallel message about the real objective of its deal with Iran. An anonymous American diplomat in July 2015 floated that Obama believed Iran “could be a bulwark against ISIS in the Middle East and the key to peace there.” That same month, another unnamed official agreed. “There is definitely a larger picture here,” the official told the New York Times. Namely, “the possibility of a new [regional] equilibrium … a potential shift in alliances.” Obama himself had made the latter point in several interviews in 2014 and 2015.
Obama also linked the nuclear deal and realignment in the letters he sent to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, nudging Khamenei to embrace the agreement and pursue a regional partnership with the U.S. in 2014.
Tethering the nuclear deal to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign against the Islamic State would serve to reinforce the realignment and the larger, geopolitical scope of the deal. The primary theater for this partnership was Iraq, where Soleimani’s Shiite militias ran the show. For all the lip service the Obama administration paid to “empowering the moderates” in Iran, its real partnership was with Khamenei and his right-hand man, Soleimani. This is likely why, as former Bush administration senior director for the Middle East Michael Doran recently revealed, and as a Trump administration senior official confirmed, the Obama administration also sent letters to Soleimani, presumably to explore the possibility of jointly combating ISIS.
What that meant in practice was that the U.S. would help prop up Iranian political orders in Iraq and Lebanon and help to put down any Sunni insurgencies against those orders. As an Obama official put it in 2015, “Because we have a common enemy, a common goal, everybody is moving in the same direction.” The trick was for the U.S. to avoid crossing Iran’s “red lines,” or else jeopardize the partnership. As the official cautioned, “You cross a red line in Syria, you start to infringe on what Iran sees as its long-term interest, and those Shia militias could turn in the other direction.” In other words, crossing Iran would lose the U.S. permission from Tehran to kill Sunni insurgents and put the lives of American soldiers in Iraq at risk. Obama committed to that arrangement in writing, reassuring Khamenei in his letters that Bashar Assad’s regime in Syria would not be touched, only ISIS.
The pretext of the nuclear deal also served to boost the other side of the equation, distancing the U.S. from its traditional allies, especially Israel. Like clockwork, whenever the Israelis would take action about the growing Iranian threat, an anonymous Obama official could be trusted to leak that the Israelis were recklessly endangering our counterterrorism partnership and risking the lives of American men and women in Iraq and elsewhere.
This cooperation component of the deal was of particular importance for the Obama administration's ability to put the agreement into place in the face of congressional pushback because it tethered realignment with Iran to counterterrorism, which ensured a broader base of support in Washington.
For this reason, Team Obama is now engaged in an all-out messaging campaign premised on the idea that withdrawal from the nuclear deal is collapsing the security partnership it built. “Up until President Trump’s unilateral withdrawal … there were no proxy attacks by Iranian proxies on U.S. personnel in Iraq,” former national security adviser Susan Rice told MSNBC. “Iraq welcomed our presence fighting ISIS,” wrote Kerry. But, as a result of our withdrawal from the accord, “the U.S. presence in Iraq … is now hanging by a thread,” added Malley.
When this crew talks about “withdrawing from the deal,” therefore, it means the geopolitical deal to realign with Iran — the deal to achieve a new regional “balance,” or “equilibrium,” as Obama explained. “Rebalancing” required movement away from traditional allies in Iran’s favor. The accord was the vehicle for that rebalancing. On its own terms, the deal not only did not constrain Iran’s nonnuclear activities, but it also enabled them, namely, by setting a timeline for lifting the arms embargo on the Islamic Republic and the ban on its ballistic missile program. Moreover, it provided sanctions relief that filled up Iran’s war chests as it prosecuted its regional campaigns, with some of the funds sent straight in cash on wooden pallets. This is why Team Obama’s messaging today focuses on the lifting of U.S. sanctions and the end of the “maximum pressure” campaign.
All of this is on top of the nuclear concessions. When the temporary restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities expire, according to the so-called sunset clauses in the deal, Iran will have been given a legal, full-scale nuclear program. Talk about rebalancing.
Obama officials are now incensed because Trump has upended this new geopolitical “equilibrium” and realignment that his predecessor had worked so assiduously to achieve. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. The realignment was supposed to have been locked in by a true custodian of Obama’s legacy, Malley candidly explained in a recent essay. It was “premised on his being succeeded by someone like him, maybe a Hillary Clinton, but certainly not a Donald Trump.”
Trump’s elimination of Soleimani symbolizes the end of the Obama strategy of realigning the U.S. with the Islamic Republic. But to bury that strategy, Trump still needs to end the nuclear deal fully. The arms embargo on Iran is set to be lifted at the end of this year. The expiration of other sunset clauses will be prevented only when the U.S. activates the so-called snapback mechanism at the United Nations Security Council, which would restore the international restrictions and sanctions on Iran that the nuclear deal shredded.

Texto completo: Even O. Henry could not have conceived this level of irony.
Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a Democrat, said this week that Democrats must get over lost races and focus only on future prospects.
Not bad advice, really. But coming from the woman who has done little else but obsess over her loss to Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, it's a bit much.
"We have to stop relitigating past elections and have to start planning for future elections," Abrams said this week during an appearance at the University of New England, according to the Associated Press.
Democrats would be wise to follow her recommendation. Lord knows her party could benefit greatly from ridding itself of its embittered failures, such as failed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is pitifully determined to convince the world that she is the rightful president of the United States.
Or Abrams herself — who has yet to concede to Gov. Kemp.
Abrams claimed 12 times in the six months after she lost her election that she had actually won, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis. Abrams told New York Times Magazine in April 2019, "I won." Abrams has also gone on national television to argue that the race was "stolen" from her.
Abrams lost by 54,723 votes in an election year that saw voter turnout in Georgia increase by an estimated 2.5 million from the last midterm election cycle. Abrams's campaign team said in 2018 that it could prove the election was stolen. They have yet to make good on that promise. And frankly, they have no case to make.
The only reason Abrams is still a player in American politics is that she lost an election that she and her supporters in the news media are determined to relitigate perpetually. So Abrams is not wrong when she says Democrats need to move on from losses. Democrats should do as she says, not as she does.

Word of the Week: Endorsement

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 23 Jan 2020.

Texto completo: The New York Times, it seems, does not know what the word “endorsement” means. The paper conducted a series of interviews that were recorded and then transcribed, published under the heading “The Choice.” It then heralded its process for choosing whom to endorse as the most transparent ever — as transparent as, say, the confession booths on a reality show. In service of said transparency, and not mere marketing, the editorial board of the Gray Lady televised an endorsement special in which it announced that it is not choosing at all. It endorses both Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.
Never to be outclowned when something silly is happening in politics or culture, the writer Lauren Duca opined that she thinks "using feminine pronouns for the most powerful person in the world could help correct our overriding tendency toward the toxic masculine.” As if language determines cultural attitudes and not the other way around. Yet it’s evident the New York Times’s board is saying something similar: Any female Democrat will do. “May the best woman win,” as the “endorsement” closes. It is the gender identity and not the political, intellectual, or personal characteristics of the endorsees that won them the editorial board’s backing. Tokenism is apparently good now.
Anyway, put aside all this, and just focus on this more practical question: If I am a New Yorker and New York Times subscriber who is registered to vote in the Democratic primaries, and I want to heed the paper’s endorsement, how do I do that?
This question is not answered because the “endorsement” at the end of “The Choice” feature is no endorsement at all. Let me be at my William Safire-iest for a moment: According to the great lexicographer and overseer of the Dictionary of Word Origins, John Ayto, the word “endorse” comes to us via the now-dead French verb "endosser," literally meaning to write on the back. It retains this meaning in handling checks and other documents. That word, in turn, “comes from the medieval Latin indorsare, a compound formed from the prefix in- ‘in’ and dorsum ‘back’ (source of English dorsal, doss, and dossier).”
Eric Partridge’s otherwise venerable and witty 1942 style dictionary, Usage and Abusage, says that it is not interchangeable with “approve.” But Partridge is also outmoded and so British that he suggests the spelling “indorse.” So I think he can be safely waved off for any contemporary purposes stateside. Perhaps the most common context in which “endorsement” shows up these days other than a political endorsement is in a usage meaning exactly “agreement.” Think of the legalese disclaimer that some sort of statement “does not imply or constitute endorsement” that you can find on any website or speaking contract or before a TV show. We take pains to say something is not an endorsement specifically because we understand endorsement to carry some sort of official stamp of agreeing with it. Time magazine’s stock defense for decades when it named someone morally gross as a person of the year because he or she was influential is that the title is “not an endorsement.”
In this sense, perhaps the most etymologically direct way to understand an act of endorsement is as backing something, or putting your seal on it, or being behind it. If you endorse it, you’re for it, anyway. And if you’re for it, well, you can’t also be against it. Unless, depressingly, we keep letting the intrusion of politics into the way we use words make common meanings ever more wishy-washy.

Ex-spy Valerie Plame congressional campaign is suddenly in trouble

Texto completo: Former CIA agent Valerie Plame's status as a shoo-in to win a congressional seat in northern New Mexico is now deeply imperiled amid charges she's an outsider from Washington who knows too little about the district she seeks to represent.
Plame is running in the Democratic primary to replace Democrat Ben Ray Lujan, the highest-ranking Hispanic lawmaker in the House, in the state's 3rd Congressional District, home to 15 Pueblo tribes and the Navajo and Jicarilla Apache nations, with a 41% Hispanic and 19% Native American population.
Lujan, who has held the seat since 2009, announced a run for Senate in April last year, drawing prominent Hispanic candidates into the primary.
Plame's strategy of drawing attention to her background in foreign policy and boasting that she knows her way around Washington is flawed, said local officials and pollsters interviewed by the New York Times. Voters care about local issues and knowledge of the region, said Gabriel Sanchez, a Latino Decisions pollster and executive director of the University of New Mexico's Center for Social Policy.
Where Plame might benefit, Sanchez said, is from the high number of Hispanic entrants into the race, splitting the Hispanic vote in an election where Anglo turnout is expected to be high.
In September, a campaign ad touted her experience as an undercover CIA operative in "hot-spot" countries, including Syria, Pakistan, Iraq, and others. Foot on the pedal, Plame careens backward down a dusty New Mexico road, calling out Scooter Libby, who President Trump pardoned in 2017, for outing her CIA cover.
That was a moment "when my own government betrayed me," Plame says. The ad shows a photograph of her Ukrainian Jewish family.
In 2017, Plame drew criticism for sharing a link to an article, "America's Jews are driving America's wars," with a picture of Bill Kristol.
"Just FYI, I am of Jewish descent," Plame said on Twitter, amid the uproar. Raised a Lutheran, Plame's synagogue attendance began shortly after.
Plame rebutted accusations of anti-Semitism, telling the New York Times in an interview that her grandfather's Ukrainian Jewish family was "right out of Fiddler on the Roof."
“One’s spiritual journey is private,” Plame said when pressed on the timeline of her relationship with Judaism.
Her spy background led to lucrative book and entertainment deals, including the 2010 film adaptation of Plame's autobiography Fair Game, where she and her husband were portrayed by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.
Plame's husband, the late Joseph Wilson, a retired U.S. ambassador to Gabon, famously questioned the Bush White House's justification for invading Iraq. Writing in the New York Times, Wilson, returning from a CIA "fact-finding mission" to Niger in 2003 to investigate whether Saddam Hussein had purchased yellowcake uranium from the country, said he found no evidence. He believed that "some of the intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat,” he said.

Joe Biden's internet-breaking idea

Texto completo: Former vice president and 2020 Democratic candidate for president Joe Biden has been so frustrated with Facebook and other tech companies that he suggested making one of the most significant changes to the internet ever made.
While talking to the New York Times, Biden suggested outright revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides websites protection from being held liable for things posted on them.
"[The New York Times] can't write something you know to be false and be exempt from being sued," Biden said. "But [Facebook] can. The idea that it's a tech company is that Section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked, number one."
His suggestion was in response to Facebook sticking to its guns and allowing politicians to post potentially false information on its platform, calling the content "newsworthy" and arguing that its users should see that content and come to a conclusion themselves.
"Would it be acceptable to society at large to have a private company, in effect, become a self-appointed referee for everything that politicians say? I don't believe it would be," Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a speech. "In open democracies, voters rightly believe that, as a general rule, they should be able to judge what politicians say themselves."
Facebook's policy comes after two years of being accused by conservatives of stifling or censoring content critical of liberals. But removing Section 230 could fundamentally change the internet forever.
"The internet as we know it wouldn't exist, to be blunt," Matthew Feeney, director of the Cato Institute's project on emerging technologies, said. "It's the piece of legislation that allows the internet that we all know to exist in the first place. Someone once called it the Magna Carta of the internet, and that's not much of an exaggeration."
The Communication Decency Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. It was initially crafted to protect users from being exposed to obscene content, but many people took issue with provisions in the act they say targeted free speech, leading to the law getting stripped through the years.
"There were a couple of court cases in the 1990s that were giving conflicting guidance to these websites. In one case, if you're not engaging in content moderation at all, then you're a distributor with no liability, like a bookstore," Feeney said. "But a few years later, there was a different case that said that if you engage in any content moderation, then you're a publisher. Absent 230, you have to pick one of these two worlds. There just wouldn't be a Facebook or a YouTube."
In essence, without Section 230, websites would either have to not moderate content at all, ending up with sites full of possibly racist, pornographic, excessively violent content or every single piece of content having to be approved by a group of lawyers.
Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has referred to Section 230 as a "gift" to Big Tech companies. Still, it protects smaller websites that aren't capable of moderating every piece of content users post, such as comments. While their animosity focuses on Facebook and Google, revoking Section 230 could allow Big Tech companies to maintain an even deeper monopoly over the discourse on the internet as they have the resources to comb through all the content. At the same time, smaller websites could get litigated out of existence if their users' content violates the law. Despite recent bipartisan complaints, revoking Section 230 still appears to be an unlikely and unpopular move.
"I don't view this as a serious policy proposal," Feeney said. "I don't know of anyone in the technology policy world that advocates for outright revoking of the entire Section 230. I think this is a pipe dream. What this does politically is just signal to people that Joe Biden isn't happy with Facebook. If he does have someone on staff advising him on this, I can't imagine that they've spent much time thinking about technology policy. I don't think that's seriously a world anyone in the 21st century wants to live in."

Democrats have no clear strategy in the impeachment trial

Texto completo: Before accusing Republicans of rigging the Senate impeachment trial, Democrats might have first settled on one clear strategy to make their case that President Trump deserves to be immediately removed from office.
As of right now, Democrats are actually making four separate assertions.
First, they have an overwhelming, irrefutable body of evidence that Trump abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress’s constitutional duty to oversee the conduct of the executive branch.
Second, still more evidence and witness testimony are needed to build their supposedly rock-solid case.
Third, they don’t need to find any explicit crime or criminal conduct to pursue impeachment and removal from office.
Fourth, although there need not be any criminal accusation involved, the Senate trial should operate as a criminal trial.
These arguments collide with one another, demonstrating once again that Democrats aren’t very confident in any one path to fulfilling their desperate dreams of ousting Trump before the election.
For anyone who hasn’t followed this riveting tale about the president, a poor country called Ukraine, and a gas company by the name of Burisma Holdings, the trouble for Democrats began when they opted not to collect all of the witness testimony and evidence they wanted when they had the chance to do so in the House.
Now, they’re asking the Senate, where Republicans hold most of the power, to do that work for them. At the same time, while admitting that they haven’t accused the president of a crime, they want his trial conducted as a criminal one.
New York Times liberal writer Nicholas Kristof said on Wednesday that it appeared as though Senate Republicans wanted “a rushed, sham trial with no witnesses and limited evidence.”
This is another way of saying, "Why can’t Republicans just do everything the way Democrats say it should be done?" Well, because that’s not the way it works. We have two major political parties and not one because, in theory, they get their support from people who have opposing interests.
Democrats and liberals in the media can be upset that Republicans aren’t doing everything their way. But that doesn’t make the process a sham.

Texto completo: Newly revealed documents raise questions about the alleged Ukraine whistleblower.
Fox News host Laura Ingraham reported Wednesday evening that she obtained a chain of State Department emails stemming from a standard request for comment from New York Times journalist Ken Vogel, whose reporting helped generate scrutiny of Hunter Biden's ties to Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Hunter Biden, 49, is the son of Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, and Republicans have called for him to testify during the Ukraine-related Senate impeachment trial against President Trump.
On May 1, 2019, Vogel contacted State Department official Kate Schilling about a story he was working on regarding an Obama administration meeting in January 2016 with Ukrainian prosecutors and mentioned the name of the CIA analyst believed to be the whistleblower whose complaint sparked impeachment proceedings that led to two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Ingraham did not state the name of the alleged whistleblower — Fox News hosts are banned from doing so until the identity is confirmed — and blacked out the name when showing excerpts of documents. However, she likely was referring to Eric Ciaramella, who some Republicans and conservative media figures believe is the whistleblower.
In the email, Vogel wrote, "We are going to report that [State Department official] Elizabeth Zentos attended a meeting at the White House on 1/19/2016 with Ukrainian prosecutors and embassy officials as well as ... [redacted] from the NSC ... the subjects discussed included efforts within the United State government to support prosecutions, in Ukraine and the United Kingdom, of Burisma Holdings, ... and concerns that Hunter Biden's position with the company could complicate such efforts."
Ingraham said this email was forwarded to Schilling's colleagues Zentos and George Kent, who appears to have been a source for Vogel. The conversation ended on May 3, with the State Department declining to comment. Kent, who was stationed in Kyiv at the time, told House investigators during an impeachment hearing last year that he raised concerns in 2015 about Hunter Biden holding a position with Burisma but was rebuffed by a Joe Biden aide.
Using archived Obama White House visitor logs, Ingraham said her team was able to corroborate details of the January 2016 meeting, showing on the screen the names of Ukrainian officials checked into the White House by Ciaramella, who was Ukraine director on the National Security Council.

Ingraham said the story was never published and reached out to Vogel and the New York Times to ask why the report never came to fruition. While Vogel did not reply, Ingraham said the New York Times director of communications simply stated that Vogel's request for comment was consistent with their news-gathering process.
Still, Ingraham said that "the timing of their request and the subsequent squashing of the story are very interesting," noting how Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president on April 25, one week before Vogel's request. She speculated a number of possibilities, including that Joe Biden's campaign somehow got the New York Times to drop the story.
On the same day as Vogel's request to the State Department, he had a report published examining how in 2016, then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.
Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and other allies claim Joe Biden improperly used his role as vice president to pressure Ukraine to fire Shokin, who was widely seen as corrupt, in 2016 to protect his son from an investigation into Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company at which Hunter Biden held a $50,000-per-month position on the board. But the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and other allies had the same objective, and Joe Biden was repeating U.S. policy that had been set out by Washington’s ambassador to Kyiv in the preceding months and was briefed by White House staff just ahead of the trip.
Joe Biden has dubbed the allegations as “false, debunked conspiracy theories” about him, and Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden and other political rivals are at the heart of the impeachment proceedings. Impeachment was spurred by the emergence of a whistleblower complaint, which the intelligence community inspector general determined to be urgent and credible, about a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the American leader pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden and other Democrats.
Republicans have called for the whistleblower to come forward, but Democrats have argued that witness testimony and documents have moved the impeachment case beyond the whistleblower. Lawyers for the whistleblower have warned that identifying their client would put that person's life in danger.
Vogel has continued to report on the Bidens and Ukraine and the unfolding impeachment saga. He said in a Sept. 21 interview that the Ukraine story posed a "significant liability" for Joe Biden and that there was "more to be told." Vogel got a report published the next day that declared no evidence had surfaced that showed Joe Biden intentionally tried to protect his son by getting Shokin fired.

Capt. ‘Sully’ Sullenberger: Like Joe Biden, I once stuttered, too. I dare you to mock me.

Texto completo: As a small boy in Denison, Texas, I remember vividly the anguish of being called on in grade school, knowing that I was going to have a hard time getting the words out; that my words could not keep up with my mind, and they would often come out jumbled. My neck and face would quickly begin to flush a bright red, the searing heat rising all the way to the top of my head; every eye in the room on me; the intense and painful humiliation, and bullying that would follow, all because of my inability to get the words out.
Those feelings came rushing back, when I heard Lara Trump mocking former Vice President Joe Biden at a Trump campaign event, with the very words that caused my childhood agony. “Joe, can you get it out?” Ms. Trump was seen saying onstage, as a few giggles are heard from an otherwise silent audience. “Let’s get the words out, Joe.”
In the interest of full disclosure, I attended a fundraiser last year for the Biden campaign, but this issue goes beyond politics. Regardless of how you feel about Joe Biden, or his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president; whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or none of the above; whether you stuttered as a child or laughed at one who did; whether as a parent you try to protect your own stuttering child from taunts such as those made by the president’s daughter-in-law; these words come without hesitation: Stop. Grow up. Show some decency. People who can’t, have no place in public life.
What might a child who stutters, as I did, feel when they hear a grown-up on a public stage trying to make a bunch of other adults laugh by ridiculing a public figure who also stutters?
This culture of cruelty is what drives decent people from public service, and what makes millions of Americans recoil from politics, and even from participating in our democracy. Vice President Biden has spoken openly — and courageously, in my view — about the pain of his severe childhood stutter. He takes time to reach out to children who have suffered as he did.
As I grew older, I learned to manage and overcome my stuttering, through much hard work and intense focus. I learned to slow down and to enunciate each word with precision. I joined the church choir, and found that singing helped me to practice controlling my breath, and the formation of words. I learned to resist and overcome the bullying.
I also learned that our imperfections do not define us.
The fact that I once stuttered did not keep me from being a successful U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, an airline pilot, or even a public speaker.
And on that frigid day in January 2009, when I had to tell the air traffic controller at New York Departure Control that I was about to land US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River, after a bird strike following takeoff caused both engines to fail, my words came out with precision and control, even in the stress of a life-threatening emergency.
So, to every child who feels today, what I felt, after hearing those cruel remarks by an adult who should know better, here is what I want you to know:
You are fine, just as you are. You can do any job you dream of when you grow up. You can be a pilot who lands your plane on a river and helps save lives, or a president who treats people with respect, rather than making fun of them. You can become a teacher to kids who stutter. A speech disorder is a lot easier to treat than a character defect. You become a true leader, not because of how you speak, but because of what you have to say — and the challenges you have overcome to help others. Ignore kids (and adults) who are mean, or don’t know what it feels like to stutter. Respond by showing them how to be kind, polite, respectful and generous, to be brave enough to try big things, even though you are not perfect.
Do that, and the sky is the limit. Take it from me.

Texto completo: Who leads the Golden State Warriors in total points this season?
Alec Burks.
Yes, that’s right, the guard who spent eight seasons with the Utah Jazz after being selected in the 2011 NBA draft is now the formerly-vaunted Warriors’ leading scorer. Much of that, of course, is due to injury: not just the obvious ones like Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, but also the various games D’Angelo Russell has missed.
Burks has taken advantage of the opportunity, scoring 16.2 points (a career high) in his 29.5 minutes per game on the floor. He’s also passing the ball a little more often, while turning it over a little less. It’s probably been his best NBA season, with the obvious caveat that the Warriors stand at 10-35 on the season.
“Anytime a player, whether it be Alec or Dante [Exum] more recently, you play a part in their career and you want to seem them succeed," Jazz head coach Quin Snyder said. "Everybody in the locker room and coaching staff and players that have played with him want to see him do well, and he is.”
Zone defense comeback
If you’ve watched the NBA this season, you’ve probably seen more zone defenses than ever before. According to a New York Times article quoting Synergy Sports data, usage of zone defenses is up 50% when compared to last year. It’s no team’s base defense, but seven teams — Dallas, Toronto, Washington, Charlotte, Los Angeles (Clippers), Miami and Brooklyn — use zone defenses as a wrinkle between to 4 and 10% of the time.
The Jazz are not one of those teams. According to Synergy, the Jazz have run zone for only two possessions all year. But they still have to run their offense well against zone defenses when teams try to use it to slow them down.
“We found maybe the most important thing is get guys in comfort zones,” Snyder said. “A lot of times, zone is successful if it just makes you stop and think.”
The Jazz have attacked zones extremely successfully this season. They’re second in the league in offensive efficiency against zone defenses, averaging 1.286 points per possession. Only Denver ranks higher.
“I think you probably want to distort the zone in some ways initially and try to at least have some variance in how you attack it, where it’s not the same every time,” Snyder said. “A lot of times that can something as simple as pick and roll and spacing.”

Thomas L. Friedman: Trump, impeachment and catching Frisbees

Texto completo: As the country embarks on only the third impeachment trial of a president in its history, there are many unique features about this moment, but one stands out for me: Never before have we had to confront a president who lies as he breathes and is backed by a political party and an entire cable TV-led ecosystem able and enthusiastic to create an alternative cognitive universe that propagates those lies on an unlimited scale.
It is disheartening, disorienting and debilitating.
How can the truth — that Donald Trump used taxpayer funds to try to force the president of Ukraine to sully the reputation of Joe Biden, a political rival — possibly break through this unique trifecta of a president without shame, backed by a party without spine, reinforced by a network without integrity?
There is only one way: Keep it simple.
Democrats need to just keep repeating over and over one question: “Why would an innocent man, and a jury interested in the truth, not want all the evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn’t you if you were innocent?”
Indeed, at moments like these I always fall back on what I consider to be one of the most useful essays in political science. It was a 2012 speech by Andrew Haldane, a top economist at the Bank of England, at an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It was titled “The Dog and the Frisbee” and was all about how central bankers and regulators should think about regulation after the 2008 financial crisis.
Haldane began by asking a profound philosophical question that we should all ponder occasionally: Why are dogs better than humans at catching a Frisbee?
“Catching a Frisbee is difficult,” Haldane began. “Doing so successfully requires the catcher to weigh a complex array of physical and atmospheric factors, among them wind speed and Frisbee rotation. Were a physicist to write down Frisbee-catching as an optimal control problem, they would need to understand and apply Newton’s Law of Gravity. Yet despite this complexity, catching a Frisbee is remarkably common. ... It is a task that an average dog can master. Indeed some, such as Border collies, are better at Frisbee-catching than humans.
“So, what is the secret of the dog’s success? The answer, as in many other areas of complex decision-making, is simple,” he said. “Or rather, it is to keep it simple. For studies have shown that the Frisbee-catching dog follows the simplest of rules of thumb: Run at a speed so that the angle of gaze to the Frisbee remains roughly constant.”
Haldane then went on to explain that catching a financial crisis required the same approach: Keep it simple, don’t choke markets with too many complex regulations, understand that oftentimes “less may be more.”
So it is with this impeachment, too. Democrats need to keep it simple. The goal in this trial is not a conviction by the Senate. That is simply impossible with this Republican Party intimidated by this president using this Fox News-led noise machine.
The most that can be achieved, and it’s a lot, actually, is to convey to the swing voters — the independents, suburban women and moderate Republicans who delivered the House to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms — just how much this president is ready to put himself above the law. And, therefore, four more years of his presidency, when he would no longer be “restrained” by the need for re-election, would be catastrophic for our country’s unity and for the institutions and norms that have sustained it since 1776.
I am convinced that more Americans are worried about the country’s cohesion and its institutions being ripped apart by Trump than Trump realizes. It’s a key reason his approval rankings remain largely flat while our stock markets soar. I also believe that the Trump team has overestimated how easy it will be for it to just keep hiding the most important evidence and witnesses now that the impeachment trial has begun and many Americans are tuning in to this issue for the first time.
And when they do, variations of that simple question — “Why would an innocent man, and a jury interested in the truth, not want all the evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn’t you if you were innocent?” — will take on even more power.
Republican senators have been able to dodge that question for months while the matter was in the House but not any longer. And you can already see how uncomfortable it makes them by the way Sen. Martha McSally literally ran away from and denounced a CNN reporter when he asked her if the Senate should consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial. There is a reason McSally fled.
A CNN poll released Monday night found that 69% of Americans want the Senate to call new witnesses, while 26% do not.
Democrats still need to come up with a compelling candidate against Trump. But the midterms told us that there is an important coalition of independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women no longer so sold on Trump.
In 2016 they disliked Hillary Clinton and were willing to give Trump a chance, telling themselves, “How bad could it be — and hey, anyway, we have the Constitution to protect us.” Then they witnessed just how bad it could be and that the Constitution in Trump’s hands could not protect us. Democrats running in swing districts in 2018 also kept it simple, focusing on Trump’s attempts to destroy Obamacare and coverage of pre-existing medical conditions.
This impeachment trial is another opportunity to show those swing voters just how bad it could be, by constantly asking why an innocent president would be frantically preventing the likes of his former national security adviser, John Bolton; his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney; and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, from testifying.
That’s banana republic stuff. That’s end-of-separation-of-powers stuff. That’s I-am-above-the-law stuff.
I repeat, it may not change the outcome of this trial. But it will strike some average, fair-minded Americans as just not right and give them another justification — for themselves, for their friends and for their families — to swing away from Trump in the presidential election. If the next election is about Trump, not the Democrat, a lot of experts believe, he will have a real uphill climb.
In order to prevent that, you are about to see the Trump-Fox-GOP noise machine go nuclear, pull out all the stops and fill the airwaves and the internet with distractions and misinformation.
So keep cutting through it with that simple question: “Why would an innocent man not want all the evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn’t you if you were innocent?” Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Don’t make it complicated. Just catch the Frisbee.

Texto completo: Health officials say Pennsylvanians have little to fear so far from a deadly respiratory illness spreading across Southeast Asia.
The coronavirus, which presents itself with symptoms similar to a common cold or the flu, has so far killed 18 people, mainly in China, and has sickened people in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam and the United States, according to The New York Times.
Pennsylvania has yet to record a confirmed case, but officials are taking precautions to prevent a spread of the disease.
"For the general public there is nothing to really worry about if you haven't been exposed to anyone from the impacted area or haven't traveled to the impacted area," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a Pittsburgh-based infectious disease physician. "The symptoms are very similar to the common cold or the flu: fever, chills, cough."
Nate Wardle, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Health Department, said the department is monitoring the virus and working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health departments to be sure all are prepared in case of an outbreak in the United States.
The Allegheny County Health Department issued an advisory saying that it has been in contact with federal and state health agencies, the Pittsburgh International Airport and hospitals and clinics throughout the county to discuss the outbreak.
Airports across the country are screening passengers arriving from Asia. The Allegheny County Airport Authority said Pittsburgh International has no nonstop flights from China and is not one of the airports conducting enhanced passenger health screenings.
Airport officials are monitoring updates and guidelines from the CDC and is prepared to respond if the situation changes, according to the authority.
The virus was first confirmed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December, according to the CDC. Chinese officials are now limiting travel in and out of the region.
Officials have confirmed one case in the United States. The Seattle area man is in isolation and under medical care, according to news accounts.
Wardle said officials believe the source of the disease is snakes.
"They believe it may be snakes that transmitted it to a person, either from a bite or a snake spitting on a person without biting," he said. "What can happen is the novel coronavirus can mutate and it can jump from person to person. As long as you're not traveling out of the country there's really not too much to be worried about at this point."

'Even a little voice can make a big difference' — In a small Iowa city, a local newspaper's presidential endorsement carries clout

Texto completo: STORM LAKE, Iowa — Art Cullen has just finished his latest editorial, haranguing the governor this week for not spending more on natural resources. Soon Cullen will need to start laying out the pages before Thursday's print deadline, but for a moment, he takes a break.
Cullen, with his mop of white hair and matching handlebar mustache, is the editor of the Storm Lake Times, a family-run newspaper that for 30 years has been a progressive voice in this community of 10,000 in conservative northwest Iowa. Nearly a third of its residents subscribe to the print edition, which lands in their mailboxes twice a week.
Coastal elites bickered this week over whether The New York Times' double presidential endorsement of Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren was a cop-out. But just as they sought that coveted nod in a glassy Manhattan conference room, the Democratic contenders have also sought the endorsement of Cullen's paper, journeying to its own conference room, where the chairs are worn and the side table is equipped with coffee but also Milk-Bones for Peach, the newsroom dog.
“I don't know what endorsements mean," Cullen lamented Wednesday. But as he kept talking he answered his own question.
“We do them because I think we have a special window and especially so this year," he said of the intense Democratic race to find the best candidate to unseat President Trump. “We are able to meet these people and Joe the plumber is not. So I think it does have value to do an endorsement. And in our case, we have a point of view, so how could you not apply that point of view to the presidential candidates? I just couldn't sit there and bite my tongue."
In a year where the field is so large, so much seems at stake, and so many people are still undecided, endorsements like this one from local journalists who understand Iowa seem particularly important.
“Having those nuanced explanations in your local paper of why you should support this candidate could be particularly impactful this time around," said Pat Rynard, managing editor of Iowa Starting Line, a news outlet devoted to state politics he founded in 2015. “I'd certainly say that they are more helpful than the national ones for caucus-goers' minds."
Cullen, 62, has been a Storm Lake fixture for decades, and Iowa politicians have long been wary of his calls, but the rest of the world only took notice in 2017, when he won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials that challenged powerful corporate agricultural interests in the state.
“All of a sudden, rather than being an anonymous weekly newspaper editor … I was the sage of progressive Iowa," he said with an explosive laugh. He wrote a book and now pens columns for The Guardian.
So this year, Cullen has used his fame to nail down nearly every presidential candidate on how he or she would address the intersection of agriculture and climate change. The policy discussions are complex, but Cullen is an expert because sustainable agriculture has been his campaign for decades, long before anyone outside Iowa paid attention.
And he has been successful — he got all the Democratic candidates to agree on sweeping reforms for “regenerative agriculture" that would mean more sustainable farming practices, he said. In December, after he personally interviewed 15 candidates, the paper endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren.
“It's all I've been doing all year is trying to buttonhole these candidates, in a nice way, in a sort of a hick sort of way, throwing no sharp elbows, that's not my place, I'm just here to root for the home team," Cullen said.
Storm Lake feels a world away from the East Coast media outlets that now seem to drive coverage of presidential contests, parachuting every four years into the country's heartland. To get here from Des Moines, you have to zigzag nearly three hours on the long, straight highways that form a grid across the state. This time of year, the snow-covered cornfields disappear into the white sky, the horizon barely visible only because of a few barns and silos.
The Storm Lake Times is a family operation. Cullen's brother John is the publisher. His wife, Dolores, takes photographs and writes features. His son, Tom, is the reporter, authoring most of the stories on its website and in the paper, which has two sections and 16 pages.
Just below the box where the editorials run in each edition , the paper prints the text of the First Amendment and John 8:32 from the Bible: “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
Cullen's newsroom is a blue warehouse around the corner from Storm Lake's main street, where several blocks of shops and restaurants draw a steady stream of customers. Gridded streets of tidy homes stretch down toward the lake that gave the city its name, where fog makes it hard to tell if the water is frozen.
Cullen's desk is at the back of the newsroom and his computer is surrounded by yellowing newspapers and a coffee cup. He is a crusader for the importance of local journalism. That comes with the hallmark self-deprecation and cynicism.
“All my bragging goes by way of saying that even a little voice can make a big difference," he said. “I'm old fashioned enough to believe in an institutional point of view, and that institutions are important, and that a newspaper should have a voice of its own, and that implies editorials, and if you don't have that voice, then you're just the AP."
Warren earned the Storm Lake Times endorsement because of her stance on agriculture and conservation, her understanding of economic systems, and because Cullen believes that her other proposals, like universal health coverage, show that she understands the challenges of the area.
“I just look at it through the prism of rural America," he said. “The Boston Globe can look out for Boston. Somebody's got to look out for this fly-over country, and so while I have a voice I'm going to use it."
As for The New York Times, Cullen thinks it may have given Klobuchar a boost in Iowa, but if anything, he thinks her recent endorsement from the Quad Cities Times in eastern Iowa probably did more.
But Cullen, like most everyone else in this state, will tell you he has no idea who will win the caucuses in less than two weeks. The race is considered a toss-up between Warren, Senator Bernie Sanders, former vice president Joe Biden, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
For the past 20 years, politics in Iowa has split geographically, with conservatives in western Iowa largely separate from more liberal voters in the eastern half of the state. Hillary Clinton didn't stop in Storm Lake in 2016, Cullen said, but the paper still endorsed her. Barack Obama came through twice when he was running for president, although Biden got the Storm Lake Times' nod in the 2008 race. Now Democrats are starting to realize that you must at least show up here, Cullen said.
Whether his endorsements have any real sway, Cullen claims not to know. But people in town will tell you they are paying attention.
“It was a big move," Linda Torres, who works at the Better Day Cafe downtown, said about Cullen's endorsement of Warren.
Storm Lake is “Steve King country," people say, referring to the ultraconservative US representative from this region who closely allies with Trump.
Torres, 22, is part of the new generation of residents in the city. She was born in the United States but her mother is from Mexico. Cullen has used his pages to trumpet the vitality that the city's new Latino residents has brought. Not everyone agrees.
“It gave us a lot of hope that OK, someone is out there, stepping up," Torres said about Cullen's endorsement. “I don't think he knows how much he means to us."
Cullen doesn't seem to spend much time thinking about sentiments like that. He is always working on the next editorial, needling the next politician. The flash of fame that came with the Pulitzer merely gave the rest of the world a brief glimpse into the battles that he and his staff have been waging in Iowa for decades.
The paper is one of few voices in rural Iowa for more conservation funding. On the wall in his conference room is a map of the lake that hugs the community and draws tourists to its water park in warmer months. After two decades of pushing, Cullen's paper finally succeeded in pressuring the state to spend $20 million to help conserve it, he said. He hopes his editorial Friday will persuade the governor to make a genuine effort for more conservation funding.
“We like to think that we've elevated the debate a little bit," he said, " but you don't want to start to believe your own press releases."

Texto completo: Una gran incógnita sobre el futuro de modernización del Subway en la Gran Manzana deja la renuncia de Andy Byford, presidente de la Autoridad de Tránsito de Nueva York (NYCT), justamente cuando despegaba el Plan Capital 2020-2024, que bajo su liderazgo prometía un giro en un servicio vital para los neoyorquinos .
“ Estoy muy orgulloso de lo que hemos logrado como equipo en los últimos dos años y creo que New York City Transit está en una buena posición para continuar su progreso, ahora que la Autoridad de Transporte Metropolitano (MTA) tiene un récord de $51.5 mil millones para invertir en los próximos 4 años”, expresó Byford en una carta pública este jueves.
El experto en transporte urbano de origen británico, “se baja del vagón” justamente dos años luego de asumir el cargo, en medio de una tormenta de especulaciones.
“Estoy muy agradecido con el gobernador Andrew Cuomo, el presidente de la MTA y los miembros de la Junta por darme la oportunidad de servir a Nueva York y dirigir el sistema de tránsito más grande de América del Norte “, precisó en su misiva.
Medios locales reaccionaron inmediatamente a esta dimisión, describiendo la carrera de Byford como “ un progreso significativo que le dio nuevos aires al Subway, a través de planes ambiciosos a favor de los neoyorquinos”.
Entre tanto, el presidente y director ejecutivo de MTA Patrick J. Foye, reconoció que “jugó un papel decisivo en el avance del sistema, promulgando el exitoso Plan de Acción del Metro y asegurando una financiación récord de capital con el Gobernador y la Legislatura. Le deseamos lo mejor en su próximo capítulo “.
Las reacciones de varios sectores de la ciudad que predicen “un retroceso en las modernización del Subway”, no cesaron.
John Raskin , director ejecutivo de Alianza Riders, organización que defiende los derechos de las comunidades a un mejor sistema de transporte, opinó que “no importa quién maneje ese sistema, el Gobernador está a cargo de la MTA, y los pasajeros lo responsabilizarán por la calidad del servicio”.
A juicio de Raskin, solo el 58% de los trenes llegaban a tiempo el mes en que asumió Byford este cargo. “Ayudó a impulsar la tasa de puntualidad, en más del 80% , a través de una serie de cambios operativos y un enfoque en lo básico”, aseguró.
El activista explicó que se superaron colapsos casi constantes y los descarrilamientos de trenes, en los últimos dos años. Además se estaba haciendo una ambiciosa revisión del antiguo equipo de señalización del sistema.
The New York Times aseguró que Byford “ tuvo problemas para llevarse bien con el gobernador Cuomo, quien controla el sistema del metro y el flujo de dinero. Ambos hombres, tienen egos de gran tamaño y querían crédito por el éxito del Subway. Se pelearon por los planes para arreglar el tren L y la nueva tecnología para actualizar las señales”, precisó el diario neoyorquino..
Reseñó el prestigioso diario, que cuando el ahora expresidente de la NYCT cuestionó públicamente la decisión del mandatario neoyorquino de suspender el cierre del túnel del tren L entre Manhattan y Brooklyn, este se sintió marginado. “Los dos hombres no se hablaron durante cuatro meses en 2019”, detalló el medio.
Byford llegó a Nueva York después de dirigir el sistema de transporte en Toronto, donde ganó un premio al sistema de tránsito del año de la Asociación Estadounidense de Transporte Público. Dirigió las redes de tránsito de Londres y Sydney.

Guest Editorial: Two Americas in school textbooks

Texto completo: This editorial is from the San Diego Union-Tribune:
When former New York senator and scholar Daniel Patrick Moynihan died in 2003, he was celebrated for his hugely productive careers in both politics and academia and admired for his wit. His aphorism — “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” — was often cited.
But as the 21st century careens along, Moynihan’s premise has taken a beating. Technology has made it easier for ideologues to only get information that reinforces their existing views. Moynihan’s assumption that people could carry on arguments over policy issues while agreeing on basic facts has been obliterated. The most prominent examples: Those on the left like to cite the skepticism many conservatives have about climate change, which runs counter to the views of the vast majority of scientists. And those on the right often bring up the warnings many progressives make about the risks of genetically modified food, which also are contrary to the views of the vast majority of scientists.
This partisan framing goes far beyond such high-profile issues. Every day, Americans can watch TV shows, check out websites or listen to podcasts that present not just different opinions but different factual frameworks. And as a deeply troubling recent story in the New York Times pointed out, this fact shading is now common in school textbooks.
The New York Times analyzed eight of the most popular history textbooks used in both California and Texas public schools — textbooks with the same authors and same publishers. In both states, laws have been passed and teaching standards set that reflect the values of state lawmakers and members of the state board of education. As a result, there are now basic differences in how the history books in America’s two most populous states deal with such profound issues as race and the economy.
In discussions of the “white flight” phenomenon from the 1950s and 1960s in which millions of white Americans moved from big cities to more homogenous suburbs, the California history textbook published by McGraw-Hill says some of these Americans were “driven by a desire to get away from more culturally diverse neighborhoods” — i.e., racism. The Texas textbook states that some of these Americans “wished to escape the crime and congestion of the city” — also loaded language.
In discussions of capitalism, The New York Times noted California textbooks “sometimes read like a brief from a Bernie Sanders rally.” Those in Texas celebrate the wealth-creating free-market economy.
The same differences are apparent in how the textbooks deal with everything from gun rights and the Harlem Renaissance to immigration and gender. In California, the New York Times noted, education bureaucrats persuaded one textbook publisher to not use the word “massacre” to describe how 19th-century Native Americans responded to white settlers. In Texas, they got another publisher to emphasize religious values of America’s founders.
The sad news is there is little reason to hope that this front in America’s ongoing culture wars is going to change. A survey of 8,000 Americans released in 2018 by researchers at YouGov and the More in Common civics group found that while most Americans are generally centrist, 14% of residents are “starkly polarized” people on the left and right who tend to “dominate public debate in the digital age.”
Such Californians and Texans likely love their state officials putting their thumbs on the scales in the teaching of history. But the rest of us should fear this as one more sign of the clout of a relative handful of Americans who reject ideas that don’t fit in with their worldview, facts be damned or shaded.
American history has long been framed by those who write it. That’s clearer the more divided we get.

Texto completo: Philadelphia Museum of Art CEO Timothy Rub offered an apology to the museum's rank-and-file Wednesday morning during a "town hall" in the museum's Great Stair Hall that was his first all-staff meeting since allegations surfaced involving the behavior of a former manager.
Rub called for the meeting after a Jan. 10 New York Times article that detailed complaints of several women who worked with Joshua R. Helmer while he was employed at the Art Museum as its assistant director for interpretation.
Rub indicated that his apology, directed to museum staff and to the women who spoke to the New York Times, was for the confidence he had put in Helmer, according to employees who attended the hour-plus meeting held inside the main Art Museum building before it opened to the public.
The Art Museum had declined a request for reporters to go to the meeting - which was attended by about 200 of the museum's more than 500 employees - but several staffers said Rub offered an address they found short on details.
"I hoped for strong policy statements that empower staff, like, 'This is how we will respond consistently to reports of harassment,' " said Sarah Shaw, a museum educator who attended Wednesday's meeting. "But I didn't hear that."
Instead, she said, museum leadership offered staffers "apologies and admissions of failure, which seem like the bare-minimum first step."
"There was lots of talk about moving forward, but it wasn't substantive," she said.
Museum educator Adam Rizzo echoed Shaw's sentiments.
Specific actions by the museum, like instating an anonymous harassment reporting line, or requiring mandatory antiharassment training, would instill more faith in the institution, he said.
"I would love to believe the apology," Rizzo said. "But it's hard to do the work when you believe the institution isn't holding up their end of things."
Rub offered this statement Wednesday evening through a spokesperson: "I know that actions speak louder than words. It is my firm commitment to do all that is necessary to address our issues head on."
During Wednesday's meeting, employees were allowed to ask questions at microphones.
"I think people felt a little braver as each person spoke," said one junior-level employee who asked not to be named. "It was still very vague."
One of the topics that came up was the "cultural assessment" by an outside third party that Rub promised to the staff prior to Wednesday's town hall event. "People were asking, 'What is this cultural assessment?' " the junior-level employee said. "Even Timothy said he didn't know what it was or what it would look like. He told us to be patient."
Rub said the museum will provide more details on the assessment at an all-staff meeting Monday, employees said.
After Wednesday's meeting, Rizzo commended colleagues from across the institution who expressed their concerns during the town hall.
"They asked questions that were really challenging of [Rub]," he said. "I think that takes a degree of bravery."
After the Times' report published, Rizzo and some colleagues drafted a statement of solidarity with the women who spoke out, calling for structural change within the institution. The statement has been signed by nearly 400 current and former museum staff.
"I think people are just angry," Rizzo said, adding that staffers' questions at the town hall made it clear that "this isn't just about Josh."
Rub has been meeting with individual departments in recent days, but this was the first all-staff meeting since the Times article in which several women alleged that Helmer pursued relationships with them while holding out possibilities for professional opportunities.
Helmer has not addressed the allegations. He declined to talk with the Times about his relationships, attributing the allegations against him as a function of office politics. "You make enemies," he told the newspaper.
Helmer left the museum in 2018, and then took the top job at the Erie Art Museum - a post from which he was separated a few days after the Times story appeared and circulation began of online petitions supporting the women quoted in the article.
On Friday, Art Museum board chair Leslie Anne Miller told staff in an email that she would be taking the reins of an assessment that would bring in "an independent third party to understand what brought us here and most importantly what we need to change to be sure it never happens again."
To "ensure transparency and objectivity, I have agreed to lead this process," her note said.
The goal of the process is to understand and remedy issues brought forward by the staff, Rub wrote in a separate Friday email to employees. "Nothing is more important to all of us than ensuring that the museum is a safe, welcoming, productive place, free from misconduct of any kind, where all voices are heard, and where there is no fear of coming forward to report any type of concern," Rub wrote.
After the museum opened to the public following Wednesday's meeting, museum staff could be seen once again wearing red buttons reading, "We Believe Women." Some said they felt the meeting conveyed leadership was "trying to do better," while others felt the apology and town hall felt like too little, too late.
Shaw said she still didn't have clarity on what a cultural assessment is, how the assessment can be independent if it's conducted under the board chair, or how the Philadelphia museum's leadership will be held accountable.
She also said she didn't feel confident that institutional policies were adequate. "I still don't know how we're going to address the systemic inequities that allowed a Josh Helmer to happen."

Texto completo: A widely watched case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday pitting school-choice advocates against proponents of public schools has been described by both sides as having potential to profoundly reshape the national education landscape.
Yet it is unclear to what extent Espinoza vs. Montana Department of Revenue could affect Pennsylvania. The case centers on the Montana Supreme Court's decision to end a state program that gave students scholarships to attend private schools. The court based its decision on a state constitutional provision that bars government money from going toward religious schools.
Pennsylvania's constitution also restricts the use of public education funding for religious schools - and, like Montana, has programs that award scholarships to students to attend private schools.
Here's what you need to know:
How did the Espinoza case begin?
The case was brought by three Montana mothers of children in a Christian school who challenged a state decision that made students in religious schools ineligible for a scholarship program created by the state in 2015.
In response, the Montana Supreme Court struck down the program, based on language in the state constitution prohibiting the appropriation of government money for religious institutions.
Such provisions are sometimes called Blaine Amendments. Critics say the provisions, named after Congressman James Blaine, of Maine, reflect anti-Catholic bias in the mid-19th century.
Pennsylvania is among the 37 states with such provisions, according to the Institute for Justice, the nonprofit representing the mothers in the Espinoza case.
Why is it significant?
School-choice advocates and President Donald Trump's administration are hoping the high court will strike down the provisions, which Education Secretary Betsy DeVos described as the "last acceptable prejudice."
"Across the nation, many traditional public schools are not working, and the repercussions are posing great danger," Jeanne Allen, CEO of the Center for Education Reform, and Paul Clement, U.S. solicitor during George W. Bush's administration, wrote in a Time op-ed Tuesday.
Teachers' unions and supporters of public schools, meanwhile, say such a ruling could jeopardize the broader public education system, validating private-school voucher programs they say would drain money from public schools.
If it rules in favor of the petitioners, "the Supreme Court will be responsible for unleashing a virtual earthquake in this country that threatens both religious liberty and public education," American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten said Wednesday.
How will it affect Pennsylvania?
Like a number of states, Pennsylvania already has programs that give money to students to attend private and religious schools. The programs, which grant tax credits to businesses and individuals in exchange for donating to the scholarships, function similarly to vouchers.
But they don't violate Pennsylvania's prohibition against using public education money for religious schools for two reasons, said Colleen Hroncich, senior policy analyst at the Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative advocacy group in Harrisburg.
Pennsylvania's constitution specifies that "no money raised for the support of the public schools of the Commonwealth" shall be used for any religious school. The money for the tax-credit programs comes from the state's General Fund, which isn't raised specifically for schools, Hroncich said.
And the state doesn't give money directly to religious schools, she said. Rather, it gives tax credits to donors who support scholarships - many of which end up being used by students to attend religious schools.
Hroncich doesn't believe a Supreme Court ruling against the Espinoza petitioners would doom Pennsylvania's programs, "because they're written so specifically as to be constitutional."
But a ruling in favor, she said, "might inspire lawmakers to provide more options for our students."
Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Turzai of Allegheny County, have pushed for the growth of the tax-credit programs - the larger of which grants $135 million a year in K-12 scholarships - citing unmet demand from families and donors. Gov. Tom Wolf last year vetoed an expansion of one of the programs, saying the measure didn't provide enough accountability for tax dollars. He ultimately agreed to a smaller increase in the budget.
Donna Cooper, executive director of Public Citizens for Children and Youth, a public education advocacy group, said Pennsylvania's tax-credit programs had not been tested by state courts. Depending on the court's ruling, "we may end up rethinking" whether the tax-credit programs and their support for religious education is appropriate, Cooper said.
In addition, public-education advocates say the issue is about more than tax-credit programs. Petitioners in the Espinoza case are "seeking a broader constitutional ruling" that "could fuel future lawsuits" over whether private schools are entitled to public funding, said Chris Lilienthial, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, the statewide teachers union.
"It really depends on how far the court is willing to go in its ruling, and how it handles this case," Lilienthal said.
What happened in court?
During oral arguments in Washington on Wednesday, some conservative justices seemed favorable toward the petitioners.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the constitutional provisions in states barring aid for religious schools were rooted in "grotesque religious bigotry" against Catholics, according to the Associated Press.
Some of the court's liberal justices, meanwhile, suggested the Montana court hadn't discriminated because it ended the program for all private schools, not just religious ones. "So where's the harm?" asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the AP reported.
The New York Times reported that Chief Justice John Roberts - often seen as part of the 5-4 conservative majority on the court - "seemed to be searching for a limiting principle, one that would allow the scholarships but stop short of requiring state support for religious education in other contexts."
A decision is expected before the court's term ends in June.

Texto completo: Based partly on the observations of Harvard University oceanographer James J. McCarthy, the first paragraph of an August 2000 New York Times story was brief and blunt: “The North Pole is melting."
He was a lecturer on a natural history tour of the Arctic that summer and was surprised by what he saw — and more importantly, what he didn't see — when the ship reached the North Pole. The typical thick, multiyear ice was absent.
“What was really unusual was that over a period of two weeks we never had a day of what would be considered normal ice," he told the Times. “When we reached the pole and found open water, that simply punctuated what we were seeing everywhere. These were conditions that did not seem representative of a transient phenomenon."
An award-winning scientist whose observations about the pace and intensity of climate change inspired and informed students, colleagues, and politicians, Dr. McCarthy died Dec. 11 of pulmonary fibrosis. He was 75 and lived in Arlington.
“Dr. James McCarthy was an amazing man, a loyal friend, world-class oceanographer, a passionate advocate for science and for our climate balance," former vice president Al Gore wrote for a Harvard University Center for the Environment tribute webpage.
“Nobody communicated the importance of the climate crisis in the context of the oceans as eloquently and passionately as Jim," added Gore, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work focusing attention on climate change.
The Alexander Agassiz professor of biological oceanography and director emeritus of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Dr. McCarthy was awarded the 2018 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, whose presenters hailed him for having “fostered and led cooperative efforts among scientific disciplines to forge new, global-scale perspectives on environmental change."
In 2008, he received the Walker Prize from the Museum of Science in Boston, which honors “meritorious published scientific investigation and discovery."
Dr. McCarthy also had led a working group and was lead author on an assessment report for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Gore.
“Jim's own research on biological oceanography probed the nitrogen cycle in the oceans, seeking to understand how the ecology of plankton affected and was affected by nutrient cycling," Dan Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, wrote for the center's tribute page.
“But Jim's impact went far beyond his own research," Schrag added. “Jim promoted the best in all of us through his numerous leadership positions inside and outside of Harvard and also through his extraordinary devotion to students."
Dr. McCarthy formerly chaired the board of the Union of Concerned Scientists. On its website, the organization's current president, Ken Kimmell, called him “a passionate advocate for the essential role science plays in our democracy."
Though Dr. McCarthy witnessed the impact of climate change firsthand and was a leading voice insisting that the warnings of scientists be heeded, he remained hopeful — partly because of what he saw each day on Harvard's campus.
“This is the generation that will make a difference. I know college students. I live with 400 of them," he told the Globe in 2008.
“I'm inspired by them," he added. “I'm very optimistic."
Dr. McCarthy and his wife, Sue,were deans of Pforzheimer House at Harvard from 1996 to 2009.
“He always was a joyous person," she said. “He always was an optimist."
In the 2008 Globe interview, Dr. McCarthy said he believed humanity had “turned a corner. People are feeling the urgency, and our politicians are following the people."
And speaking at the event Harvard Thinks Green in December 2011, Dr. McCarthy reminded the audience that even incremental steps are important.
“Small changes, that often have no impact on our lifestyles, add up to significant change," he said.
James Joseph McCarthy was born on Jan. 25, 1944, and grew up in Sweet Home, Ore.
He was the second of four children whose parents were Dr. James McCarthy, a chiropractor, and Errilla Gearhart, an elementary schoolteacher.
In an interview last year with Steve Curwood for the Public Radio International program “Living on Earth," Dr. McCarthy recalled “a very formative moment" in childhood when he and his father were exploring a pond at the edge of the community. They collected water in a test tube and examined it under a microscope.
“I knew there were fish in those ponds and I knew there were bugs, but I had no idea what was living there in the microscopic realm," he told Curwood.
That experience helped form Dr. McCarthy's aspiration to pursue science and to be “inclined toward something that would have me involved in field work, rather than totally lab-based."
He graduated from Gonzaga University with a bachelor's degree in biology and received a doctorate in biological oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California.
At Scripps he met Mary Suzanne Tilsworth, whom he married in 1969.
“Jim was many things, but I think one of the driving forces in his life is that he was enormously curious about the world that he lived in and the people. There was so much to learn and know," she said.
“He also was an incredibly kind and compassionate person in the best possible way," she added. “He let people be themselves, but he was always encouraging them."
Away from work, Dr. McCarthy was drawn to the precise discipline of fly-fishing. He also made furniture and engaged in woodworking throughout his life.
He was a research scientist at Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at Harvard in 1974.
At Harvard, he helped found and had served as head tutor for the environmental science and public policy concentration.
“His commitment to students and to making the world a better place inspired me, and I am sure many others, to do more and to care more," Missy Holbrook, a Harvard professor who is now the concentration's head tutor, wrote for the university's tribute page.
For “Living on Earth," Dr. McCarthy said he believed the importance of climate change had become an integral part of the lives of those in the next generation.
“What more than anything else gives me hope is seeing the young people today, the college-age population who are learning about this subject," he said, adding that “wherever they go, whether they go into business and into the public sector, any position in any career, they're carrying with them an understanding."
In addition to his wife, Sue, Dr. McCarthy leaves their two sons, Jamie of Houston and Ryan of Brooklyn, N.Y.; a brother, Richard of Cottage Grove, Ore.; and two granddaughters.
A memorial service will be held at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Memorial Church in Harvard Yard.
Though optimistic, Dr. McCarthy stressed that addressing climate change is a task that can't be ignored.
“If you lose a day working on this problem now, it's not like you can work an extra day later and catch up," he told Curwood.
“The carbon dioxide we're putting in the atmosphere now, a portion of that will be in the atmosphere hundreds of thousands of years from now," he added. “So everything you can do to slow it today makes tomorrow easier."

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday denounced immigration officials for denying Iranian students entry at Logan Airport and removing one student against a judge's orders this week. She said their actions were the direct result of President Trump's policies, which she would reverse immediately, if elected president.
“On the first day of my administration, I will lift the Muslim ban, and I believe that sends a message all across the country," Warren said during a video conference with The Boston Globe editorial board.
Mohammad Shahab Dehghani Hossein Abadi, a 24-year-old student, was detained by Customs and Border Protection after arriving at Logan Sunday. Though his lawyers filed an emergency petition and a judge ordered a 48-hour stay, he was flown out of the country before a hearing could take place.
Warren challenged the idea that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies are lacking federal oversight or operating without accountability in detaining Iranians.
“I think they have exactly as much oversight as the Trump administration wants them to have and they are doing exactly what the Trump administration wants them to do," Warren said.
At least three Iranian students have been barred from attending Boston-area schools since September, the Globe reported, and at least 11 students with valid visas have been turned away since August nationwide, according to The New York Times.
Trump's travel ban, which ignited protests at airports when he announced it three years ago, now restricts immigration from five majority-Muslim nations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as Venezuela and North Korea. The ban suspended visas to those countries but allowed for exceptions, including for students.
But immigration lawyers told the Globe this week that they are seeing more cases of Iranian students being turned away at Logan. And they asserted that there is growing evidence of CBP ignoring district court orders.
If she is elected president, Warren said, she would reverse course and hold both agencies accountable.
“They are not entitled to break the law and I will make it clear as president where my priorities are," she said. “And my priorities are not in trying to hang out in neighborhoods and attack families and tear people apart. These are our neighbors and our friends, many of them, who have been terrified by this administration."
“I will make it clear – and I'm making it clear during my campaign – that when I am president, this will stop," Warren said.
Warren spoke with the editorial board, which is considering endorsements in the Democratic nomination for president.
The New York Times on Sunday endorsed both Warren and US Senator Amy Klobuchar in the Democratic race for president, calling Warren the most effective advocate of the “radical" approach and Klobuchar the “realist."
“I thought what a strange way to describe what I fight for," Warren responded when asked about it.
She said she's focused her campaign on anti-corruption efforts and tightening up the influence of money.
“Asking your government to work for you — I just frankly don't think is radical," she said.
She acknowledged that she's proposing “big structural change" by introducing a wealth tax to invest in child care, public schools, and post-high-school education.

Moore will skip another season

Texto completo: For the second consecutive year, Maya Moore is devoting her time to life rather than basketball. As a result the Lynx are once again preparing to play without her.
Moore's decision to skip the WNBA season again was first reported in an interview with the New York Times that was published online Wednesday. Moore said she also will not vie for a spot on the United States Olympic team for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo.
"I'm in a really good place right now with my life, and I don't want to change anything," Moore, 30, told the Times. "Basketball has not been foremost in my mind. I've been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road."
Moore played eight seasons with the Lynx, winning four WNBA championships, and was the league's MVP in 2014. She took home Olympic gold medals in women's basketball in 2012 and 2016.
She surprised the Lynx and the WNBA last February when she announced that she intended to take a year off to focus on criminal justice reform, particularly the case of Jonathan Irons, a man serving a 50-year prison sentence for burglary and assault in Moore's hometown, Jefferson City, Mo. Moore believes he was wrongly convicted.
Lynx coach and General Manger Cheryl Reeve said she got the news from Moore in a conversation Tuesday.
The two sides have been in touch regularly over the past year. But, Reeve said, the conversations were always about Moore's part in the Irons case and her ministry and not about basketball.
"We were engaged with the work she was involved in," Reeve told the Star Tribune on Wednesday after the Times report was published. "Because the conversations were not basketball-specific, there was no assumption about what she was going to do, one way or another. When I listen to Maya, hear the way she expresses herself, I know how much that work -- with the Irons case and her ministry work -- has taken out of her, how much she's had to give. It makes sense that the timing of this season isn't going to work with her."
So, for a second consecutive season, the Lynx will enter a season without Moore.
Last season, without Moore, Rebekkah Brunson and Lindsay Whalen, the Lynx finished 18-16 and tied for sixth overall with Seattle before losing in the first round of the playoffs.
As Reeve has said many times, Moore is not replaceable.
"What you have to do is figure out what you do have, and how to be successful," Reeve said. "I thought our team last year showed our ability to be resilient and remain a playoff team. … I know Maya wishes us the best in that. We're hoping we can be even more successful this season."
It was important to know Moore's plans because WNBA free agency negotiations begin Tuesday.
Sylvia Fowles returns at center, with Damiris Dantas and last season's rookie of the year Napheesa Collier at forward. The Lynx have a solid backup for Fowles in Temi Fagbenle, who will be given a tender to retain her rights. And there is depth at forward, with Karima Christmas-Kelly (right knee) expected back at full health as well as Jessica Shepard, who had her right anterior cruciate ligament surgically repaired.
So much of the Lynx's focus in free agency could be on the backcourt, with point guard Danielle Robinson a free agent. Moore's $117,000 salary will not count against the team's cap.
Reeve said she had planned for either outcome, Moore returning or not.
Moore signed a two-year deal before announcing her decision a year ago. That contract will run out after this season. The Lynx would still retain her rights, but she would have to sign a new contract to return to the WNBA in 2021.
"I told her there is always a place for her here," Reeve said.
Asked by the Times if she would ever play basketball again, Moore said:
"I don't feel like this is the right time for me to retire. Retirement is something that is a big deal, and there is a right way to do it well, and this is not the time for me."

Texto completo: A Portuguese banker was found dead after being identified as a suspect in a fraud case against Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's former president.
Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, 45 years old, apparently hanged himself and had attempted suicide earlier this month, Lisbon police said. His death came after Angola prosecutors identified him Wednesday at a press conference in Luanda, the African nation's capital, as a suspect in a wide-ranging investigation of alleged money laundering and fraud by Ms. dos Santos.
She and three business associates were also named suspects.
Mr. Ribeiro da Cunha was a private-banking director at EuroBic, a Portuguese bank that Ms. dos Santos partly owns, according to press reports in Portugal. His body was discovered Wednesday in a garage in an upscale Lisbon neighborhood, police said in a statement Thursday. Representatives for EuroBic didn't respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors in Angola allege that Ms. dos Santos and others carried out transactions with government-owned companies that resulted in a $1.14 billion loss for the state. In December, an Angola court froze her assets in the country, according to a court order reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The allegations are "completely unfounded," Ms. dos Santos said earlier this week in a statement.
"I have always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators," she said. "I am ready to fight through the international courts to defend my good name."
On Sunday, news outlets including the New York Times and BBC began a series of reports about Ms. dos Santos's business empire, based on what they said were more than 700,000 leaked documents. The reports have focused on how Ms. dos Santos allegedly got preferential access when her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, was president to invest in land, oil, diamond and telecommunications deals and then shielded her riches with assistance from consulting firms, law firms and Portuguese banks. Forbes estimates her wealth at $2.1 billion.
At EuroBic, Mr. Ribeiro da Cunha allegedly approved $58 million in payments from the Angola state oil company, Sonangol, to companies linked to Ms. dos Santos in November 2017, according to a report by Quartz, citing leaked documents and bank statements. That month, Ms. dos Santos was dismissed as Sonangol's chief executive.
Ms. dos Santos's father was president of Angola for 38 years until September 2017. His successor, João Lourenço, launched an anticorruption drive, and Angola prosecutors have also investigated other dos Santos family members and their associates.
On Wednesday, EuroBic said Ms. dos Santos would sell her stake in the bank "in the very short term." Earlier this week, it said it would terminate commercial relationships with entities controlled by Ms. dos Santos and her close associates and would investigate earlier transactions.
Ms. dos Santos, 46, was born in the Soviet Union, where her father was studying engineering. She earned her degree in the same field at King's College London and returned to Angola in the early 1990s during a lull in the country's civil war.
In 2016, the Journal reported that some members of the European Parliament had raised questions about the purchase of a majority stake in a company in Portugal, where Ms. dos Santos has many investments. They suspected that the Angolan state might have indirectly financed major acquisitions for Ms. dos Santos, according to a letter they sent to the European Commission.
Ms. dos Santos denied the allegation, telling the Journal that she started Miami Beach, now one of Luanda's most expensive nightclubs, with some savings. Her business empire grew from there.

Covering impeachment: Senate rules test press duty to inform

Resumen: A clampdown on access during impeachment has reporters scrambling for comments from lawmakers, many of whom have taken to posting Twitter videos.

Texto completo: The Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump started off with a straitjacket of rules, particularly on communications. No cellphones, no talking allowed for senators in the chamber. For reporters, no “walk and talk” interviews with senators in the hallways. Instead, the media were to be confined to roped-off pens at the Senate exits.
But like water flowing downhill, it’s hard to stop lawmakers and media from finding each other, or senators from getting their message out.
“Any political figure that has something to say will find a way to say it. If they want the press to find them, they will be found,” says Mo Elleithee, former communications director for the Democratic National Committee, and now at Georgetown University.
During an afternoon break on Wednesday, at least seven senators stopped to talk with reporters penned behind ropes and stanchions near a Senate exit. Democratic presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota advised her Republican colleagues to “start acting like a juror” and allow witnesses in the trial. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas declared “nothing new” after more than two hours of opening arguments. 
The arguments were a “tour de force!” responded Minority Leader Charles Schumer, waiting for Senator Cornyn to finish so he could have his say. The New Yorker made sure to repeat his message in front of television cameras and other media at a stakeout near the Senate basement.
Senators from both sides are talking informally with reporters in these locations and elsewhere, as well as holding press conferences and doing television interviews. Most notably, many are filing daily updates on Twitter, including sharing tips on how they are enduring hours on end of presentations.
Food and drink other than water (plain or fizzy) or milk (originally for health reasons) are forbidden in the chamber. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, joked on Twitter that “milk is the big news today,” as his seatmate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, went for the white stuff. He also shared an impeachment survival trick: “During the short breaks, unwrap a few hard candies and put them in your desk drawer. That way you avoid the noise of unwrapping them when you sneak one mid-trial.”
Many Democrats have been sharing their views of the day’s events in brief, conversational videos that they post to Twitter, speaking directly to constituents. “It was a long, long day and night last night,” started out Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama, the most endangered Democrat in the Senate, on Wednesday.
“Yesterday was bananas,” said Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, in another Twitter video. In a brief interview later, she explains that the videos are meant to “keep people engaged, and to remind them that they are part of this process ... and what it’s really like.”
The video strategy fits with today’s reality TV ethos, says Mr. Elleithee, where people want to see more than fixed cameras focused on the Senate chamber. Democrats want voters to be invested in the impeachment process, and they are hoping to speak to a broader electorate that includes independents.
Fewer Republicans have been doing speak-to-camera videos. But they’re still finding ways to get their messages out. 
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has been tweeting out a daily diary of sorts. “House began presenting their case over course of 8 hours,” he wrote Wednesday on Twitter. “Offered detailed timeline of the events underpinning their case. We heard recorded testimony of witnesses, supplemented by transcripts & evidence gathered from press & social media. Will continue tomorrow.”
These individual takes, of course, are only each lawmaker’s opinion. They aren’t reported pieces with comments from both sides and relevant context. They don’t give Americans the full picture of this historic trial, however partisan it may be.
Which is why journalists have objected so strenuously to the restrictions imposed on them by the Senate Republican leadership and the sergeant-at-arms.
Under normal circumstances, the Hill is the most accessible reporting spot on government in Washington. A hard congressional pass allows reporters to roam freely in the corridors of the Capitol and its office buildings. During the trial, senators can visit a pen – if they choose. But reporters aren’t able to find other viewpoints when they’re locked into a few square feet for 30 minutes or an hour during a break.
Lawmakers can jump over the media, but “what we say has more credibility, I would hope,” says veteran New York Times reporter Carl Hulse. “We’re serving a real purpose here, trying to sort out a pretty confusing mess that a lot of people don’t understand.” 
The restrictions have forced news organizations to adjust, taking more time to try to reach senators by phone and adding reporters to be in more places to try to catch them. That’s doable for a news giant like The New York Times, but it’s harder for smaller outlets.
Take the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It has one reporter on the Hill, Daniel Moore. “The restrictions make it really difficult,” he says, preventing him from getting “anything meaningful” from either of the senators he covers from the swing state of Pennsylvania – Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Bob Casey.
As of Day 3 of the trial, Mr. Moore had not been able to reach either senator during a break or on the phone. Normally, he’s got great access, he says, but in this case he has had to rely on the senators’ public comments.
Senator Toomey, who won his last race by a close margin, has offered up very little. When swarmed by reporters as he entered the Capitol’s internal subway, the senator commented only that the candy in the Senate cloakroom was running low.
Mr. Moore had better success on Thursday, speaking with Senator Casey on a phone press conference for Pennsylvania reporters, and gleaning some insight on Senator Toomey’s views from a television interview.
“I don’t want this to sound just like reporters whining,” says Sarah Wire, who is chair of the Standing Committee of Correspondents on the Hill. “We have a responsibility to the American people, to our readers and to viewers, and that’s my concern.”
Still, since the trial started, things have loosened up a bit – both on the Senate floor and with journalists. Senators are no longer glued to their seats, but are disappearing for a moment (or quite a bit longer). They’re standing or stretching their legs at the back of the chamber. They can be seen munching on candy bars and chewing gum. Some even say they welcome being untethered from their cellphones.
Reporters are seeing fewer instances of Capitol police interrupting interviews mid-conversation, according to Ms. Wire, who writes for the Los Angeles Times. They’re also discovering other places to intercept senators.
“That’s what we do for a living,” she says. During the Clinton impeachment, reporters were not allowed on the same floor as the Senate chamber, which is how the underground stakeout by the subway cars got started, she explains. And indeed, during that five-week trial, restrictions on journalists eased.
“That trial went on for a very long time,” says Mr. Hulse. “It’s very hard to sustain that level of red alert.”

Greta Thunberg’s words don't have the same import as those spoken by President Trump

Resumen: What people are saying about President Donald Trump, Greta Thunberg and climate change.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump: “I’m pleased to announce the United States will join One Trillion Trees Initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. . . . We will continue to show strong leadership in restoring, growing and better managing our trees and our forests. This is not a time for pessimism; this is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action. . . . Alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives. ”
Greta Thunberg: “We are not telling you to ‘offset your emissions’ by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate. Planting trees is good, of course, but it’s nowhere near enough of what is needed, and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature. ”
Tom Rogan, Washington Examiner: “Why are we acting as though Thunberg’s words have the same import as those spoken by President Trump? . . . We saw that on Tuesday when Trump and Thunberg separately addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. . . . Thunberg is not the prime minister of her native Sweden. Trump is the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. Each of his statements offers insight into policies that have profound relevance for the global economy, international security and any other issue Trump is addressing. . . . Thunberg is just a 17-year-old with a large soapbox. So yes, praise Thunberg’s commitment to her cause. But let’s stop pretending these two voices are equally relevant. ”
OUR VIEW: American voters sound more like Team Greta on climate change
Kara Swisher, The New York Times: “Reports outline a multitrillion dollar opportunity in . . . renewables, software and artificial intelligence to help us understand climate data, the food production ecosystem and even the way we construct our buildings. . . . The United States and Europe lag in investment and innovation far behind China, which has a staggering lead in solar photovoltaic module production and also a big head start in other renewable technologies, including hydropower and lithium-ion batteries. (Lithium, by the way, is often referred to as the 'white petroleum. ') . . . Those who jump into this climate space will make the next great fortunes in tech. More like ‘profits of boom. ’ And if it takes Trump’s unruly ranting to get our greatest minds focused on stopping our environmental suicide, so be it. ”
Joe Bonfiglio, The Hill: "For years, President Trump has called the climate crisis a 'Chinese hoax,' a 'big scam' and even a 'make-believe problem. ' But recently and suddenly, his rhetoric has shifted. This week, while announcing a major weakening of environmental protections, he said of climate change, 'nothing’s a hoax about that. It’s a very serious subject. ' Has Donald Trump suddenly become worried about rising climate pollution and its impact on our health and economy? Did he read through the National Climate Assessment and change his long-held view on the science of climate change? More likely, he read the polls. . . . For Trump, the hard math is not that climate pollution in our atmosphere has reached record levels — it’s that he can’t be reelected without winning Florida, a state on the front line of climate impacts.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) - Jim Lehrer, co-host and later host of the nightly PBS "NewsHour" that for decades offered a thoughtful take on current events, has died, PBS said Thursday. He was 85.
Lehner died “peacefully in his sleep,” according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983 and more recently, had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008.
For Lehrer, and for his friend and longtime partner Robert MacNeil, broadcast journalism was a service, with public understanding of events and issues its primary goal. Lehrer was also a frequent moderator of presidential debates.
"We both believed the American people were not as stupid as some of the folks publishing and programming for them believed," Lehrer wrote in his 1992 memoir, "A Bus of My Own."
"We were convinced they cared about the significant matters of human events. ... And we were certain they could and would hang in there more than 35 seconds for information about those subjects if given a chance."
The half-hour "Robert MacNeil Report" began on PBS in 1975 with Lehrer as Washington correspondent. The two had already made names for themselves at the then-fledgling network through their work with the National Public Affairs Center for Television and its coverage of the Watergate hearings in 1973.
The nightly news broadcast, later retitled the "MacNeil-Lehrer Report," became the nation's first one-hour TV news broadcast in 1983 and was then known as the "MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour." After MacNeil bowed out in 1995, it became "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer."
“I’m heartbroken at the loss of someone who was central to my professional life, a mentor to me and someone whose friendship I’ve cherished for decades,” said Judy Woodruff, anchor and managing editor of the PBS NewsHour, in a statement.
Politics, international relations, economics, science, even developments in the arts were all given lengthy, detailed coverage in their show.
"When we expanded to the hour, it changed from being a supplement to an alternative," Lehrer said in 1990. "Now we take the position that if you're looking for a place to go every 24 hours and find out what's happened and get some in-depth treatment, we're the place."
Lehrer moderated his first presidential debate in 1988 and was a frequent consensus choice for the task in subsequent presidential contests.
"Anybody who would say it's just another TV show is a liar or a fool," he once said. "I know how important it is, but it's not about me. It's what the candidates say that matters."
He also anchored PBS coverage of inaugurations and conventions, dismissing criticism from other TV news organizations that the latter had become too scripted to yield much in the way of real news.
"I think when the major political parties of this country gather together their people and resources in one place to nominate their candidates, that's important," he told The Associated Press in 2000. "To me, it's a non-argument. I don't see why someone would argue that it wasn't important."
Naturally, Lehrer came in for some knocks for being so low-key in the big televised events. After a matchup between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, David Letterman cracked, "Last night was probably the first and only that time Jim Lehrer (was) the most exciting person in the room."
But the real-life Lehrer - who had a tradition of buying a new tie for good luck before each debate - was more colorful than he might have seemed on PBS.
On the side, he was also a novelist and sometime playwright whose debut novel, "Viva Max!", was made into a movie starring Peter Ustinov. He did a whole series of novels about the adventures of an Oklahoma politician known as The One-Eyed Mack.
"Hemingway said this, too: If you paid attention as a reporter, then when the time came to write fiction you'd have something to write about," Lehrer told The Associated Press in 1991.
"And it turned out I did. And I've got all these stories stored up after 30 years in the news business. And they're just flowing out of me."
As Lehrer turned 75 in spring 2009, PBS announced the show would be retitled as "PBS NewsHour" later in the year, with Lehrer pairing up on anchor duties with other show regulars.
He said he approved of the changes, telling The New York Times that having a pair of anchors would "shake things up a bit," even as all sectors of the news business struggle to meet changing reader and viewer demands.
Lehrer was born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1934, the son of parents who ran a bus line. In addition to titling his memoir "A Bus of My Own," he collected bus memorabilia - from station signs to a real 1946 Flxible Clipper bus.
After graduation from college in 1956, he served three years in the Marines - and later called the experience so valuable he thought all young people should take part in national service.
"I had no close calls, no rendezvous with danger, no skirted destinies with death," he wrote. "What I had was a chance to discover and test myself, physically and emotionally and spiritually, in important, lasting ways."
He went to work from 1959 to 1970 at The Dallas Morning News and the now-defunct Dallas Times-Herald. Lehrer jumped to television on a Dallas nightly newscast.
Lehrer wrote that it was ironic that the Watergate hearings helped establish the importance of public TV, since President Richard Nixon hated public broadcasting. He also recalled that the lengthy hearings gave him the chance to practice his new craft, and MacNeil, already a veteran, gave him valuable pointers on how to speak on camera clearly and conversationally.
He is survived by his wife, Kate; three daughters: Jamie, Lucy, and Amanda; and six grandchildren.

After graduation from college in 1956, he served three years in the Marines - and later called the experience so valuable he thought all young people should take part in national service.
"I had no close calls, no rendezvous with danger, no skirted destinies with death," he wrote. "What I had was a chance to discover and test myself, physically and emotionally and spiritually, in important, lasting ways."
He went to work from 1959 to 1970 at The Dallas Morning News and the now-defunct Dallas Times-Herald. Lehrer jumped to television on a Dallas nightly newscast.
Lehrer wrote that it was ironic that the Watergate hearings helped establish the importance of public TV, since President Richard Nixon hated public broadcasting. He also recalled that the lengthy hearings gave him the chance to practice his new craft, and MacNeil, already a veteran, gave him valuable pointers on how to speak on camera clearly and conversationally.
He is survived by his wife, Kate; three daughters: Jamie, Lucy, and Amanda; and six grandchildren.

AGENCY: COLD SNAP GOOD TIME TO GET RID OF IGUANAS HEALTH&amp;SCIENCE

Texto completo: The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission suggested Wednesday that residents take advantage of the cold temperatures this week to get rid of invasive iguanas.
The suggestion came a day after the National Weather Service in South Florida warned everyone about the high falling iguana "rain" chance.
"This isn't something we usually forecast, but don't be surprised if you see Iguanas falling from the trees," the weather service tweeted Tuesday afternoon, adding a reminder that iguanas "are cold-blooded."
Iguanas slow down or become immobilized when the temperatures dip into the 40s - a cold-stunned paralysis that, according to the FWC, "may offer a unique opportunity for people to easily remove nonnative invasive iguanas from their properties."
The FWC, which was criticized last year for encouraging homeowners to kill green iguanas on their property whenever possible, was careful in its social media post to say the removal should be done safely.
It also links to its website that has more information for homeowners about how to deter the lizards that climb trees at night to roost from taking up residence.
But there still doesn't appear to be detailed instructions on how to humanely kill iguanas.
The FWC's suggestion came as iguana meat, dubbed "chicken of the trees," started showing up on Facebook Marketplace overnight as the cold snap apparently made them easy pickings for backyard harvesters.
Several ads for skinned and butchered iguanas, looking like Peking not-duck, were posted in Miami, Doral and Homestead. At least one ad showed what looked like freshly prepped garrobo - a name often used as interchangeable for iguana in parts of Latin America. (The animals may be slightly different species, but both are often found as invasive in South Florida.)
While iguanas are not a protected species they are covered by animal cruelty laws.
The Miami Herald, The New York Times and CNN contributed.

Kobe Bryant: UConn alums Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore could play in the NBA

Texto completo: Kobe Bryant has been a visible presence around the UConn women’s basketball program, attending games in Storrs and Los Angeles with his daughter over the past few seasons.
Apparently his appreciation for the Huskies extends to the alumni.
In an interview with CNN, Bryant said three WNBA players could play in the NBA: Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore and Elena Delle Donne. Taurasi, the WNBA’s all-time leading scorer, plays for the Phoenix Mercury while Moore has spent her career with the Minnesota Lynx, although she sat out last season and plans to miss the 2020 season.
Delle Donne, who committed to UConn out of high school before opting to stay home and play at Delaware, is a two-time WNBA MVP who won a title with the Washington Mystics last season.
“I think there are a couple of players who could play in the NBA right now, honestly,” Bryant said when asked whether his daughter could someday play in the NBA. “There's a lot of players with a lot of skill that could do it. Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Elena Delle Donne. There's a lot of great players out there, so they could certainly keep up with them.”
Bryant has become a high-profile advocate for women’s basketball, but some view the question of whether elite female athletes can compete with men as irrelevant. Writer Lindsay Gibbs argues the “framing of the topic is an insult to women’s sports” and Bryant is not the right choice to be a spokesperson for women’s basketball given his past.
Meanwhile, the praise for Moore comes as the former UConn star announced she will not play for the Lynx this season. In an interview with the New York Times, Moore said she will miss her second consecutive WNBA season and will not be part of the 2020 Olympics as she devotes herself to criminal justice reform.
Moore has been advocating for the release of Jonathan Irons, who is serving a 50-year sentence for burglary and assault.
“I’m in a really good place right now with my life, and I don’t want to change anything,” Moore told The Times in a telephone interview from her Atlanta home. “Basketball has not been foremost in my mind. I’ve been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I’ve been able to be there for Jonathan.”
Moore met Irons during a visit to the Jefferson City Correctional Center in Missouri three years ago. Irons, who is African-American, was convicted by an all-white jury despite a lack of evidence or witnesses.
A five-time WNBA All-Star, Moore is one of the best players in the world. Asked if she would ever play again, Moore told The Times: “I don’t feel like this is the right time for me to retire. Retirement is something that is a big deal and there is a right way to do it well, and this is not the time for me. ... I have had such a unique experience in the game. I got to experience the best of my craft, and I did that multiple times. There is nothing more I wish I could experience.”

Political scandal isn’t necessarily the end – it can be a beginning

Texto completo: Dear reader:
Reading about former Watergate “plumber” Egil Krogh today, as the fury of President Donald Trump’s Senate trial reverberates in Washington, I was struck by several lessons the arc of Mr. Krogh’s life might offer about larger meanings of President Trump’s pressure campaign against Ukraine and subsequent impeachment.
Mr. Krogh passed away on January 18. As The Washington Post and New York Times obituaries noted on Wednesday, as a young aide in President Richard Nixon’s White House, he was one of the leaders of a group charged with plugging media leaks – hence the “plumber” nickname – and other skullduggery.
In particular, Mr. Krogh approved a burglary into the office of Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsburg’s psychiatrist. Carried out with farcical ineptitude, the break-in produced little but a trail of evidence implicating the White House in the crime.
The possible takeaway for President Trump’s team? All administrations are tempted to work around the executive branch to get sensitive tasks done – illegal or not. Sometimes it's looking for a press leak. Sometimes it’s getting your personal lawyer to push a foreign country to announce an investigation into one of your political opponents.
It’s seldom effective. As political scientist Jonathan Bernstein notes, the bureaucracy is not just a “deep state” blockade; it’s a critical source of ability and expertise about what can – and can’t – be done. Chief executives ignore it at their peril, as Presidents Nixon and now Trump have found out.
The other lesson offered by Mr. Krogh’s biography is that for those caught in the swirl of a historic political scandal, it is not the end of work and hope.
It can be the beginning.
Mr. Krogh eventually pled guilty to burglary and conspiracy charges and served 4 ½ months in prison. He later called the Ellsburg break-in “a meltdown in personal integrity” and through the rest of his life taught and lectured on ethics, so others could learn from his mistakes.
“Integrity, like trust, is all too easy to lose, and too difficult to restore,” he wrote in a 2007 memoir.

Texto completo: Over the holidays I decided on a whim to make some Meyer lemon marmalade and was surprised to find how easy it was to create. I'm crazy about these softball-sized sweet lemons, and my 5-year-old tree went into overdrive this year, growing so many that its small branches were pulled to the ground in a cascade of golden fruit.
With so many folks growing Meyer lemons around here the fruit can be hard to give away, so I found a simple recipe to preserve their delicious flavor for the rest of the year.
I learned that we are lucky to be able to grow Meyer lemons in abundance in North Florida. I asked the New York Times Cooking Community Facebook group for recipe ideas, and the comment section filled up with jealous foodies wanting to buy them. (I am not in the Meyer lemon shipping business, but it sounds like the demand is there if someone wanted to start one.)
Meyer lemons are native to China, and according to Wikipedia were introduced to the United States in 1908 by the agricultural explorer and USDA employee Frank Nicholas Meyer. The compact tree is evergreen with dark glossy leaves, and its fragrant white blooms in springtime will scent the whole yard with lovely citrus notes that attract bees and butterflies.
Meyer lemons are ideal for making marmalade because their mild flavor and thin skin allows you to use the entire lemon (except the seeds), providing all the pectin needed to firm up the mixture.
The recipe couldn't be simpler — just pick a few lemons and grab the sugar and a vanilla bean out of the pantry and you are ready to make this golden, fruity spread. The whole vanilla bean could be replaced with a tablespoon of vanilla extract, but the bean adds a rich, creamy flavor and visually pleasing specks of vanilla seeds throughout the marmalade.
A nice bonus while making Meyer lemon marmalade is that your whole house will smell amazing.
This marmalade is as equally delicious spread on toast or mixed into yogurt as it is alongside smoked salmon. The slices of peel throughout the marmalade are especially tasty, giving a burst of that signature flowery lemon flavor and satisfying bite.
If you'd like, you can add herbs or red pepper flakes to spice it up for a winning sweet and savory combination. I've made two batches using vanilla and with my little tree still weighed down with lemons, I'm ready to try some new combinations.
I'd love to hear your favorite ways to use Meyer lemons, so email me at carafleischer4tally@gmail.com to share your ideas.

Vanilla Meyer Lemon Marmalade
6 Meyers lemons
4 cups water
4 cups sugar
1 vanilla bean or 1 tbsp vanilla extract (optional)
Clean mason jars, lids and rings.
1. Wash the lemons, slice in half and juice them. Remove any seeds and pour the juice into a non-reactive sauce pot.
2. With a sharp knife, slice the lemon peels and any remaining pulp into thin two-inch long strips. Add to the juice in the sauce pot.
3. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium heat and simmer for 20 minutes until the liquid has reduced by half.
4. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Split the vanilla bean by cutting down the middle and scrape the seeds into the mixture, then cut the whole bean into small sections and add to the pot (or add the vanilla extract if not using the whole bean.) Bring to a boil until a candy thermometer reaches 223 degrees and the marmalade "wrinkles" when pushed across a cold plate after being cooled in the freezer for a minute. (Mine took about 20 minutes to get to this stage.)
5. Let the mixture cool for about 5 minutes and then add to clean jars with a ladle, taking care to add a vanilla bean section and an equal amount of peel into each jar. (A jarring funnel helps with this step but isn't necessary.) Wipe the jar rims, add the lids and tighten with the rings. You can either stop here to make refrigerator marmalade, or follow the instructions on Ball Canning to preserve them in a water bath to be shelf stable. www.freshpreserving.com.
Recipe adapted from The Alchemist: Meyer Lemon Marmalade found at http://alchemybaking.blogspot.com
Jars of marmalade preserve the unique flavor of Meyer lemons to be enjoyed year-round.
Cara Fleischer
Making Meyer lemon marmalade is a simple process that uses all of the lemon except the seeds. The first step is juicing the lemons.

Has an editorial endorsement ever decided how you'd vote?

Texto completo: For something that everyone agrees doesn't matter much, the New York Times' endorsement of two candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination sure generated a big buzz.
Political analysts, serious journalists and activists on both sides of the partisan divide offered expert insights on what impact the Times' editorial endorsement of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar might have on the Iowa caucuses next month. There were wide-ranging opinions about not only the merits of the two candidates, but whether it was a cop-out for such a prestigious journal as the Times not to make one choice.
How they did it was really interesting. The editors released video of their roundtable discussions and recaps of what candidates said in interviews with the board. Members of the editorial board went on TV talk shows to discuss how they arrived at their split decision.
The written editorial was long and ponderous, explaining why the Times didn't pick any of the men running and exploring pros and cons of the Warren and Klobuchar candidacies.
Basically, it came down to recognizing that the Democratic Party has moved substantially to the left, and deciding how far the editors wanted to follow that movement. That left Warren, the more liberal of plausible contenders, and Klobuchar, a more moderate candidate with appeal in those Midwest states that tipped the balance to President Trump three years ago.
"Both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration," the editorial said. "If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it. That's why we're endorsing the most effective advocates for each approach."
Wow, that's a straddle to give Hamlet a headache. Traditional new ideas. Moderate radicalism. John Kennedy's New Frontier and Warren Harding's "return to normalcy."
Coverage of the Times endorsement competed for attention with events of Martin Luther King Jr. Day observances, the Second Amendment rally at the Virginia statehouse and — oh, yeah — trial preparations for an impeachment of the president. And one little detail mentioned again and again was that newspaper endorsements don't matter much any more.
If they ever did.
That comes as no surprise to those of us working in newsrooms. For years, we've heard readers complain about endorsements — either their candidate didn't get chosen, or they think an editorial pick shows bias in news coverage, or they just don't like being told how to vote.
Well, newspapers — not even the haughty Times — aren't telling you how to vote. They're expressing their own opinions.
A lot of people say they use newspaper endorsements as a guide for who will not get their votes. Well, that's their editorial opinion. The First Amendment is for you, too.
You may not believe it, but political endorsements don't influence news coverage. Reporters and editorial writers (and columnists) have separate and distinct duties.
And if your favorites didn't get endorsed, you can always write letters to the paper and give another side. Florida used to have a "right to reply" law, which fairly shouted its unconstitutionality, requiring papers to print any response a spurned candidate submitted in response to an editorial choice.
Former Tallahassee Democrat publisher Skip Foster ended candidate endorsements several years ago. The paper has no plans to start again, since Skip left recently.
Foster said it's better for a news organization to discuss issues and events, not people.
"Endorsing injects us into a political process where we ought to be completely Switzerland," he said. "The benefit of the endorsement is outweighed by the harm of getting us out of our objective place."
But then, we're not the New York Times.
That one is an endorsement with real prestige, one all candidates covet, one that can change minds. You could even say Walter Mondale and Mike Dukakis would never have been president, if they hadn't had the editorial endorsement of the New Yor...
OK, bad example.
