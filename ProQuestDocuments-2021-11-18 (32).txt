Texto completo: Washington • House Democrats investigating whether to impeach President Donald Trump issued a subpoena Monday demanding that Rudy Giuliani, his private lawyer, produce communications and other records related to his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president’s Democratic rivals.
The new demands of Giuliani and separate requests sent to three of his associates said to be involved in the Ukraine matter suggest that Democrats are moving quickly to stand up their investigation, even as Trump on Monday questioned whether the chairman leading their impeachment inquiry, Rep. Adam B. Schiff, should be arrested for treason.
“Our inquiry includes an investigation of credible allegations that you acted as an agent of the president in a scheme to advance his personal political interests by abusing the power of the office of the president,” Schiff and two fellow Democratic chairmen, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of the Oversight and Reform Committee and Rep. Eliot L. Engel of the Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote in a letter to Giuliani.
Democrats said they had also sent letters requesting documentary evidence and to schedule depositions in the coming two weeks with three associates of Giuliani: Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon Kislin.
The requests follow another subpoena sent Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents, and a request that he make five department officials available for depositions in the coming days.
But in targeting Giuliani directly for a long list of possible communications, Democrats are now aiming at the man who appears to be at the center of the pressure campaign on Ukraine. Giuliani is mentioned frequently in a government whistleblower complaint that set off the House inquiry and in recent weeks, he has admitted in interviews to taking a series of actions to advance investigations in Ukraine into Democrats, including Joe Biden, a leading candidate for president.
The Democrats asked for a wide range of communications and documents going back to January 2017.
Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But like a growing list of potential witnesses, he will now face an excruciating choice: Either he can hand over material under subpoena that could help build the case against the president, or refuse and feed a possible impeachment article based on obstruction of Congress. The chairmen gave Giuliani about two weeks, until Oct. 15, to comply.
“Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the president or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House’s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,” they wrote.
The new requests came as Democrats were preparing to hold closed-door depositions this week with State Department officials connected to the Ukraine matter, as well as a closed hearing with the intelligence community inspector general who fielded the whistleblower’s complaint.
The new subpoenas — and Trump’s threat to Schiff, who leads the Intelligence Committee — came as both sides continued to dig in Monday for what could be a protracted and ugly fight over the fate of Trump’s presidency. Republicans rushed to publicly defend Trump and shift attention back onto unsubstantiated accusations of wrongdoing by Democrats in Ukraine. Democrats framed the president’s remarks as a desperate attempt to confuse voters about the charges against him and discourage potential witnesses from cooperating with their inquiry.
In a sign that Washington is not preparing for a resolution anytime soon, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Senate majority leader, said Monday for the first time since the Ukraine revelations burst into public that if the House ultimately voted to impeach the president, a Senate trial would be unavoidable.
“I would have no choice but to take it up,” McConnell said on CNBC. “How long you are on it is a whole different matter.”

Texto completo: FBI agents in Philadelphia are investigating New Jersey's tax-break policies, which are also the center of a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy formed earlier this year, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
The Inquirer cited multiple anonymous sources but reported that interviews of witnesses started a month ago and focused on development in Camden.
The revelations of federal agents investigating the tax breaks, which were used heavily under former Gov. Chris Christie, also follow a steady stream of news reports raising questions about how the programs were administered and how companies took advantage of them.
The New York Times reported earlier in the week that a dozen companies had threatened to leave New Jersey for the same building complex in New York if they did not receive tax breaks. But they never did, and many of them never seriously considered moving to the Blue Hill Plaza in Pearl River, New York, located just a half-mile from the New Jersey border in Bergen County.
New Jersey's two major tax credit programs were designed to encourage businesses to create jobs and to invest in the Garden State, and Christie, a Republican, and many Democrats who supported the incentives have defended them as essential tools to compete with neighboring states. The programs expired in July, but were already at the center of scrutiny before Philadelphia authorities reportedly joined the fray. The Attorney General's office in New Jersey has also been looking into the incentives, and the state comptroller issued a damning audit of the incentives at the beginning of the year, saying that they lacked proper controls and there was no way for the state to check if jobs were created.
Murphy's task force, led by a small team of white-collar attorneys, found in an initial report that special interests were overly influential on the creation and implementation of the credits, and that the agency doling out the awards didn't have the proper procedures in place to confirm the validity of applications worth millions of dollars in forfeited taxes.
The task force's biggest targets so far have been companies connected to George E. Norcross III, the heavily influential Democrat from South Jersey who worked closely with longtime friend Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic Senate president, and Christie on a range of policies over the years. Of nearly $11 billion in awarded tax breaks, about $1.1 billion in incentives went to those companies, all located in Camden.
One of the organizations connected to Norcross, Cooper University Hospital, has hired the high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell, according to Politico New Jersey. The hiring of Lowell, who represented U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez in his corruption trial and White House adviser Jared Kushner in the special counsel's investigation of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, could be a sign that Cooper is facing a serious legal challenge.
For his part, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he is "not concerned" about the investigations and that they could be a reaction to media coverage.
At the unveiling of his new political institute at Seton Hall University on Thursday night, he referred to a 2016 investigation of Norcross by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey that concluded "no further action is warranted."
Christie, whose institute is founded on civility in politics, blasted his Democratic successor, Murphy, for putting such heavy focus on the tax incentives.
"It's political theater by a guy who understands theater and who needs a show to distract from the fact that the major things that he ran on, he simply hasn't accomplished even though he has a Legislature of his own party," Christie said.

Texto completo: Advisers to the former vice president wrote to executives at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and Fox News to "demand" that Mr. Giuliani not be invited on the air to discuss Ukraine and President Trump.
Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks on Sunday to "demand" that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine.
"We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump," a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, wrote in the letter.
"Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism," the advisers wrote.
The note, which was obtained by The New York Times, was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC, including star interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd and Chris Wallace.
Mr. Giuliani could not immediately be reached on Sunday for comment.
Mr. Giuliani has been a ubiquitous presence on television news in recent days, advocating on Mr. Trump's behalf. He has repeatedly alleged that Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, intervened in Ukraine to assist his son Hunter Biden's business interests. No evidence has surfaced that Mr. Biden intentionally tried to help his son in Ukraine.
The Biden campaign argued that Mr. Giuliani's television appearances had allowed him to mislead the viewing public -- and suggested that network journalists had done too little to hold him to account. "While you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough," the letter said.
Mr. Biden's advisers have not been shy about offering advice to journalists. Earlier this month, the campaign sent a memo to an elite group of campaign reporters warning that any news story would be "misleading" if the Trump camp's claims about Mr. Biden were unsubstantiated.
The news networks had no comment on Sunday.
As Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Mr. Giuliani remains a highly newsworthy figure, particularly amid an escalating impeachment inquiry in which Mr. Giuliani's own actions in Ukraine could play a central role. It is likely that Mr. Giuliani will remain a coveted booking for television journalists seeking insight into the president's mind-set and legal defense strategy.
As for Mr. Biden, he has shown little eagerness to engage one-on-one with TV anchors. The former vice president has declined to appear on any of the weekend political talk shows since declaring his candidacy, reserving his on-air appearances for late-night comedy shows, "The View" and a small number of other sit-downs.
On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani made freewheeling appearances on "Face the Nation" on CBS and "This Week" on ABC to discuss the impeachment inquiry.
Producers at both shows also requested interviews with Mr. Biden. The Biden campaign declined the invitation and instead offered its national co-chairman, Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, an option that the producers rejected, according to three people familiar with the deliberations.
Weekend political talk shows typically reserve airtime for newsmakers themselves -- a candidate or politician in person, for instance -- rather than for lower-ranking supporters.
Still, the Biden team's memo highlighted a topic that had loomed large for network journalists gearing up for the 2020 race: how to responsibly cover a president who regularly lobs baseless accusation at opponents. Last week, the MSNBC anchor Nicolle Wallace cut away from the president's first news conference since the start of the impeachment inquiry, telling viewers that Mr. Trump wasn't "telling the truth."
Other journalists argue that the public has a right to know what a president -- or, in Mr. Giuliani's case, one of a president's closest advocates -- has to say. Television anchors have other tools of accountability at their disposal, too; Mr. Tapper won praise on Sunday for his persistent questioning of Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who was defending Mr. Trump's actions on Ukraine, during an interview on CNN.

Wall Street Loves Strongmen

Texto completo: Markets are amoral and won't complain about autocratic behavior if it produces economic growth.
Wall Street has long existed as a parallel universe where leaders cast by critics in the media as autocratic villains can be feted as heroes if their actions bode well for the economy. Lately, this split has reached new extremes.
In the critics' view, we live in an increasingly illiberal age, populated by dangerously erratic strongmen. Leading examples include President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, who at the United Nations this week defiantly defended his government against charges that it is turning a blind eye as the Amazon burns; President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whose tough, military-backed regime has been the target of protests over the past week; and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, widely reviled for the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives.
Yet global investors view the same trio as promising economic reformers, following a mainstream playbook that could have been written (indeed sometimes is written) by analysts at the International Monetary Fund. Markets reward them accordingly. For much of their recent tenures, Brazil under Mr. Bolsonaro and Saudi Arabia under Prince Mohammed have all ranked among the world's hottest stock markets. Until this week, this year's top-performing market was Egypt.
The harsh reality is that markets are amoral, instinctively neutral barometers of economic performance, and they will at times ignore the brutality and excesses of strongmen for a simple reason: Facing little or no resistance from legislatures, courts or independent watchdogs, strongmen can push through sweeping reforms -- particularly in emerging economies, where political institutions and the rule of law are relatively weak. Looking at the records for 150 countries between 1950 and 2010, I found 43 cases in which an economy grew at an annual pace of 7 percent or more for a full decade. An astonishing 35 of those economies -- more than 80 percent of them -- were run by an autocrat.
The downside is that nations subject to the unchecked whims of autocrats are also vulnerable to wild growth swings -- and long slumps. Among the same 150 countries, I found 138 cases in which an economy grew at a pace of 3 percent or slower for a decade, and 100 of those economies were led by an autocrat.
Markets sense the erratic nature of economies run by strongmen and will bet big on these figures until the moment economic reforms lose momentum. Stock markets enjoyed bull runs under autocrats who instituted high-growth policies, like Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Suharto of Indonesia and Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
After 2000 a new generation of autocratic market darlings arose, led by President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. In their first terms, the stock markets of Russia and Turkey rose, respectively, by about 100 percentage points and 300 percentage points faster than the average for emerging countries. Later, investors would turn on Russia and Turkey, not because their leaders grew more troublesomely autocratic but because they stopped pushing tough economic reforms.
What markets look for perhaps above all is financial stability, a necessary condition for solid growth. Today, while there are many differences among Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. el-Sisi and Prince Mohammed, they have each taken steps to put their financial houses in order.
Mr. Bolsonaro plans to downsize the bureaucracy, sell off state companies and cut up to $ 250 billion from pension payments that could bankrupt Brazil. Mr. el-Sisi, in part to secure I.M.F. help, has raised taxes on capital gains and on the rich, and slashed fuel subsidies by more than 50 percent. Prince Mohammed has cracked down on rich tax dodgers, including fellow Saudi royals, raised sales taxes and cut energy subsidies as a way to pare back a large budget deficit.
Wall Street research reports on Brazil, Egypt and Saudi Arabia barely mention autocratic tendencies. Instead, they say that reforms are "still on track" in Saudi Arabia, Egypt is "the best reform story" in its region, and "market considers Bolsonaro Brazil's 'last chance' to reform economy." The gap between market and mainstream media narratives is now a yawning chasm.
In May, Mr. Bolsonaro was driven out of Manhattan by headline-grabbing demonstrators chanting "fascista," shortly after his University of Chicago-educated economic minister, Paulo Guedes, was greeted as a savior by global investors at the I.M.F.'s semiannual meeting in Washington. One participant (a Wall Street liberal) told me Mr. Guedes's speech, outlining Mr. Bolsonaro's free-market plans, was "the most inspiring" she had ever heard at this confab.
One trait the new strongmen share is a tendency to blur ideological lines. Illiberal politics often combine with eclectic economics in ways that make them hard to place on the traditional left-right political spectrum. President Trump, a champion of blue-collar jobs and tax cuts for the rich, is a prominent example. More than any other American president, he has tried to please the stock market. And as the impeachment battles heat up, he is likely to try to please it more, in his erratic way -- perhaps by looking for a quick trade deal with China or further badgering the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again.
Not coincidentally, Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. el-Sisi and Prince Mohammed, who occupy the same gray area. The crown prince has freed women to drive as part of an economic modernization campaign while suppressing activists who push for broader women's rights. Is he right or left, progressive or reactionary, or beyond the old categories?
It is not that people on Wall Street themselves are amoral or aren't often appalled by the excesses of autocrats. But it is their job to filter out headlines casting strongman presidents and prime ministers as cruel villains, and focus instead on whether their policies are likely to spur growth.
With illiberal leaders still on the rise worldwide, this political age is likely to produce more strongmen the market can love.

Texto completo: For years, writer Nora Ephron said Mark Felt was Watergate source
When you think about it now, it's sort of amazing that people gossiped and speculated about the identity of Deep Throat - the source Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein relied on during Watergate - for 30 years without the use of Twitter.
This week, the Twitter sleuths were out in full force, trying to figure out the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint about President Trump's conduct has fueled an impeachment push. On Thursday, acting national intelligence chief Joseph Maguire said he did not know who the whistleblower is, but kept referring to him using male pronouns. The New York Times published a report identifying him as a CIA officer who had once worked at the White House, drawing condemnation from readers who said the Times was endangering his safety.
And a former CIA official wrote in the New York Post that the whistleblower had to be a law professor and not an intelligence official because - wait for it - the complaint included "detailed footnotes."
No one expects his anonymity to last as long as Deep Throat's did.
Richard Nixon became the only president in American history to resign in 1974. It wasn't until 2005 that W. Mark Felt, the associate director of the FBI during Watergate, revealed he was the one who provided crucial information to Washington Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein during their investigation into the Watergate break-in and coverup.
Thus ended decades of speculation in bars, law schools and late-night tabloid shows, where Deep Throat was fingered as future Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist; Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan; a composite of several people; and even journalist Diane Sawyer, who had been an assistant in Nixon's White House press office.
Perhaps if Twitter had existed in those years, the matter would have been resolved sooner, because there was someone who knew who Deep Throat was, and that someone was a) a master of brevity and wit, b) married to Bernstein for a time and c) eager to blab to anyone who would listen about Felt.
But no one believed her.
That someone was Nora Ephron, the filmmaker behind classic romantic comedies such as "When Harry Met Sally," "Sleepless in Seattle" and "You've Got Mail."
Before she became beloved by witty women the world over, Ephron was married to Bernstein for four years, from 1976 to 1980. As she recounted later, Bernstein refused to reveal Deep Throat's identity to her. But she learned that before The Post's managing editor Howard Simons gave the source the pornographic moniker "Deep Throat," Woodward had referred to the source as "M.F." in his notes.
Woodward always insisted that stood for "My Friend," but Ephron didn't believe him, correctly guessing the initials stood for "Mark Felt." When she confronted Bernstein with her conclusion, he denied it.
Years later, Woodward admitted to NBC News that using "M.F." was "not very good tradecraft on my part."
In fact, as Woodward explained later, he had met Felt by chance before he was even a journalist. Both men had ended up in a White House waiting room when Felt was lower on the chain in the FBI and Woodward was a Navy courier. Woodward struck up a conversation and, over the years, asked Felt for career advice. Eventually, the mentoring relationship changed when Felt came to Woodward to leak information about Watergate.
In 1979, while Ephron was pregnant with her and Bernstein's second child, she discovered her husband was having an affair with a mutual friend. The couple divorced. A few years later, Ephron wrote a fictionalized version of the split in the novel "Heartburn"; she later wrote the screenplay for a film based on the book.
Over the years, as Ephron's reputation for great movies and bluntness grew, she told hundreds of people the truth: her kids, her friends, rooms full of adoring fans.
"If I gave a speech with 500 people, and [someone] asked me, I told them," she told NPR in 2006. "I told everyone. But no one listened to me. It was very, very, very frustrating … I was like a tree falling in the forest that no one hears."
At times, she later wrote, she suffered in non-silence as "unbelievably idiotic ideas of who Deep Throat was were floated by otherwise intelligent people."
"Why these people with these ludicrous theories didn't call me I cannot imagine," she joked. "I am listed" in the phone book.
Ephron's son, Jacob Bernstein, apparently inheriting his mother's propensity for indiscretion, also told classmates in grade school what he had overheard from his mom. In 1999, the Hartford Courant ran an article about a 19-year-old college student who claimed Jacob had told him Felt was Deep Throat when the two attended a day camp together a decade earlier.
When the Courant contacted Bernstein, he laughed off his son's claim, saying he "has not a clue as to the identity of Deep Throat."
There was also someone else who denied it: 86-year-old Mark Felt.
"No, it's not me," Felt fibbed to the Courant. "I would have done better. I would have been more effective. Deep Throat didn't exactly bring the White House crashing down, did he?"
(Felt also denied it to the Wall Street Journal in 1974, cryptically adding that if he were Deep Throat, he obviously wouldn't admit it.)
But by 2005, he had changed his mind, and revealed all to Vanity Fair.
Ephron, who died of complications from cancer in 2012, lived long enough to be vindicated and to gloat about it in the way only she could.
"All I can say is that this is a huge load off my mind. Mark Felt is Deep Throat," she said. "Don't say I didn't try to tell you."

Texto completo: Joe Biden's presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks Sunday to “demand" that Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine.
“We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump," wrote a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, in the letter.
“Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism," the advisers wrote. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.
The note was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC, including interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd, and Chris Wallace.
Giuliani could not immediately be reached Sunday for comment.
Giuliani has been a ubiquitous presence on television news in recent days, including several appearances on Sunday. Advocating on Trump's behalf, Giuliani has repeatedly alleged that Biden, while serving as vice president, intervened in Ukraine to assist his son Hunter's business interests. No evidence has surfaced that Biden intentionally tried to help his son in Ukraine.
New York Times
Giuliani says he'd help probe only with Trump's OK
Under fire for peddling a debunked conspiracy theory, Giuliani said Sunday he would cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry only if Trump gave him permission.
"If he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I'll testify," Giuliani said during a series of television appearances where impeachment dominated the discussions.
But it's not clear whether Representative Adam Schiff, whose House Intelligence Committee is taking the lead on the impeachment investigation, wants to hear sworn testimony from Giuliani.
For now, Schiff, a California Democrat, is working to strike a deal with the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint forms the heart of the proceedings against the 45th president.

Most 'not surprised' Trump asked Ukraine for help
The vast majority of Americans are not surprised that President Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden's son, and fewer than half see it as a "very serious" problem, an ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday indicates.
Just about half of Americans said they are "not surprised at all" to hear of Trump's actions. An additional 32 percent said they are "not surprised."
The national poll, conducted Friday and Saturday, also finds that 63 percent of adults say it is a serious problem that Trump pushed the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden in a July call that has sparked an extraordinary whistleblower complaint and led Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. Less than half of the public, 43 percent, said Trump's action was "very serious."
The survey did not ask whether Trump should be impeached or about accusations that White House officials tried to keep the July phone call secret, a claim laid out by an unidentified whistleblower in a seven-page complaint released Thursday.
Several reaction polls released in the past week found an increase in the percentage of Americans in favor of impeachment. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist survey found 49 percent approval for impeachment and 46 percent against. After the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller III's report on Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and throughout the summer, most polls showed majorities opposing impeachment.
House Democrats are gambling that more of the public will support their decision to move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry as the investigation progresses. Until this week, about half of Democratic caucus members wanted to launch impeachment proceedings. By Friday, all but 11 were on board.
Despite the Ukraine story's domination of headlines, just about one-quarter of adults say they have followed the news "very closely." More than 6 in 10 say they are following the issue at least "somewhat closely."
The survey was conducted Sept. 27-28 using Ipsos' Knowledge Panel, an ongoing survey panel recruited through random sampling of US households. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.
Washington Post
Cory Booker says he could drop his bid by Tuesday
Cory Booker said he could end his presidential campaign by Tuesday unless he is able to reach his goal of $1.7 million in donations within the next 36 hours.
Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, the New Jersey senator said that despite an "avalanche of support," his campaign needed "some more help" from contributors. His campaign website shows he's about $150,000 short of the amount he targeted on Sept. 21 to have a viable path to victory.
Although he has languished at 2% or 3% in most polls and is struggling in fund-raising, Booker has qualified for the October debate of Democratic presidential candidates. In the CNN interview, Booker said he has also met the threshold of 165,000 unique donors required to participate in the November debate.
Booker also rose to the defense of fellow candidate Joe Biden, saying the accusations from President Trump that the former vice president acted improperly to benefit his son Hunter's business interests in Ukraine are unfounded.
"I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I should be president, not him," Booker said of Biden, with whom he has clashed on the campaign trail and at debates. Yet the allegations from Trump "should in no way affect the vice president in his pursuit of the nomination," he said. "This can in no way besmirch his character, his honor, and his incredible service to this country over decades."
Instead, Booker said the focus should be on the actions of Trump and his family, and said he would tighten the rules if elected president.
"I'm watching what's going on with the Trump family right now and Trump properties, and I just find that deeply offensive to just any kind of independent sense of what's honorable, ethical, not to mention consistent with the emoluments clause," he said, referring to a clause in the Constitution that forbids accepting payments from foreign governments. "I just don't think children of president and vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that."

Transcendent Genius: NM Museum of Art exhibit spotlights Agnes Pelton

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Agnes Pelton boasts none of the instant name recognition of Georgia O’Keeffe.
A one-woman traveling exhibition from the Phoenix Art Museum argues maybe she should.
“Agnes Pelton: Desert Transcendentalist” opens at the New Mexico Museum of Art on Friday, Oct. 4. The exhibition runs through Jan. 5. It marks the first survey of the artist’s work in more than 23 years.
Long overlooked and underpriced, Pelton was a groundbreaking artist who inspired the New Mexico-based Transcendental Painting Group. Like O’Keeffe, she studied with the influential teacher Arthur Wesley Dow at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute. Pelton came to New Mexico by way of Taos salon hostess Mabel Dodge Luhan 10 years earlier than O’Keeffe. Intrigued by Pelton’s use of spirituality in her art, Transcendental Group co-founder Raymond Jonson wrote her letters begging her to join his movement in the 1930s, eventually naming her its honorary president.
But Pelton was much more than a transcendentalist.
The artist’s most essential work melded representationalism with abstraction, said Gilbert Vicario, deputy director of curatorial affairs at the Phoenix Art Museum.
The exhibition coalesced when Vicario started researching the museum’s collection.
“I thought, ‘This is amazing,’ ” he said in a telephone interview. “I thought, ‘This is too good to be true.’ That led me to her last major exhibition, which was in 1995.”
The more than 40 works on view include “Awakening (Memory of My Father),” 1943.
The dream-like image features a profile beneath a lit trumpet bell floating in a star-flecked sky.
Pelton’s father died of a morphine overdose when she was 9.
“He was an avid hiker and mountaineer,” Vicario said. “He battled depression with morphine.”
The trumpet was supposed to awaken the dead, he said.
Pelton was born and raised in Germany. In 1888, the family moved to Europe after a notorious Gilded Age scandal involving her grandmother, who had an affair with a celebrity Brooklyn preacher. The story spilled across The New York Times in sensationalist ink.
Pelton was raised never to speak of it; society shunned her mother. Pelton grew up withdrawn, uncertain and painfully shy. Her mind and her paintings forged her escape.
Having no connections within the art world’s elite, Pelton was relatively unknown, despite being compared to O’Keeffe for her landscape work. In 1932, she moved to Cathedral City, California, immersing herself in spiritual practices such as theosophy, numerology and Agni yoga, with its focus on fire as a guiding force.
“Ray Serene,” 1925, is one of her first pure abstractions.
“She begins to focus on light, and there is a lot of energy and desire,” Vicario said.
Pelton’s subjects balance conceptual forms with objects haloed by invisible sources. Energy and vibrations bloom around the astral and physical bodies of the desert.
“The work is very particular,” Vicario said. “It’s very unlike anything. She didn’t exhibit much in New York. We always reference O’Keeffe; O’Keeffe had (gallery owner and impresario) Alfred Stieglitz” to market her.
The rampant sexism of the art world did little to expand Pelton’s reputation.
Pelton died in 1961, having never married and leaving no heirs. Many of her works were lost or destroyed. Vicario discovered a letter penned by a caretaker saying Pelton’s cousins had found a painting at a white elephant sale at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art with a price tag of $40. When she returned with the cash, the price had been slashed to $15. Last year, Vicario learned of a Pelton for sale in New Jersey valued at $400-$600.
He hopes the exhibition changes that. Its next stop is New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art.
“The Whitney is taking 1,200 copies of the catalog,” Vicario said. “When we travel shows, we’re lucky if we sell 50.”

Texto completo: She was shot to death by a former boyfriend. He wrote about it for The Washington Post. His article won a Pulitzer Prize.
George Lardner Jr., a Washington Post reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize for his monthslong investigation into the murder of his 21-year-old daughter by a former boyfriend, died on Saturday in a hospice facility in Aldie, Va. He was 85.
His daughter Helen Lardner said the cause was complications of a series of strokes.
By the time Kristin Lardner was shot dead in 1992, Mr. Lardner had distinguished himself over nearly 30 years at The Post, writing about assassinations, civil rights, savings-and-loan scandals, politics and national security.
But investigating his daughter's death became his most important assignment -- and one that The Post believed he was well suited to handle despite his personal connection to the subject.
"When he suggested this was something he wanted to do, it seemed logical to me," Leonard Downie Jr., the former executive editor of The Post, said in a phone interview. "He was a great reporter -- a determined investigative reporter -- and a grieving father. It seemed like the therapeutic thing to do."
To emphasize that it was written by the victim's father and had a viewpoint, the article appeared in Outlook, an opinion section.
Mr. Lardner began his reporting with the basic details: On May 30, 1992, Ms. Lardner, a 21-year-old student at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University in Boston, was shot in the head by Michael Cartier, a bouncer with a violent history whom she had dated for a short time. Later that day he committed suicide in his apartment.
In his 9,000-word article, Mr. Lardner wrote that he had heard the news of his daughter's death from her older sister, Helen, who called him at The Post. "Kristin? My Kristin? Our Kristin?" he recalled thinking. "I'd talked to her the afternoon before. Her last words to me were, 'I love you, Dad.' Suddenly I had trouble breathing myself."
Mr. Lardner's reporting over the next few months illustrated the many lapses in the criminal justice system that had led to his daughter's death -- from judges who had dealt cavalierly with domestic abuse cases to probation officers who had not cracked down on Mr. Cartier's behavior.
Mr. Cartier had a felony record that included burglary and grand larceny, and he had beaten a previous girlfriend, then violated a restraining order she had been granted.
Eleven days before Ms. Lardner's death, she had asked a judge in Boston for a permanent restraining order against Mr. Cartier, having received one that had lasted only a week. Mr. Cartier had violated that one by calling her that morning to ask her not to go to court.
At the hearing, the judge did not check Mr. Cartier's criminal record; he had been imprisoned for the attack on his previous girlfriend, then violated his probation, which should have sent him back to jail. But he left the hearing with warnings not to contact Ms. Lardner for a year and to stay away from her apartment and school.
"Kristin was looking for protection," Mr. Lardner wrote. "She was processed like a slice of cheese."
At 5 p.m. on May 30, Ms. Lardner left her job as a cashier at a liquor store on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. She returned to the area about an hour later to meet up with another cashier, who was getting off her shift. Mr. Cartier shot Ms. Lardner once from behind; moments later, as she lay wounded, he shot her twice more.
Nearly three weeks after her death, a summons that a police officer had filled out for Ms. Lardner -- citing Mr. Cartier for assault and battery, intimidation of a witness and violating domestic abuse law -- had not been issued. It was still waiting to be typed.
When Mr. Lardner won the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing months after his article was published, he told The Associated Press that he was "stunned, elated and sad."
He added, "I'd give anything not to have written it."
Mr. Lardner expanded the story into a book, "The Stalking of Kristin: A Father Investigates the Murder of His Daughter" (1995). Reviewing it in The New York Times, Richard Bernstein wrote:
"A father who has lost his daughter is, it could be argued, not the sort of dispassionate observer to write about that very crime. On the other hand, those who have suffered the kind of terrible loss that Mr. Lardner did are more likely to have the passion and commitment to investigate the issue thoroughly, to track down the operations of the system in every detail."
George Edmund Lardner Jr. was born on Aug. 10, 1934, in Brooklyn and was raised there and in Jackson Heights, Queens. His mother, Rosetta (Russo) Lardner, was an elementary-school teacher. His father was a syndicated golf writer and part of the celebrated Lardner family of writers; Ring Lardner, the sports columnist and short-story writer, was George Jr.'s great-uncle.
After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from Marquette University in Milwaukee, George began his reporting career at The Worcester Telegram in Massachusetts, then moved on to The Miami Herald. He was hired by The Post in 1962 and developed a reputation there for dogged investigative reporting and elegant writing.
"I was impressed by his complete open-mindedness, skepticism and reluctance to draw conclusions that weren't warranted," Mr. Downie, now a professor at the Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University, said. "He had this remarkable curiosity."
Mr. Lardner investigated the life of Sirhan B. Sirhan after his assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. He also revealed that Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, then a candidate for the 1984 Democratic nomination for president, had been born a year earlier than he had long claimed, and delved into why he had shortened his surname from Hartpence.
"His biographies give the date as Nov. 28, 1937, but official records in Kansas and a family birth book kept by Uncle George Hartpence reportedly say 1936," Mr. Lardner wrote.
For many years he followed the threads emanating from President John F. Kennedy's assassination, from conspiracy theories to investigations. His expertise was clear in a 1991 article critical of the director Oliver Stone for "chasing fiction," as Mr. Lardner put it, in his film "JFK."
Based on his reading of the original script, Mr. Lardner wrote that "there isn't space to list all the errors and absurdities, large and small."
Soon after retiring from The Post in 2004, he began research into a book about the presidential power to pardon. He never completed that book, but he won a victory in federal court in pursuit of the names of people who had been denied clemency by President George W. Bush.
Mr. Lardner sued the Department of Justice when its Office of the Pardon Attorney refused to comply with his Freedom of Information Act requests for the thousands of names of those whose pardon applications had been rejected. A district court ruled in Mr. Lardner's favor in 2009; the federal Court of Appeals upheld the decision the next year.
In addition to his daughter Helen, Mr. Lardner is survived by his sons, Edmund, Charles and Richard; two grandchildren; and a sister, Joan Beachley. His wife, Rosemary (Schalk) Lardner, died in 2007.
Four months after the murder of Kristin Lardner, Massachusetts legislators passed a law creating a central registry of domestic restraining orders and requiring judges to consult it.
And the $ 30 billion federal crime bill enacted in 1994 included provisions of the national Violence Against Women Act that let judges look into records of domestic abusers; made it a crime to cross state lines to commit domestic violence; and required states to honor orders of protection issued in other states.
Still, Mr. Lardner was not satisfied. In 2013, he noted in an interview with Charles Lewis, the executive editor of the Investigative Reporting Workshop, that domestic violence persisted despite stronger laws.
"It's still the case where police, prosecutors and judges wink at it," he said. "There's still plenty of violence against women."

Texto completo: It’s a truism that capitalists don’t like competition — especially for workers. In recent decades, American companies have tried to limit this problem by requiring millions of employees to sign contracts prohibiting them from moving to rival firms.
The absurd and harmful proliferation of the practice is well illustrated by a recent survey that found 30 percent of the nation’s hair salons required stylists to sign noncompete agreements.
A few states, notably California, have long restricted the use of the tactic. And in 2008, Oregon passed an innovative law that barred noncompete agreements for most workers, including those making less than the median income for a family of four — $97,631 in 2018.
A new study finds that the Oregon law made a big difference for workers, increasing both how often they changed jobs and how much they got paid.
There is no single explanation for the stagnation of workers’ income in recent decades, but a key reason is that negotiating power shifted from workers to employers. The rise of noncompete agreements is both a symptom, demonstrating the power of employers to dictate terms, and a cause, undermining the ability of workers to obtain a larger piece of the pie.
Defenders of the practice say it encourages companies to make investments, for example in employee training, since the company is more likely to reap the benefits. They also insist that workers are compensated for the loss of bargaining power with higher wages or greater job security. Indeed, some experts have asserted that the elimination of noncompete agreements would cause wages to fall, because workers would no longer be paid for signing.
The Oregon study shows that this theoretical model of labor markets bears little relationship to the lived reality. After the law took effect, job hopping increased by as much as 18 percent — and wages for workers no longer bound by noncompetes rose by as much as 21 percent.
Put plainly, the old rule allowed employers to suppress their workers’ pay.
Among the reasons: Workers are often required to sign noncompete agreements after they accept a job, when they no longer have as much leverage to negotiate. Workers also may not understand the terms, nor anticipate the consequences for their own careers.
There may be some case for allowing corporations to negotiate noncompete agreements with top executives or other particularly valuable employees — although states would do well to consider the example of California, where the absence of noncompetes has contributed to the rise of Silicon Valley. But allowing broad use of noncompetes harms workers.
A growing number of states have followed Oregon’s example in the past few years. Illinois went first, in 2016, banning noncompete agreements for workers making up to $13 an hour. Six more states have since passed new laws, ranging from Maryland, which drew the line at $15 an hour, or about $31,200 a year, all the way to Washington, which rendered noncompete restrictions unenforceable for workers making less than $100,000 a year. (The other states with new laws are in New England: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.)
A Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, introduced federal legislation in January banning noncompete agreements for low-wage workers. In March, a bipartisan group of six senators, including Mr. Rubio, requested a Government Accountability Office study of the agreements, writing there was “no good reason” to let companies bind the hands of low-wage workers.
The Rubio bill needs to be broader. It would protect only workers who are eligible for overtime pay under federal law — mostly, employees earning less than $23,360 a year — a significantly lower threshold than in the Oregon law. It also needs stronger penalties for companies that break the rules. And Congress should consider protections for workers who may justifiably be subject to noncompete agreements, such as requiring any deal to be part of the job offer.
But the bill nonetheless offers a rare opportunity for bipartisan agreement. Congress should act to protect the freedom of American workers to seek jobs in an open marketplace.

Ocasio-Cortez pide en el Congreso aliviar deudas a taxistas de Nueva York

Texto completo: La representante (D-NY) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez se unió a la lista de funcionarios electos de Nueva York que piden un rescate financiero para los endeudados propietarios de medallones de taxis.
Hablando el jueves en una audiencia del comité de Servicios Financieros de la Cámara Baja en Washington sobre préstamos para pequeñas empresas, Ocasio-Cortez fustigó a los funcionarios de NYC y a los reguladores federales por permitir, y en algunos casos, alentar, a los conductores a tomar préstamos de alto precio que los han paralizado desde entonces.
“Estos taxistas necesitan un rescate, porque no se trata sólo de prácticas de recolección depredadoras”, dijo. “Ésta es una servidumbre por contrato financiero fabricado, y está mal”.
En 2013 los medallones se vendían por $1.3 millones de dólares en las subastas de la Comisión de taxis y limusinas. Para el año pasado, el precio se había desplomado a menos de $250 mil, mientras los propietarios de medallones todavía estaban enganchados por sus préstamos de un millón de dólares.
Hoy cuestan cerca de $150 mil dólares. En tanto, los prestamistas se marcharon con decenas de millones de dólares en ganancias, reveló una investigación realizada por The New York Times en mayo. La ciudad misma recaudó más de $855 millones durante 12 años a partir de las transacciones.
Los defensores de los taxistas no buscan un rescate financiero, sino la condonación de la deuda financiada por la ciudad, según la directora ejecutiva de la Alianza de Trabajadores de Taxi de Nueva York (NYTWA), Bhairavi Desai, quien testificó en la audiencia del jueves en representación de más de 15 mil trabajadores.
La ciudad debería comprar el medallón a los precios actuales, y establecer acuerdos de préstamo con los propietarios de los conductores a esa tasa, dijo Desai.
“Técnicamente no es un rescate financiero. Realmente es una reestructuración de préstamos”, le dijo a New York Post. “Varios actores son responsables de esto, pero la ciudad es la que tiene los medios para sacar a los conductores propietarios de la desesperación y la pobreza de por vida”.
La difícil situación de los taxistas llamó la atención de la ciudad después de una serie de suicidios de conductores en 2018.
* Taxistas tendrán alivio de deudas y más protección frente a Uber en Nueva York
* Ganancias de taxistas en Nueva York han caído 44% desde 2013
* Fiscalía y Alcaldía investigarán estafas a taxistas endeudados de Nueva York
Bhairavi Desai, an activist and the founder of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, has been fighting against this scheme.

N.B.A. Denies Net's Effort To Securitize His Contract

Texto completo: Dinwiddie had planned to turn his three-year, $ 34.4 million contract with the Nets into an investment.
Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here .
The N.B.A. on Friday notified the Nets' Spencer Dinwiddie that he cannot use his contract as a digital investment vehicle, according to a league official.
Dinwiddie had announced earlier this week to The Athletic that he planned to go public with an " $ SD8" token offered by his company DREAM Fan Shares that would enable investors to essentially buy into Dinwiddie's three-year, $ 34.4 million N.B.A. contract.
By selling shares in his contract, Dinwiddie would have allowed investors to bet on whether he would be able to play well enough to earn an even more lucrative contract after the second year of his deal.
The N.B.A. issued the following statement to The New York Times on Friday: "According to recent reports, Spencer Dinwiddie intends to sell investors a 'tokenized security' that will be backed by his player contract. The described arrangement is prohibited by the C.B.A., which provides that 'no player shall assign or otherwise transfer to any third party his right to receive compensation from the team under his uniform player contract."'
The N.B.A. Players Association declined to comment on Friday night.
Dinwiddie, 26, intended to offer the security using the Ethereum blockchain and raise $ 4.95 million to $ 13.5 million. He planned to guarantee investors a few percentage points in interest over the three years of his deal. The minimum investment was to have been $ 150,000.
Reached on Friday night by The Times, Dinwiddie said he planned to meet with league officials to try to change their minds by further explaining the investment concept.
Dinwiddie is one of the most improved players in the league over the past two seasons. His contract is still regarded in league circles as a bargain given his production. So investors might have been poised to get in on the ground floor of a sleeper stock -- assuming he could land a richer contract in the summer of 2021.
Dinwiddie averaged 16.8 points and 4.6 assists per game last season for the Nets, emerging as one of the league's top sixth men. He played an active role in the free agency recruitment of the All-Star guard Kyrie Irving.
"What better way to be invested in a player as a fan than to have some level of skin in the game," Dinwiddie told The Athletic. "With the way mine works, if I play well in that player option year and we split the profits up the first year of my new deal, it greatly appreciates the return on this investment vehicle."
Dinwiddie isn't the first athlete to attempt such a move with his contract. For a number of years, Fantex allowed fans to buy stock in the lifetime earning potential of certain athletes, primarily football players like Vernon Davis and Alshon Jeffery. But the concept never took off, and Fantex hasn't offered any new player stocks since 2016.
Kevin Draper contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Los presidentes demócratas de tres comités de la Cámara de Representantes citaron el viernes al Secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo para que entregue documentos relacionados con Ucrania que, según dicen, pertenecen a la investigación de juicio político contra el presidente Trump, reporta Fox News.
Los presidentes de los comités de Asuntos Exteriores, Inteligencia y Supervisión de la Cámara solicitaron inicialmente una larga lista de documentos el 9 de septiembre y enviaron una carta de seguimiento el lunes.
“Su incumplimiento o negativa a cumplir con la citación constituirá evidencia de obstrucción a la investigación de destitución de la Cámara”, escribieron el presidente de Inteligencia, Adam Schiff, D-Calif .; Eliot Engel, presidente de Asuntos Exteriores, D-N.Y .; y el presidente de supervisión Elijah Cummings , D-Md.
Los presidentes mencionados también solicitaron correspondencia y documentos del Departamento de Estado que datan del 20 de enero de 2017 hasta el presente. Los documentos se relacionan con informes de que Trump presionó a los funcionarios ucranianos para que investiguen al posible rival electoral de 2020 Joe Biden, su hijo Hunter y la actividad comercial de los Bidens en Ucrania.
Los legisladores demócratas también exigieron copias de la transcripción de la controvertida llamada de Trump el 25 de julio con el presidente ucraniano Vladimir Zelenski y una lista de funcionarios del Departamento de Estado que podrían haber estado involucrados en la conversación, según la carta. También solicitan cualquier registro del Departamento de Estado sobre Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Trump, y cualquier registro relacionado con la ayuda militar de EE. UU. a Ucrania.
Pompeo tiene hasta el 4 de octubre para cumplir con las solicitudes.
En una carta separada, los presidentes notificaron a Pompeo que habían programado deposiciones para cinco funcionarios del Departamento de Estado entre el 2 y el 10 de octubre.
Esos funcionarios son el ex embajador en Ucrania, Marie Yovanovitch, el Representante Especial de Estados Unidos para las Negociaciones de Ucrania, Kurt Volker, Subsecretario Adjunto George Kent , el Consejero T. Ulrich Brechbuhl y el Embajador de los Estados Unidos en la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland.
Todos los funcionarios, excepto Kent, son nombrados en una queja por un denunciante de la comunidad de inteligencia que acusó a Trump de “usar el poder de su oficina para solicitar la interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020”.
“El hecho de que ninguno de estos empleados del departamento comparezca para sus deposiciones programadas constituirá evidencia de obstrucción a la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara”, dijeron los presidentes.
NYT reportó la renuncia de Kurt Volker a su cargo el viernes.

Texto completo: In the whistleblower complaint that triggered the impeachment inquiry, the author describes a series of events – partly public and partly described by other officials – that culminated in a call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
We've arranged those alleged events in chronological order – providing a clearer context to the call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate 2016 election interference and the Biden family's Ukrainian business dealings.
December 2018: Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani speaks with Viktor Shokin, Ukraine's former prosecutor general.
January: Giuliani meets with Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general under President Petro Poroshenko, in New York.
February: Giuliani meets with Lutsenko a second time in Warsaw, Poland.
March: In a series of articles in The Hill, Lutsenko and other Ukrainian officials make claims about:
April 29: U. S. Ambassador Yovanovitch is recalled to Washington for "consultations. "
May 6: The State Department announces Yovanovitch will end her assignment in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.
May 9: The New York Times reports that Giuliani plans to travel to Ukraine to press the government to pursue investigations into election interference in 2016 and alleged wrongdoing by the Biden family.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- For years, people who use Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have chased Likes as a status symbol. More Likes on a social media post meant it was popular, engaging and worthwhile.
To gain Likes, people were sometimes motivated to post messages and videos that they had calibrated to go viral. That helped lead to a proliferation of violent, radical or otherwise extremist content on social media that set tongues wagging.
Now Facebook is moving to limit the importance of Likes and other metrics.
On Thursday, the social network said it was starting a test in Australia, where people's Likes, video view counts and other measurements of posts would become private to other users. It is the first time the company has announced plans to hide the numbers on its platform. Facebook said it had not decided whether to roll out the experiment beyond Australia.
"We will gather feedback to understand whether this change will improve people's experiences," said Jimmy Raimo, a Facebook spokesman. He added that the site wanted to be a place where people felt comfortable expressing themselves.
For years, internet health advocates have pushed Facebook to stop prioritizing Like counts, arguing that the metrics have a negative impact on people's self-esteem. "We know that kids seek validation via the Like button. We know that it can negatively affect kids' and teenagers' self-esteem," said Jim Steyer, chief executive of the nonprofit Common Sense Media. "The public is finally waking up to how many of these tactics can be manipulative."
Facebook has also been under fire for the amount of extreme content on its site and the effect those posts and videos have on people's lives. As users have tried to draw attention for their posts, they have live-streamed killings on the social network and posted conspiracy theories. Social media influencers have also racked up Likes -- sometimes by purchasing them -- and made money by promoting products to their followers.
Instagram, the photo-sharing site owned by Facebook, also began hiding some Likes and other metrics this year as part of an experiment intended to make users feel happier about the time they spend on the platform.
Adam Mosseri, who runs Instagram, told BuzzFeed News in April that people often worried about not getting a high enough number of Likes on their photos. Under the experiment, people could still see the number of likes on their own posts, but the number was not publicly displayed.
This could create "a less pressurized environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves," Mr. Mosseri said at the time.
At Instagram, the change was inspired partly by the rising popularity of Stories, where people post photos and videos that expire after 24 hours. Views and reactions to Instagram Stories have always been private. Instagram Stories emulates the Stories feature of Snapchat, the social media platform whose chief executive, Evan Spiegel, has talked publicly about not using online measurements to incentivize people's behavior.
In Australia, Facebook said it planned to study whether users would continue to comment and to Like posts even if they could not see the number of their peers who were also doing so.

Trump's other Ukraine problem: New ethics concern about his hotel business

Texto completo: Buried in the controversy over President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was an effort by the Ukrainian leader to curry favor with Trump through his business.
"Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower," Zelensky told Trump, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call released Wednesday.
Zelensky's comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him about it.
Other Ukrainian officials have also patronized Trump properties. A top Zelensky aide met at Trump's D.C. hotel in July with Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, a frequent patron of the hotel himself, according to the New York Times. A lobbyist who registered as an agent of Zelensky's with the U.S. government hosted a $1,900 event at the D.C. hotel in April, according to a federal filing.
Internal hotel listings of "VIP" guests at the hotel, obtained by The Washington Post, show that Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Giuliani's in his efforts to build connections with Ukraine, stayed at the hotel in April 2018 and were listed as Trump loyalty-card members and repeat customers.
"This is what we've been warning about for years: proof directly from the White House that a foreign leader is trying to get in Trump's good graces by telling him he stayed at his hotel," said the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.
Another advocacy group, Public Citizen, tweeted: "The Ukrainian president telling Trump that he spent money at his New York hotel is an important reminder that our president violates the Constitution's emoluments clause every. single. day."
It remains unclear whether the stays were illegal. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.
A spokeswoman for Zelensky declined to say when the president's New York stay took place, but Zelensky posted several images from New York City - including a video jogging in Central Park - on social media in March 2018. That was 14 months before Zelensky entered office and more than six months before he entered the race for president in Ukraine.
Legal experts said the timing made that visit unlikely to violate the foreign emoluments clause, which bars the acceptance of gifts "from any King, Prince, or foreign State." In three lawsuits winding their way through the court systems, Democrats and business competitors of Trump allege that Trump violates the emoluments ban by accepting payments from foreign leaders.
"The attempt here is to find a quid pro quo and the argument could be that Trump gave [Zelensky] something to reward him for staying at the hotel a year or so earlier," said Boston College law professor George Brown. Based on the available information about Zelensky's stay, Brown said, "I think it's a weak argument."
Other foreign leaders - including from Kuwait, Bahrain and Malaysia - haven't been bashful about holding events at Trump's D.C. hotel, and when the crown prince of Saudi Arabia made his visit to New York last year, members of his entourage also stayed at Trump's New York hotel.
Attorney General William P. Barr plans to hold a holiday bash at the D.C. hotel in December that will cost a minimum of $30,000, according to documents obtained by The Post. In court, Justice Department attorneys have argued that Trump has done nothing wrong. Trump's company, which did not return a request for comment, donates what it calculates to be profits from foreign business to the U.S. Treasury.
Still, the idea behind the foreign emoluments clause, said University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal, is that "if a foreign leader is paying you, then that's a violation."
On Wednesday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched an impeachment inquiry over Trump's attempts to persuade Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, other House Democrats pushed for more information about Trump's hotel business.
In a morning subcommittee hearing, Democrats on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked why officials from the General Services Administration - the agency that leases the Old Post Office to Trump for his D.C. hotel - have repeatedly refused to hand over financial records and legal memos related to the project.
According to the lease agreement between the Trump Organization and the GSA, the government should receive a cut of earnings after the hotel hits certain financial benchmarks. But the agency has not disclosed information about the hotel's performance, following a request from Trump's private lawyers that it be withheld.
"How do we know what the income is? How do we know how GSA is calculating the profits?" said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), Transportation Committee chairman.
Dan Mathews, head of the GSA's Public Building Service, said that last year the agency received just the base annual rent from the Trump Organization of $3 million.

Checks and balances at work

Texto completo: A Times editorial

By flouting the law and the authority of Congress, President Donald Trump left House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with little choice but to open a formal impeachment inquiry. That declaration produced immediate results Wednesday as the administration released an account of the troubling call between Trump and the Ukranian president, and more facts should be forthcoming. Congress and the American people deserve to see the full picture surrounding the latest allegations that Trump sought a foreign countrys help in his election so they can make their own judgments about the presidents behavior.

The momentum for a formal impeachment inquiry built quickly following reports by the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times about Trumps efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. As vice president, Biden pushed Ukraine in 2016 to fire a corrupt prosecutor who had investigated the owner of an energy company where Bidens son was a paid board member. But the investigation was not active at the time, and there is no evidence so far that Biden or his son did anything wrong. Just days before the July 25 phone call to the Ukrainian president where he suggested an investigation into Biden, Trump froze $391 million in military aid for Ukraine.

On their face, Trumps actions raise serious concerns about national security, the abuse of presidential power and once again inviting foreign interference into a U.S. election. The president has confirmed he talked about Biden with the Ukrainian president and offered various explanations for withholding the military aid, insisting again Wednesday he did nothing wrong. If that is the case, Trump should have immediately released the account of the phone call and allowed a whistleblowers complaint to be forwarded to Congress as the law requires. Instead he stonewalled and thumbed his nose at the House, prompting Pelosi to act Tuesday as dozens of her fellow Democrats demanded.

That announcement of the impeachment inquiry prompted the administration Wednesday to release the five-page account of the key phone call with the Ukrainian president, and it does not put Trump in a positive light. It quotes Trump asking the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son, and he says he wants Attorney General William Barr and his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, to be involved in the Ukraine inquiry. The account of the call does not show an explicit quid pro quo  an investigation of the Bidens in return for foreign aid  but it also is far from the complete picture.

The whistleblowers complaint, as the Washington Post reported last week, includes several conversations involving Trump and Ukraine, and a promise to a foreign leader so concerning it prompted this U.S. intelligence official to act. The complaint was filed with the inspector general, who found it to be of urgent concern and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence. By law, the director of national intelligence has seven days to send the complaint to congressional intelligence oversight committees. Yet the Justice Department ordered that the complaint not be sent to Congress. Only after the impeachment inquiry was announced did negotiations begin to send the whistleblowers complaint to Congress, which was sent late Wednesday.

While the move toward a formal impeachment inquiry came suddenly this week, context is important. Pelosi has long resisted calls from some of her Democratic colleagues for formal impeachment hearings. In the Tampa Bay area, Democratic U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor of Tampa and Charlie Crist of St. Petersburg have been cautious for months and did not call for a formal impeachment inquiry until Tuesday. It also is notable that in a rare bipartisan move, the U.S. Senate voted unanimously for a resolution asking Trump to provide the whistleblowers complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees.

The constitutional checks and balances of the democracy are working. The president refused to recognize the authority of Congress, and the House responded. Now the president appears to be grudgingly cooperating, and the House is obligated to conduct a fair and full inquiry before deciding on impeachment. No one is above the law, and the ultimate judgment on the Trump presidency will be determined by the American people. They deserve the facts.

White House hunt for identity of whistleblower and 'spy' who helped him

Texto completo: President Trump and his advisers are frantically searching for the identity of the whistleblower who exposed Trump’s phone call with Ukraine’s president and those in the White House who spoke to him.
Trump demanded the identities of the sources as Democrats clamored for Trump’s impeachment for allegedly inducing Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.
“I want to know who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?”
Among sources close to the White House staff, there was a clear consensus that at least one of the sources likely worked at the National Security Council, given context clues in an Aug. 12 whistleblower complaint released Thursday.
In the complaint, the person who reported the call to the inspector general of the intelligence community said they acquired information from "multiple White House officials" and “more than half a dozen U.S. officials.”
The document specifically alleges a cover-up of the July 25 call’s transcript, with the document transferred to a less widely accessible platform in what the whistleblower saw as an effort to conceal its content.
Specific names are circulating as suspects for both the whistleblower and the sources, though the Washington Examiner is not printing the names because the officials’ responsibility cannot be proven.
Recent turnover at the highest levels of the National Security Council, with John Bolton ousted, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, with Director Dan Coats and his deputy Sue Gordon resigning, has fueled speculation about the intersection of palace intrigue and the whistleblowing.
The New York Times reported Thursday afternoon that the whistleblower, who lacked direct knowledge of the call and its aftermath, was a CIA officer detailed to the White House but who has since returned to the CIA. The Times didn't name the person.
Other suspects had floated among insiders, including a former official at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said to have been disgruntled about an investigation into their conduct.
A Bolton ally at the National Security Council, meanwhile, has been discussed by insiders as a suspected source of information for the whistleblower. But he “would NEVER do this,” countered a former senior administration official, who questioned whether the individual would have access to such information.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has said that the whistleblower has expressed interest in testifying, potentially ending the guessing game as to their identity.
But inside the White House, rumors and fear are likely to reign, with Trump furious after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi blessed an official impeachment inquiry, noting the timing of the call and Trump's decision to delay foreign aid to Ukraine.
“It wouldn’t be the first time” that there was a mole hunt inside the White House, said a former official.

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

Texto completo: Jimmy John's joins Arby's family: The parent company of Arby's is buying Jimmy John's Sandwiches, hoping to reverse sluggish sales at the chain.
Atlanta-based Inspire Brands said the acquisition makes it the fourth-largest U.S. restaurant company, with annual sales of $14 billion and 11,200 restaurants. Inspire also owns Sonic, Buffalo Wild Wings and Rusty Taco. Jimmy John's founder and chairman, Jimmy John Liautaud, will step down and become an adviser to Inspire's board. The chain was founded in 1983 in Charleston, Illinois.
New home sales rise: U.S. new home sales jumped 7.1% in August as low mortgage rates pulled buyers into the housing market.
The Commerce Department said new home sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 713,000, from a revised 666,000 in July. So far this year, sales have risen 6.4%. The average new-house sale price in August was $404,200, up 6.1% in the past year.
New York Magazine is sold: Online publisher Vox Media is buying the owner of New York Magazine, a half-century-old publication chronicling the city's culture and events.
The companies did not state a price. They said the editorial brands will remain distinct; The New York Times reported that the merger will not result in newsroom layoffs.
Vox owns seven sites, including tech blogs The Verge and Recode, food site Eater and Vox.com. In addition to its print magazine, New York Media runs five websites that cover pop culture and food.
Hedge fund pressures Marathon: Elliott Management renewed its push for Marathon Petroleum to split into three, a move the hedge fund said would unlock more than $22 billion in value.
Marathon should divide its refining business, Speedway retail stations and MPLX pipeline into separate companies, the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer said Wednesday. Elliott said it owns about 2.5% of Marathon.
Marathon shares jumped 8% Wednesday.
Amazon unveils wireless earbuds: Amazon doesn't want you to leave home without Alexa. The online shopping giant unveiled wireless earbuds, its first major attempt at getting its Alexa voice assistant outside of homes, at a Seattle event.
The Echo Buds, which cost $130, let users order an Uber or find the nearest coffee shop while strolling down the street. Later this year, Whole Foods shoppers wearing the black buds can ask Alexa which aisle contains canned tomatoes or other groceries.
Amazon said some customers will be invited to buy $180 prescription glasses with Alexa built in. It also will sell a limited number of Alexa-enabled rings.
FTC sues Match: The Federal Trade Commission is suing Match Group for allegedly using notifications about phony profiles to trick consumers into paying for a subscription to dating site Match.com
The site lets people create profiles for free but they must pay for a subscription to respond to messages. The FTC said Wednesday that Match sent millions of emails about notices that came from accounts already flagged as probably fake. Nearly 500,000 people between June 2016 and May 2018 subscribed to Match.com after receiving communications from fake profiles, the FTC said.
Match issued a statement calling the FTC's claims "outrageous" and said it plans to vigorously defend itself.
Peloton prices IPO: Peloton Interactive Inc., the fitness startup known for on-demand workout programs on its exercise bikes, priced its initial public offering Wednesday at $29 a share, the top end of its target range, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Texto completo: Good thing her new show is on Netflix.
Gwyneth Paltrow stopped by "Today" Thursday to promote her new series "The Politician. " While speaking to co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, she made a hilarious revelation about what it's like to be the mom of teens that might be a little shocking for morning TV.
"It's the best," the mother of Apple, 15, and Moses, 13, said, smiling. "They're really coming into themselves. They're hilarious, they're smart, they can talk, they can sort of muse about things. It's just the greatest. I mean, yeah, they can be kind of, you know, (jerks) once in a while. "
Obviously she didn't say jerks. What she did say rhymes with "clicks. "
The comment, which aired without being censored but was later bleeped when the sit-down interview was shared online, made Guthrie laugh.
"We don't usually put a 7-second delay on when Gwyneth comes on," she said. "I don't even know if we're allowed to say that. "
"Sorry. Sorry, America," Paltrow offered.
"Gwyneth, I like when you're showing that side of you," the morning host complimented. "People don't normally get to see it. "
The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall: From 'The Politician' to (yes) 'High School Musical'

In a more serious moment of the interview, Paltrow shared that her daughter served as partial inspiration for speaking to Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, "She Said" authors and journalists for The New York Times, who wrote about Harvey Weinstein's alleged misconduct in 2017.
Paltrow said on "Today" that she had her reservations.
"I was really scared. I think society had shown us only basically examples where women coming forward ended up not being advantageous for the woman," she said. "But I really felt like it was time. "
"I think also having a teenage daughter that's the love of my life and worrying about her going into the workplace and feeling like if there was ever a chance that there could be a cultural shift on this stuff, I wanted to participate in (it). I never could've imagined that collectively a shift this seismic would happen, but I feel proud that I have a small part in it. "

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to she rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book.
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Grieving the loss of our barbecue icons

Texto completo: "You shouldn't be so worried about the transition in the barbecue world."
Jim Auchmutey was trying to reassure John Shelton Reed and me about our loss of old-time barbecue restaurants, including Wilber's in Goldsboro and Allen & Son in Chapel Hill.
Auchmutey wrote for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for almost 30 years, specializing in stories about the South and its history and culture. His new book, "Smokelore: A Short History of Barbecue in America," is a must read for barbecue fans and social history students. Retired UNC-Chapel Hill professor Reed is one of North Carolina's barbecue gurus.
Auchmutey understands how we are grieving the loss of our barbecue icons, but he urged us to consider some positive developments. "Young people who have been on the barbecue contest circuit have learned the science of heating and cooking meats. They are better than some of the old masters and they are opening up restaurants where the barbecue is more consistently good than some of the old masters."
He pointed out that the young restaurant owners are expanding their menus. And not just with ribs and beef briquettes. They are experimenting with wood fired dishes from all over the world, adding opportunities for expanding the palate.
Reed and I conceded that there are some fine new restaurants such as Picnic in Durham where young owners have delivered outstanding results, thanks to careful sourcing of the meats and consistent cooking methods.
But, we told Auchmutey, there is a problem. The new places have to charge higher prices to cover the increased rent, new cooking equipment, loan payments, and compliance with new construction and environmental requirements.
Higher prices and fancier menus mean we do not get the same mix of construction workers, white collar people, students, and folks of modest means. Reed held out Stamey's in Greensboro as the ideal, where a simple barbecue sandwich with fixings can be within the lunch budget of almost everybody who works for a living.
These newer places, Reed said, don't give us a place where people from all walks of life can come together for a good meal at a modest price.
Something like what is happening to barbecue restaurants here in North Carolina is happening to other diners across the country according to a story by Steven Kurutz in The New York Times last month.
Kurutz describes the Oakhurst Diner in Millerton, New York, as "a living time capsule."
"Housed in the original 1950s Silk City dining car, it screams classic diner: crimped stainless-steel facade, Formica counter with stools, pink-and-blue neon sign, specials scrawled on chalkboards."
"But," he writes, "the nods to midcentury nostalgia mostly end there."
He explains that the menu includes a bowl of seaweed and brown rice, kimchi, and a hamburger made from "grass-fed and grass-finished" beef. That fancy hamburger costs $16.
It is the "same look and vibe as the classic steel original, but the food has been upgraded to reflect current tastes."
"And," mourns Kurutz, "So was born the greasy spoon serving avocado toast and deconstructed chicken potpie."
Kurutz introduces and quotes Richard J.S. Gutman, author of "American Diner Then and Now," who explains the current appeal of the old diners. "You feel at home in the diner whether you've been there dozens of times or it's your first time. There's a buzz inside. There's a kind of energy when you're sitting stool to stool, cheek by jowl, asking for the ketchup. That feeling, that place you'd go with your grandpa or your auntie, where is that anymore? There's something so democratic about diners. They're part of the community. I think that's what people are craving."
It is also what Reed and I are craving and what we are missing as our old-time barbecue places bite the dust.

Texto completo: Is U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a villain or a victim? It's a question that seems to divide Americans into two camps. But what if it's the wrong question to ask?
During his confirmation hearings a year ago, lots of circumstantial evidence turned up suggesting that Kavanaugh was a drunken cad in his youth and early adulthood. Then the confirmation process was upended by testimony from Christine Blasey Ford - who in her teens was tangentially in the same social circles - that Kavanaugh and a friend sexually assaulted her.
Very powerful institutional forces came to Kavanaugh's defense, painting him as the victim of a persecution campaign by political opponents. President Trump, Sen. Lindsey Graham - a powerful member of the Senate Judiciary Committee - and Kavanaugh himself played the victim card, presenting the nominee as a sacrificial lamb to the overreach of the #MeToo movement.
The proceedings ended with Kavanaugh's confirmation, leaving many critics of the process claiming that the relevant authorities - the Senate Judiciary Committee (under Republican control) and the FBI (ditto) - failed to scrutinize with due rigor the evidence presented by Blasey Ford and other witnesses to the alleged debauchery of the young Kavanaugh. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh's advocates made great use of one of the troubling aspects of such cases: the fuzzy memories of women who come forward years later, when evidence and corroborating testimony is more dubious and difficult to come by.
Positions tend to align with people's politics, a fact that's being mined for all it is worth with the release of a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation." The authors, reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly of the New York Times, wrote an article for the Times unveiling a previously unreported allegation that as a college freshman at Yale, a drunken Kavanaugh, his pants down, had his penis shoved into the hand of a female student by his friends. In an embarrassing later clarification, the paper noted that the woman supposedly involved refused to be interviewed and that her friends say she denies having been involved in such an incident.
The book also delves into similar allegations by Yale alumna Deborah Ramirez, who never received the federal investigative attention paid to Blasey Ford.
The emergence of Pogrebin and Kelly's book is tailormade for Trump's Twitter obsession, his disdain for journalists and a penchant for snarling judgments. All the better that the rollout was hobbled by an editorial misdeed. The Times has been roundly and rightfully pilloried for failing to note the noncooperation of the supposed female victim.
That fact has been red meat for Republican leadership. Meanwhile, many Democrats - including several presidential hopefuls - have pounced on the possibility of damning new details.
Stepping for a moment out of the political maelstrom of charge and countercharge, we ought to consider what message young people are receiving.
Here's the admonishment I fear they hear about the alcohol-filled parties of high school and college where something awful might happen: Don't tell anyone. Keep it to yourself. Forever. Nothing good comes of it.
Sometimes it feels as if nothing has changed for young people in America. They are navigating working a first job with an older male supervisor who might catcall or try to fondle them. They're young men attending fraternity parties who don't realize that they hold extraordinary power to influence their friends, that their intervention might save another person from sexual assault.
Wouldn't it be better for all to recognize that this does not address the trauma of sexual assault - trauma that, in many cases, goes untreated for years?

7 Shows That Will Inspire the Next Wave of Bidding Wars Among Streaming Powers

The streaming wars of the present are less about the high-profile, big-budget home run swings the respective online powers are taking on exclusive originals and more about the gaudy sums being throw around for legacy programming. Classic sitcoms are selling for the GDPs of small cities. WarnerMedia’s HBO Max paid $425 million for the exclusive streaming rights to Friends and another nine figure-plus total for The Big Bang Theory. NBCUniversal’s Peacock dropped $500 million to reclaim the rights to The Office. Netflix spent around $600 million to snag Seinfeld away from Hulu. It’s chaos out there on the open market and it isn’t ending any time soon. These heavy hitters may be locked down for the next five years, but there remains a plethora of attractive options that could spark the next great bidding war once their current deals expire.
The Walking Dead
Currently Streaming On: Netflix, YouTube TV
AMC Studios is behind the popular zombie drama now entering its 10th season and set to spawn its second spinoff in the near future. But the company also operates networks such as WE tv, BBC America, IFC and SundanceTV, giving it a roster of content that is ripe for either acquisition or verticalization.
An estimated 84% of AMC Studios’ revenue comes from distribution of its programming via subscription fees and advertising. In order to maximize earnings potential, it makes sense to continue selling content to the highest bidder, which it currently does with Netflix. But, the company has also launched AMC Premier, a mini-streaming service available only to Comcast and YouTubeTV subscribers. This service could easily be scaled into a vertically-integrated over-the-top streamer if the studio so desired. If that happened, it’s likely AMC would reclaim the exclusive streaming rights to The Walking Dead , which was licensed to Netflix in a deal that first began in 2011.
Grey’s Anatomy
Currently Streaming On: Netflix, Hulu
In its 15th season, ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy averaged nearly 7 million live viewers as one of the network’s highest-rated scripted series. No wonder ABC President Karey Burke wants to keep it around. In 2010, ABC and Netflix signed a streaming deal for full runs of several marquee titles including Grey’s Anatomy . But since then, Disney has opted into the streaming wars with Disney+ and assumed full control of Hulu. The chances are good that the Magic Kingdom will want to reclaim exclusive streaming rights for its in-house direct-to-consumer operations.
Everybody Loves Raymond
Currently Streaming On: TBS
Ray Romano’s lovable sitcom used to stream on Netflix, but is currently something of a free agent. HBO Independent Productions played a key role in its production and CBS Television Distribution was integral in the show’s distribution. That presumably gives HBO Max and CBS All Access the inside track to its back catalog, but Amazon Prime should really throw out a Godfather offer. Nearly 33 million viewers tuned it for Everybody Loves Raymond ‘s series finale in 2005. Nine seasons of laughs are potentially up for grabs.
NCIS
Currently Streaming On: Netflix, CBS All Access
In 2018, the CBS Corporation signed a two-year deal that saw popular CBS-owned series such as NCIS , Fraiser , Medium and Cheers become available to stream on Netflix. However, after the Viacom-CBS merger, the newly formed company has less incentive to license its content out to streaming rivals. It wouldn’t be a stretch to see the newly bulked up conglomerate make a move to reclaim the exclusive streaming rights to NCIS , which ranks among the 10 favorite available over-the-top streaming series, according to findings from the OTT OpenX report.
However, CBS and its roster of reliable procedurals and sitcoms are aimed at an older demographic. The median age of CBS stalwarts such as Young Sheldon and Big Bang Theory viewers is 57.4 and 56.2, respectively, according to the New York Times . About 42% of streamers are Gen Xers and 39% are Millennials, per Forbes.
This Is Us
Currently Streaming On: Hulu, YouTube TV
This Is Us is broadcast’s only offering to notch an Emmy nomination for Best Drama this year. It’s also one of the most popular games in town with more than 8 million live viewers for NBC in Season 3. But the series is produced by 20th Century Fox Television which is now owned by, you guessed it, Disney. It’s safe to say that the Mouse House would want the exclusive streaming rights to one of television’s most-watched shows once its current deal expires.
Supernatural
Currently Streaming On: Netflix
Netflix and The CW signed a massive $1 billion library deal in 2011 and then extended it in 2016. But earlier this year, The CW—which operates under parent companies CBS and Warner Bros. — opted not to renew its agreement. Past seasons of existing CW series that are already housed on Netflix will remain throughout their broadcast tenures and possibly beyond. This keeps Supernatural locked down for now, but there will come a time in the near future when The CW attempts to cash in on the show’s 300-plus episodes. Supernatural will premiere its 15th and final season in October.
Mad Men
Currently Streaming On: Netflix
Lionsgate is planning to auction off the Emmy-winning Mad Men next year after seeing the prodigious sums shelled out for Seinfeld ($500 million) and Friends ($425 million). The studio may, however, want to adjust their expectations as the critically acclaimed drama about advertising executives in the 1960s never held the same commercial appeal as other entries in this list.
Netflix first signed a deal valued at $1 million per episode with Lionsgate TV for streaming rights to Mad Men in 2011. Lionsgate owns Starz, which has launched its own streaming service, and are reportedly looking to be courted by Netflix, HBO Max and Apple as well.
Bonus: Pro-Sports Streaming Rights
In 2018, NBC’s Sunday Night Football was the second-most-watched TV program with an average audience of 19.6 million viewers. Five of the top 10 most-watched individual telecasts last year were NFL-related. This is important because potential change is on the horizon with the majority of the NFL’s current broadcasting deals expiring at the end of the 2022 season. While a complete migration of NFL games and other major North American pro sports to streaming platforms is unlikely, increased simulcasts are expected to be a point of focus in the upcoming round of negotiations.
“If you believe that these marquis shows are commanding a huge premium in the streaming world then wait until the next cycle of pro-sports streaming rights are on the block,” Lou Schwartz, CEO of Frankly Media, told Observer. “It will eclipse anything else you’ve ever seen in the realm of content licensing for broadcast/streaming.”

Eli Lake: Why Trump relishes the upcoming impeachment battle

Texto completo: The allegation that President Donald Trump called Ukraine’s new leader to bully him into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden was too much. After months of warning her fellow Democrats about the perils of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has changed her mind.
At this moment, a normal president would tread lightly. Impeachment hearings and a Senate trial are not ideal in an election year.
But Trump is not a normal president. He has been irascible this week at the United Nations - insulting reporters, denying and then confirming elements of the allegations against him, taunting his opponents by calling openly for the investigation of Biden and his son.
Maybe Trump is feeling confident because he has reviewed his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He said on Tuesday that he would take the unprecedented step of releasing a transcript of that call.
This is unlikely to sate the appetite of the resistance, however, and there is still the matter of a whistleblower whose report was deemed urgent enough by the intelligence community’s inspector general to send to Congress, only to have that transmission stymied by the acting director of national intelligence. Now that whistleblower is seeking to brief Congress. Even Republican senators on Tuesday voted to urge the executive to hand over the whistleblower’s report.
Some think that Trump’s provocations are deliberate: The president seeks his own impeachment because it’s unpopular with voters and will rally his base. It was just one day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified before Congress, after all, when Trump allegedly told Zelenskiy to discuss the Biden affair with his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani. That doesn’t seem like a man who’s particularly worried about being impeached, notes Ross Douthat in the New York Times.
No, it doesn’t. But Trump knows something else here too: Not only what’s in the transcript, but that he will have the good fortune of being impeached by the same party that tried but failed to make stick the charge of Russian collusion. Which is to say, the impeachers have their own credibility problems.
Consider the man who got the Ukraine scandal going, Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
Today Schiff is negotiating to hear the testimony of the intelligence community whistleblower and has stoked the story about Trump’s alleged collusion with Ukraine. In 2017 and 2018, Schiff was the Democrats’ point man on Trump-Russia collusion. He defended a dubious opposition research dossier used by the FBI to obtain a federal surveillance warrant of Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. He rattled off many of its allegations in his opening statement at a March 20, 2017 hearing. In November of that year, he told the Wall Street Journal that the dossier was largely accurate. He publicly defended the surveillance of Page.
Yet Page has never been charged with a crime. In fact, the only Trump associates who were charged faced offenses unrelated to the central conspiracy that Schiff and other Democrats hyped for the first two and a half years of Trump’s presidency. When Mueller’s report was finally released to the public, Schiff still sought to portray the fizzle as a flash, saying it raised “serious counterintelligence concerns that the committee must follow.” For Schiff there is always another allegation that must be pursued, even when the initial conspiracy is not found.
Trump, in his oafish way, is using Schiff’s playbook when it comes to Biden. It’s true that in 2016 the then-vice president pressured the Ukrainian government to fire a prosecutor who had investigated a company on which his son was a board member. But the prosecutor in question had a miserable reputation among reformers and was widely believed by the State Department to be unconcerned about corruption. Indeed, he had declined to cooperate with a British probe of the company in question.
Trump does not really want a Ukrainian probe in order to find dirt on the Bidens. He wants a spectacle to spotlight the “dirt” that’s already known. It’s not unlike an oversight investigation or a counterintelligence inquiry that digs into allegations generated by opposition research. The point is not to find facts, but to give the appearance that your “facts” are more durable than they really are.
There is an important difference, though. Adam Schiff is one of 435 members of Congress. Donald Trump is the president. He has more power than Schiff to abuse - and his violations of long-held norms are more consequential. A normal president, sensitive to this disparity, would steer clear of entangling a foreign leader in domestic politics. But Trump is not - say it again - a normal president.

Tokyo 2020 Olympics: Ticket packages 'running scarce' and other insider travel tips

Resumen: It's time to start planning your Tokyo 2020 Olympics journey.

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. Where should I stay? When should I book my flights? What is there to do while I'm in Tokyo? What is there to do outside of Tokyo? What is the weather going to be like? But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the 2020 Olympics?
July 24 to Aug. 9. U. S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U. S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list. Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471. 50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics?
There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U. S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends travelers fly into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U. S. (i. e. if you're leaving from California, go for under $700).
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10 to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they either arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay?
Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling. " Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a significantly reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. . Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book during that period yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price per night.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o. d. o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant located in New York’s Flatiron neighborhood, recommends travelers stay at a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo?
Shibuya Crossing
Who knew a crosswalk could also double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing isn't just any crosswalk. It could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji
Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails there from early July to early September.
Animal cafes
Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
First time in Tokyo? Here are 5 things you should do
Other notable sights
Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do near Tokyo?
Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are scattered in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura, which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Anything else I should keep in mind?
"One of the greatest misconceptions about Japan is that it can be unapproachable and difficult to navigate effectively because of the language barrier and cultural formality," Tadehara says. "Though it is true that English is not as prevalent here as it is in other non-English speaking countries, getting around and immersing in authentic experiences is easy with a little preparation. "
Getting around
The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Congressional Republicans on Wednesday dismissed a call between President Donald Trump and the leader of Ukraine as much ado about nothing, despite a summary of the call showing Trump repeatedly pressing for an investigation into a political rival.
“What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger,” tweeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. “Democrats have lost their minds when it comes to President @realDonaldTrump. ”
House Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries labeled the call a “textbook abuse of power” but declined to say whether it’s evidence enough to impeach the president.
“We are in the midst of an impeachment inquiry,” Jeffries said.
The next step, he said, is getting a complaint filed by a whistleblower in the intelligence community.
House Republican leaders denounced Pelosi’s launch of an impeachment inquiry as disgraceful, unprecedented, unfounded and irresponsible as the summary was released.
“When this transcript comes out – is it out?” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. , said in his weekly remarks to the news media. “I think at the end of the day, the speaker owes an apology to this nation, and I think it’s even a question whether she should stay in her job. We are done with this. ”
McCarthy walked away as reporters asked him about the details of the call.
Republicans put out statements saying Trump did not unduly pressure the Ukrainian president.
“I’ve read the transcript in its entirety. It shows that there was no quid pro quo," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. "The Ukrainian president admitted problems with corruption in the country and agreed that the issue at hand warranted looking into further. "
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , who heads the House intelligence committee, said the call reads like a "classic, mafia-like shakedown of a foreign leader. "
More: Trump acknowledges he delayed aid for Ukraine but says he didn't do it to force a Biden investigation
Schiff, along with the chairs of three other House committees investigating the president, issued a joint statement saying no quid pro quo is necessary to conclude Trump betrayed the country.
"The corruption exists whether or not Trump threatened – explicitly or implicitly – that a lack of cooperation could result in withholding military aid," they said.
Pelosi said the details of the call released Wednesday show she was right to begin steps toward possible impeachment.
“The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the president’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry," she said. "Clearly, the Congress must act. "
More: Read Nancy Pelosi's full remarks as she called for an impeachment inquiry of President Trump
Tuesday, the Senate unanimously backed a resolution offered by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N. Y. , calling for the whistleblower complaint to immediately be sent to the intelligence committees.
That measure was much more limited in scope and restrained in language than the House resolution.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. , did not object to the measure, even as he said it was not the appropriate way to address the issue.
"It doesn't serve the committee or its goals to litigate its business here on the floor or the television cameras," McConnell said. "Nevertheless, I agree that the (director of national intelligence) should make additional information available to the committee, so it can evaluate the complaint consistent with the statute and other procedures that exist to safeguard classified and sensitive information. "
McConnell called Pelosi's impeachment inquiry announcement a "rush to judgment. "
“It simply confirms that House Democrats’ priority is not making life better for the American people," McConnell said, "but their nearly three-year-old fixation on impeachment. ”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The soldier at the wheel of a truck that overturned in June, killing a West Point cadet and injuring 21 others on the way to a training exercise, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, negligent homicide, reckless driving and dereliction of duty, the Army said on Tuesday.
The soldier, Staff Sgt. Ladonies P. Strong, faces a preliminary hearing in mid-October to determine whether her case will be referred to a court-martial trial, according to Lt. Col. Patrick Husted, a spokesman for the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., the sergeant's parent command.
The cadet who was killed, Christopher J. Morgan, died at the scene of the accident. Two trainers and 19 other cadets were injured.
Mr. Morgan, 22, who was expected to graduate next year, was a member of the academy's wrestling team and was recruited after a standout wrestling career at his high school in West Orange, N.J., his hometown.
The truck, known as a light medium tactical vehicle, was transporting the cadets on June 6 to a training area about eight miles from West Point's main campus in upstate New York when it overturned at 6:45 a.m., a West Point spokesman, Lt. Col. Christopher Ophardt, said at the time.
The five-ton truck driven by Sergeant Strong overturned near Camp Natural Bridge, a summer training site of mountainous terrain. The cadets were in the middle of the annual summer program for rising seniors, which generally includes training in military field exercises.
The cause of the accident is still under investigation, Colonel Husted said in an email on Tuesday.
The accident was one of several fatal rollovers during military training exercises in recent months, prompting lawmakers in Washington to demand that the Pentagon investigate the causes.
On May 16, Army Staff Sgt. Jacob Hess, 34, died from injuries after a Humvee rolled over at a military training center in Louisiana.
A week earlier, First Lt. Hugh C. McDowell, 24, a Marine platoon commander, was killed when a light-armored vehicle rolled over during a training exercise at Camp Pendleton in California.
It was the second deadly rollover at Camp Pendleton in a month. In April, Staff Sgt. Joshua Braica, 29, also died after a vehicle rolled over there.

It's the Environment, Stupid

Texto completo: I don't know who sold progressive Democrats on the idea that the way to beat Donald Trump is to abolish the private health insurance of 160 million Americans and offer instead "Medicare for all" (and Mexico will pay for it), but it's a political loser and an easy target for Trump to feast on. A much better campaign theme is hiding in plain sight. I call it "the Earth Race."
In the 1960s, John F. Kennedy energized the country behind a "space race": to make America the first nation to put a man on the moon. Democrats need to run against Trump on the Earth Race: to make America the leader in all policies and technologies that help men and women everywhere live sustainably here on Earth?
Yes, I know, mitigating climate change and saving the environment never poll well. But times change, and it depends how you frame the issue. Mother Nature is forcing herself onto the ballot, and Trump's efforts to roll back more than 80 rules and standards protecting clean air, water, climate, parks and wilderness make him uniquely vulnerable. He can't pivot away from what he's doing. He owns it, and it's villainous. This time is different.
In this era when so much activism is online, when was the last time you saw a bottom-up, mass movement of young people in America and across the world -- some four million in all -- take to the streets on every continent as they did last week to demand action to stop the heating of our planet? These young people are telling us, and their voting parents, that this issue is a political winner -- theirs is a movement in search of courageous political leaders.
I am not saying that the Earth Race is the only issue to run on. I'm all for strengthening Obamacare and even adding a public health insurance option. But if I were running for president against Trump, I'd be leading with the Earth Race as an economic opportunity, a national security necessity, a health emergency, an environmental urgency and a moral obligation. No other issue can combine those five.
I'd pound Trump every day with this message: "Trump says he cares about you. Well, that's funny, because he clearly doesn't care about the water you drink. He just revoked a rule that prohibited coal mining debris from being dumped into local streams -- among other actions to weaken the Clean Water Act -- so that pro-Trump coal companies can make more money while they make you sick. What kind of president does that?
"Trump says he cares about you. Well, that's funny, because he clearly doesn't care about the air you breathe. He's weakening clean air rules so that power and coal companies can emit more pollutants, methane and carbon dioxide into the air -- so they can make more money and give your kids more childhood asthma today and disruptive climate change tomorrow. What kind of father does that?
"Trump says he cares about making America great again. Well, that's funny, because he clearly doesn't care about American automakers and their supply chains. He's trying to force California and other states to weaken their gas mileage and pollution standards so our companies -- which don't even want this change -- can make gas guzzlers and no longer produce cars that get mileage as good as those in Japan or emit as little pollution as China's expanding electric car fleets. Who the hell does that?
"The last time our auto industry indulged in a race to the bottom on mileage and pollution standards, it went bankrupt. That's why automakers are resisting Trump's effort to dumb them down. There are 42 Chinese companies actively manufacturing and selling electric cars in China right now -- and they can't wait to ship them here once Trump forces our manufacturers to make more polluting gas guzzlers.
"All 18,000 public buses in Shenzhen, China, a city of 12 million people, went electric by the end of 2017. 'Taxis soon followed suit,' TechCrunch reported in January. In Shenzhen today, 99 percent of the more than 21,000 cabs run on electric batteries. How does America become great again if we're surrendering the world's next great industry -- clean power generation and transportation -- to China?
"Trump says he's pro-business. Well, that's funny, because he's trying to expand the use of polluting coal when both wind and solar are now cheaper in many locations, including red states. Even Texas is enjoying the cost, environmental and job-creating advantages of wind over coal, producing almost twice as much wind energy as California.
"The Los Angeles Times reported last week: 'The cost of wind power has fallen about 50 percent since 2010. Solar has dropped 85 percent. That makes them cheaper than new coal and gas plants in two-thirds of the world, according to research organization BloombergNEF.'
"Trump says he wants to make America energy independent. Well, that's funny, because he just rolled back the lighting standards initiated by President George W. Bush and his assistant secretary of energy Andy Karsner to phase out energy-sucking, heat-emitting incandescent and halogen bulbs and replace them with energy-efficient LEDs.
"Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, told NPR: 'The rollback will eliminate energy-efficient standards for light bulbs that were slated to take effect in January that would save consumers billions of dollars and reduce millions of tons of climate change carbon dioxide emissions.' Who does that?"
How do you run against all these things Trump's doing? With a simple message repeated over and over: "Trump is poisoning Americans and weakening America. Join the Earth Race. Make America healthier, wealthier, smarter and more secure."
And with a simple solution, too. The Earth Race doesn't need a giant Green New Deal that tries to change everything at once, as noble as that goal is. It just needs to aggressively amplify what is already happening. Today, 24 states -- including blue California and purple New Mexico -- have put in place, to varying degrees, steadily rising standards for clean energy from their power plants and efficiency standards for their vehicles, homes and buildings.
We've already seen the impact, as Andrew McAfee documents in his important new book, "More From Less." Total resource use in America is now declining -- even as our economy has kept growing -- because rising standards like these have made us steadily more efficient and innovative.
A candidate running on the Earth Race should just say: "I'll require all 50 states to move to such standards. When you get all 50 states imposing steadily rising standards for clean power, transportation and energy efficiency -- and let the market determine the most effective solutions -- you will unleash an explosion of innovation that will create thousands of products to export to the rest of the world in so many different areas of clean power, energy and efficiency -- and you'll be mitigating climate change at the same time."
The Earth Race candidate would tell people every day: "You can vote for a man who wants to bring back cars that get bad mileage, lights that use more energy and produce more heat, power plants that produce more asthma, chemical companies that pollute more rivers, coal companies that pollute more air, mining companies that strip more pristine landscapes, and an economy that lags China in the next great global industry.
"Or you can join the Earth Race and make Donald Trump's presidency an extinct species while saving Mother Nature's endangered species."
If a candidate can't make headway with that message, either America is doomed or he or she doesn't belong in politics.

HARRY FLYNN 1933 - 2019

Texto completo: Former Archbishop Harry Flynn, who led Minnesota's largest Catholic diocese for more than a dozen years and struggled with fallout from the church's sexual abuse scandal as it played out across the country, has died. He was 86.
The Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis reported that Flynn died Sunday night. The Rev. John Malone, a longtime friend and colleague, said Flynn had several bouts with cancer in recent years and had moved into hospice care in the Twin Cities last Tuesday.
"He never wanted to be a bishop," said Malone, who was a professor and administrator at the University of St. Thomas. "He'd do anything he could to get out of the office. He was a man who wanted to be present to the people he served."
Flynn took over as archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis in 1995, after previously working in New York, Maryland and Louisiana. In 2002, he led a task force of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that looked into the clergy sexual abuse crisis.
Flynn retired in 2008, but continued to live in Minnesota until his death. Following later revelations of abuse by archdiocesan priests during his tenure, he resigned from the University of St. Thomas Board of Trustees in 2013.
Two years later, in a deposition related to abuse lawsuits, Flynn said under oath that he recalled few details of steps taken under his watch in his own diocese to root out problem priests. He didn't recall ever trying to defrock a priest despite later evidence of numerous offenders during that time, he said.
"All of that took a significant toll on him," said Sister Fran Donnelly, who served under Flynn as director of ministry during most of his tenure.
David Clohessy, former national president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said he viewed Flynn as just another church leader who didn't do enough in the face of mounting evidence.
"He was affable, charming, smart -- like so many bishops," Clohessy said. "But he refused to take very simple, common-sense, proven steps that could have protected kids."
Flynn was born May 2, 1933, in Schenectady, N.Y. Malone said Flynn's parents died before he was a teenager, after which he was mostly raised by three aunts. He attended seminary in Maryland and worked as a priest there and his home state before joining the Diocese of Lafayette, La., as bishop in the late 1980s.
At the time Flynn took over, that diocese was reeling from its own abuse scandal.
"Everyone knew why he was there," said Jason Berry, a journalist and author who covered those scandals at the time and later wrote a book, "Lead Us Not Into Temptation," about the church scandals. "He had the reputation of being a reformer, being part of the solution."
The Rev. Ken Bartsch worked as a priest in a neighboring Louisiana diocese when Flynn took over in Lafayette. He said Flynn had a big personality and gregarious manner.
"He had that politician's gift. But there was also a certain iron fist under that silk glove," said Bartsch.
Flynn came to Minnesota to succeed Archbishop John Roach, who'd served in the job for two decades. Donnelly had been appointed to her leadership job by Roach, whose own reputation at that time as a reformer on abuse issues may have contributed to the decision to install Flynn, she said. Donnelly also recalled Flynn as a pastor at heart who was happier when he was out among the congregations and mixing with churchgoers.
"He had a fabulous sense of humor and loved to tease people," Donnelly said.
Flynn was viewed in some quarters as liberal-minded on some church matters, especially in comparison to his successor, Archbishop John Nienstedt, who later resigned under pressure over the abuse scandals.
It's true Flynn didn't come down as hard on some congregations that flouted traditional church teaching on issues like homosexuality, Donnelly said. But she said he would have taken great issue with being called a liberal Catholic.
In an interview when he took over as archbishop. Flynn said he was conservative regarding the faith, adding: "Would I be liberal about the taking of that faith and making sure every person is fed and clothed and taken care of? Absolutely."
Conflict over abuse scandals
In 2002, the leadership of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops appointed Flynn to lead the church's highest committee devoted to issues surrounding clerical sexual abuse. He replaced a New Hampshire archbishop who had faced criticism for his handling of the issue, according to a New York Times story at that time. Under Flynn, the panel drafted a Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People.
But abuse scandals continued to surface, including the allegations from under Flynn's watch. He said in the 2015 deposition that his work leading the panel may have distracted him from addressing problems in his own backyard.
Last year, a bankruptcy judge approved a $210 million settlement between the Archdiocese of St. Paul and more than 400 survivors.
After Flynn's retirement, Malone said, he maintained a small circle of friends. Before entering hospice, Malone said, Flynn had been living in the parish rectory at the Church of St. Vincent de Paul in St. Paul's Frogtown neighborhood.
Malone said Flynn knew in recent days that his end was coming.
"He was ready to go," Malone said. "He wasn't afraid at all."

Texto completo: Plácido Domingo, the opera star who was accused of sexual harassment by at least nine women earlier this summer, is primed to make his fall season debut as the star of Verdi’s Macbeth at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City on Wednesday evening. According to a new report from NPR, Peter Gelb, the opera’s general manager, held a meeting last Friday with the institution’s orchestra and chorus in order to discuss why Domingo was not being suspended by the Met. Four Met employees who spoke to NPR anonymously said that Gelb told the group that part of the reason why he hadn’t taken any steps to investigate Domingo’s conduct was because the singer’s accusers had only spoken to the Associated Press, and not to any other reputable news outlets.
Gelb also reportedly said that since all the women who spoke to the AP did so anonymously, this dilutes the validity of their claims, despite the fact that Patricia Wulf and Angela Turner Wilson both put their names behind their accusations of Domingo. Just a week before the AP story in question came out, news broke that the Met Opera had settled a lawsuit regarding the sexual misconduct-related firing of conductor James Levine, who had been a fixture at the institution for decades.
SEE ALSO: Star Tenor Plácido Domingo Accused of Sexual Harassment by Nine Women
“[Gelb] explained that because there was currently no corroborated evidence against Mr. Domingo the Met believed that the fair and correct thing to do was to wait until the investigations by LA Opera and AGMA had taken place,” the Met said in a statement sent to NPR. “He explained that if corroborated evidence is made public either through the investigations or other means, the Met would take prompt action.”
Back in August, the AP published an expansive investigation into the behavior of 78-year-old Domingo, who has long been touted as one of the opera world’s most respected and revered figures. According to a dancer and eight singers who have worked with or close to the celebrated Grammy winner, Domingo has repeatedly sexually harassed women in a wide spectrum of ways, including bestowing unwanted kisses, groping and professionally icing out people who rejected his advances.
In the immediate aftermath of the AP story hitting the news, Domingo issued a statement calling the allegations “as presented, inaccurate.” The Los Angeles Opera, of which Domingo is the General Director, hired the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to conduct an independent investigation that is apparently still ongoing; the LA Opera declined to comment for this story.
Domingo’s accusers have also triggered a rash of conversations about his professional future. “Plácido Domingo is a huge cash cow, and sometimes I feel like management cares more about money and reputation,” a female choir member at the Met told NPR. “What if these accusations turn out to be true or if there’s legal action against Maestro Domingo? I feel that Peter Gelb is saying, ‘I don’t have a problem exposing my artists to such situations.'”
Soon after the allegations against Domingo originally emerged, the Philadelphia Orchestra rescinded a gala invitation that had previously been extended to Domingo and the San Francisco Opera cancelled a planned concert that would have starred him. “We are committed to providing a safe, supportive, respectful, and appropriate environment for the Orchestra and staff, for collaborating artists and composers, and for our audiences and communities,” the Philadelphia Orchestra said in a statement on August 13.
The Metropolitan Opera did not respond to a request for comment.
Update: On Tuesday afternoon, Domingo announced he would be withdrawing from the Metropolitan Opera’s production of Macbeth. The singer provided a statement to the New York Times , which read in part: “I believe that my appearance in this production of Macbeth would distract from the hard work of my colleagues both onstage and behind the scenes.” The Met also provided a statement, noting “Plácido Domingo has agreed to withdraw from all future performances at the Met, effective immediately. The Met and Mr. Domingo are in agreement that he needed to step down.”

Paul Krugman: Republicans only pretend to be patriots

Texto completo: Republicans have spent the past half-century portraying themselves as more patriotic, more committed to national security than Democrats. Richard Nixon’s victory in 1972, Ronald Reagan’s victory in 1980 and George W. Bush’s victory in 2004 (the only presidential election out of the past seven in which the Republican won the popular vote) all depended in part on posing as the candidate more prepared to confront menacing foreigners.
And Barack Obama faced constant, scurrilous accusations of being too deferential to foreign rulers. Remember the “apology tour,” or the assertions that he had bowed to overseas leaders?
But now we have a president who really is unpatriotic to the point of betraying American values and interests. We don’t know the full extent of Donald Trump’s malfeasance — we don’t know, for example, how much his policies have been shaped by the money foreign governments have been lavishing on his businesses. But even what we do know — his admitted solicitation of foreign help in digging up dirt on political rivals, his praise for brutal autocrats — would have had Republicans howling about treason if a Democrat had done it.
Yet almost all GOP politicians seem perfectly fine with Trump’s behavior. Which means that it’s time to call Republican superpatriotism what it was long before Trump appeared on the scene: a fraud.
After all, a true patriot is willing to make some sacrifice, to give up some personal or policy goal, in the national interest. Can anyone point to any prominent figure in the modern Republican Party who has done that?
In fact, the periods in which Republicans worked hardest to wrap themselves in the flag and question Democrats’ loyalty were also periods in which the GOP doubled down on its usual domestic agenda of making the rich richer. Even as George W. Bush’s administration was hyping the war on terrorism and leading America to war on false pretenses, the party was pushing for tax cuts: “Nothing,” declared Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader at the time, “is more important in the face of a war than cutting taxes.”
But if Republican superpatriotism has always been a fraud, why were so many Americans taken in? After all, polling suggests that except for a brief period after the extent of the Iraq debacle became clear, the public has consistently viewed the GOP as stronger than Democrats on national security.
My guess, although I’d love to see some serious research from political scientists, is that for most of the past half-century the GOP’s patriotic posturing dovetailed with its domestic political strategy, which centered on hostility to the Other.
Republicans positioned themselves as the champions of white, small-town America against people of color and cosmopolitan urban elites; they also posed as the nation’s defenders against international communism and Islamic extremism, which in reality had nothing to do either with each other or with domestic racial tensions, but somehow fit psychologically because they involved strange people with funny names.
The irony is that in the past few years this paranoid fantasy, in which a major U.S. political party is de facto allied with an international movement hostile to American values, has actually become true. But the party in question is the GOP, which under Trump has effectively become part of a cross-national coalition of authoritarian white nationalists. Republicans were never the patriots they pretended to be, but at this point they’ve pretty much crossed the line into being foreign agents.
And why have both professional Republicans and the party’s base gone along with this? You need to think of Trump’s foreign entanglements in the context of a GOP establishment that realizes that its domestic agenda is deeply unpopular, and a rank-and-file that sees itself on the losing side of demographic and social change. The result is a party that is increasingly willing to play dirty, violating democratic norms, to hold on to power.
And once a party has decided to do whatever it takes to prevail politically, there’s no reason to expect the foul play to stop at the water’s edge. If a party is willing to rig political outcomes by preventing minorities from voting, if it’s willing to use extreme gerrymandering to retain power even when voters reject it, why won’t it be equally willing to encourage foreign powers to subvert U.S. elections? A bit of treason is just part of the package.
Which brings me to the political question of the moment: Should Democrats begin an impeachment inquiry? Such an inquiry almost certainly wouldn’t remove Trump from office, because Republicans in the Senate wouldn’t vote to convict. But that misses the point.
What an impeachment process would do now is get the truth about who really cares about defending America and its values — and who doesn’t — out into the open. By forcing Republicans to explicitly condone behavior they would have called treason if a Democrat did it, Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues can finally put an end to the GOP’s long pretense of being more patriotic than its opponents.

'Parents that can't let go' pose problems

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to sign, and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions and — in at least one case — bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid, so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of the American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting — when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood, such as marriage and homeownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute. Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time, and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Both Goldsmith and Sarno said parental interference in work matters is rare and not unique to millennials, who have been unfairly maligned by some as lazy or entitled.
Most of the parents with whom Goldsmith works as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said. Instead of teaching, they take action.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said. "I see a lot of emerging adults who struggle to know how to have difficult emotional conversations with their bosses. That's hard; there's no class for that. We often learn that by talking to our parents. But if the parents step in and do it for you, you never learn it."
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said. Both hit adulthood without a tool kit for dealing with adversity and feel as if they have not accomplished anything on their own.
"What I see, and this is a direct result of helicopter parenting, is kids who hit 25 and they've never hit a major roadblock in their life and they are terrified of failure, paralyzed because they feel like life is only successful if you make no mistakes," Goldsmith said. "Kids that were helicopter-parented in many ways look like the kids who never had opportunities ... because they're never really doing it themselves."
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, Onyschak said.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently? Do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity, and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."
Still, employers like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn have embraced the close relationship between new hires and their parents, launching "Take Your Parents to Work" days to give parents a glimpse of their children's work lives.
Onyschak said she supports parents who provide more hands-off guidance: helping their children practice job interviews, helping them weigh the pros and cons of multiple job offers, looking over cover letters and résumés. But the oversight should stop there, she said.
"We're not hiring the parent, we're hiring the individual, so we want candidates who can think for themselves, who are assertive, who can ask their own questions," Onyschak said.
For parents feeling the urge to become more heavily involved, Goldsmith recommends taking a step back and asking themselves if they are facilitating — or enabling.
"When you've got a parent who's really tuned in and providing good support and facilitating growth, that kid's going to fly to the moon," he said. "But when you have a parent who responds to anxiety by stepping in and trying to run the kid's life — even if it's not as egregious as showing up at a job interview — you still end up with a kid who doesn't really trust the tools they have to be in the world."

Texto completo: You now can download a bestselling book, a hit song or a video at no charge. A plan to make people feel welcome in Broward has opened up the county's online library collections to the world.
The free access is available to anyone who logs onto the county's website at broward.org/Library and applies for an Instant eCard.
Access is also offered to airline passengers passing through Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and to people using county parks, who can scan a Quick Response (QR) code to apply for an online library access card and immediately begin making downloads.
The online cards are offered to anyone who lives, works or attends school in Broward County, or who is just visiting the county or who was born in the county. But they are set up so anyone can take advantage of them.
"I'd like to see as many people reading from anywhere in the world as possible. Anybody who's reading, who's coming through Broward, is a benefit to us," Commissioner Michael Udine said. "I have no problem if we're subsidizing a small amount, somebody who's reading a book who is not from Broward County."
Once an application is made, the library quickly sends an email with a library card number and pin, which allows users to connect to a variety of online services paid for by the county. Mobile users can also download free apps for the different services to make it easier to access those collections.
Some of the online resources are:
*OverDrive, which provides eBooks, eAudiobooks and videos, and includes New York Times best sellers.
*Freegal, a music service that allows cardholders to download up to six free songs a week - and keep them forever. Unlimited streaming of music also is possible.
*Hoopla, which has movies, music, eAudiobooks, eBooks, comics and TV shows that can be streamed or downloaded.
*Axix 360, which has eBooks for children and young adults.
*RBdigitial Magazines, which includes hundreds of popular publications.
*Rosetta Stone, which can be used to learn foreign languages.
"Another reason we're doing this is not just to provide a service to visitors, it also raises awareness of what libraries offer," library spokesman Stephen Grubb said.
A cost to taxpayers
Rita Lipof, a library worker, said the open-access policy is not fair to county taxpayers, who are footing the bill for the nonresidents using the collections. It means longer wait lists for the most popular books, forcing the county to buy more copies to meet the demand, she said, and it gives nonresidents access to other music, books and videos that the county pays a fee per download.
"I do not think it is the goal of Broward County Library to provide online resources for non-Broward County residents," Lipof told county commissioners. "It's great if you're at the airport and you're coming from another place and now you can get all these free eBooks, but it also would be great if we handed out $20 bills. People would like that, too."
Some of the online services charge the county an annual fee, while others charge by the download. OverDrive costs the county $1.2 million annually, Freegal $170,000 and Hoopla $230,000, officials said.
Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties don't offer any similar nonresident access to their online collections, officials with those programs said. Nonresidents can purchase regular library cards that are good at each county's libraries and online. Palm Beach County's cost $95 for a year or $55 for a half year, while Miami-Dade's costs $65 for a year.
Leila Khalil, a Miami-Dade library spokeswoman, said most nonresidents can access free digital services through the library systems where they live.
Growing popular
There is a rising demand in Broward for the digital resources. The library system's total digital circulation went from 1.75 million in the first 10 months of Fiscal Year 2018 to 2.12 million for the first 10 months of Fiscal Year 2019, a 22 percent increase.
So far, Broward County officials aren't worried that nonresidents will bankrupt its online programs. Nonresidents make up only a small portion of all cardholders, said Broward Library Division Director Kelvin Watson. Any increase in wait lists for the most popular items is due more to the rising number of county residents having library cards than to outsiders, he said.
In the past three years, nonresidents made up only 10 percent of the eCards issued, or 5,796 of 56,978, officials said. The nonresident portion drops to 2% when you include the 205,974 Broward residents who have received regular library cards that can also be used to access the online services.
County Administrator Bertha Henry said the county will gather more statistics about the program so it can gauge the impact out-of-county residents are having on the system. "It's expected that we're going to have people who do not live here access those readers, but it was just one more addition to how do we make our visitors feel welcome," Henry said.

Texto completo: Las Cruces-based children's author Jennifer Cervantes – pen name J.C. Cervantes – is now a three-time New York Times best-selling author.
Her latest book, "The Fire Keeper," released Sept. 3, debuted at No. 4 on the list. Her first two books – "Tortilla Sun" and "The Storm Runner" – also made the prestigious list.
Cervantes, who writes books for children and teens, said she's humbled at the distinction.
"Writing for kids is about more than entertainment," she said. "You hold their minds, and often hearts, in your hands. So to know that my books are being widely read is not only a dream come true but a responsibility I take seriously.
Cervantes said she has been an avid reader since a young age and was inspired by her youngest daughter to take up writing.
"I always say that I didn't go looking for writing, that writing found me. My youngest daughter inspired the first story I ever wrote which ended up being my first book, 'Tortilla Sun,'" she said. "When I first began to create stories, I had no idea I was writing a book. So, this journey – like that book – has been sequential. I have been fortunate to meet some incredible mentors along the way, to find the right resources at the right time, to venture to writing retreats where I pushed the limits of what I thought I could do as a writer."
Rick Riodan presents "The Fire Keeper" is a sequel to "The Storm Runner" which is based on Maya mythology and follows the story of a young New Mexican boy named Zane Obispo and his three-legged dog named Rosie. Zane spends every day exploring the sleeping volcano in his backyard he calls "The Beast," which is the one place where he can be himself and escape other kids who make fun of him for having a limp and walking cane. In the story, Zane meets with colorful characters inspired by Maya mythology.
The "Fire Keeper," introduces spirited new characters, sneaky gods, Aztec royalty, unlikely alliances and dark secrets – secrets that will change Zane forever.
The third book in the series, "The Shadow Crosser," will be released sometime in 2020.
Cervantes is the second author to publish under Rick Riordan Presents, a Disney-Hyperion imprint, headed by Riordan, best-selling author of the "Percy Jackson" series.
In addition to the "Storm Runner" series, Cervantes also has another project up her sleeves.
"I am working on a project that I can't talk about yet but that will hopefully be announced soon," she teased.
Cervantes' books can be purchased anywhere books are sold. For information, visit her official website at https://www.jennifercervantes.com/.
Set in New Mexico Cervantes, a San Diego native, attended the University of New Mexico where she met her husband, Joseph Cervantes, who is a state senator and last year ran for governor.
Jennifer Cervantes said New Mexico is the perfect backdrop for her book because its vast and open beautiful rural spaces that offer many adventures.
"I love New Mexico because of the energy and mysticism that's found in the beauty of our landscape that reminds me how big the universe is and how small we really are," Cervantes said.

NYT reporters: Blasey Ford claim still credible because friend has substance abuse history

Texto completo: The New York Times reporters who wrote The Education of Brett Kavanaugh say the accusation of sexual misconduct Dr. Christine Blasey Ford made against Justice Brett Kavanaugh is still credible, even though Ford's friend Leland Keyser doubts it.
Co-author Kate Kelly told CNN's Reliable Sources that valid issues have been raised and addressed, but also said some of the criticisms have been "a distraction from all the reporting that we did and new material that we have. It’s really sort of an attempt to discredit the messenger and avoid the conversation about the facts, about the evidence."
Kelly said their book has the first interview with Keyser, whom Ford says was at the party where Kavanaugh allegedly tried to rape her. Keyser revealed she does not believe Ford's claim and told the FBI she felt pressure from Ford's allies to change her story.
"However, we still find Christine Blasey Ford credible in the end and you will see why," Kelly said. "Keyser’s claims don’t rebut Blasey Ford’s claims and also Keyser has memory issues discussed in the book, as well, which relate to the way memory functions for all of us and also because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges. So, I think it’s important for all of these things to be seen in the full context."
iFrame Object
When Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, she downplayed how Keyser did not remember what she was claiming.
“Leland has significant health challenges, and I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs,” Ford said. “I don’t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening.”
Kelly and Robin Pogrebin's new book also included a new accusation against Kavanaugh, which featured in a New York Times article that omitted key facts about the claim. The Times appended an editor's note almost a full day after the article was published.
Pogrebin said the criticisms some have leveled against their work "just really points out how all of these facts are kind of taken out of context and then weaponized for people’s own political ends, and we think it’s really unfortunate because it obscures the actual hard work we’re doing to put the facts out there so people can make an assessment on the merits."

Marc Thiessen: Democrats the losers in push for Kavanaugh investigation

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party’s presidential candidates.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh’s impeachment. “These newest revelations are disturbing,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding “Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.” Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh’s “place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached.” Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O’Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former vice president Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and “follow the evidence to wherever it leads.” That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats’ way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let’s remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let’s relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties — all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let’s rehash Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let’s remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party’s campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were “like an adrenaline shot” for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party’s presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh’s impeachment to “get real.” “We’ve got to get beyond this ‘impeachment is the answer to every problem,'” Durbin said. “It’s become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you’re unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. … If that’s how we are identified … we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said “no.”
Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could “restructure” the court when they take power in the 2020 elections — packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, “26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same.” As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Film: The Many Faces of Antonio Banderas
Through Sept. 26; quadcinema.com .
Can anyone ever get too much of the Andalusian charms, chocolate-pool eyes and velvet purr of Antonio Banderas? The people at the Quad Cinema in Manhattan think not.
Banderas will next pop up onscreen across the country in Steven Soderbergh's "The Laundromat," as a lawyer at the center of the Panama Papers scandal (opening Sept. 27; on Netflix, Oct. 18); and in Pedro Almodóvar's "Pain and Glory" (Oct. 4), as a film director mired in an existential crisis, for which he scored a best actor-win at Cannes.
To whet your appetite until then -- as if -- the multiplex is presenting "Laws of Desire: The Films of Antonio Banderas," through Sept. 26. The 13-film lineup includes four Almodóvar collaborations -- "Labyrinth of Passion," "Matador," "Law of Desire" and "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" -- as well as turns alongside Salma Hayek in "Desperado," Madonna in "Evita," Catherine Zeta-Jones in "The Mask of Zorro" and Tom Hanks in "Philadelphia." KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Art: The Beautiful Paradoxes of da Vinci's Teacher
Through Jan. 12; nga.gov .
The 15th-century painter and sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio stood at the center of the Renaissance. A favorite of the Medicis, he was a teacher to Pietro Perugino and Leonardo da Vinci. More than five centuries later, it's still easy to see why: He had an unprecedented ability to capture human expression and sensibility in all its ephemeral specificity.
And one of the beautiful paradoxes of this new naturalism is the way it enriched images of the supernatural. With lips set and eyes downcast, Verrocchio's painted terra-cotta bust of Christ -- one of dozens of treasures in "Verrocchio: Sculptor and Painter of Renaissance Florence" at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. -- projects confidence, resignation, weariness, compassion, devotion to duty, pain and an exalted kind of loneliness.

TV: The Swan Song of 'Transparent'
Sept. 27; amazon.com .
Last year, when Jeffrey Tamborwas fired from "Transparent" after accusations of sexual misconduct, Jill Soloway, the series's creator, had a decision to make. So she has killed off Maura Pfefferman, Tambor's transgender protagonist, and wrapped up the show not with a whimper but with a song.
The result, "Transparent: Musicale Finale," debuts Sept. 27 on Amazon Prime Video. Maura's offscreen death becomes the starting point for a musical devised by her ex-wife, Shelly (Judith Light), as their grown children (Amy Landecker, Jay Duplass and Gaby Hoffmann) reunite for the funeral of the parent they called Moppa.
The movie has its genesis in revues that Faith Soloway, Jill's sister, composed and presented at Joe's Pub in Manhattan in 2017 and 2018. And the stars of those productions -- Shakina Nayfack, Lesli Margherita, Erik Liberman and Jo Lampert -- play assorted Pfefferman doppelgängers here. The original Pfeffs get songs as well, including "Sepulveda Blvd," "Your Boundary Is My Trigger" and the rousing ensemble climax "Joyocaust."
But this isn't necessarily it for "Transparent," Jill Soloway told The New York Times. "The show isn't ending," she said, imagining, say, a theatrical version. "It's transitioning." KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Dance: De Keersmaeker's Early Works
Sept. 24-28; Oct. 1-5; newyorklivearts.org .
Before Ivo van Hove's revival of "West Side Story" lands on Broadway, its choreographer -- Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker -- will get a turn in the spotlight with the return of a pair of her prized early works from the 1980s. The two-part engagement features "Fase, Four Movements to the Music of Steve Reich," Sept. 24-28; and "Rosas danst Rosas," Oct. 1-5. In "Fase," which features three duets and a solo, De Keersmaeker etches a design of precise patterns that shift over time. It's mesmerizing.
And fittingly "Rosas" builds on the drama and tension of "Fase." In this choreographic universe -- again the dancers exist within De Keersmaeker's formal structure -- four female dancers test the limits of exhaustion and determination to music by Thierry De Mey and Peter Vermeersch. To experience both is to see a brilliant choreographer's mind at work when she was just starting out: It can be gift to go back in time. GIA KOURLAS
Classical Music: A Double-Bill of Violent Modernism
Sept. 26-28; nyphil.org .
Stumbling through the forest, a woman discovers the dead body of her lover; the new bride of a nobleman tours his castle, opening doors to find torture chambers and bloodstains. Composed in the years leading to World War I, Arnold Schoenberg's "Erwartung" and Béla Bartók's "Bluebeard's Castle" both one-act operas, share much in common: Expressionist gloom, misogynistic violence, viscerally modernist scores.
This weekend, the New York Philharmonic, led by its music director, Jaap van Zweden, presents a double-bill of the darkly radical works, in a new production designed by the Swedish director Bengt Gomer. The soprano Nina Stemme and the baritone Johannes Martin Kränzle take the two roles in the Bartók, and the mezzo Katarina Karneus stars in the Schoenberg. WILLIAM ROBIN

Pop Music: A Newly Solo Brittany Howard in Manhattan
Sept. 24; ticketmaster.com .
As the vocal might behind the Southern soul-punk band Alabama Shakes, the singer-songwriter Brittany Howard found herself experiencing creative listlessness following the group's most recent tour. Last year, after exploring a range of side projects, she bit the bullet and broke the news to her band: She was venturing out on her own.
Howard's first solo album was released Friday. Titled "Jaime," after her older sister who died at 13, it contains songs that -- with topics ranging from faith to childhood trauma -- felt too personal to burden bandmates with. It's also more sonically adventurous than her work with Alabama Shakes. "For me this record is like, what do I want to listen to? What do I want to hear?" she told The Times this month. "That's the whole point." On Tuesday, she will appear at Beacon Theater in Manhattan as part of a North American tour, with stops in Boston, Los Angeles and Seattle. OLIVIA HORN
Theater: A Tribute to Marin Mazzie
Sept. 22, 54below.com .
There's going on with the show, and then there's going on with the show as your body fills with so much fluid that it makes your leg "numb and burn." That's how the musical theater star Marin Mazzie remembered performing after a diagnosis of ovarian cancer in 2015. She opened that night in the Encores! production of "Zorba!"
"I knew that when I went onstage, I would feel all right," she said later that year, post-chemotherapy. "The adrenaline is so amazing, what it does and how it masks pain."
No wonder, then, that she barely took a break before returning to the concert stage, and then to Broadway in "The King and I" in 2016. She was 57 when she died a year ago.
Her husband, the actor Jason Danieley, is marking the anniversary with a tribute at Feinstein's/54 Below in Manhattan. With performers slated to include Liz Callaway, Victor Garber, Donna Murphy, Debra Monk and David Hyde Pierce, it's a benefit for the nonprofit Cancer Support Community. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

Texto completo: Anyone expecting an apology or remorse from comedian Louis C.K. regarding his widely reported sexual misconduct -- first in the New York Times in November 2017 -- will have to keep looking. In his late set Thursday night at Zanies in Rosemont -- the second of six shows over three days that quickly sold out earlier this week -- he seemed to be working to reframe himself as the victim.
At times during his show, he almost reveled in the shame, claiming everyone in the audience has a "thing" that they do sexually that would be embarrassing if anyone found out. His own culpability in the reports of him masturbating in front of women went unmentioned. Instead he put the focus squarely on how he has been affected by the fallout; he used to play arenas, he noted at one point with a cynical laugh, reminding the audience how lucky they were to see him in such an intimate space.
But he doesn't want anyone quoting him on that. On top of the use of a Yondr case to keep everyone's phones locked up throughout the course of the show -- which is something a number of comics have begun doing -- this show came with an additional disclaimer: "Recording of any kind, including note taking, is not permitting (sic) in the show room. You will be asked to leave." I tested the waters during one of the opening acts by using a pencil to write down the comic's name -- Mike Earley, by the way -- and someone quickly approached me, pointed and said, "There's no writing during the show."
Mixed in with some jokes that seem vulgar just for vulgarity's sake, he had plenty of what could be considered "classic" Louis C.K. material -- stuff that pushes past what's generally acceptable to joke about.
But can Louis C.K. on an unpublicized, downright furtive tour of the country work with the same level of nuanced material as the theater-packing comedian of pre-2017? And, more importantly, does he have an audience that wants him to? Many in the audience Thursday seemed happy to clap any time he said something off-color.
He lost his train of thought at one point, wondering out loud what he had been trying to get at, when an audience member yelled, "Baby rape!" (This was, in fact, a technically accurate response in regards to what C.K. had been talking about.) But for a moment C.K. seemed to be faced with the awkward fervor of someone clearly too ecstatic about the surface-level horror of his subject matter and -- if only for a blink -- he seemed completely turned off by it. But then he took a drink from his cup. And pushed on.

Texto completo: Want to do something about climate change by reducing carbon emissions? If you're serious, that "something" has to include a massive commitment to the construction of new nuclear power plants worldwide, as well as making sure that existing nuclear power plants don't go offline until they can be replaced by new ones.
Nuclear power is the only major, established, proven source of power that has zero carbon emissions. Of the carbon-free alternatives, only hydroelectric has a long track record as a major power source, and you can only dam so many rivers; solar and wind are still in the teething stages and are unlikely to carry the load any time soon.
Nuclear power is reliable, safe and well understood. If you oppose nuclear power but call climate change a crisis, then you're speaking nonsense.
Most, but not all, of the Democratic candidates for president are vague on the subject, silent or opposed to nuclear power. But not all. Cory Booker has been a "full-throated" supporter of nuclear power, and nuclear power gets a big boost from Andrew Yang's 2020 climate change plan.
According to Yang's plan, "Nuclear power is a crucial component in the move toward creating sustainable, carbon-free energy for the United States. However, many people — including some other candidates — dismiss it out of hand. Why does it have such a bad reputation? ... First, the public's perception of its safety has been skewed by TV shows like Chernobyl and The Simpsons.
"When the OECD (11), NEA (11), and NASA (12) analyzed the actual danger of nuclear energy compared to other sources, they found that it caused orders of magnitude fewer deaths than fossil fuel-based energy. And that's not even considering the long-term impact of climate change from burning fossil fuels. With modern reactors, safety is drastically increased, and nuclear waste is drastically decreased."
That's exactly right. Yang is particularly interested in reactors powered by thorium instead of uranium, because thorium is more efficient, and more plentiful, and because thorium reactors can't produce materials suitable for use in nuclear weapons. Plus: "Thorium reactors produce less waste than uranium reactors. Thorium waste remains radioactive for several hundred years instead of several thousand years. Thorium-based molten salt reactors are safer than earlier-generation nuclear reactors, and the potential for a catastrophic event is negligible, due to the design of the reactor and the fact that thorium is not, by itself, fissile."
Yang is right to make these points, and he's gotten some well-deserved attention. If you take climate change seriously, you have to take nuclear power seriously. As Mike Shellenberger writes in Forbes, if Germany and California had based their emissions plans on nuclear instead of "renewables" like solar and wind, they'd have 100% clean power now.
But they didn't, and they don't. The International Energy Agency reports that planned nuclear retirements will already lead to 4 billion metric tons of extra carbon dioxide emissions. If it makes sense to keep functioning reactors online longer rather than replacing them with fossil fuels, then surely it makes sense to replace existing fossil fuel plants with new nuclear reactors.
There's something of a renaissance going on in nuclear technology, with small "inherently safe" reactors being put forward to fill gaps in supply. These reactors could be mass-produced on assembly lines for much lower costs (current reactors are custom-built on site) and because of their small size could more easily be placed where needed.
Sure, people are scared and invoke things such as Chernobyl or Three Mile Island, but when they do, they're mostly thinking about the absurdly dramatized fictional versions of those incidents. Yang's plan specifically recognizes that, noting that nuclear power causes orders of magnitudes fewer deaths than fossil fuels.
And the change could be done quickly. As Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist and Steven Pinker note in The New York Times, France and Sweden "decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world's most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power's intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power."
Andrew Yang's right. So why wait?
It's time for our leaders to get their heads out of thriller movies and start supporting a massive shift to nuclear power. Because it's a crisis, and in a crisis, you do things you haven't done before.

Texto completo: Several years ago I read a letter in the New York Times from a minister I knew in my former denomination. Her letter was in response to a piece by secular writer Susan Jacoby who was reflecting on suffering, grief, death and hope. This clergy colleague penned some good reflections yet I felt a little balance was in order, so I wrote her a note.
Jacoby's article addressed the fact that many people in our culture and communities do not turn to faith in times of tragedy. Hurting, grieving people are frequently offered little more than "divine presence" and heavenly hope. Jacoby was investigating the question whether there is an equally good alternative response to suffering and death other than faith. I explained that I thought this was a valuable point – that these are not merely faith issues, but human issues. I agreed with Jacoby's assertion that a non-theistic perspective can and does provide another meaningful, positive choice.
I agreed with the pastor's comment that some atheists have blindspots when it comes to religious believers and their experience. I suggested we could learn more from each other and wider religious knowledge is sorely lacking in the church as well.
Concerning her statement that most atheists she has spoken with have rejected religion because of a childhood tragedy, I ventured to guess her conversations with non-believers were limited. I suggested she speak with more representatives of unbelievers since, as I see and hear it, many of us choose to leave faith for a variety of very adult and very rational reasons.
In her NYT letter the pastor explained that when she discussed faith with atheists she asked, "Tell me more about the God you don't believe in." This is a common approach taken by more liberal clergy who are waiting at the ready to respond, "Ah-ha, I don't believe in that God either!" I told the pastor that not believing in any notion of the supernatural or a divine being beyond the natural world describes the secular viewpoint, at least mine. It's not about rejecting a "bearded guy in the sky," a "god of judgment" or creeds and bibles. Those might be factors in choosing not to believe, but not the foundational reasons for atheism.
Turning the question around, I might ask the pastor to "Tell me about the God you do believe in." If she says "Love," "Grace" or "Justice," I would smile and say, those are qualities or actions that don't require a God, so why choose God and why just one God from one religion?
At one point in her letter the pastor states that atheism is not rooted in empathy and is "nothing more" than a lack of belief. That seemed off base to me. My pushback was that this "reflects some prejudice and begs more experience." I pointed to my years of service among people often excluded from or judged by religious communities. Empathy came naturally to me. I was a Christian minister during much of that time, but my interfaith work helped me evolve my views in a more secular way, until faith became unnecessary – I wasn't against faith, I just didn't need it any longer.
When the pastor questioned Jacoby's view that faith includes some belief in the afterlife, I said that is indeed true for most religions. Though some in the "progressive" religious community dismiss a definitive view of the afterlife (or even an anthropomorphic – human-like – god), that circles back to the question non-religious people ask: Then why have faith at all?
I appreciated the pastor's assertion that her congregation is "welcoming" to atheists. She told me there are self-identified atheists who attend church. My comment to her was that I wonder how fully welcome these folks feel in her church. Do they feel the freedom to speak up about why they don't believe and how they can be just as good and ethical as baptized members?
This led to some final questions I had for the pastor. I wondered aloud, "What if ethical people with or without faith could put theological issues aside long enough to collaborate and cooperate to create something that could truly be called 'community'?" Since the pastor said she was "dedicated to working for a world of justice and peace for all people," I happily suggested the church could acknowledge the fact that this dedication is not limited to her church or faith itself.
Lastly, I thanked her for her letter and offered to share some time on a Sunday morning to have a dialogue with her and the congregation about these issues that were stirred up by her provocative letter.
Unfortunately, she didn't take me up on that. I wonder who would?

Researchers on Abortion Find Blind Spot in Data

Texto completo: Evidence suggests more American women are "self-managing" their abortions.
The number of abortions performed in American clinics was lower in 2017 than in any year since abortion became legal nationwide in 1973, new data showed this week. But that does not count a growing number of women who are managing their abortions themselves, without going to a medical office -- often by buying pills illicitly.
These "invisible" abortions are hard to measure, so it's unclear how much higher the true abortion rate is. But researchers say self-managed abortions have risen as abortion has become more restricted in certain states, and as more people have learned that effective pills can be ordered online or purchased across the border.
"This is happening," said Jill E. Adams, executive director of If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice, which provides legal assistance to women seeking abortions. "This is an irreversible part of abortion care here in the United States."
The black market for abortion pills has changed the landscape for those lacking easy access to an abortion clinic or preferring to have an abortion in private. The pills are harder to regulate than in-clinic abortions; they can be easily hidden and shipped, and women can take them at home and appear to have had a spontaneous miscarriage.
"When you say a self-managed abortion, people think about a coat hanger or a back-alley abortion," said Abigail R. A. Aiken of the University of Texas at Austin, who has studied the safety of self-managed abortions and the reasons women choose them. "The reality is we're sitting here in 2019, and it's not like that anymore. You can go online, and you can fill out a form, and you can get this safe and effective technology delivered to your home."
Some anti-abortion groups expressed alarm. "The industry's migration to chemical self-abortion is deeply disturbing as it carries with it the possibility of increasing the overall abortion rate over time," Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, said in a statement this week.
Experts disagree somewhat about how many such abortions are occurring in the United States. Some estimated a few thousand a year; others said tens of thousands. Because they are underground, it's hard to measure them precisely. Those numbers compare with around 862,000 in-clinic abortions in the new yearly count published this week by the Guttmacher Institute, which collects the most detailed statistics about abortion in this country, and supports abortion rights.
"I have no doubt that it will become more common if access becomes more constrained," said Daniel Grossman, a physician and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied self-managed abortion overseas and in the United States.
The current abortion pill regimen, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000, involves two medications. The first, mifepristone, blocks pregnancy-enabling hormones. The second, misoprostol, causes uterine contractions. Between 2014 and 2017, there was a 25 percent increase in the share of in-clinic abortions by medication instead of by surgery, found the Guttmacher report. They were 39 percent of abortions in 2017.
Mifepristone is tightly monitored in the United States, and is usually administered in a clinic by a certified doctor. But misoprostol, originally developed as an ulcer drug, can be easier to obtain. It is sold over the counter in many countries, including Mexico.
When both pills are used for pregnancies of up to 10 weeks, the pills are 98 percent effective. When misoprostol is taken alone, it is around 80 percent effective. Dr. Aiken's research on self-managed abortions in Ireland found that widespread use of mail-order pills was as safe and effective as the use of pills administered in a doctor's office. A small percentage of women developed bleeding or infections that required follow-up medical care.
Aid Access, a service started by a Dutch doctor, offers online counseling with a doctor along with mail-order abortion pills; it entered the United States last year. Other websites also ship the pills to the United States. A study last year in the journal Contraception and (separately) a New York Times columnist tested pills from online vendors and found that the drugs were real.
The people least likely to have easy, affordable access to an abortion clinic tend to be poor and to live in states that have restricted abortion. For them, traveling to the nearest clinic can seem insurmountable.
But there's evidence that even some people with easy access to a clinic are buying and taking pills on their own, for reasons like privacy or cost. Aid Access requests a $ 90 donation for the pills and medical counseling. Other sites charge around $ 200 for the medications. A typical clinic-based medication abortion costs around $ 500, according to Guttmacher, and is only sometimes covered by health insurance.
Awareness of the option appears to be spreading, as women share their experiences on Reddit and other online forums. Proponents have started sites explaining how to get the pills -- and the medical and legal issues involved.
The new Guttmacher report found that in-clinic abortions declined by 7 percent between 2014 and 2017, and cited increased use of contraception as a major reason. Rachel Jones, a physician and the lead Guttmacher researcher on this week's report, said she thought self-managed abortions were still fairly marginal, but the report mentioned them as a factor for the first time. Other experts said they might be common enough to erase some of the recent measured reduction.
In a 2017 editorial in the American Journal of Public Health, Diana Greene Foster, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said the leading explanations for the drop in abortions -- better contraception, less sexual activity among young people, and legal restrictions -- didn't suffice. Women using the most effective forms of contraception, she noted, seemed to come from different demographic subgroups than the groups with the biggest abortion declines.
"The total number of abortions may not be decreasing if women are looking outside the medical system to terminate their pregnancies," she wrote.
Researchers have tried various ways to measure the practice. They've surveyed women about their experiences with self-managed abortions. They've counted the sales of abortion pills from Aid Access. And some have looked at related questions, like the frequency of abortion-related web searches.
Survey research found that around 1 percent of women at abortion clinics had tried to end a pregnancy with misoprostol. A broader survey of Texas women found that between 2 percent and 4 percent had attempted to perform an abortion on themselves, though sometimes with other, less effective methods.
Aid Access reported 21,000 requests for medications for self-induced abortions last year, in its first year in the country. Other vendors don't report sales figures. Plan C, which provides information about self-managed medication abortions, reports about 40,000 online visitors a month.
There is also suggestive evidence from Texas, where a law (since overturned) temporarily imposed strict abortion restrictions. In-clinic abortion rates declined statewide, but fell more sharply close to the Mexican border. It's an indication, researchers said, that people were probably buying pills in Mexico or ones brought across the border instead of driving hundreds of miles to a clinic.

Texto completo: The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book — "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times’ staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times’ piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book — and, according to friends, doesn’t remember any such incident.
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times’ writers, who said that the details had been in the excerpt’s initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors and apparently told friends that she doesn’t recall any such incident amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Washington Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren’t identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors’ only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times’ writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let’s rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn’t quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told The New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by is alleged victims who also were drinking at the time and comments from former classmates, who may also have been inebriated, some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times’ writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez’s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez’s mother, to whom she apparently said "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez’s story was first reported by The New Yorker just days before Ford’s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser, not only doesn’t remember the party — but says she’s never even met Kavanaugh.
What’s all too clear is that America’s privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s; and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism.

Texto completo: HARTFORD -- Wayne Bruce Pannell, 88, of Hartford, passed peacefully on Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019, surrounded by his family.
Wayne was retired from the Kentucky Department of Agriculture where he was an inspector for the Environmental Protection Agency outreach, after leaving a 40-plus-year farming career. He was born to parents Jackson Walker Pannell and Carrie Aster Hill Pannell on July 14, 1931. Wayne attended Calhoun consolidated high school and served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean Conflict. After receiving an honorable discharge, he enrolled in the educational program offered through the G.I. Bill of Rights, earning a degree in agribusiness.
Other than family, Wayne was most proud of his professional accomplishments in the advancement of agriculture in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Pannell's foresight and innovation were used to improve Kentucky agricultural row crop productivity. He introduced the first no-till row crop farming in Daviess County, in partnership with the University of Kentucky Experimental Research Project. An avid soil conservationist, Pannell was recognized by columnist Tom Wicker in the New York Times, Farm Journal magazine, Progressive Farmer, Louisville Courier-Journal and the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer. Mr. Pannell was also recognized by The Kentucky Hereford Journal for his championship string of Polled Hereford cattle.
During his agricultural career, he worked as a manager for C.E. Field Farms. Pannell was named honorary commissioner of agriculture under five gubernatorial administrations. He was also a charter member of the Kentucky Corn Growers Association, member of the Soybean Association, Kentucky Cattleman's Association, council member of the Daviess County UK Extension Service, 4-H and Owensboro Chamber of Commerce. Pannell served two terms as Daviess Co. Farm Bureau president where he founded the Annual Farm City Breakfast under the auspices of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Federation.
As an advocate of higher education, Mr. Pannell annually donated the proceeds of the first truckload of shelled corn to Brescia University Scholarship Fund.
Wayne is survived by his loving spouse and devoted caregiver, Betty Capps Pannell; daughters Susan Pannell (spouse David Wilson), Karen Pannell and Lisa Manley (Steven); grandchildren Kendall Jarboe, Levi Manley and Abigail Manley; and great-grandson Kingston Hinton. He is also survived by his brother, Glenn Pannell (Sandra) of Central City.
A celebration of life service will be 2 p.m. Saturday at Glenn Funeral Home and Crematory with visitation from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Mr. Pannell requested that any expressions of sympathy be made in the form of a donation to Sunrise Children's Services, P.O. Box 1429, Mt. Washington, KY 40047 or by giving online at sunrise.org/donate.
Memories and condolences may be left for the family by visiting www.glenncares.com.

Texto completo: Remember the dunking-kid meme from a couple of years ago? Little kid runs up to his tiny basketball hoop, dunks the ball, turns around to flex and holler. Meanwhile he doesn't see that the whole backboard is wobbling and about to collapse on his head. When it does, he looks confused.
Congrats, New York Times! And Politico. And CNN. You're all the Dunking Kids. You keep throwing down on the Trump administration. The backboard of truth keeps falling on your head. The rest of us laugh.
The New York Times just issued its most spectacular correction since my personal favorite, from Nov. 7, 2012: "An earlier version of this article misspelled the singer's surname in a number of places. He is Bruce Springsteen, not Springstein."
This past Sunday's correction cut the legs out from under its big Saturday scoop about a supposed new sex scandal about Brett Kavanaugh involving a woman who supposedly had Justice Kavanaugh's penis shoved into her hand when they were both at Yale. The Times' gobsmacking correction noted that in the book from which its Saturday report was derived, "the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article."
Backboard of truth meets skull.
This capped off a week in which The Times had to delete a tweet praising Mao Zedong, one of history's greatest mass murderers, as "one of history's great revolutionary figures" and another tweet saying that what happened on Sept. 11, 2001, was that "airplanes took aim and brought down the World Trade Center." Times editors doubtless thought that mentioning radical Islamists were the ones who aimed those airplanes would play into Donald Trump's hands.
Meanwhile, Politico was sticking with a bonkers attempt to make a scandal out of Air Force members paying a cheap $130 a night to stay at a Trump resort in Scotland called Turnberry while they were refueling their planes at a nearby airport Mr. Trump does not own or profit from.
Politico solemnly reported that "up to 6%" of Air Force members had stayed at the Trump property while refueling at the airport. So the resort is affordable, service members have been staying there since the Obama years and at least 94% of those staying in the area stay at some other hotel. Politico tried to frame this as a violation of the Emoluments Clause that forbids presidents from cashing in on their position while in office. That doesn't pass the laugh test.
Meanwhile, MSNBC gave airtime to Jason Johnson, a journalism professor from Morgan State, who made the following vicious, defamatory and utterly bonkers statement about Justice Kavanaugh: "I've never heard of a guy who is a one-time rapist. I've never heard of a one-time sexual assaulter. I grew up with guys like this. He's from around this area, right? He is the fifth guy in a gang rape. He's the guy who comes in after he is drunk because everybody else encourages him and he can get away with it. He's been pretty much covered his entire life. And now he's on the Supreme Court."
Just a few days earlier, CNN issued a report on the circumstances around an American spy being taken out of Russia that was so wrong, The Times felt moved to contradict it: The decision to extract the spy was made while Barack Obama was president, The Times reported, yet CNN blamed Mr. Trump for endangering the agent and forcing his extraction.
This isn't just a story of media bias. It's a story of utter unbe-frickin'-lievable obliviousness by the media. CNN doesn't bother putting a fig leaf on anything anymore: A glance at CNN's homepage on any given day is like looking at an assortment of Democratic Party press releases.
Any news that might be happening that can't be weaponized against Mr. Trump is of little interest. Any news that might make Mr. Trump or anyone on the right look bad is eagerly pushed through, ordinary standards of fairness and checking be damned.
The media think Mr. Trump's sometimes overblown attacks on them are making it more vital than ever. But what's really happening is that the media is beclowning itself trying to end Mr. Trump. One recent survey found 95% of Americans saying they were troubled by the current state of the media, and two-thirds think journalistic ethics will get worse during the election season. Ow, media. Backboard, head.

Lessons of a first-time director

Texto completo: Being vulnerable for the sake of authenticity is the driving force pushing slam poets forward in first-time director Max Powers' documentary "Don't Be Nice." Powers uses the verité style of filmmaking - a documentary technique that allows the subject to be captured in an honest way so audiences feel they're observing a truthful depiction - to capture a troop of five poets of color (Timothy DuWhite, Noel Quiñones, Joel Francois, Ashley August and Sean "Mega" DesVignes) from the Bowery Slam Poetry team as they prepare for nationals.
To dismantle the performative criteria that slam is known for, coach Lauren Whitehead encourages the poets to dig deep into their discomfort, emphasizing that using their vulnerability is a powerful use of freedom of expression. The urgency behind the troop's triumph, both individually and as a whole, is captured during the summer of 2016 when there's a swell of media coverage around police brutality affecting black and brown lives. The film uses the backdrop of racial tensions and the Black Lives Matter movement as it follows this particular troop.
amNewYork spoke with Powers about his first film, opening at the IFC Center on Friday.
Editors Note: The following has been edited and condensed from two interviews.
There are these little hidden communities of artists in New York but a lot of it has gone digital. The film really focuses on that small tight-knit community in New York. It's easy to forget that these spaces really do exist.
Especially with how the communities in New York are changing so rapidly. Especially with everything going on in digital like you said. No matter how many Whole Foods and John Varvatos stores pop up on the Bowery, there's still these pockets of culture that continue to persist even through the change. I hope that people [who] watch the film will seek [slam poetry venues] out.
What do you think it is about New York that lends itself to this art form?
I think that it's a unique art form for many reasons. One of the reasons is because it is scored and has a competitive element. I think it lends itself to a really dense urban environment because you can really have that sense of competition, which for this art form really just fosters and facilitates an intense creativity. I think that once something is scored it definitely kind of turns up the heat and puts on the pressure to really make that work.
You covered a time that many see this as the height of Black Lives Matter movement. Was that a conscious decision on your part?
One of the special and difficult things about making a verité film is you really don't know what's going to happen. You're filming a lot of discussions and a lot of open-ended interviews, and we didn't go into it saying, for the first third of the movie, we're gonna talk about the political dynamics in the Black Lives Matter movement. Then in the edit it was about seeing what the patterns were. What were the interesting conversations? And where the poets and the coaches were taking the work themselves. The events during that summer did coincide with the poetry that the poets were writing, but there wasn't a preconceived direction ... it just kind of happened in front of us.
We're seeing these artists at a very specific time in their lives through a season of violence that was documented by the media in a new way. By using this art form to speak to the violence of that summer, did it give you a new perspective of that time?
I think it did. I think the violence of that summer did give me a unique perspective, but ... I think those events and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement seem to define that summer in a lot of people's heads. The thing is that those events have always been happening and are continuing to happen. A lot of the poets' work and the themes that were being discussed around police violence - those weren't new to that summer. They just happened to be heightened in the cultural consciousness. I think that's why the film is so important now because people can watch it and remember that they were paying attention to these events that summer, even though these events continue to happen.
The film opens up a conversation about the importance of personalizing art and how it's a careful balance of being vulnerable versus exploitative. There was a moment when Tim, one of the artists, opens up about being sexually assaulted and how by participating in the poem "The Purge" it re-traumatized him in a way he wasn't ready for. What were you thinking after that moment?
We had been with the team filming for a really long time at that point. When you're filming with a group of people for many months, you kind of feel part of the same group. If anyone ever during the process told us to turn off the camera, then we'd turn off the camera. When Tim was going through that emotional moment he was aware that we were filming. So, after that happened, half of me was like, wow, that was a really emotional moment that we captured on camera. I was also saying to myself, [expletive] this is really hard for Tim and I really hope that he's going to be OK. Following people for a really long time you do have a bit of a split consciousness between wanting to do your best for the film and paying attention to that and also being close to your subjects and to the team. It's a complicated feeling after a scene like that.
How did you balance that line yourself between documenting vulnerability to service the film without allowing exploitation to happen?
I think that you just have to kind of go with your gut in the moment and feel out if something is becoming too much. There were points in this film where the cinematographer and I would look at each other from across the room and silently communicate that we're gonna take a little break. You just kind of feel that moment to moment and hope that you get that right. You can push people to a point where they really don't want to be filmed anymore. And we didn't have much of that on this film.
A New York Times article last year detailed issues the poets in the documentary had with the film. What was your reaction when you found out the poets felt exploited?
I was disappointed. It's tough to pour your heart and soul into a film and have someone who has a different opinion about a part of that film. I don't want to speak for the poets in any way, but of course I was disappointed. One of the things that we did with this film that I'm very proud of is, most documentaries, follow one, two, three subjects and in this documentary, we really wanted to make it an ensemble piece. I wanted to make sure that we highlighted each poet and their work. When you do that and you are now up to five, six, seven subjects, including the coaches, you've gotta make some really hard decisions. As with any documentary, everyone's gonna have a point of view about things that they may feel should have been done better or differently. [Having said that], I really stand behind the film.
Given that this is your first film, what do you think you've learned from the experience of post production, all the way through to the poets' reaction to the film?
I think I've learned that all the decisions that go into making a documentary are difficult. I think that you do your absolute best to scrutinize your decisions and make the best film that you possibly can. I guess I'd say I'm still learning. I think that as the first film, I really stand behind it and feel that the entire team from beginning with the poets and their incredible work to our producing team, to our editors and our cinematographer, we all did the best job that we possibly could have. I think ... [long pause] I guess I would say that you always have to keep trying to make the best film that you possibly can and that's what I'm going to do with the next one.

Texto completo: We were delighted to have arrive at our doorstep a zippy new book, literally hot off the press: Jason Wilson's "The Cider Revival: Dispatches from the Orchard."
An engaging read with many good things to say about our beautiful Finger Lakes region, it's a romp through the recent rise of "hard" cider — the smart, hardworking people who graft and grow the classical European cider apple varieties, the dedicated cider makers who seek out "feral" varieties and crab apples in hedgerows and abandoned orchards, the tension between large commercial producers and artisan producers, the drama in the wings: it's all there.
Wilson, who also writes for The Washington Post, New York Times and The New Yorker, tells the story of cider, nearly as old as this country itself. But what grabbed my attention was not only the breadth of his research, but also Wilson's concentration on ciders produced "on the isthmus between Seneca and Cayuga Lakes in New York," where he interviews and tastes along with the apple cullers and producers of the area's fine ciders, among them Redbyrd, Bellwether, Black Diamond, Kite & String (Finger Lakes Cider House), Blackduck, and a little to the south, Eve's Cidery and South Hill Cider, the latter about to open a handsome new cider house near Buttermilk Falls.
Meanwhile, I plan to relax with the book and a glass of cider. Cheers!

Texto completo: New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán has been placed on administrative leave due to the MLB's domestic violence policy, the league announced Thursday.
MLB announced that it will undergo an investigation into Germán, but did not specifically say what his alleged actions are. The specifics of the incident were not announced as the league investigates the situation.
Bob Klapisch of the New York Times reported Thursday afternoon on social media that the incident with Germán involved his girlfriend and occurred between late Monday night and Tuesday morning.
The Yankees released a statement on Thursday in response to MLB's decision.
"We fully support all measures being undertaken by the commissioner's office pursuant to the policy of domestic violence. We support this policy which reinforces that domestic violence has no place in our society and cannot be tolerated. We have followed the lead of Major League Baseball and will continue to provide our complete cooperation throughout the investigative process. We reserve any further comment until the investigation reaches its conclusion. All questions pertaining to this matter should be directed to the office of the commissioner."
Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters Thursday afternoon that he learned of Germán's placement on the ride to Yankee Stadium.
"I heard some of the whispers and what not, but this is a Major League Baseball investigation and issue, so we are just trying to be as cooperative as we can while this goes on," Boone said.
It remains a mystery as to whether the Yankees were aware of a pending move by the league regarding Germán. The 27-year-old appeared in Wednesday's 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, tossing 21/3 scoreless innings in relief. Germán is 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 143 innings this season.
"It was vague to me," Boone said about hearing of the incident. Boone said he was not sure he knew if Germán was aware before pitching on Wednesday.
According to Boone, players were not informed of the move by the league before it was announced to the public. When Boone was asked if he knew anything before Wednesday's game, the manager said he could not comment further on an active league investigation.
"It's a Major League issue and we are kind of in a stand down mode," Boone said.
Boone and general manager Brian Cashman will address the team before Thursday night's game regarding the incident.
"I haven't thought of exactly what I'll say," Boone said. "Obviously, this is fresh. I'll get up there and talk as a group and as a family and speak from the heart."
With the move to place Germán on administrative leave, the Yankees brought up right-handed pitcher Michael King to the active roster. Under the administrative leave, Germán cannot have contact with the team while the matter is being investigated.

Will the Big Four networks become invisible?

Texto completo: Let's check the calendar one more time.
Is this really the second half of September? Then shouldn't we be a-buzz about the new shows on the big broadcast networks – ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox?
That used to be the case, you know. One fall, NBC had banners throughout Kmart stores ... Another, ABC had "Desperate Housewives" ads on dry-cleaner hangers. Grids kept showing us what the day-by-day line-ups would be in the season ahead.
And now? Kmarts are closing, a desperate housewife is going to jail and even TV Guide didn't print a grid.
On Sunday (Sept. 22), the Emmys will ignore the big-four networks; NBC has two series nominations ("This Is Us" and "The Good Place"), the others have none. The next day, their new season starts.
The New York Times reluctantly listed all the new shows, but focused on streaming and cable ones. It added: "There are all the broadcast-network debuts, many of which won't be spoken of again."
Is that true? Will the big four become invisible and unspoken-of? Fielding questions from the Television Critics Association last month, their programming chiefs begged to differ,
Karey Burke of ABC pointed to a Nielsen list of the regular season's 50 most-watched shows. "All but six" were on broadcast, she said. "That surprised even me."
And that's in the 18-49 age category, where cable thrives. If you simply take total viewers, broadcast has all but three of the top 50. The only exceptions are HBO's "Game of Thrones" (No. 4), ESPN's Monday football (No. 13) and AMC's "Walking Dead" (No. 44).
Burke points to quantity: "At ABC, we reach nearly 150 million people (at least once) every month."
CBS' Kelly Kahl tops that. "We love reaching a huge audience, 240 million people this past season."
He gets there by using a full season (rather than a month) and by being No. 1 overall. That Nielsen list (which includes seven-day delayed viewing via DVR or on-demand) puts his "Big Bang" and "NCIS" at 17.4 and 15.9 million, trailing only Sunday football; only five cable shows top 4.5 million.
That doesn't mean all is well for networks. Situation comedies are usually their strength; last year, only eight were in the top 50 – including "Big Bang" (now gone) and three CBS shows that followed it.
Now even one of the successful sitcoms (Fox's "Last Man Standing") is temporarily on the shelf. Fox is starting the season without a single live-action (non-cartoon) sitcom.
Fox's Charlie Collier claims it's "an embarrassment of riches"; others might see it as a desperate attempt to stop viewers from time-shifting. They're most likely to delay scripted shows ... so in the fall, Fox will be unscripted for half of each week – pro football on Thursday nights and Sunday afternoons, wrestling on Friday nights, college football Saturday afternoons and nights.
Then there's half of Wednesdays with "The Masked Singer." Its success, Collier said, "is influencing the types of unscripted shows that we're pursuing – bold and brash, risk-taking and fun."
That reflects the early years, when Fox was the outsider taking chances. Collier points to the upcoming "Moody Christmas," six comedy half-hours about a chaotic family. "We're going to show you Christmas ... in a very different way that feels very Fox."
At ABC, Burke agrees that special events are important. She has a family one in November – "Little Mermaid," juggling the movie animation and singers working live. Serious mini-series are coming, including one with "the history of the civil rights movement through the eyes of its heroic women."
NBC has mainly scored with football or reality. Now it hopes to recapture its old Thursday comedy domain. It has the final "Good Place" year, plus the promising "Perfect Harmony" and "Sunnyside."
Yes, there are promising shows on the big four. That includes some more comedies – ABC's "Mixed-ish," CBS' "Bob (hearts) Abishola" – and several dramas, including ABC'S "Stumptown," "CBS' "All Rise" and Fox's "Almost Family." Stay tuned,
"This Is Us" is among the few network series nominated for Emmys this year.

Sackler site here has lawyer fuming

Texto completo: An attorney who represents Palm Beach County in its lawsuit against OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma said it was “outrageous” that the family that owns the company has set up shop in West Palm Beach to manage the family fortune.
The Palm Beach Post reported on Tuesday that the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, paid $6.8 million for the Glidden Spina Architecture building at 207 Sixth St., just across the Intracoastal Waterway from Palm Beach.
The building now is home to Summer Road LLC, an entity that manages the Sacklers’ fortune. David Sackler, grandson of a family member who helped found Purdue Pharma, is chief executive of Summer Road, according to state records.
The building was bought by a Sackler entity on July 31, less than two months before Purdue Pharma filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15.
The building purchase was surprising to Hunter Shkolnik, an expert in class- and mass-action litigation. Shkolnik represents Palm Beach County, one of many municipalities across the country that have sued the company for its role in the opioid crisis.
Palm Beach and Broward counties were the epicenter of the prescription pill mills that led to people getting hooked on the addictive painkiller OxyContin, Shkolnik said.
“I find it outrageous that in a county that has been devastated by their actions, they’re now setting up their financial empire. It’s rubbing salt in the wounds. How do you do that?” Shkolnik said. “Thousands of people have been seriously injured or are dead by their products.”
Shkolnik said Palm Beach County’s lawsuit continues in federal court as part of a larger lawsuit involving many other municipalities.
The 2018 complaint laid out Palm Beach County’s argument in a straightforward way. “This case is about one thing: corporate greed,” the complaint alleges. “Defendants put their desire for profits above the health and well-being of Palm Beach County consumers at the cost of plaintiff.”
But the litigation’s path forward is unclear now that Purdue Pharma has filed for Chapter 11 protection in a bid to settle lawsuits filed by multiple states.
The county’s claims “are in limbo right now” as parties wait to learn whether a judge will make all claimants abide by a settlement hammered out as part of the Chapter 11 filing — or whether claims against the company and the Sackler family can proceed, Shkolnik said.
The settlement will provide more than $10 billion to help reimburse state and local governments and clean up the damage done by prescription painkillers and illegal opioids. The Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue and contribute at least $3 billion toward the settlement.
Some states, including Florida, have signed on to the bankruptcy to resolve claims.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said Florida “is one of the states leading the negotiations ... Florida is working extremely hard to ensure Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers pay billions of dollars to account for their role in the opioid crisis.”
Purdue Pharma’s lawyers say they will ask a judge to issue an injunction to halt efforts by state attorneys general who won’t sign on to the settlement and instead want to pursue claims against the family.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, for instance, said she would oppose any effort to stop her claim against the family from going forward. She wants to hold the Sackler family personally accountable.
So do state attorneys general in New York, New Jersey and North Carolina. “Our office intends to pursue financial discovery from the Sacklers,” said a spokeswoman for North Carolina State Attorney General Josh Stein.
The Sackler family has said it is not to blame for the opioid crisis. In June, David Sackler told Vanity Fair that the family has had to endure “vitriolic hyperbole” and “endless castigation.”
Protests have erupted at a New York museum that received Sackler money, and the founder of the Inside Philanthropy website has called the family’s charitable giving “blood money.”
Earlier this year, David Sackler and his wife, Joss, who together have three children, apparently decided to get away from the negative attention and resettle in Palm Beach, according to a May article in the New York Post.
Rumors quickly began flying on Palm Beach about properties the family may have purchased, but no home yet has been linked to the Sacklers.
Instead, the low-rise West Palm Beach office building on Sixth Street, next door to the Butcher Shop Beer Garden and Grill, is the first known property purchased by the Sacklers in Palm Beach County.
The building, the former Hopkins Marine Supply store, is just west of Flagler Drive and the Intracoastal Waterway.
The Glidden Spina building was purchased by an entity called WP Leasing LLC, whose managers are Leslie Schreyer and Jeffrey Robins, two lawyers with the New York law firm of Norton Rose Fulbright. According to an August article in The New York Times, the lawyers received subpoenas from the New York state attorney general in connection with its effort to track down the Sackler family’s billions.
The purchase took the local real estate community by surprise because of the huge price paid for the 1950s-era building, which features a total of 11,288 square feet. Glidden Spina bought the former marine supply store building in $1.4 million in 2014, then spent $700,000 to design the interior.

MILPITAS TO RENAME STREET AFTER OBAMA

Resumen: Despite concerns from the mayor about the roadway connecting to a nearby landfill, the Milpitas City Council voted to change the name of a section of Dixon Landing Road to Barack Obama Boulevard. Tran, who was so inspired by the former president that he lifted passages from Obama's 2008 acceptance speech into his own inauguration address in 2016, thinks the name change could make the city the butt of jokes in national media. Tran raised a host of other issues he was concerned about with the name change including the cost, the potential impact to residents along the road, and the need to honor local figures first, such as the city's first black mayor, Ben Gross.

Texto completo: Milpitas will likely have the first street in Silicon Valley named after President Barack Obama, even if part of the road connects to a dump.
"This thing is going to make news," said Mayor Rich Tran, who opposed the road name change.
Despite concerns from the mayor about the roadway connecting to a nearby landfill, the Milpitas City Council voted to change the name of a section of Dixon Landing Road to Barack Obama Boulevard.
The western edge of Dixon Landing leads to the Newby Island Landfill, long believed by residents to be a major source of stench that wafts through the city regularly.
"It's going to say, Barack Obama Boulevard, in Silicon Valley's largest dump landfill,'" Tran said.
Tran, who was so inspired by the former president that he lifted passages from Obama's 2008 acceptance speech into his own inauguration address in 2016, thinks the name change could make the city the butt of jokes in national media.
"It's going to reach USA Today, it's going to reach New York Times, it's going to reach Fox News, and President Trump might tweet about it. I'm not ready to be the joke in America," he said.
Vice Mayor Karina Dominguez and Councilmen Anthony Phan and Bob Nuñez voted in favor of the change, saying the president's legacy will resonate in the city, and it will add cachet to the city, while Councilwoman Carmen Montano joined the mayor in voting against it.
"I think it's about what President Obama represents, and how his values, his virtues are reflected in Milpitas as it is today as a city and a community," Councilman Anthony Phan said.
Montano said she was in favor of "historical preservation," and keeping the road named after Matthew Dixon. Dixon came to the region for the gold rush, and in 1861 bought 600 acres of contiguous land in Santa Clara and Alameda counties for his farm, according to the Milpitas Historical Society.
"When I think of Obama I think of hope and change, and when it comes to Milpitas, I am very excited of all the opportunities that are coming to Milpitas and where it will be as a city in Silicon Valley moving forward," Phan said.
Phan and Nuñez, also said the Dixon Landing Road, a highly visible road which passes over Interstate 880, will serve as gateway to Silicon Valley, the city's slogan.
"I think that renaming it as President Obama, it supposed to frame Silicon Valley as an optimistic land of opportunities, if you will."
Tran raised a host of other issues he was concerned about with the name change including the cost, the potential impact to residents along the road, and the need to honor local figures first, such as the city's first black mayor, Ben Gross.
Gross was also integral to forming the working-class Sunnyhills neighborhood, one of the nation's first planned, integrated communities.
Dominguez said she has an interracial daughter, and said the change would be significant for her, and others like her.
"She's going to be able to see the first African American president name in her city, the city that she also grew up in," Dominguez said.
Nuñez said he'd like Milpitas "to be first" to make the change in Silicon Valley, if possible, as similar efforts stemming from as far back as 2017 in San Jose have yet to become a reality.
City staff indicated the road name may only be changed from the middle of the highway overcrossing, east to Milmont Drive, and leave the portion that leads to the dump as Dixon Landing, but that didn't seem to comfort the mayor.
"You're going to rename an exit off the freeway that leads to the largest landfill in Silicon Valley after one of our most honorable presidents and first president of color, Barack Obama?," Tran asked, just as the vote was about to take place.
Obama stayed at the Milpitas Sheraton on one of his visits to the region in 2016, where the cooks whipped him up one of his favorite snacks chips and guacamole.
It's unclear how much a name change could cost, or how long it would take to finalize. City staff will work up a report on the change and present it at a future meeting.

Texto completo: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy warned the media not to trust a news report that suggests President Trump made a troubling promise to a unnamed foreign leader in a call leaked by a whistleblower.
“I know the media always wants to rush when they think something is sensational,” California Rep. McCarthy said. “I think nine times out of ten we find a lot of that is not true.”
The Washington Post reported the whistleblower complaint, citing two former U.S. officials. The House Intelligence Committee, led by California Rep. Adam Schiff, is investigating the matter, which was referred to the inspector general of the intelligence community.
The whistleblower reportedly overheard Trump make a “promise” to a foreign leader.
McCarthy told reporters, “This is not something I have seen the president doing,” and warned that major media outlets have gotten stories wrong recently.
He pointed to the New York Times, which issued an update to a story that initially claimed to have proof of sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh dating back more than three decades.
“Instead of jumping to conclusions, I’d get the facts first,” McCarthy said.

MIT president to faculty: 'This moment of crisis must be the moment of reckoning'

Texto completo: MIT president L. Rafael Reif told the school's faculty Wednesday that he signed a 2012 letter thanking disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein for a donation to a professor because he did not recognize the name, while noting that he signs many standard thank-you notes every week, according to prepared remarks.
“That includes several hundred letters every year thanking individuals for contributions to the Institute," he said, according to the remarks.
While addressing faculty at a meeting Wednesday afternoon, Reif once again offered an apology.
“I understand that I have let you down and damaged your trust in me, and that our actions have injured both the Institute's reputation and the fabric of our community," Reif said, according to a copy of his remarks released by the university.
Past connections between MIT and Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide last month in a New York prison, has engulfed the school in recent weeks. Epstein pled guilty in 2008 to two charges of soliciting a prostitute, including one involving a minor, and by September of the next year, more than a dozen civil lawsuits had been filed by women who alleged they were molested by him when they were underage, according to The Miami Herald.
Joi Ito, who had served as the MIT Media Lab's director since 2011, resigned last week hours after an explosive new report from The New Yorker detailed close ties between the research center and Epstein.
Epstein secured major donations for the lab, including $5.5 million from investor Leon Black, founder of one of the world's largest private-equity firms, and $2 million from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, in addition to his own beneficence, according to The New Yorker report.
MIT had previously disclosed only $800,000 in contributions to the university over a 20-year span from foundations Epstein controlled. Earlier this month, Ito told attendees at a meeting to address the scandal that Epstein had contributed $525,000 to the Media Lab and $1.2 million to investment funds Ito controlled, according to The New Yorker and The New York Times.
At the MIT faculty meeting on Friday, Reif, the school's president, said a provost has been tasked with launching “an internal review of how we assess donor relationships and gift agreements, so we can correct the flaws in our process and practices."
He also mentioned the investigation of Goodwin Procter into MIT's ties to Epstein, saying the law firm “is fully engaged in its fact-finding now."
“It's now clear to me that the culture that made possible the mistakes around Jeffrey Epstein has prevailed for much too long at MIT," he said. “We need to stop looking away from bad behavior and start taking the time to see what it costs us as a community. This moment of crisis must be the moment of reckoning – and a turn towards real accountability."

Texto completo: Editor,
It was in April of this year that I was to look ahead to months of television misery. I had for some time been watching too much cable TV politics, and now the debates to determine the Democratic presidential nominee were about to begin ... with 24 candidates.
Even the most devoted political junkie should acknowledge the problem: If there is a lot of useful opinion, there may be just as much useless attitude - all to be repeated (recycled) again and again.
There was a solution to my problem. Most days I would purchase the two local newspapers (of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre) and one national. I started buying an additional national along with a helpful “scandal sheet,” the New York Daily News. Helpful in the sense it names everything; unhelpful in that it names everything. It also has a good sports section.
Most knowledgeable people will admit that The New York Times is the best newspaper in the world, albeit liberal. Others may prefer the conservative Wall Street Journal. I won’t buy it, but will accept a free copy.
The nation’s moderate newspaper is USA Today. There is usually not much to it, but primary political reporter, Susan Page, may be worth the price herself. She is thoughtful and wise, and never touches the extremes that practically every other commentator does.
What is the relative value of buying five newspapers? Each can be quickly perused (except for the most important items), and remember, time is money and there is now much more available. Thus, I can continue to take a glance at the television screen for highlights (or low lights).
The great reward is that once summer has begun, I can seize the opportunity to read the two most important new books of Trump Time: “American Carnage,” by Tim Alberta, a history from the end of Bush-Cheney through Barack Obama until now; and “The Immoral Majority,” by Ben Lowe, which is adequately described by the tagline, ‘Why Evangelicals Chose Political Power over Christian Values.’

New season, same old story: disrespect for women

Texto completo: This time of year, back-to-school time, used to evoke fresh notebooks and clean slates, unsharpened pencils and new beginnings.
These days, it brings reruns of the same old story and evokes a familiar dread.
It's the season of “Access Hollywood" and Harvey Weinstein, of Brett Kavanaugh-The-Trial and Brett Kavanaugh-Possible-Impeachment-Sequel. It's the season Antonio Brown surges onto the field as a New England Patriot just days after being accused of rape.
It's the season that has demonstrated, four years running, how little America thinks of women.
First, there was Donald Trump's pussy-grabbing, dismissed as locker room talk, and the dawning realization that the guy who bragged about getting away with it was going to get away with that, too. The following fall brought Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's horror show, teaching us an entire industry could be complicit in enabling a powerful man and crushing women, even the women we envy.
A year later, we got a chance to watch these lessons play out in real time. In the fall of 2018, when allegations of sexual misconduct emerged against Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh, our government institutions were paralyzed by the intrusion. Many people defaulted to the assumption that the men seeking power belong in it, because how scary is it if that power structure shifts? What then?
A Supreme Court appointment could be dashed over a mere accusation! We fretted over this for a couple of weeks until he was confirmed.
Now, Kavanaugh is back in the news because a new book by New York Times reporters revealed the FBI never chased down the individuals who might have corroborated claims of his bad behavior. The FBI was in a rush, after all, and hadn't he already been vetted? Wouldn't we have heard something before now if there was something to hear?
The latest stories show it hasn't gotten any easier for us to confront these challenges to power. The willingness to put one's head in the sand and accept the word of an entitled man to protect a brand is just as instinctive today as it was four years ago. Individuals and institutions alike are still willing to turn a blind eye if they're winning.
MIT was happy to accept millions from Epstein, a convicted pedophile, as long as no one found out about it. (News flash: We did.) The New England Patriots benefited from Brown's dazzling performance on Sunday, dodging pesky questions about a woman's claims that he had sexually assaulted her three times. (Addressing it would have been awkward, what with team owner Robert Kraft still mired in his own sex scandal in Florida.) So, carry on, ladies. Nothing to see here.
That is not to say that any one of these men is guilty (except Epstein, who was convicted and whose crimes continue to unspool in garish detail). It's wrong and counterproductive to convict any man on our worst assumptions. But haven't we learned yet how corrosive and diminishing it is to reflexively ignore women's voices, to assume the worst of them ?
The US Senate last year did not have to declare Kavanaugh guilty to conduct a full investigation before declaring him innocent. The Patriots do not need to declare Brown a rapist before saying they won't tolerate it if he is, and declaring the actions and language ascribed to him as abhorrent.
MIT did not need to own the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein; he was the sexual predator. It merely needed to admit that it took Epstein's money while hoping that no one would notice. Instead, it covered up the details, which dribbled out over time.
The New York Times bobbled the handling of the latest book's revelations about Kavanaugh, giving President Trump and other critics an opening to delegitimize them. That's unfortunate, because it landed at the same time as another book by New York Times reporters who broke the story about Weinstein, and that provides a master class tutorial on news gathering, objectivity, and doggedness.
Like all the women who told the #MeToo stories they prompted, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey put themselves on the line to tell a truth the world might learn from.
How disappointing that it hasn't.

Carlson falsely claims John Bolton was ‘man of the left’

Texto completo: Fox News host Tucker Carlson celebrated the departure of former national security adviser John Bolton, saying the mustachioed war hawk was actually a lefty.
“If you’re wondering why so many progressives are mourning Bolton’s firing tonight, it’s because Bolton himself fundamentally was a man of the left,” Carlson said Sept. 10 on his show, adding that Bolton was “one of the most progressive people in the Trump administration” and alleged that he “promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council.”
But it’s Carlson’s claims about the former national security adviser that are ridiculous. (Fox News did not respond to requests for comment.)
A lifelong conservative
First, a note about ideologies: In the United States, we tend to associate the terms “left” and “right” with the Democratic and the Republican Parties, respectively.
In that context, Carlson’s claim is “nonsense,” said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University, who previously served on staff for the Senate Democratic policy committee and the House Democratic caucus task force on Central America.
That’s because Bolton has spent his entire career in conservative circles and served in every GOP presidential administration going back to President Ronald Reagan, LeoGrande said.
Here are just a few examples of Bolton’s work prior to joining the Trump administration:
• In high school, Bolton volunteered to campaign for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, who lost to President Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 general election.
• Bolton spent the 1972 summer between law school semesters interning for Vice President Spiro Agnew of President Richard Nixon’s administration.
• Bolton joined the Reagan administration in the Agency for International Development in 1981, serving a year as general counsel and a year in an administrative role. He later moved to Reagan’s Justice Department, where he was the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs from 1985 to 1988 and assistant attorney general for a year in 1988.
• Bolton served in 2005 as ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, who appointed him on a “recess appointment” after the Republican-led Senate did not confirm his nomination.
• Bolton created a super PAC in 2013 that contributed millions of dollars to Republican congressional candidates in 2014, 2016 and 2018.
Foreign policy views
Best known for his foreign policy views, Bolton has criticized international institutions like the United Nations and called for a more aggressive stance toward hostile countries such as North Korea and Iran. He was an outspoken critic of Obama, penning op-eds, a number of tweets and a book about his policies.
But Bolton’s hawkishness — which Carlson described as a preference for “the brute force of government” — does not make him liberal, LeoGrande said. “In the foreign policy field, Bolton’s specialty, the interventionists have been conservative Republicans.”
Here are some of Bolton’s recent statements about foreign policy:
• In a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed, Bolton argued in favor of preemptively striking North Korea: “It is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current ‘necessity’ posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons by striking first.”
• In a 2015 New York Times op-ed, Bolton called for military action against Iran: “Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program. Nor will sanctions block its building a broad and deep weapons infrastructure. The inconvenient truth is that only military action … can accomplish what is required.”
• In an address at the 2018 CPAC conservative conference, Bolton called for a “massive military buildup” and “a comprehensive national debate on why preventing China from becoming the dominant world power” should be a top concern for Americans.
The National Security Council
We also found no evidence to support Carlson’s claim that Bolton “promoted Obama loyalists within the National Security Council.”
The Washington Post and Politico detailed the shuffling that occurred after Bolton took over as national security advise.
Many officials left their posts, while others were moved to new roles. Bolton left some openings vacant and filled others with people from outside of government.
But none of them were “Obama loyalists,” as far as we could tell.
Plus, government bureaucracies like the NSC are often full of career government officials who stay on staff from one administration to the next.
Our ruling
Carlson said Bolton “fundamentally was a man of the left.”
We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

Those who haven't seen him onstage will soon be able to read his thoughts on these perennially thorny issues in "My First Black Boyfriend," a collection of his essays set for publication in fall 2020.
"A lot of celebrities write books, and they don't always have something to say. I think Chris Rock has something to say," said Deb Futter, the senior vice president and co-publisher of Celadon, which is publishing the book. The essays, she added, "point out things that maybe need to be pointed out in our crazy world."
Celadon, a division of Macmillan, declined to make Rock available for an interview.
During his 2017 "Total Blackout Tour," the comedian was candid about his recent divorce and the role he played in the breakdown of his marriage. "At times, Mr. Rock sounded like a man confessing his sins, turning vulnerability into his latest provocation," Jason Zinoman wrote in his review of a performance in Durham, N.C.
Rock, 54, joined the cast of "Saturday Night Live" in 1990 and appeared in the final season of "In Living Color" as a special guest star. His first HBO special aired in 1994, followed by "Bring the Pain" in 1996, for which he won two Emmy Awards. He has produced and directed both TV ("The Rundown With Robin Thede," "Everybody Hates Chris") and film ("Top Five," "I Think I Love My Wife") and will appear in the Eddie Murphy movie, "Dolemite Is My Name," next month.
His first book, "Rock This!," came out in 1997 and was a New York Times best seller. Rock wrote about several of his favorite topics at the time, including President Bill Clinton and the O.J. Simpson saga, as well as racial dynamics in the United States and the differences he sees between men and women.
The news of Rock's collection comes at a time of heated debates over what lines comedians can and can't cross. Last week, Shane Gillis, a newly announced "S.N.L." cast member, was criticized for making racist comments directed at Chinese people and using a racial slur on a podcast. Gillis responded on Twitter, saying: "I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss." On Monday, "S.N.L." said he wouldn't be joining the show.
In January, after the comedian Kevin Hart withdrew from hosting the Academy Awards after criticism of his homophobic tweets, Rock said he wouldn't be taking the job on again. According to Variety and other outlets, while presenting at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, Rock referred to the current state of comedy and said: "If it was five years ago, I could say something really offensive and funny right now, but I can't do that anymore."

Texto completo: The Los Angeles Philharmonic knew that it had big shoes to fill when Deborah Borda -- the visionary executive whose leadership since the turn of the 21st century had helped make it the envy of the orchestra world -- departed in 2017 to take over the New York Philharmonic.
After looking at strong internal candidates, and considering outsiders from the world of business and entertainment, its board chose Simon Woods, who had developed a reputation for innovation as president of the Seattle Symphony.
So it surprised the music industry when the orchestra announced on Monday that Mr. Woods would step down, after less than two years as its chief executive, just as its new season is about to begin. Mr. Woods was quoted in the announcement as saying that "after a great deal of reflection, I have concluded that my hopes and aspirations lie elsewhere."
In Los Angeles, Mr. Woods inherited an orchestra that is financially and artistically thriving. A record producer before becoming an administrator, he forged a partnership between the Philharmonic and Deutsche Grammophon.
But the orchestra had grown accustomed to the larger-than-life presence of Ms. Borda. And while Mr. Woods was credited with raising the Seattle Symphony's artistic profile -- among other things, that orchestra presented the premiere of John Luther Adams's "Become Ocean," which went on to win a Pulitzer Prize -- and prioritizing outreach, that was a much smaller operation: The Los Angeles Philharmonic's annual budget, approximately $ 125 million, is nearly four times that of Seattle.
Another possible challenge: Mr. Woods also inherited the respected senior leadership team that Ms. Borda had assembled, some of whom had been considered as possible successors to her. Gail Samuel, the executive director, who served as acting president during the search, let it be known she was interested in the job. Chad Smith, the chief operating officer, who oversees the orchestra's adventurous programming, said then that he was happy in his current post. The current contract of the orchestra's star music and artistic director, Gustavo Dudamel, runs through mid-2022.
The orchestra, which announced that its board chairman, Jay Rasulo, and chairman designate, Thomas L. Beckmen, would serve as interim leaders, declined to elaborate on the reasons for Mr. Woods's departure. Ms. Borda said in an interview that each artistic institution has its own ecosystem and that "a leader who works brilliantly in one setting may simply not be the right fit in another."
It was, in a sense, history repeating itself. After another strong-willed executive, Ernest Fleischmann, retired from the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 1997 after nearly three decades, his successor, Willem Wijnbergen, lasted less than two years in the post.
When Mr. Rasulo was asked about that earlier bungled transition during a 2017 interview with The New York Times, as the search for a new chief got underway, he said that he hoped to find someone who could stand the test of time.
"You don't want to be doing this again in two years," he said.

Texto completo: Shane Gillis, a 31-year-old stand-up comedian who was named last week to the "Saturday Night Live" cast, has mimicked caricatures of Chinese accents. He has called it a "hassle" to have to speak with a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. He has used a racial slur to refer to the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
And in response, Mr. Yang, who has emerged as one of just a handful of viable Asian-American candidates ever to seek a major party's nomination for president, has preached forgiveness.
"Shane -- I prefer comedy that makes people think and doesn't take cheap shots. But I'm happy to sit down and talk with you if you'd like," he said in a tweet over the weekend. "For the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human."
But lose his job Mr. Gillis did. On Monday afternoon, "S.N.L." announced that he would not be joining the show, and in a statement, called his language "offensive, hurtful and unacceptable."
Then, about an hour after the announcement, Mr. Yang tweeted again, suggesting that Mr. Gillis had taken him up on his offer to talk things out.
"Shane Gillis reached out," Mr. Yang said. "Looks like we will be sitting down together soon."
A spokesman for Mr. Yang did not have any comment on Mr. Gillis's departure from the show on Monday night. Nonetheless, the dayslong ordeal with its swift and sudden turn has had the side effect of thrusting Mr. Yang, a long-shot candidate with a loyal following, into the spotlight and placing him at the center of a national conversation about racism, outrage culture and absolution.
For more than a year, Mr. Yang, 44, has built support from outside the political establishment by purposely staying above the political fray, posting videos of himself having fun playing basketball and preaching "humanity first" as a central tenet of his campaign. His response to Mr. Gillis over the weekend echoed those inviting approaches.
But as many "S.N.L." viewers and others across the country clamored for Mr. Gillis to be fired, believing his jokes to be beyond excusable, Mr. Yang's response unnerved those hoping for a more forceful condemnation from him. Perhaps the most pointed criticism has come from the Asian-American community itself, where some have expressed a mix of incredulity and weighty disappointment at the way Mr. Yang has talked about race throughout his campaign.
Mr. Yang took "a position that's very much at odds with the Asian-American community," said Jenn Fang, the creator of a long-running Asian-American advocacy blog, Reappropriate, who tweeted over the weekend about Mr. Yang's comments. "He's trying to let Shane Gillis off the hook so he can cater to other voters that he needs to get to the White House."
Mr. Yang also received significant blowback from people within and outside Asian-American communities for appearing to draw a comparison between how society treats anti-Asian racism and anti-black racism.
"Anti-Asian racism is particularly virulent because it's somehow considered more acceptable," Mr. Yang argued on Twitter. "If Shane had used the n word, the treatment would likely be immediate and clear."
As one of three remaining candidates in the race who do not have a background in politics, Mr. Yang has won fans by speaking off the cuff and peppering his stump speech with sometimes self-deprecating humor. Because he has made automation and concern over mass unemployment central themes of his candidacy, he has won the support of some young, white, male Trump voters while at the same time attracting progressives and a significant share of Asian-Americans -- all groups he seeks to hold together under the apolitical campaign catch phrase "Not left, not right, but forward."
But his handling of race has sometimes undermined that careful balancing act and raised the concerns among some who say he has been too willing to lean in to stereotypes about Asian-Americans to win support. His biggest applause line remains "The opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math"; in front of a national television audience during the debate last week, he observed, "I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors."
In tweets, Mr. Yang also reiterated that he had been the target of racial epithets in the past. Asked about his jokes about liking math and knowing doctors, he has maintained that the Asian-American community is diverse, that his individual experience does not speak for everyone and that Americans are smart enough to see through the model minority myth, which overgeneralizes Asians as diligent and high-achieving.
In an interview on Monday with The New York Times just hours before Mr. Gillis was dropped from "S.N.L.," Mr. Yang said he had not meant to compare his experience as an Asian-American to "the experience of growing up black in this country." He said he had intended only to make an "observation" about anti-Asian racism and the fact that it is not always taken seriously.
Mr. Yang said he and his wife had sat down to watch Mr. Gillis's comedy routines for 30 minutes to an hour and had concluded that he was not "malignant or evil." He also said he had resisted sending a tweet containing an expletive that would have more forcefully expressed his anger at Mr. Gillis.
"There's a complex set of reactions one has," Mr. Yang said.
He said that someone had yelled a slur at him out a car window "just the other day" and added that he had talked to his wife about the experience. He said they had bemoaned the fact that such a slur could eventually be directed at one of their boys.
Mr. Yang also denied that there were any politics at play. "This is both how I genuinely see this and what I think is best," he said. "I totally respect people who have different points of view."
Danielle Seid, an assistant professor of English at Baruch College who studies film and television history, said Mr. Yang had definitely found himself "in a tough spot." He had been right to point out that anti-Asian racism has often not been treated seriously, she said, but he may not have done "a good job of parsing that with his tweets about the n-word."
Mr. Yang's comments could have been read as an argument that "Asians have it worse" than other minority groups, when "it's pretty clear that, in terms of racist policies and practices and culture in the United States, so much of it is founded on anti-black racism," said Ellen Wu, an associate professor of history at Indiana University.
At a broader level, both Professor Seid and Professor Wu said Mr. Yang's high profile had made him something of a spokesman for the Asian-American community. As such, Professor Seid said she wished Mr. Yang had been "more forceful in condemning Mr. Gillis's 'jokes' and taken the opportunity to congratulate Bowen Yang," one of the show's writers who was also elevated to a featured performer's position.
Kevin Xu, a co-host of the Model MAJORITY Podcast and a former Obama White House staff member, said he had wanted Mr. Gillis to lose his job "because he is racist and not funny."
But he defended Mr. Yang's handling of the situation. Given that Mr. Yang is a candidate for president, Mr. Xu said he believed it was appropriate for him to "take the high road."
"This is the best way he could have handled something like this," Mr. Xu said. "I think over all he's doing a pretty good job owning up to his minority status while still doing what he needs to do to run for president."
"I don't think that, for someone like him -- just like Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or any other historical candidate trying to break any sort of ceiling -- they can do this perfectly," Mr. Xu added. "It's a very, very high-wire act. It's very hard."

New York Times reporters blame editors for 'error of judgment' in Kavanaugh story

Texto completo: The two New York Times reporters behind the story detailing a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh blamed the editing process for the omission of a key passage that was later added along with an editor's note.
In an interview Monday evening, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly said this missing detail, which undercut the claim that Kavanaugh made inappropriate sexual contact with a female student at Yale University in the mid-1980s, was in the original draft of the piece.
"I think what happened actually was that we had her name and the Times doesn’t usually include the name of the victim. And so I think in this case the editors felt like maybe it was probably better to remove it. And in removing her name, they removed the other reference to the fact that she didn’t remember it," Pogrebin told MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell.
The Times exposé, published Saturday afternoon and adapted from Pogrebin and Kelly's upcoming book The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, due out Tuesday, centered around Deborah Ramirez, who alleged Kavanaugh thrust his penis into her face at a Yale dormitory party in the 1980s. It contained a new allegation that came from a male classmate, Max Stier, who told the FBI and at least one Democratic senator that he saw Kavanaugh "with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The FBI reportedly did not investigate the claim.
After the report's publication Saturday, liberal activist organizations and some 2020 Democratic candidates called for Kavanaugh to be impeached. President Trump defended Kavanaugh in a salvo of tweets and urged him to "start suing." But more than 24 hours after the piece was published, the Times revised the article, along with an editor's note, to include a passage that said the female student who was alleged to be the victim, "declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode."
iFrame Object
Pogrebin said she believes the removal of the whole sentence was "done in haste in the editing process, as you know, for closing the section." Pogrebin also acknowledged she and Kelly were involved in the decision to remove the words.
"We discussed it," she said. "We think we felt like there was so much heat, you know, there's so much — everyone has been kind of seizing on various aspects of this that we certainly didn’t want this to be an issue anymore. And we certainly never intended to mislead in any way. We wanted to give as full a story as possible."
Kelly emphasized the "key point" is that the book provides a "much fuller context" about everything they know.
Asked by O'Donnell if they thought it would have been a good idea to mention in the editor's note that the passage was in the original draft of the article, Kelly said, "I'm not sure."
"But I think the desire you see was to get the information out there to the readers, not to focus too much on the process," she added. "Because obviously there had been an error of judgment that was being addressed, and just to move on to give people the information they needed, but also to remind people that this is an adaptation of a much longer work that’s forthcoming."

Texto completo: Be better stewards
Editor: An Aug. 30 Times-Tribune article had reference to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan sending a letter to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf telling him the Keystone State needs to up its game on the Chesapeake Bay cleanup.
While I understand what he means, I feel a stormwater fee is a way to extort money from property owners instead of using tax dollars that were already collected. I can see Scranton’s officials don’t care about pollution going into our rivers and streams that feed the Chesapeake Bay.
I’ve complained to the Department of Environmental Protection and the state’s Chesapeake Bay office when I couldn’t get results from Scranton to stop using an old garbage truck. Throughout the summer, Department of Public Works crews would compact the garbage in front of my house and on our streets and spill garbage juice, trash, glass and nails on the road. There’s no telling what garbage juice contains - chemicals, medication, feces, just imagine. Would you want your children riding their bicycles though this leachate or have it dripping on your garage floor and driveway?
Scranton’s officials don’t seem to care. DEP and the state Chesapeake Bay office don’t seem to have the power to stop Scranton from polluting our environment. The only help DEP did was to get Scranton to use a new garbage truck on my street.
Then they sent a street sweeper up a week later after I cleaned up the garbage juice and then rain washed that residue into the streams. DPW still uses an old truck that spills garbage pollutants on other streets.
Recently, I had to maneuver around garbage juice and trash spilled on Pen Y Bryn Drive and other streets. Scranton needs a change. We don’t need politicians allowing this to happen and endangering our health and the environment. Hopefully, this will help convince Scranton’s elected officials and employees to stop pollution and become good environmental stewards.

The sustainability of Western economies in its current form, which started with globalization in 1980, is at an extremely volatile place. Most Western governments put a cover over gaping holes in the system that the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy laid bare, by adding $17 trillion infusion into the financial sector, according to Forbes magazine.
Strangely, adding $17 trillion to the world’s economy did not raise interest rates to help eat away debts - although Economy 101 tells you it will.
The fact that the U.S. government can print money is the essence of sovereign power. The countries within the European Union that use the euro cannot print money. All EU banks continue to be highly leveraged because of bad assets on their books that the banks can do nothing with.
EU and U.S. banks have continued to issue credit they know can never be repaid to cover debts already held. The best they can hope for, with wages stagnant and no interest rate rise, is that the debt revolves.
This is kicking the can down the road. The banking policies that underlay the 2008 financial crisis continue. If any EU bank fails, the domino effect is incalculable due to the global and connected nature of financial markets.
The financial sector seems content to ride the wave until it must be bailed out again or it crashes, and another version of capitalism is formed. What is not certain is if capitalism can survive an all-out global crash.

Reading rewarded
Editor: In April I looked ahead to months of television misery.
I had been watching too much cable TV politics and now the debates to determine the Democratic presidential nominee were about to begin with 24 candidates. Even the most devoted political junkie should acknowledge the problem: If there is a lot of useful opinion, there may be just as much useless attitude, all to be repeated again and again.
There was a solution. Most days I purchased two local newspapers (from Scranton and Wilkes-Barre) and one national paper. I started buying an additional national paper along with the New York Daily News, which is helpful because it names everything and is unhelpful in that it names everything. It has a good sports section.
Many knowledgeable people say The New York Times is the world’s best newspaper, albeit liberal. Others may prefer the conservative Wall Street Journal.
The nation’s moderate national newspaper is USA Today. There is usually not much to it, but primary political reporter Susan Page may be worth the price herself.
What is the relative value of buying five newspapers? Each can be quickly perused and time is available. Thus, I continue to glance at the television screen for highlights, or low lights.
The great reward is that once summer began, I seized the opportunity to read the two important new books of Trump’s time: “American Carnage,” by Tim Alberta, a history from the end of Bush-Cheney through Barack Obama until now; and “The Immoral Majority,” by Ben Lowe, which is adequately described by the tagline, “Why Evangelicals Chose Political Power over Christian Values.”

Taliban tete-a-tete
Editor: I don’t understand why President Trump has been the target of so much criticism for his plan to meet with the Taliban at Camp David, three days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
I’m sure the Republican Party and Trump would have been very tolerant and supportive if President Obama or Hillary Clinton had offered to meet with the terrorist group, perhaps choosing Ground Zero as the meeting site and reading from the Koran while flying miniature airplanes in circles.
Let’s stop the divisiveness and partisan politics and try to be a kinder and gentler nation.

Texto completo: Manhattan prosecutors have subpoenaed eight years of President Trump's tax returns from his accounting firm as part of a state investigation into hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 campaign, according to a published report.
The demands for the president's personal taxes and those of the Trump Organization were issued last month to Mazars USA after District Attorney Cy Vance Jr. opened a probe into the payments made to keep the porn star quiet about her alleged affair with Trump, The New York Times reported Monday.
Vance is eyeing the $130,000 that was paid to Daniels (photo) by Trump fixer Michael Cohen just before the November 2016 vote.
Federal prosecutors got Cohen to plead guilty to breaking campaign finance laws by making the payments, for which he was later reimbursed by Trump's business.
But they effectively dropped the probe into Trump or anyone else who directed the payments.
Vance is probing whether the Trump Organization may have falsely claimed the reimbursements were legal expenses, the Times reports. Falsifying business records can be a crime in New York and can be a felony if used to cover up other crimes.
Democrats in Congress are separately demanding Trump release his personal tax returns, but he has steadfastly refused to do so.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has defied a congressional subpoena for the returns, and Trump has sued to block a state law that permits officials to disclose his state returns if Congress asks for them.

How does Congress impeach a Supreme Court justice?

Texto completo: Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts plans Tuesday to introduce a resolution calling for an impeachment inquiry of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
She is potentially kicking off a constitutional process that closely mirrors the process for removing the president from office. So how would that work?
First, if Speaker Nancy Pelosi allows it, the House would vote on Pressley's resolution. If passed, it would prompt the Judiciary Committee to take affidavits and depositions and issue subpoenas in connection with an impeachment inquiry of Kavanaugh, who was confirmed last fall amid public allegations of sexual assault and harassment stemming from his high school years and his time at Yale University.
Once it is given the go-ahead to start an impeachment inquiry, the Judiciary Committee has subpoena power to investigate whether or not Kavanaugh committed an impeachable offense, which are defined in the Constitution. The guidelines for impeachment are imprecise, defined in Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution as “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."
There is precedent for charging judges with sexual assault under “high crimes and misdemeanors." In 2009, the House impeached Judge Samuel B. Kent for sexual assault, obstruction of justice, and lying to federal investigators. Prior to his impeachment, Kent pled guilty to obstruction of justice and admitted to assaulting former employees at his US District Court in Texas.
If the Judiciary Committee chooses to pursue articles of impeachment, the entire House would have to approve impeachment with a simple majority. If approved, an impeachment trial would begin in the Senate, who would have to vote with a 2/3 majority to convict on the articles of impeachment.
Kavanaugh's approval vote, 50-48 in the Senate, was the closest Supreme Court vote in American history. As when he was voted onto the court, Republicans control the Senate by a 53-47 margin and GOP Senators Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham called the allegations against Kavanaugh “unsubstantiated" and “scurrilous" respectively.
The House has impeached a single Supreme Court justice — Samuel Chase, in 1804 — and the Senate refused to convict him.
However, eight federal judges have been removed from the bench by the Senate following a successful impeachment trial. That record stands in contrast to presidential impeachment — only two presidents have been impeached and both Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were acquitted in their impeachment trials in the Senate.

Why is a TV critic writing about Trump?

Texto completo: James Poniewozik, chief television critic for "The New York Times," has an answer at the ready if anyone suggests that writing "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" is beyond his purview.
"If somebody says stay in my lane?" Poniewozik says. "The guy from 'The Apprentice' is president. That ship sailed a long time ago, and nobody's going to bring it into the dock."
Not that Poniewozik has anyone to answer to. The book, which comes out Sept. 10, is brilliant, drawing on Poniewozik's considerable skill as a critic. If you still struggle to understand how Trump got elected, boy, is this the book for you.
What is the book about?
It's a terrific read. Poniewozik's writing is breezy, funny when it needs to be, serious when it doesn't. In his TV reviews and media essays, Poniewozik always seeks the larger meaning, and if that's difficult to wedge into a single newspaper column, the book gives him more room to breathe.
He examines not just Trump's evolution from media-hungry huckster to president but also the way television changed along the way, creating a synthesis unique to the time and the person – resulting in President Trump.
Or, as Poniewozik puts it in the book, "TV became president."
"I saw that here were these things that I had been writing about for decades as a critic – reality TV and sort of the idea of authenticity," Poniewozik said, "Fox News and conservative media and the political polarization that came from that. The fragmentation of the larger media into bubbles and niches, which enabled all of those things. They gave us reality TV and they gave us political cable news channels. All these things I had been writing about for so long had converged together in the form of a single person who got elected president."
The book follows the parallel lines of both the man and the medium, and their forever-intertwined relationship. A young Trump was fascinated not only by the televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II but also his mother's entrancement with it (his father thought it was a waste of time).
Of course, it's the reality show "The Apprentice" and Trump's "You're fired!" mantra that most people cite when talking about Trump and TV, though Poniewozik traces the future president all the way back to a 1980 appearance on the "Today" show – a kinder, gentler but just as boastful Trump.
Both he and TV would change.
Grand plan or dumb luck?
In reality, "The Apprentice" was a hit for only a season. It would morph into "The Celebrity Apprentice" and gradually fade away.
Trump, obviously, wasn't done with TV yet, and vice versa.
"One thing that honestly writing the book made me aware of that I wasn't even enough aware of at the time was the extent to which Donald Trump had become kind of a has-been reality-show host through 'Celebrity Apprentice,' (at the same time) he was really rising as a personality thanks to Fox News and 'Fox & Friends,' which I would argue is as important to his eventually getting elected as 'The Apprentice' was," Poniewozik says.
It was a match made just a few feet below heaven, with Trump making outrageous claims against President Barack Obama on a frequent basis (like the birther conspiracy theory), but it worked for both parties.
"That's like the perfect medium to sort of put over into the political world this loud, buffoonish entertainment figure, and kind of gradually transform him into a political figure," Poniewozik says. "And Fox News was a great medium for him to do that in, because it had for decades, thanks to Roger Ailles, been cultivating this audience that felt besieged and the rest of the news is fake news and you can only trust Fox and had sort of taught its audience this sort of resentment of liberal Hollywood.
"With Donald Trump becoming a personality on 'Fox & Friends' it's great, because here's this TV celebrity who's on their side, and is not part of liberal Hollywood, but a celebrity of their own. That ends up being the perfect medium in which to sort of launder that reality TV celebrity and turn it into a genuine political asset."
So was all this a grand plan, or just dumb luck?
"I think it is not a grand plan, but it's not dumb luck," Poniewozik says. "It's sort of this instinctual, kind of savant-like ability to follow the light of the camera and trust that it will lead him to the next thing, which it always has. He kind of learned how to think like a television – what stimulates a TV camera's pleasure centers and nerve endings, and say and do the things that get you attention. There's no such thing as bad attention, because you can leverage that into something else."
Like, for instance, the presidency. You will recall that during the Republican primaries, Trump would fight with his opponents about almost anything. This surprised a lot of political pundits, but not Poniewozik.
"When he ran for president, there were all these things, whether it was attacking John McCain, war hero, or he goes on a debate and he launches on this tirade against Rand Paul, who is like 5,000 points behind him in the poll," he says. "Over and over again, it's like, 'Why is Trump picking this unnecessary fight?'
"Well that's the thing you say if you don't watch a lot of reality TV. If you watch a lot of reality TV, you realized every fight is necessary, because fights get you camera time. Fights show that you're a fighter. It's sort of dominance politics when you apply it to a presidential primary, which is basically a reality-TV elimination event."
Remember the audience Trump was playing to – and continues to play to today.
"If you launch this outrageous attack against somebody and they don't have a good response, then it's telling voters this guy can't even protect himself, how do you expect him to protect you? It's sort of virtual combat. That is the thing I think you understand by understanding how reality TV works, that you wouldn't understand if you had just looked at how past political campaigns worked."
Poniewozik is somewhat optimistic about the lessons media learned from the way they covered the 2016 election, though he says it's mostly at the margins. Unfiltered coverage of rallies is less common. But it remains a difficult balance for all media.
"Nobody's innocent in this," Poniewozik says. "It's not just cable news. It's newspapers. Everybody to some extent, they're ruled by the tyranny of clicks."
True enough. Providing context and a critical eye is essential to covering Trump – to covering anyone, really. And in "Audience of One," Poniewozik does just that, to outstanding effect.

MORE JEFFREY EPSTEINS ARE STILL OUT THERE THEY OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY, CONTINUING TO SEXUALLY EXPLOIT CHILDREN

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein got away for years with raping underage girls, and the public is properly outraged that powerful people seemed to shrug and let him off easy.
But the problem isn't one tycoon but many tens of thousands of men who pay for sex with underage girls across the country. And society as a whole reacts with the same indifference that the authorities showed in the Epstein scandal.
"We see it as this singular narrative about this one guy," said Rachel Lloyd, who wrote a superb book, "Girls Like Us," about her own experience being sexually trafficked as a teenager. "There's a much larger narrative out there about girls, often girls of color, who are commercially sexually exploited, often with impunity."
"It's part of the same behavior, part of what we allow as a society," Ms. Lloyd added. "He got away with it because society said he could, and that's what other johns think as well."
Ms. Lloyd now runs a first-rate program, GEMS, in New York for girls and young women who have been trafficked. The people she helps haven't been whisked off to Caribbean islands on private jets, but the pattern is the same: sordid exploitation of vulnerable girls by older and more affluent men who get away with it.
Indeed, girls across America are often treated even worse than in the Epstein case: Some end up arrested for prostitution while their rapists get off scot-free.
If we want to channel our outrage at the Epstein case in a productive way, we could: A) ramp up prosecution of pimps who traffic children; B) prosecute johns who rape girls and boys; C) assist programs for survivors of trafficking; and D) support initiatives that help vulnerable youths avoid being victimized by predators.
"They're not billionaires, but it happens all the time," said Shelia Faye Simpkins, who ran away from home at 14 and into the arms of a pimp.
She was raised by an alcoholic who was addicted to drugs and taught her, when she was 6, how to perform oral sex on a man. Ms. Simpkins says intervention by social workers might have spared her a brutal career being beaten by a pimp when she didn't earn a daily quota of $1,000.
She estimates that over the years she was arrested about 200 times for prostitution and other offenses; her pimp, never.
Eventually, Ms. Simpkins escaped that life and now works with an outstanding program in Tennessee called Thistle Farms that helps exploited women start new lives and find employment.
As world leaders prepare to gather at the United Nations, some 40 million people are effectively locked into modern forms of slavery, according to the Global Slavery Index. That includes sex trafficking but also child marriages and a great deal of forced labor.
In the U.S., no one knows exactly how many children are sold for sex, but estimates have run between 10,000 and 100,000 in any given year. Whatever the number, it's too many.
President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump have both denounced sex trafficking, with the president saying he will leverage "every resource" to address this "urgent humanitarian issue." Ms. Trump has said that fighting trafficking is a major priority of her father's administration.
But while the attention is welcome, it seems to be largely hot air - and Mr. Trump's lurid descriptions of trafficking seem mostly to be a misleading rationale for his border wall. In fact, under Mr. Trump, the federal government is easing up on human traffickers.
Federal prosecutors initiated only 171 human trafficking cases last year, substantially fewer than the 241 in 2017 or the 223 in 2016, according to the Federal Human Trafficking Report series. Bradley Myles of Polaris, the organization that runs a human trafficking hotline, (888) 373-7888, notes that the number of T visas, which are given to trafficking victims, has also dropped, and a housing program for trafficking survivors has been canceled.
"I'm glad the issue has bipartisan support, but I don't think enough is happening," Mr. Myles said. "Epstein wasn't this one bad apple; this is more of a systemic issue."
If we could leverage outrage, there's evidence of what works abroad and in the U.S. A group called the Freedom Fund has a report coming out this month showing that expanding grassroots initiatives could lead to huge reductions in forced labor in India.
Likewise, new studies of My Life My Choice, a Boston program for children who have been trafficked or are at risk of being trafficked, find that the girls become less likely to use drugs, engage in delinquent behavior or be arrested when provided counseling, mentoring and other support. The program's participants on average were first sexually exploited at the age of 14 - which should remind us that we need more help for vulnerable children, and less impunity for pimps and johns who exploit them.
"What was so painful about the Jeffrey Epstein case is that it wasn't shocking," Lisa Goldblatt Grace, co-founder of My Life My Choice, told me. "A wealthy white man leveraged his money, privilege and power to sexually abuse, to rape, young girls."
Or, as Yiota Souras of the National Center for Missing&Exploited Children put it: "Epstein is the tip of a very large iceberg."

Texto completo: Keene Sentinel
The Trump administration's recent announcement that it plans to ban most flavored vape products is roiling some local business owners who sell the goods.

The announcement comes amid recent cases of lung illness that health officials say may be linked to vaping, as well as mounting concerns over e-cigarette use among youth.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Thursday, 380 cases of the illness, with six deaths, are being investigated in 36 states. Though the investigation has not yet identified any specific product or substance linking all of the cases, the suspected cause is chemical exposure, the federal agency said.
“We can't allow people to get sick. And we can't have our kids be so affected,” President Donald Trump said last week, according to the New York Times.

But owners of two area stores that sell vaping devices and supplies said a ban on flavored products would be a significant hit for their businesses.

As described by the administration, the ban would apply to everything but plain-tobacco flavorings, the Times reported.

“We stock close to 200 flavors, so we have about seven tobacco flavors, and three different menthol flavors,” said Gaetano Putignano, who owns 802 E-Cig Supply Inc. in Walpole. “... It would greatly impact our business.”
Daniel Cavallero, an owner of Monadnock Vapor, which has locations in Keene, Hinsdale and West Lebanon, said that aside from hurting his sales, he believes a flavor ban would have a detrimental public health effect by discouraging people from seeking out alternatives to smoking.

“(The flavors are) not geared towards kids; it's geared towards adults to make it more attractive for them to quit smoking. And it works – I have 9,000 customers, 9,000-plus on my rewards program. So it obviously works, and my customers are 18 to 75,” Cavallero said. “So, guess what? Adults like flavors too.”
While e-cigarette users and vape shop owners have pushed back against the proposed ban, prevention advocates are offering praise. Shawn LaFrance, vice president of population health at Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, said Friday that he's pleased the federal government is taking action to address what he considers a significant public health concern.

'It's sloppy and it's lazy': The View co-host attacks New York Times Kavanaugh story

Texto completo: The View co-host Abby Huntsman called the New York Times' article about an allegation of sexual misconduct lodged against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that left out crucial details "sloppy" and "lazy."
The New York Times reported on Saturday, which was adapted from an upcoming book by reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, that one of Kavanaugh's classmates at Yale University said he made inappropriate sexual contact with a female student.
However, after the article blew up and presidential candidates began calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment, the outlet added an editor's note that says in part, "The female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode."
Huntsman was very critical of the significant detail being left out of the article at the time of its original publication.

"When you talk about journalistic integrity and why you look at the American public on media, and their views on it, why it is so low — I grew up watching my dad read the New York Times and I would read it with him, and it was a place where I knew there was sourcing at least beyond one name," Huntsman stated. "Now we’re in this place where there isn’t a difference many times between tabloid news and a New York Times article, and that to me is really sad and frankly it plays right into the president’s hands."
She continued, "New York Times, congratulations. If the president gets reelected, you are helping him get there because when you write pieces like this. It’s sloppy and it's lazy, and you have not one name in there that was actually directly involved in anything that happened."
This was the fourth woman to publicly accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. The three others came forward at the time of his appointment and confirmation to the Supreme Court.

Leaping fly larvae offer more to explore

Texto completo: ROANOKE - For a split second, Michael Wise wondered if his eyes were playing tricks on him.
"At first, I thought maybe I had been sitting in the lab by myself for too long," he joked.
"I had not expected these little guys to be able to jump."
Wise, a biologist and a professor at Roanoke College, had been in his campus lab methodically dissecting pieces of goldenrod and collecting the fly larvae that was burrowed within waiting to pupate and emerge, fully formed, into the world.
The larvae - teensy maggot-like organisms with an orange hue - were being set aside in the same petri dish.
Then Wise glanced down and realized the dish was nearly empty.
The little guys, without the benefit of leg or limb, had escaped.
Wise gave chase and found the larvae were leaping about the room. A few had nearly reached the wall - a distance many times greater than their diminutive body lengths.
The advent of jumping larvae isn't unprecedented, though neither is it common. Other specimens collected by Wise, who studies plant defenses against insects, showed little to no movement, let alone the ability to launch themselves across relatively wide gulfs.
The secret of how these legless, wingless creatures - a form of gall midge larvae - managed these aerial acrobatics had yet to be pinpointed.
Wise, who first noticed the phenomenon in 2012, shared the puzzle with a team at Duke University led by Sheila Patek, a former grad school classmate of Wise's who specializes in breaking down the blink-and-you'll-miss-it movements of the animal world.
Using a powerful high-speed camera, recording at the dizzying rate of 20,000 frames per second, Patek's lab captured the details of the larval leaping and found it employed an intriguing spring-loaded approach.
A busy larva on the go will start by curling itself into a loop, touching head end to tail end, and latching those together using adhesive patches of microscopic hair-like structures.
The larva then starts churning its internal fluids, pushing them toward its lower end, creating pressure that builds until, snap, the latch springs open and sends it somersaulting through the air.
Specimens, no bigger than a grain of rice, were documented vaulting distances 36 times their body length.
Wise said anecdotally he's spotted some covering even greater fields while in flight.
"They're kind of among the champion jumpers," he said. "And they'll keep doing it until they run out of energy or dry up or find a good place."
In August, the researchers published a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology sharing their findings. The paper made a splash, something Wise hadn't expected, and attracted national attention from a string of outlets including The New York Times, National Public Radio and The Atlantic.
"It's nice to see something that you think is neat get interest from other people," said Wise, adding he's not accustomed to lay people wanting to hear him talk about his larval observations.
Wise said he wasn't sure what it was about the spunky little leapers that struck a chord with people. "I don't know if it was the gross factor or the cool factor," he said.
The findings could hold significance for other arenas of research, including soft robotics, a field working to develop robots from pliable materials that are more resilient and adaptable than rigid components. The squishy gall midge larvae, which are able to create these powerful, efficient motions, could help shape experiments in that work. Mechanical engineers are among those interested in the findings.
Wise, who co-authored the research paper, noted there also is more to explore from an ecological standpoint.
Still undetermined is exactly why these restless wanderers send themselves soaring through the air. Could it be a means of evading danger when rousted in their infancy, or perhaps a vestigial trait evolved for purposes no longer known?
Wise said the carefully perfected nature of the jumping motion leads him to suspect that it meets some need.
"My sense is that this behavior is so well-honed, so specific and so effective that there must be some selective advantage to doing it," he said.
"But that's one of the big questions," he added. "There's more to do in terms of nailing down where these midges fit in evolutionarily."

RIC OCASEK | 1944 - 2019

Texto completo: Someone once said that the formula for a hit song was simple: Sad lyrics, happy melody. Ric Ocasek, lead singer of the quintessential new wave band The Cars, was one of the masters of that formula.
Ocasek, 75, was found dead in his Manhattan apartment Sunday afternoon, an NYPD spokesman said, after a 911 call reporting his death. No foul play is suspected.
The legendary singer, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year, spent years turning out upbeat yet subliminally dark pop-rock that perfectly captured the mood of the late 1970s and 1980s. That was when The Cars produced its best-known hits, from "My Best Friend's Girl" to "Shake it Up" to "You Might Think."
It's easy to forget The Cars were initially a '70s band, formed in 1976 in Boston, a town whose musical output consisted mainly of the classic rock stalwarts Aerosmith and, of course, Boston. The Cars were nothing like those shaggy-haired bands, which were essentially still steeped in the '60s. The Cars were, like their name, a sleek and modern machine. Their spiffed-up version of power-pop, driven by dynamic guitars and cool synthesizers, pointed the way toward the 1980s that were yet to come.
Looking back at that cusp-of-the-decade era - when punk bands like the Ramones existed side by side with new wave bands like Blondie and Talking Heads - Ocasek stands out as a definitive figure. Tall, lanky, dressed in a slim suit, skinny tie and ever-present sunglasses, Ocasek came off as a modern-day Roy Orbison. Like Orbison, Ocasek cultivated an aloof persona, a mystique. He wasn't exactly Mr. Charisma on stage, and The Cars were never known as a particularly galvanizing live band. Ocasek preferred to let the music speak for itself.
And it did. A Cars song was always a work of cool detachment and irony with a strong undercurrent of yearning and heartbreak. "Just What I Needed," a deceptively propulsive rock tune, told the age-old story of a toxic relationship; "Since You're Gone" builds on the rhythm of what sounds like a pair of stilettos walking out a door; "Good Times Roll" is one of the most wondrously depressing pop tunes ever to blast out of AM radio.
"Drive" - one of their biggest and most straightforward hits, written by Ocasek but sung by bassist Benjamin Orr - is a ballad whose nightmarishness is easy to overlook unless you focus on the words: "Who's gonna pay attention to your dreams? And who's gonna plug their ears when you scream?"
It's not too much of a stretch to connect The Cars with the Cold War anxieties of the 1980s. What was so great about Ocasek and The Cars is that they turned those anxieties into some of the catchiest pop tunes ever written.
"If someone can walk out in the street and shoot John Lennon, somebody can launch a nuclear attack," Ocasek told The New York Times in 1983. "It's scary. But you start to take it in stride after a while. If you're going to live in a world of absurdities, you have to learn to laugh at them.''

Texto completo: Before we get lost in all the analysis and pontificating and political connect-the-dots surrounding Margaret Atwoods new novel, lets remember this: Atwood is a hell of a writer, and, whatever else it may be, The Testaments is a splendid tale, splendidly told.

But the publication of the book, the sequel to the Canadian authors 1985 dystopian classic The Handmaids Tale, is also a media event. Atwood herself has appeared in recent weeks in places you would expect  witty interviews with the New York Times, NPRs Weekend Edition and CBSs Sunday Morning  and others you might not, like a cover and fashion spread for the Style section of the Times of London, posing in an elegant array of haute couture witchwear, a twinkle of irony in her eye.

As for The Testaments, publisher Nan A. Talese/Doubleday (an imprint of Penguin Random House) was keeping it under tighter wraps than the Mueller Report. No early copies for critics; those few who did get copies were required to sign strict nondisclosure agreements, their reviews embargoed until the books publication.

Among those who got their hands on The Testaments early were the judges for Great Britains prestigious Booker Prize, who included the novel as one of the six short-listed for the 2019 award.

A first printing of half a million copies was scheduled. Booksellers were required to sign unusually stringent contracts, complete with financial penalties, promising not to sell the novel before its Sept. 10 publication date, or even to open the shipping boxes.

And then Amazon blew it all up.

A week before the publication date, the giant online retailer sent out an unknown number of copies of The Testaments to American customers who had ordered in advance. With the embargo smashed, a number of publications rushed out their reviews.

Todd Doughty, executive director for publicity at Doubleday, wrote in a terse statement, A very small number of copies of Margaret Atwoods The Testaments were distributed early due to a retailer error which has now been rectified.

Independent booksellers, for whom the books debut would be perhaps this years most profitable event, were furious. The American Booksellers Association called for the appropriate federal agencies (to) thoroughly investigate Amazons destructive business practices.

A couple of days later, Amazon issued a vaguely worded apology, blaming the premature mailing on technical issues. On Tuesday, the official publication date, The Testaments topped its bestseller list, above new books by Dav Pilkey, Malcolm Gladwell, James Mattis and Stephen King, with The Handmaids Tale in the No. 7 spot.

Atwood, who will turn 80 on Nov. 18, had already ascended from longtime literary icon to pop-culture celebrity thanks to the recent explosion in interest in The Handmaids Tale, the best known of her 60 books. In April 2016, Hulu announced that an original series would be based on the book. A few months later, Donald Trump was elected president, setting off unprecedented political divisions in America. The climate made Atwoods misogynist dystopia more relevant.

The TV series, which released its third season this summer, has won large audiences, critical acclaim and 11 Emmy Awards. Atwood has praised it and even made a cameo as one of the Aunts, the fearsome enforcers of the fictional Gileads

subjugation of women. In a brief scene in the first season, she slapped main character Offred, played by Elisabeth Moss. (Hulu and the producers have already signed on to make another series based on The Testaments.)

Sales of The Handmaids Tale soared as Trump took office, taking it to the top ranks of bestseller lists for more than a year. It has now sold more than 8 million copies. Atwoods Gilead  formerly the United States, transformed by military takeover into a land ruled by religious zealots, where infertility is rampant and women are valued only for their ability to have babies  has entered pop culture, as familiar a metaphor as Star Wars. Watch video of a protest against laws restricting reproductive rights and the camera will find women dressed in the Handmaids striking scarlet costume and white bonnet, a symbol instantly understood.

Atwood could rest on her laurels and royalties, but, as you might expect from someone with her brilliant, restless intellect, she has more to say. In interviews she has explained that she wrote The Testaments in part to answer some of readers questions about Gilead and Offreds fate, and that in part she was inspired by the times were living in.

In an interview with the New York Times, she said, Im too old to be scared by much  even the risk of writing sequels.

In a way, theres already a sequel: the TV series. Only the first season of The Handmaids Tale is based directly on Atwoods novel; Seasons 2 and 3, and the upcoming 4, continue the story far beyond the moment when Atwood left Offred stepping into a van, her future unknown.

Although she makes a few nods to the series, Atwood lightly leaps over most of it, setting The Testaments 15 years later than The Handmaids Tale, both within Gilead and outside it.

The Handmaids Tale took place in the early days of Gilead, as its puritanical, fascist government took hold. Its told from Offreds point of view, the view of a shocked and traumatized prisoner.

In The Testaments, Gilead is long established and has become the new normal, accreting bureaucracy and fighting pointless wars. This book has three narrators, two young women and one old one, none of them a Handmaid, each narrating her own chapters. Their stories begin very separately, but Atwood will bring them together.

We meet Agnes in her childhood in Gilead, where she is the privileged daughter of one of the Commanders. In line with the nations color-coding of females, shes a schoolgirl wearing pink or plum, according to the season. School, however, does not involve reading, or writing, or arithmetic, all forbidden to women (except the Aunts). Training to become a Wife means lessons in docility and embroidering handkerchiefs. Later in the story, when map-reading becomes crucial, we discover that not only can Agnes not read a map, she has never seen one. (In Gilead, modern technology such as TV and computers exist, but their use is strictly limited to the powerful.)

Agnes isnt even allowed to learn to cook; thats the realm of the Marthas, and as a Wife she wont be dirtying her hands in the kitchen. And, like all good Gilead girls, or precious flowers, as theyre called, shes taught that sex is the dirtiest thing of all, enjoyed only by those sluts, the Handmaids.

At first, Agnes doesnt question Gileads strictures because she doesnt know anything else exists. But her beloved mother dies young, and Agnes ends up in the hands of a very wicked stepmother who arranges to marry her off, at the Gilead-appropriate age of 13, to another Commander. Agnes balks and ends up instead as a novice Aunt, along with her timid but loyal friend Becka.

They grow up looking forward to their required years as Pearl Girls, missionaries in silver dresses who travel in pairs to preach the gospel of Gilead to heathens in such foreign lands as Canada, California and the Republic of Texas. Once they bring back a convert (expectations are not high enough to require multitudes), theyll be full-fledged Aunts.

Pearl Girls choose new names, Atwood writes, from a list made by the original Aunts of approved names of products women had liked once and would be reassured by, so they select names like Aunt Dove, Aunt Immortelle and Aunt Victoria.

Daisy has a very different kind of childhood. Shes an eye-rolling, wisecracking teenager in Toronto, where her hippie parents run a used clothing store and collect vintage cameras. Daisy spends a lot of time at the store because her parents dont like to leave her on her own, although shes nearly 16.

The store is frequented largely by sketchy street people, many of whom her parents seem to know, and a steady stream of Pearl Girls, distributing brochures that often refer to Baby Nicole. Shes the great cause celebre of Gilead, ripped from her mothers arms during a border crossing and still missing years later. (In this world, its Canada that has a steady flood of undocumented immigrants across its southern border, and, being Canada, it takes them in.)

Daisy doesnt really know much about Gilead beyond what she has half-learned in her high school classes. When disaster strikes her family, she will learn more than she ever wanted to know.

And then theres the third narrator: Aunt Lydia. Yes, that Aunt Lydia. If you know either version of The Handmaids Tale, you know about Aunt Lydia, but theres even more you dont know.

She is the main character of The Testaments, just as ruthlessly terrifying as ever but much more complex. Atwood fills in her backstory, a harrowing tale of the brutal birth of Gilead. Lydia was a judge, having worked her way out of a childhood among trailer-park dwellers, sneerers at the police, consorters with the flip side of the criminal justice system to respectability and success.

When the coup occurs, she finds herself imprisoned in a stadium with thousands of other women: judges, lawyers, doctors, teachers. Theyre starved and held in abominable conditions, their only diversion watching the daily executions of 20 of their number. Lydia tells us, The opposition is led by the educated, so the educated are the first to be eliminated.

But she survives, and rises. By cunning and ferocity, she becomes one of the four Founding Aunts of Gileads womens sphere. She tells us all of this in her chapters, a secret manuscript she has hidden over the decades, written with a purloined pen and ink  even for Aunts, the use of such tools is strictly limited. (The chapters narrated by Agnes and Daisy are cast as oral testimony in some unnamed proceeding.)

Lydia gains and retains her power by recognizing early on the value of secrets. She becomes a kind of J. Edgar Hoover in a plain brown dress, buttering up Gileads leaders so she can learn their worst sins  and hoard that knowledge for future use.

Aunt Lydias secrets and their uses drive the plot, which accelerates as the lives of the three narrators intertwine. Atwood moves gracefully from dystopian world-building to character study to breathless adventure, her map unerring.

Like The Handmaids Tale, The Testaments ends with a chapter that takes place almost two centuries in the future, at an academic conference in Passamaquoddy (formerly Bangor), Maine. Its tone  light academic satire  reminds us that, in the long arc of history, the story of Gilead has been told a thousand times. It is terribly urgent to those who live it and a footnote in the history books.

All tyranny, Atwood shows us, contains the seeds of its own destruction. Internal feuding is a factor, of course; power is not only corrupting but endlessly temporary, never secure. Tyranny is founded on subjugating the other, a process that constantly consumes the tyrants attention, because the subjugated never entirely accept their fate. No matter what tyrants choose to judge others inferior  gender, race, religion or whatever other notional difference they dream up  they exhaust their time and resources enforcing those differences. And all the while, inside the walls, there are the unnamed sources, the takers of notes, the smiling masks  and the writers, old women with wry smiles and nothing left to fear, their pens poised to prick.

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The feminist dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985) gets a sequel at long last. Atwood says of the book, "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "'The Testaments' is worthy of the literary classic it continues."
2. "The Institute" by Stephen King (Scribner, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: Twelve-year-old genius Luke Ellis is whisked away in the middle of the night and taken to the Institute, where psychic kids are being held captive to save the world.
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "King leans into the theme of 'great events' happening with the smallest of decisions as well as the world-changing power of togetherness. And in that case, it's a frequent lesson he extols that never gets old."
3. "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" by James Poniewozik (Liveright, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The New York Times TV critic examines the history of television and American media to explain how Trump mastered the medium to win his base and become our 45th president.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base."
4. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power (Dey Street, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American diplomat and human rights advocate traces her journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official in a revealing memoir.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "Power's vibrant prose, exuberant storytelling, and deep insights into human nature make for a page-turning memoir."
5. "After the Flood" by Kassandra Montag (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: In this dystopian adventure novel set in a water-logged world altered by climate change, a mother embarks on a perilous voyage to rescue her kidnapped daughter.
The buzz: "Anchored by a complicated, compelling heroine, this gripping, speculative, high-seas adventure is impossible to put down," says Booklist.

Texto completo: President Trump said in a tweet Sunday that "Radical Left Democrats" and the "LameStream Media" are trying to slander Justice Brett Kavanaugh into "turning Liberal."
"Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment," Trump tweeted. "He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!"
Tweet
Trump's tweet follows a New York Times report that a former male classmate alleges that he saw Kavanaugh expose himself and place his genitals against a woman without her consent at Yale.
This allegation had previously not been released to the public but was made known to the FBI during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing last fall, according to the Times, which also said the the incident was not investigated by the FBI.
Kavanaugh was narrowly confirmed on a 50-48 vote after an intense confirmation process that featured emotional testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the justice's accusers of sexual misconduct.
The justice has denied all accusations of wrongdoing, and has maintained they are politically motivated. He refused to talk to the Times about the latest allegation on Saturday.
Trump also issued a follow-up tweet that Kavanaugh "should start suing people for liable" and that "the Justice Department should come to his rescue." He later deleted it and issued a tweet with "libel" spelled correctly.
"The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop?" Trump asked. "They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!"

Meritocracy is ripping America apart

Información de publicación: Bismarck Tribune ; Bismarck, ND [Bismarck, ND]. 15 Sep 2019: 6.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/meritocracy-is-ripping-america-apart/docview/2290266745/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: Ninguno disponible.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Meritocracy+is+ripping+America+apart&amp;author=&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=6&amp;date=2019-09-15&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=Bismarck+Tribune&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: There are at least two kinds of meritocracy in America right now. Exclusive meritocracy exists at the super-elite universities and at the industries that draw the bulk of their employees from them - Wall Street, Big Law, medicine and tech. And then there is the more open meritocracy that exists almost everywhere else.
In the exclusive meritocracy, prestige is defined by how many people you can reject. The elite universities reject 85% to 95% of their applicants. Those accepted spend much of their lives living in neighborhoods and attending conferences where it is phenomenally expensive or hard to get in. Whether it's the resort town you vacation in or the private school you send your kids to, exclusivity is the pervasive ethos. The more the exclusivity, the thicker will be the coating of PC progressivism to show that we're all good people.
People in this caste work phenomenally hard to build their wealth. As Daniel Markovits notes in his powerful new book, "The Meritocracy Trap," between 1979 and 2006, the percentage of workers in the top quintile of earners who work more than 50 hours a week nearly doubled.
People in this caste are super-skilled and productive. There are more than 70 law firms, Markovits notes, that generate more than $1 million in annual profit per partner. When Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1 billion, it had only 13 full-time employees.
A few years ago, people in this elite professional caste seized on research by Thomas Piketty, who argued that rising inequality is caused by the shift in income away from labor and toward capital. The investors are to blame! But, Markovits argues, roughly 75% of the increase in the top 1% of earnings is caused by shifts in income within labor. These highly educated professionals attract vast earnings while everybody else gets left behind. A cardiologist used to earn four times as much as a nurse; now it's seven times as much.
Parents in the exclusive meritocracy raise their kids to be fit fighters within it. Markovits calculates how much affluent parents invest on their kids' human capital, over and above what middle-class parents can afford to invest. He concludes that affluent parents invest $10 million more per child. The resulting highly honed, high-performing young people are amazing - and endure the stresses you'd expect. At the best law school in the country, Yale, 70% of the students say they experience mental health challenges.
You don't have to travel far to get outside the exclusive meritocracy. For example, last spring I spent a few days at Arizona State University, which is led by Michael Crow. ASU defines itself not by how many people it can exclude but by how many it can include. The need for higher education is greater than ever, so ASU has rapidly expanded to meet that need. Between 2013 and 2018, undergraduate enrollment rose by 45%. Between 2009 and 2018, the number of engineering students grew to 22,400 from about 6,400.
ASU has done it by increasing its reach into those who are underserved. The number of first-generation students has more than quadrupled since 2002.
Everything is on a mass scale. ASU's honors college alone is bigger than Stanford's entire undergraduate enrollment.
The quality has risen along with the size. Research expenditures double every six to eight years, and a number of academic departments are nationally recognized as among the best for the quality of their research.
The atmosphere is much more democratic and accessible to all. Faculty members are treated less as scholars within rarefied disciplines and more as interdisciplinary intellectual entrepreneurs. The goal is immediate social impact as much as expanding knowledge, so, for example, ASU's Watts College of Public Service & Community Solutions is enmeshed with local residents to transform a Phoenix neighborhood.
Starbucks pays for eligible employees to attend ASU online. Many of the graduates I met had dropped out of three or four colleges before finally being able to get a degree at ASU. It's an open place, where they can move up.
Similarly, last week I was in Wichita to observe the Kansas Leadership Center. The center teaches people how to create social change and hopes to saturate the state with better leaders. But the center doesn't focus on traditional "leaders." Its mantra is: "Leadership is an activity, not a position. Anyone can lead, anytime, anywhere." The atmosphere is one of radical inclusion. The enrollees I met included business leaders, teachers, line workers and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The center equips people at every level of society with organizational skills - for example, to understand when it is necessary to turn up the heat to force change, and when it is necessary to turn down the heat to encourage reconciliation.
People in both the exclusive and open meritocracies focus intensely on increasing skills. But it's jarring to move from one culture to the other because the values are so different. The exclusive meritocracy is spinning out of control. If the country doesn't radically expand its institutions and open access to its bounty, the U.S. will continue to rip apart.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Democratic presidential candidates want Kavanaugh impeached after newly surfaced sexual misconduct accusation

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The report of a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has sparked fury among figures on both the left and right.
In a Sunday morning tweet, President Donald Trump accused the "LameStream Media" and Democrats of colluding to scare Kavanaugh "into turning Liberal. "
And on the left, Democratic presidential candidates former HUD Secretary Julián Castro, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California called for Kavanaugh's impeachment.
"Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him," Warren wrote on Twitter. "Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached. "
Fellow presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , said he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold [Kavanaugh] accountable. "
Sanders, Warren, and Harris voted against Kavanaugh's confirmation in October 2018.
Kavanaugh was confirmed by a 50-48 Senate vote last October after a bitter nomination process. Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while they were high school students in the 1980s, but Kavanaugh denied the claim during the confirmation hearing.
A New York Times essay published Saturday evening and adapted from the upcoming book "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation" featured new information that two reporters said corroborated a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh and uncovered evidence supporting a previously unreported claim.
Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, alleged during his confirmation process that he had exposed himself to her in college. Her account received less attention than Ford's at the time though, as Ford had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"During his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been 'the talk of campus. ' Our reporting suggests that it was," wrote New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly.
The reporters said at least seven people they interviewed had heard about the incident –including the accuser's mother.
Despite the presence of these witnesses, Pogrebin and Kelly say, the FBI "interviewed none of them, though we learned many of these potential witnesses tried in vain to reach the F. B. I. on their own. "

Pogrebin and Kelly say they also uncovered another incident of sexual misconduct in which another one of Kavanaugh's classmates "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. "
The classmate, Max Stier, flagged the report to the FBI, but the agency declined to investigate the incident, The Times reported.
Brian Fallon, executive director of progressive judicial group Demand Justice, pitched a question about Kavanaugh's impeachment as a question for the next Democratic debate.
"Here is a good question for the next Democratic debate: Do you support impeaching Brett Kavanaugh?" he wrote on Twitter.
Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican Party, slammed the report. "The New York Times should be ashamed of this smear on Justice Kavanaugh," she said, citing a tweet from Federalist Senior Editor Mollie Hemingway claiming the reporting in Pogrebin and Kelly's book undercut the reporting in their essay.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has made increasing the number of conservative justices a major political goal, pledged his support to Kavanaugh.
"Fortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence. I look forward to many years of service to come from Justice Kavanaugh," he wrote on Twitter.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on ABC's "This Week," "I think that follows up with the rather shameful circus we saw during the confirmation hearing," adding that calls for Kavanaugh's impeachment were "another sign of how nasty and divided the time is. "
Later Sunday, Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh should "start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. "
Only one Supreme Court Justice has ever been impeached.
According to the Federal Judicial Center, the federal courts' educational and research center, Associate Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase was impeached in 1804 "on charges of arbitrary and oppressive conduct of trials," but he was acquitted by the U. S. Senate a year later.

Texto completo: The golden loo is gone.
A solid 18-karat gold toilet, titled "America" by its creator, Maurizio Cattelan, was stolen early Saturday from an exhibit at Blenheim Palace, the Oxfordshire birthplace and family home of Winston Churchill.
The toilet was part of a larger exhibit featuring Mr. Cattelan's work that began on Thursday.
As befits someone who would make a toilet out of gold, Mr. Cattelan's response to the theft was a bit, um, cheeky.
"At first, when they woke me up this morning with the news," he said in an email to The New York Times, "I thought it was a prank: Who's so stupid to steal a toilet? I had forgotten for a second that it was made out of gold."
He said of the work: "'America' was the one percent for the 99 percent, and I hope it still is. I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action."
Mr. Cattelan said the theft was not part of a prank, à la Banksy shredding his own art at auction.
"I wish it was a prank," he said, adding that the story "is deadly serious if even a little bit surreal since the subject of the robbery was a toilet."
The police said in a statement that they were investigating the burglary and that a 66-year-old man had been arrested but not charged. The toilet has not been recovered.
Jess Milne, a detective inspector, noted that the toilet had been plumbed to the building, so the theft "caused significant damage and flooding." He said the police believed a "group of offenders" using at least two vehicles was behind the theft.
Pure gold is currently valued at nearly $ 1,500 per troy ounce, and 18-karat gold is 75 percent pure, said Peter Pienta, an accredited precious metals dealer in Wakefield, Mass., who has been buying and selling gold for nearly 50 years.
Mr. Cattelan said the piece was made of 103 kilograms of gold, which would make the toilet worth more than $ 4 million if it were melted down, according to Mr. Pienta's calculation.
"That is a very, very valuable toilet," Mr. Pienta said. "If they had a refinery or gold smelting equipment ready, it could be melted into gold bars in days and there would be no way to trace them. They could really go into any place that would buy a bullion."
Dominic Hare, the chief executive of Blenheim Palace, said he hoped the art piece would be recovered.
"It is deeply ironic that a work of art portraying the American dream and the idea of an elite object made available to all should be almost instantly snatched away and hidden from view," he said.
The toilet was installed in September 2016 at the Guggenheim in New York City, where it was an instant Instagram splash.
Nancy Spector, the Guggenheim's artistic director and chief curator, wrote on the museum's website in 2017 that "more than 100,000 people have waited patiently in line for the opportunity to commune with art and with nature."
The artwork is based on a common Kohler toilet and was created by a foundry in Florence. The work's value was not disclosed, but Ms. Spector described it as "millions of dollars' worth of gold."
The Manhattan museum declined to comment on Saturday.
Mr. Cattelan said the work had been sent back to the manufacturer to be cleaned and polished after being exhibited at the Guggenheim. "It definitely needed some restoration and rest, too," he said.
He had helped set up the new exhibition, he said, and was probably the last one to use the toilet.
"I promise I have an alibi for the night."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Purdue settles opioid lawsuits

Texto completo: CASPER – Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin and the public face of the national opioid epidemic that has contributed to tens of thousands of deaths, has reached a $3 billion settlement agreement with thousands of cities, counties, tribes and other entities across the country, including several in Wyoming.
The agreement was reached Wednesday morning between attorneys and the company, said Jason Ochs, a Jackson-based attorney who represents several Wyoming cities and counties suing Purdue and other companies tied to opioid production and distribution. Under the terms of the deal, Purdue will pay $3 billion over the course of seven years and will declare bankruptcy.
A new company will be created and will continue to sell OxyContin, the powerful opioid painkiller that was the crown jewel of Purdue’s multibillion-dollar business. But any profits that come from the sale of the pill will be added to the settlement amount, Ochs said.
The New York Times reported earlier Wednesday that there had been a settlement and that the Sackler family – the patriarchs of which founded Purdue and made it into a machine that marketed and sold opioids – would pay the $3 billion settlement. Ochs said he hadn’t heard the two – Purdue and Sacklers – distinguished and that he was considering them one and the same.
Ochs represents the cities of Casper, Cheyenne, Riverton and Rock Springs, as well as Carbon County. Sweetwater County, the city of Green River, and the Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes have also filed federal lawsuits against Purdue and the other pharmaceutical companies. Messages left for their attorneys were not immediately returned Wednesday, but it’s almost certain those cases have settled as well.
“It’s important because (Purdue’s) the first of many defendants to fall,” Ochs said. “And most importantly because it preserves cash for help in this epidemic, which, a bankruptcy would have likely been disastrous.”
While the cases had all been filed in Wyoming federal court initially, they were later moved to a federal court in Ohio for collective workup. The settlement comes as Purdue worked to avoid the first of those cases going to trial later this year.
The settlement effectively ends Purdue Pharma as it existed for decades. The company most known for its opioids will be felled by lawsuits alleging that it knowingly mismarketed opioids and, lawyers argued, sparked an epidemic that contributed to the deaths of more than 47,600 people in 2017 alone. Purdue – and the Sackler family – became the public face of the epidemic, which has rivaled the AIDS crisis in its body count. They were a company and a family that, critics said, placed profits over the safety of the American public.
The state of Wyoming has also filed a lawsuit against Purdue, albeit in state court. It’s unclear if that lawsuit has also been settled. The Laramie County District Court clerk’s office told the Star-Tribune that there had been no new filings in the case. State Attorney General Bridget Hill said in an email to the Star-Tribune that the case “is currently still pending” and that she couldn’t comment.
It’s unclear how much each entity in the lawsuits will receive as part of the settlement. Ochs said the court will have to approve a “matrix” to determine that, and factors like population, deaths related to opioids, and how many pills were distributed in that municipality or county will all be taken into account.
It’s also unclear if there will be strings attached to how the money is spent. Ochs said it will be “earmarked for helping and curbing the epidemic.”
The settlement doesn’t end the cases. The litigation continues against more than a dozen defendants, including Walmart, Walgreens and the maker of fentanyl, among others. Ochs said he suspected the Purdue settlement would probably prompt similar endings from the other companies.
“However, whether they will be global, meaning everybody, or just the Ohio counties that are pending in front of the court for trial, that is unknown at this time,” he said.
Earlier this year, Purdue settled a lawsuit in Oklahoma for $270 million. Johnson & Johnson, another defendant in the lawsuits, did not settle and instead took Oklahoma to trial, where the company lost and was ordered to pay more than $500 million by a judge there.
Ochs said he thought the Oklahoma judgment played a role in Purdue’s decision to settle. He said the Ohio counties that were set to go to trial represented an even bigger risk to Purdue and others than the entire state of Oklahoma.

GOOGLE AGREES TO ALLOW WORKERS TO TALK ABOUT WAGES, DIVERSITY

Texto completo: In a settlement with federal authorities, Google has agreed to let employees speak publicly and with each other on certain topics, according to new reports.
Under the terms of the settlement, which followed a National Labor Relations Board charge against Google, the Mountain View digital-advertising behemoth must "inform current employees that they are free to speak to the media without having to ask Google higher-ups for permission on topics such as workplace diversity and compensation, regardless of whether Google views such topics as inappropriate for the workplace," the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The agreement is to go into effect after an appeals period, the paper reported.
Google must actively notify workers that it has scrapped rules barring them from sharing certain information with each other or the media, according to the Journal, but the settlement with the National Labor Relations Board doesn't detail what, exactly, was prohibited under those rules.
The settlement reportedly does not include any acknowledgement of wrongdoing by Google. A company spokeswoman told the New York Times that under the settlement, it will post a notice to employees reminding them of their rights under the National Labor Relations Act.
"As a part of that notice, we will also remind employees of the changes we made to our workplace policies back in 2016 and 2017 that clarified those policies do not prevent employees from discussing workplace issues," the spokeswoman said.
The labor relations board took action in response to two complaints by Google employees against their employer, according to the Journal.
In August, after multiple public controversies over Google's actions toward dissenting employees which started with the firing of engineer James Damore over an internal post suggesting women were not as suited for tech jobs as men, and continued with allegations that the firm punished organizers of a walkout triggered by Google's responses to sexual misconduct claims the company issued new rules for internal discussions.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent an email to employees about the new guidelines, according to Recode. "While sharing information and ideas with colleagues helps build community, disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story does not," the guidelines said, according to the tech website. Employees, the guidelines said, shouldn't "spend working time on debates about non-work topics."

Texto completo: The United States men's basketball team is assured of finishing no better than seventh at the World Cup, its worst tournament showing in program history, after falling to Serbia, 94-89, in a consolation game Thursday night in Dongguan, China. The previous worst finish for a US men's team in major tournament appearances was sixth at the 2002 world championships. The Americans — the top-ranked team in the world — will be seventh or eighth in China, depending on the outcome of their consolation finale against Poland on Saturday. Harrison Barnes scored 22 for the US, which got 18 from the Celtics' Kemba Walker and 16 from Khris Middleton . . . Connecticut Sun center Jonquel Jones and guard Jasmine Thomas were named to the WNBA All-Defensive first team. Sun forward Alyssa Thomas was named to the second team.
Horse racing
Baffert denies doping Justify
Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert denied giving 2018 Triple Crown winning horse Justify a banned substance that caused a positive test prior to last year's Kentucky Derby and blamed the result on contaminated food. Baffert said in a statement that he "unequivocally" rejects the implication he'd give Justify or any other horse Scopolamine, which the colt tested positive for in April 2018. The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for the substance after winning the Santa Anita Derby and that the California Horse Racing Board did not adequately investigate the matter. Justify was allowed to run in the Kentucky Derby a month later.
3 horses dead at Belmont
Three horses died during the first two days of Belmont Park's fall season, mirroring the start and end of the summer meet at Saratoga Race Course in which 11 horses died during training or non-racing activities and four died during races. According to the New York State Gaming Commission's equine database, two horses died last Friday, opening day. Royal Inheritance collapsed and died during training, and Passporttovictory was euthanized after being removed from a race. Both were trained by Jeremiah Englehart . Mo Moxie was put down Saturday by a veterinarian after the horse flipped while jogging and fractured a leg on the training track.
Baseball
Surgery ends Ohtani's season
Shohei Ohtani will miss the rest of the Los Angeles Angels' season to have surgery on his left kneecap. Los Angeles has been eliminated from playoff contention with 15 games left. Ohtani will need 8-12 weeks to recover from surgery on a bipartite patella, or a two-part kneecap, according to the Angels . . . Yankees designated hitter Edwin Encarnación left in the fifth inning with a strained left oblique muscle in New York's 10-4 win against the Tigers in Detroit in a doubleheader opener. Starter J.A. Happ was taken out in the fifth inning, bothered by left biceps tendinitis, manager Aaron Boone said. Yankees catcher Gary Sánchez left the second game of the doubleheader in the third inning because of left groin tightness. All three were sent back to New York for further testing. The Yankees won the nightcap, 6-4 . . . MRI results on Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner's left ankle revealed a mild sprain. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Turner's status for the weekend series against the wild-card contending New York Mets won't be decided until closer to game time Friday, according to ESPN.
Man arraigned for killings
The Virginia man who police say killed the wife, son and mother-in-law of minor league baseball pitcher Blake Bivens was formally arraigned. Officials with the Pittsylvania Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court said that Matthew Bernard , Bivens's brother-in-law, was arraigned on three counts of first-degree murder and weapons-related charges. The 18-year-old is being held in jail without bail. Authorities say Bernard killed his sister, Emily Marie Bivens , Blake Bivens's wife, the couple's 1-year-old son, Cullen , and his mother, Joan Bernard , in late August.

No bigger question confronts the Washington Capitals at the start of training camp than the uncertain status of center Evgeny Kuznetsov , who tested positive for cocaine at the world championships. Kuznetsov has already been suspended from international play for four years and could face further discipline from the NHL. Kuznetsov voluntarily entered the NHL/NHLPA Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program and met with Commissioner Gary Bettman on Monday. The team did not make Kuznetsov available to reporters like other players on media day because the NHL has not decided whether to levy further punishment . . . Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Shea Theodore told the Players' Tribune that he underwent surgery for testicular cancer during the offseason and is expected to make a full recovery.

Clijsters planning comeback
Seven years after retiring from tennis a second time, Kim Clijsters is attempting another comeback at age 36. The former No. 1 and four-time major champion, who already is a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, announced she is planning to return to the pro tour in 2020, although she's not yet ready to say exactly when or where or how often she will compete . . . In the PGA 2020 season opener, Robby Shelton shot an 8-under-par 62 to take a two-stroke lead after the first round of A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. . . . Callum Shinkwin had five birdies and an eagle on his way to a 6-under 66 and a one-shot lead after the first round of the KLM Open in Amsterdam . . . In the NHL, Vegas Golden Knights defenseman Shea Theodore told the Players' Tribune that he underwent surgery for testicular cancer during the offseason and is expected to make a full recovery.
. . . New Jersey financial adviser Munish Sood was praised for his cooperation and a federal judge in New York spared him from prison after he admitted his role in a college basketball scandal. Sood was fined $25,000 but was not sentenced to prison or forced to be supervised by probation authorities. US District Judge Kimba M. Wood said she'll rule on restitution at a later point . . . FIFA banned former soccer official Juan Ángel Napout for life, almost 21 months after he was convicted on racketeering and corruption charges in a Brooklyn court. FIFA says its ethics committee judges found Napout guilty of bribery between 2012 and 2015, and fined him 1 million Swiss francs ($1.01 million). It is unclear how FIFA can enforce payment . . . Primoz Roglic took a step closer to winning the Spanish Vuelta cycling race with a strong second-place finish on the 18th stage, increasing his overall lead entering the final stretch of the three-week race.

Texto completo: After weeks of reporting, a journalist breaks a story. Moments after it goes online, another media organization posts an imitative article recycling the scoop that often grabs as much web traffic as the original.
Publishers have complained about this dynamic for years, ever since the explosion in digital news obliterated the daylong exclusive enjoyed in the print era. On Thursday, Google said that it had made changes to its search algorithm to give an advantage to "original reporting" that would be reinforced by changes in other guidelines.
In a blog post, Richard Gingras, Google's vice president of news, said the changes to the company's search guidelines would help it to "better recognize original reporting" and make it more visible on the internet.
"This means readers interested in the latest news can find the story that started it all," Mr. Gingras wrote, "and publishers can benefit from having their original reporting more widely seen."
In a phone interview on Thursday, Mr. Gingras acknowledged that the shift was in Google's own interest. "We do everything here with Google Search and Google News to continue to earn and retain the trust of our users," he said.
Google and other major tech platforms have lately come under scrutiny -- and federal antitrust investigations -- in part because of their influence over the digital news industry. Google, Facebook and Amazon reap most of the available online advertising revenue.
The News Media Alliance, a trade group, has been sharply critical of the tech companies and has lobbied lawmakers for a limited antitrust exemption that would enable outlets to bargain collectively with the platforms.
In turn, several platforms have signaled a willingness to work with publishers. Facebook has pitched an initiative to license articles from major publishers and display them in a "News" tab. The Apple News app has made deals with some media companies, including Condé Nast, to highlight their articles and split revenue.
David Chavern, the News Media Alliance chief executive, welcomed Google's announcement but cautioned that he had to wait to see how the changes were carried out.
"Google search results have not rewarded investments in journalism," Mr. Chavern said in a phone interview Thursday. "If we can get to a place where they do better, that's good."
Google seemed to acknowledge with Thursday's changes that publications that dig up new information could use some help from the platforms.
"Some stories can also be both critically important in the impact they can have on our world and difficult to put together, requiring reporters to engage in deep investigative efforts to dig up facts and sources," Mr. Gingras said in the post. "These are among the reasons why we aim to support these industry efforts."
The guidelines from Google would also elevate outlets known for a history of accurate reporting, considering metrics like how many journalism awards a publication has won.
Several tech platforms, including the Google-owned YouTube, have been criticized for seeming to promote sensational content with no basis in fact. Soon after the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., for instance, the No. 1 trending video on YouTube tapped into false theories that the survivors of the shooting were "crisis actors."
That kind of inflammatory content may attract views in the short run while damaging the reputation of any company that makes it widely available.
The three examples of hard-news articles Mr. Gingras noted in his post were published by large outlets: the Süddeutsche Zeitung in Munich, The Washington Post and The New York Times. It was unclear what the algorithm change would mean for publications in small and midsize cities that have struggled in recent years while trying to transition from print to digital.
Google, Mr. Gingras said, is putting "increased effort into, How do we do right by local outlets?" He cited reporting on natural disasters as the type of local coverage that could benefit from the changes.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Police officers can often justify a search with six words: "I smelled an odor of marijuana."
Courts in New York have long ruled if a car smells like marijuana smoke, the police can search it -- and, according to some judges, even the occupants -- without a warrant.
But in late July, a judge in the Bronx said in a scathing opinion that officers claim to smell marijuana so often that it strains credulity, and she called on judges across the state to stop letting police officers get away with lying about it.
"The time has come to reject the canard of marijuana emanating from nearly every vehicle subject to a traffic stop," Judge April Newbauer wrote in a decision in a case involving a gun the police discovered in car they had searched after claiming to have smelled marijuana.
She added, "So ubiquitous has police testimony about odors from cars become that it should be subject to a heightened level of scrutiny if it is to supply the grounds for a search."
It is exceedingly rare for a New York City judge to accuse police officers of routinely lying to cover up illegal searches, but Judge Newbauer's decision does exactly that. Her decision also shows how marijuana's status as contraband remains deeply embedded in the criminal justice system, even as the police and prosecutors have begun to wind down arrests and prosecutions for marijuana.
At the height of the stop-and-frisk era, nearly a decade ago, the police were arresting some 50,000 New Yorkers a year for low-level marijuana offenses, more than 85 percent of whom were black or Hispanic. The arrests have since plummeted, but the presence of a marijuana odor -- real or purported -- still serves as a justification to detain people and search them, sometimes leading to the discovery of more serious contraband, including guns, police officers and lawyers say.
One woman who served on a grand jury in Brooklyn late last year recalled hearing officers in three separate cases claim to have "detected a strong odor of marijuana" and use it as justification for a stop or a search.
"They said it very formulaically," the woman, Batya Ungar-Sargon, who is the opinion editor at The Forward, recalled.
Such testimony can be the final word on whether a search was lawful or unconstitutional, especially in New York. Some other states have more stringent rules. North Carolina, for instance, does not allow the smell of pot to justify a search of the occupants of the vehicle.
In 2016, a federal judge in Rochester concluded that the rule in New York was unconstitutional and that New York judges had been wrong to allow such searches. But that decision has had little bearing in New York City.
Lawmakers in Albany considered intervening this year: A marijuana legalization bill under debate specifically forbade officers from relying on the "odor of cannabis" for some searches. The bill did not pass. Instead, lawmakers opted to reduce the penalties for possessing or smoking marijuana.
Car stops have become an increasingly important part of the New York City department's patrol strategy ever since political pressure began forcing the department to back away from stopping and frisking black and Hispanic men in large numbers, police officers say.
Looser enforcement and more lenient penalties have made the open use of marijuana -- along with its unmistakable, pungent scent -- more common on city streets and elsewhere.
Still, several officers said in interviews that they had doubts their colleagues consistently told the truth about what they had smelled. "Certain cops will say there is odor of marijuana, and when I get to the scene, I immediately don't smell anything," one Bronx officer, Pedro Serrano, said in a 2018 article in The New York Times. "I can't tell you what you smelled, but it's obvious to me there is no smell of marijuana."
In an interview last month, Officer Serrano said he still believed that to be the case. Officer Serrano, who currently works a desk job and is not out on patrol, is one of several current and former officers suing the Police Department over what they describe as arrest quotas.
A Manhattan detective, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the department, said it would be very difficult to prove what an officer did or did not smell.
But the detective said he had come to believe that some officers, particularly in plainclothes units, lied about having smelled marijuana because of how frequently he heard it used as justification for a search.
In recent years, at least five other judges have concluded in individual cases that officers likely lied about smelling marijuana to justify searches that turned up an unlicensed firearm, according to court documents. These judges came to doubt the police testimony for a range of reasons, such as discrepancies within an officer's account or among officers, according to a review of the five decisions.
These judges have generally questioned only the credibility of individual officers in individual cases. Judge Newbauer's claim was much broader: that there is widespread lying.
A Police Department spokesman, Al Baker, rejected that assertion as untrue. He noted that marijuana "gives off a distinctive and pervasive odor."
"We recognize that judges arrive at their decisions with their own sets of values and insights informed by life experiences," Mr. Baker said in a statement. "Nonetheless, we categorically reject the judge's baseless assertion in this case and refute her sweeping assertion that police officers routinely fabricate that the odor of marijuana is present in every vehicle they stop."
The case that led Judge Newbauer -- who was a Legal Aid Society lawyer before ascending to the bench -- to make this claim involved a car stop in the Bronx on March 24, 2017. A plainclothes officer, Daniel Nunez, testified that "he noticed a strong odor of burning marijuana" while approaching the vehicle, according to the decision. Officer Nunez testified that he observed three small bags of marijuana perched atop the center console -- which the police photographed, according to the decision.
While searching the trunk, Officer Nunez discovered a gun.
Judge Newbauer concluded that Officer Nunez's account was riddled with falsehoods. She decided the photograph of the bags of marijuana neatly arranged was likely staged. She noted that one of the two defendants, Jesse Hill, had testified that the marijuana had been discovered when officers searched the pockets of the other man who had been in the car with him.
Gaynor Cunningham, a Legal Aid lawyer who represented Mr. Hill's co-defendant, said the ruling "recognizes an all-too-common practice of dishonesty that police officers employ to circumvent the law to manufacture a 'legal search."'
Mr. Baker, the Police Department spokesman, said Officer Nunez had acted lawfully.
Barry Kamins, a former New York City judge and an authority on search and seizure law in New York, said Judge Newbauer was "the first judge to really express an opinion about this type of scenario." He said the opinion brought to mind a court decision from 1970, in which a judge accused New York City police officers of lying in a similar fashion.
That case dealt with "dropsy" testimony, in which officers testified they had seen the defendant throw down a small bag of drugs in an attempt to ditch the evidence as the police approached.
Such testimony spiked after a landmark Supreme Court decision required courts to suppress evidence gained from an illegal search. Officers no doubt did catch people trying to discard evidence. But there was widespread suspicion that officers sometimes made up "dropsy" testimony rather than admit they had searched someone unlawfully.
Yet even though officers were likely lying at least some of the time, it was all but impossible to figure out if they were lying "in any particular case," one judge, Irving Younger, wrote in the 1970 opinion.
"Our refusal to face up to the 'dropsy' problem soils the rectitude of the administration of justice," he concluded.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
TOP BOY Stream on Netflix. Over two seasons released toward the beginning of the decade, "Top Boy" established itself as a very English, very gritty example of modern crime drama. Set in the Hackney borough of London, the show counted among its ensemble a pair of rapper-actors (Kane Robinson, who performs as Kano, and Ashley Walters). They played Sully and Dushane, two drug dealers whose rise over the course of the two seasons led to rivalry. Their stories halted after the show's network, Channel 4, canceled it. Five years later, it has been revived by Netflix -- thanks in large part to the involvement of Drake, a fan of the show and an executive producer of its third season. The story resumes with Dushane (Walters) returning from exile in Jamaica to go into business with Sully (Robinson), who gets released from prison after a long sentence. Much of the drama centers on their conflict with Jamie (Micheal Ward), a young gang leader who has little interest in allowing the relative old-timers to resume business.
UNDONE Stream on Amazon. The process of bringing this difficult-to-categorize, animated series to life involved rotoscoping, a technique in which artists trace over film footage. "We started playing with conceptions of reality and asking what it would mean if reality were more flexible than we traditionally perceive it to be," Raphael Bob-Waksberg, one of the series's creators, recently told The New York Times. (Bob-Waksberg is also the creator of "Bojack Horseman.") The surreal imagery they produced fits naturally with this show's plot: It tells the story of Alma (Rosa Salazar), a 28-year-old whose ho-hum day-to-day routine is interrupted by a car accident that leaves her with the ability to communicate with her dead father (Bob Odenkirk) and alters her relationship with time. "It's reality and it's not reality, a grounded, naturalistic story that now and then slips its tether like a helium balloon and drifts into a half-dream state," James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The Times. "It is magnificent art," he added, "a world opulently realized from its oil-painted backgrounds to its sound design."
What's on TV
AMERICAN MASTERS: RAUL JULIA -- THE WORLD'S A STAGE 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). By the time of his death in 1994, the actor Raul Julia had become famous both for performing on and Off Broadway and for his later film roles, which included the role of Gomez in "The Addams Family" (1994). This documentary revisits his life and career through archival footage and interviews with figures including his fellow "Addams Family" star Anjelica Huston, the Public Theater artistic director Oskar Eustis and James Earl Jones, whom Julia once starred opposite in a production of "King Lear" in Central Park.
ROOM 104 11 p.m. on HBO. The brothers Jay and Mark Duplass are behind this chameleonic anthology series, which kicks off its third season on Friday. Sometimes horrifying, sometimes funny, the show's stories take place in many different time periods, and all revolve around a single room at an American motel. The third season involves an exotic animal and the reunion of a pair of estranged siblings.

Texto completo: BARI WEISS, AT 35, is a columnist at The New York Times and a veteran of the last decade-plus of American Jewish discourse.
As an undergrad at Columbia University, the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, native co-founded Columbians for Academic Freedom, which charged faculty with intimidating Zionist students; from there, she pronounced on Israel, the relationship between American Jews and liberalism and more from Tablet and The Wall Street Journal before she was hired by the Times.
Weiss' new book, her first, is called How to Fight Anti-Semitism, and is available this week. Weiss taxonomizes the different strains of anti-Semitism at home and around the globe, and gives some suggestions on how it might be effectively countered. She spoke about Tree of Life, the Diaspora, the Amalek and more.
Why did you write this book?
I was supposed to write another book, and I'm on contract to write that book when I'm done promoting this one. But on the morning of Oct. 27,1 was in Phoenix, Arizona, where I was supposed to give a speech the next day when I got a text in our family chat from my youngest sister saying, "There's a shooter at Tree of Life."
Tree of Life is the synagogue where I became a Bat Mitzvah in 1997, in Squirrel Hill, the neighborhood where I grew up. Mister Rogers happened to grow up down the street.
And it's a place where my dad sometimes goes on Shabbat morning. Thank God he wasn't there, but 11 of our neighbors were, many of them he knew and some of them I did. I was supposed to go to Israel that week to go report on a story; I ended up flying home to Pittsburgh just to bear witness to what this white supremacist had done to my community, and sort of witness the reaction to it.
My Jewish identity is fundamental to who I am. It's something I've always been very engaged with. But this sort of took it to a different level, and in the weeks and months following the massacre, I just found myself drawn back and back again to this topic, and it really felt like something I absolutely had to write about.
You make the case that the Pittsburgh shooting was an era-defining event for the JewishcommunityinAmerica. The negative consequences of that are manifestly obvious. But what opportunities do you see, post-Pittsburgh, for American Jews?
It's not as if there weren't attacks before - I outline them extensively in my book - but nothing was reaJy at this level, and then when Poway happened six months later, i: was just, like, wow, this is mom than a oneoff, this rising tide of hatred.
Agrande esta imagen.

The positive th ing that came out of it is that at first glance, what happened in Pittsburgh was another pogrom. The difference historically :s that, typically, the surrounding community and the authorities abetted in the attack, or stood by and watched the attack happem
The opposite happened in Pittsburgh. There was just an absolute outpouring of solidarity, and a real visceral sense from our neighbors that an attack on the Jewish community was an attack on them, too. And coming forward to defend us and stand by our side wasn't, like, a favor. It was them standing up to defend their values and their right to live full and unashamed lives.
The day after the attack, at Soldiers & Sailors, a big civic center in Pitrsburgh, there was an interfaith service. And at that interfaith service - hundreds of people - the mourner's Kaddish was recited in Hebrew. And the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which is our paper, printed the words of the Kaddish in Hebrew on the front page. When you think about that in the span of Jewish history, it's just an absolutely remarkable thing that that happened. And that gives me a tremendous amount of hope that people really understand that rising anti-Semitism - the most obvious victims are the Jews. But the other victim, the one that we forget about, is everyone else.
Agrande esta imagen.

Because in a society where anti-Semitism is sort of out in the open, it is the signifier that the society is dead or dying. And the desire to fight anti-Semitism comes from anyone that understands that fact about history, and a deep desire to make sure that America doesn't succumb.
In the book, you put Robert Bowers, the Pittsburgh shooter, and the Amalek on a continuum. What made you do that? I'm thinking about that especially in the context of what you describe as the genteel anti-Semitism of midcentury WASPs as not being of an eliminationist character, but more, "Well, I hope my daughter doesn't marry a Jewish person."
That's kind of the distinction between what I think of as anti-Jewish prejudice and anti-Semitism, which is an eliminationist conspiracy theory. But obviously, like, people who say, "We don't want Jews to join our country club," "we don't Jews to move next door," "we're going to deny this Jew partner in our law firm," was totally a normal thing a generation or two ago.
Those things are all horrible, and they're vile and they're wrong. But they don't suggest that Jews are the secret hand controlling the world. And that's something that's just much more essentially dangerous to us.
The reason that I want to connect Amalek and Robert Bowers, in the same way that I want to connect, I don't know, the conversos of Spain in the 1400s to the conversion out of Judaism that people had to enact in the Soviet Union, is just to show that the things that we're experiencing are not (just) now. I think that maybe we've been lulled into complacency a little bit. I feel like I've been on a holiday from history for most of my life as an American Jew. And I think it's important for people to understand, as disorienting and scary as this moment can feel, that we've been here, many, many times before. That could maybe feel despairing, but to me it's very comforting, actually, to know that this is part of the chain of our history, and there are lessons to be learned.
Bari Weiss will be the keynote speaker at the Main Event, the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia's biggest night of the year. Register at jewishphilly.org/mainevent. *

Horse racing needs another controversy like Dodgers fans need a third World Series disappointment, yet here we are again. Less than two weeks removed from a historic Del Mar meet in terms of safety that helped restore some sanity in California, the sport is left with yet another black eye.
Why?
Because factions like the California Horse Racing Board, the Stronach Group and others can’t seem to grasp the concept that transparency is the only way to go. Deals and decisions made behind closed doors, whether right or wrong, oftentimes blow up in the decision makers’ faces. This is one of those instances.
Here’s what we know about the Justify saga:
— The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for a drug called scopolamine one day after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 6. The story alleges the CHRB did not inform trainer Bob Baffert of the positive test until nine days before the Kentucky Derby. A second test on May 1, at the request of Baffert, also came up positive.
— Joe Drape, who wrote the Times article, said the CHRB let the matter drag on until after Justify swept the Triple Crown. He reported the CHRB did not file a public complaint per usual protocol and instead made a series of decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case in its entirety after the Belmont Stakes on June 8. Later, the CHRB amended its rules on scopolamine positives.
— On Thursday, Churchill Downs tweeted that “until media reports surfaced Wednesday night, neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby.”
— Churchill Downs maintained “we do know that all pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.” The race track also noted, “in advance of our race each year, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission conducts pre-race out-of-competition testing for every Kentucky Derby starter and all starters’ results were clean.” It added that all post-race tests for “a myriad of banned substances” were clean.
— Baffert, in a statement Thursday, claimed he had no influence on any decisions made by the CHRB, saying, “I unequivocally reject any implication that scopolamine was ever intentionally administered to Justify, or any of my horses. Test results indicating trace amounts of the drug were undoubtedly the result of environmental contamination caused by the presence of jimson weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California.” Baffert added: “Justify is one of the finest horses I’ve had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time. I am proud to stand by his record, and my own.”
— Baffert’s lawyer, Kentucky-based Craig Robertson III, called Drape’s reporting “defamatory.” He also said in a letter addressed to Drape that his article was “long on sensationalism” and “short on facts.” Robertson said: “No trainer would ever intentionally administer scopolamine to a horse. It has a depressant effect and would do anything but enhance the performance of a horse.”
— Chuck Winner, whose five-year reign as chairman of the CHRB expired recently, released this comment Thursday afternoon: “It is most unfortunate that the correct decision by the CHRB to not pursue action due to what was clearly a case of environmental contamination has been badly mischaracterized. All possible tests and procedures and investigations were followed by the CHRB Equine Medical Director and senior staff, which led to the overwhelming evidence that Justify, along with six other horses in four different barns at Santa Anita, ingested scopolamine from jimson weed which was present in the hay that had been delivered to the barns. Furthermore, under ARCI guidelines, scopolamine is a class 4c substance, which would not trigger disqualification or redistribution of a purse.”
Winner went on to say: “The whole premise of the story is false on its face … California law mandates that test results must remain confidential unless and until a complaint is filed, and a complaint can only be filed at the end of an investigative process. It would have been a complete miscarriage of justice for the CHRB to have taken action against Justify or Baffert.”
The CHRB dropped the ball here. It should have informed both Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission about Justify’s positive test. Seeing as though it normally takes 60-90 days for a drug positive to be resolved, it’s highly questionable whether Justify would have been denied a spot in the Kentucky Derby. We’ll never know.
There are so many questions left unanswered in this mess:
— What is the effect of scopolamine on a horse?
Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director of the CHRB, echoed Robertson’s thoughts and scoffed at the suggestion in an interview with the Thoroughbred Daily News that the drug helped Justify during his Triple Crown run.
“Jimson weed is a weed we see in California not infrequently,” he said. “This is not a case of someone drugging a horse. This is a case of a horse poisoning. The source of it is a poisonous plant.”
Arthur also defended his and CHRB executive director Rick Baedeker’s decision to put the case to rest.
“The Board, on my and the executive director’s recommendation, made the correct, appropriate and the gutsy decision to dismiss the case,” he told TDN.
But in Drape’s story, he quotes Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018, as saying “the drug can act as a bronchodilator to clear a horse’s airway and optimize a horse’s heart rate, making the horse more efficient.” Sams added that the 300 nanograms per milliliter was excessive, and he suggested the drug was intended to enhance performance. Said Sams: “I think it has to come from intentional intervention.”
So who’s right here?
Because of horse racing’s non-transparent nature, we’ll never know what Baffert’s intentions were. We’ll never know why the CHRB acted as it did. Would Justify have been as brilliant during his historic run without scopolamine? Because of that non-transparency, Justify’s Triple Crown will forever carry a huge asterisk.
So there you have it, what should stand as one of horse racing’s shining moments now has a huge black stain on it. Telling the truth from the beginning could have avoided this mess. But then, we’re talking about horse racing.
Wonder if any owner will ever name a horse “Transparency.”

China: ‘evil Permanence’

Texto completo: HONG KONG - The masked men who recently tossed firebombs at Jimmy Lai’s home targeted one of this city’s foremost democracy advocates. Lai, a 71-year-old media billionaire, calls this summer’s ongoing protest “a martyrdom movement” and “a last-straw movement.” It has an intensity and dynamic that bewilders the protesters’ opponents in Beijing and in Hong Kong’s Beijing-obedient city administration.
Today’s mostly young protesters will be middle-aged in 2047, at the expiration of the 50-year agreement that ostensibly accords Hong Kong protected status as an island of freedom. Beijing attempted to whittle away that status with a proposed 2003 law against “subversion.” And by devaluing suffrage by the 2014 requirement that candidates for the chief-executive receive approval from a Beijing-loyal committee. And by this year’s extradition bill that would have facilitated sweeping Hong Kongers into the maw of China’s opaque criminal justice system.
Monday’s New York Times carried a full-page ad paid for by “the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China.” Which means, by the Chinese Communist Party. The ad said: “We are resolutely committed to ‘One Country, Two Systems’ which provides the constitutional guarantee for Hong Kong’s continued development and success as a free and open society.”
But the “one country, two systems” formulation, agreed to in 1997, when British authority ended, as a 50-year framework for Hong Kong’s relations with the PRC, is an inherently menacing precondition. And Beijing’s consistently sinister behavior reveals a determination to incrementally nullify “one nation, two systems” by reducing Hong Kong to just another jurisdiction wholly subservient to tyranny.
For Leninists such as Xi Jinping wielding a party-state, nothing is more important than the party’s unchallenged primacy. Another “Tiananmen Square”would be calamitous for China’s Leninists, but less so than weakening the Communist Party’s primacy.
In 1940, Winston Churchill warned against “a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.” That is China’s aspiration with “digital Leninism,” an application of science that neither Churchill nor his contemporary, George Orwell, anticipated. With a steadily refined repression apparatus, aptly called “cyber-totalitarianism,” China’s surveillance state is enmeshing everyone in a “social credit” system. Individuals’ cumulative commercial and social-media transactions give them a score that determines their access to education, housing, clinics, travel and more, even including pet ownership.
And Hong Kong is reading Ma Jian’s dystopian novel “China Dream,” which is banned in mainland China. The protagonist is Ma Daode, director of the fictional (so far) China Dream Bureau, which aspires to “replace all private dreams” with one communal dream.
In her 1951 “The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Hannah Arendt argued that a tyrannical regime could achieve permanence by conscripting the citizenry’s consciousness. This echoed Orwell: “Imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.” In 1956, Arendt thought her theory had been refuted by the Hungarian Revolution, which demonstrated that no state can interrupt “all channels of communication.” Hong Kong sees Beijing using new technologies in the service of an evil permanence.
“To see what is in front of one’s nose,” wrote Orwell, “needs a constant struggle.” Belatedly, the world is seeing. The Economist recently editorialized: “The West’s 25-year bet on China has failed.” The wager was that “market totalitarianism” is an oxymoron. Embedding China in the global economy supposedly would open it to the softening effects of commerce, which would be solvents of authoritarianism. The West’s tardy but welcome disenchantment is, as the Economist says, “the starkest reversal in modern geopolitics.” If Hong Kong’s heroic refusal to go gentle into Beijing’s dark night is accelerating this disenchantment, the summer of dissent has been this decade’s grandest and most important development.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – The Columbus Symphony will open its 2019-20 Pops Series with Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas" on Oct. 19.
The Nightmare Before Christmas follows the earnest-but-misguided adventures of Jack Skellington, Halloween Town's beloved Pumpkin King, as he attempts to kidnap Santa Claus and take over the Christmas holiday.
The Columbus Symphony presents Disney Concerts: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas at the Ohio Theatre (39 E. State St.) at 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 19.

First released in 1993, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas was directed by Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach) and based on a story and characters by Tim Burton. Against the advice of Sally, a lonely rag doll who has feelings for him, Jack enlists three mischievous trick-or-treaters – Lock, Shock, and Barrel – to help him kidnap Santa Claus.
American Festival offers works inspired by moments in US history COLUMBUS – Five guest soloists and the Columbus Symphony Chorus join CSO Music Director Rossen Milanov and the musicians of the Columbus Symphony for The American Festival.
Performing Paul Moravec and Mark Campbell's monumental oratorio Sanctuary Road based on the writings of William Still, a conductor on the Underground Railroad who helped almost 800 slaves escape to freedom the performances will be Oct. 11 & 12. The program also includes a concert version of Gershwin's American classic, Porgy and Bess.
The Columbus Symphony presents The American Festival at the Ohio Theatre (39 E. State St.) at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Oct. 11 and 12. Tickets start at $10 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.columbussymphony.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787. The CAPA Ticket Center will also be open two hours prior to each performance.
Prelude – Patrons are invited to join Maestro Milanov and the creative duo behind Sanctuary Road, composer Paul Moravec and librettist Mark Campbell, for a 30-minute, pre-concert discussion at 7 p.m.
David Sedaris is live at the Palace Theatre Oct. 20 COLUMBUS – CAPA and WCBE present An Evening with David Sedaris, author of the previous bestsellers "Naked," "Me Talk Pretty One Day," "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim," and regular National Public Radio contributor will be appearing for one night only at the Palace Theatre on Sunday, Oct. 20, following the release of his newest book and New York Times #1 Best Seller, "Calypso." This is a unique opportunity to see the best-selling humorist in an intimate setting. As always, Sedaris will offer a selection of all-new readings and recollections, as well as a Q&A session and book signing.
CAPA presents An Evening with David Sedaris at the Palace Theatre (34 W. Broad St.) at 3 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 20. Tickets are $53.50-$63.50 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787.
With sardonic wit and incisive social critiques, Sedaris has become one of America's pre-eminent humor writers. The great skill with which he slices through cultural euphemisms and political correctness proves him a master of satire and one of the most observant writers addressing the human condition today.
Sedaris returns to the road following the release of his most deeply personal and darkly hilarious collection, Calypso, in which he sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Sedaris' powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled. But much of the comedy here is born out of that vertiginous moment when your own body betrays you and you realize that the story of your life is made up of more past than future.
Mystery Science Theater 3000 coming to Columbus COLUMBUS – The award-winning TV comedy "Mystery Science Theater 3000" (MST3K) is coming to Columbus with an all-new, live show featuring Joel Hodgson, the original host and creative vision behind the beloved TV and Netflix comedy series for more than three decades, in his final live tour.

Moscow Mocks Russian Aide Recruited by the C.I.A. as a Boozy Nobody

Texto completo: MOSCOW -- He drank too much, abandoned his sick, aged mother and -- in Russia's own account of the man portrayed in the United States as a highly valued spy burrowed deep into the Kremlin -- he had no contact whatsoever with President Vladimir V. Putin.
Just hours after The New York Times and other American news outlets this week detailed how an unnamed Russian informant helped the C.I.A. conclude that Mr. Putin ordered and orchestrated a campaign of interference in the 2016 United States election, Russia fired up its propaganda machine to provide an entirely different picture of the same man, who the state-controlled news media identified as Oleg B. Smolenkov.
Instead of a superspy who saw Mr. Putin regularly and became "one of the C.I.A.'s most valuable assets," he is now being presented by Russian officials, state-controlled news outlets and pro-Kremlin newspapers as a boozy nobody with no access to Kremlin secrets.
No American official has ever claimed the C.I.A.'s source was part of Mr. Putin's inner circle. But nevertheless, if Mr. Smolenkov, now aged 50, was the informant, he had a position of interest to the C.I.A.: an aide to a senior official close to Mr. Putin. Anyone in that position could have provided a vital flow of information to the United States government.
Dmitri Peskov, Mr. Putin's spokesman, told journalists on Tuesday that Mr. Smolenkov had been fired several years ago from a modest position in the Kremlin "that did not belong to the category of senior posts." This job, he added, "did not provide for any contacts with the president at all."
Mr. Peskov said he could not confirm whether Mr. Smolenkov is indeed the alleged C.I.A. informant extracted from Russia in 2017 and described American news media accounts of the informant's escapades as "pulp fiction."
The C.I.A. declined to comment and The New York Times was not able to independently confirm that Mr. Smolenkov was indeed the spy extracted by the United States.
Much of what the Russian government was putting out through state-controlled media amounts to disinformation, said current and former American officials. The information about Mr. Smolenkov, they said, could not be trusted.
Playing down the importance of a rival's recruits is as much part of spycraft as exaggerating the importance of those recruited by one's own side.
"It's pretty standard practice to magnify your own intelligence triumphs and minimize those of your rivals," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia's security system at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London. This is partly just an effort to control embarrassing publicity. But, he added, "the hope -- probably vain -- is to cast doubt in the minds of the other side's intelligence managers and consumers of the real value of the source's insights."
Whether the former Kremlin official was as valuable as the Americans describe him or as derelict as the Russians now claim is a question of paramount importance.
On his bona fides rests an issue at the heart not only of Washington's relations with Moscow but also American politics: just how accurate was the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion, made public in a declassified report in January, 2017, that Mr. Putin personally "ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election" and developed "a clear preference for President-elect Trump?"
The informant extracted from Russia in 2017, whoever it was, had proved vital to the intelligence assessment about Moscow's interference campaign. The informant's reports in 2016 detailed Mr. Putin's intentions and orders, and led to the C.I.A.'s declaration with "high confidence" that the hack of the Democratic National Committee was the work of the Russian government.
For the Obama administration, the inside source's testimony was critical; it gave them what they were missing, an understanding of the role of the Russian leadership in this new, innovative attack on the American democratic process. It was the spy's testimony that described a coordinated campaign that Mr. Putin himself ordered, as a public intelligence report, released in January, 2019, detailed.
Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, on Wednesday lashed out at reports of Mr. Smolenkov providing inside information to the C.I.A. on Russian election meddling, saying this was impossible "because there was no meddling." He condemned what he described as "the piling up of one lie on top of another and the multiplication of slander about us."
Mr. Ryabkov's boss, foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, also weighed in, mostly to distance himself from Mr. Smolenkov. "I never saw him, never met him and didn't follow either his career or his movements. And I don't want to comment on rumors," the foreign minister said.
Aleksei Pushkov, chairman of the information policy committee in the Russian Parliament's upper house, accused the United States of leaking information about its Russian informant as part of an effort to revive "its old story about 'Russian interference in the election."'
He did not name Mr. Smolenkov but mocked him as someone who "supposedly knew everything about everyone." He concluded: "The story is muddy, the goal is clear."
Frants Klintsevich, a member of the defense and security committee of the upper house, said on his Facebook page that American news media reports of the extracted spy were "a routine attempt to discredit American President Donald Trump," and said there was "no question of any American informant having worked 'inside the Russian leadership."'
Born in Ivanovo, a depressed former textile manufacturing center northeast of Moscow, Mr. Smolenkov seems to have joined the Russian Foreign Ministry straight out of college in the early 1990s. But his duties, according to Russian accounts, involved less high diplomacy than lowly administrative tasks like money transfers.
He worked for a time at the ministry's Second European Department, which handles relations with Britain, Baltic states and parts of Scandinavia.
Sent to Washington around 15 years ago to work in the Russian embassy there, he appeared in diplomatic lists as a "second secretary" and was listed as being accompanied by his then wife, Regina. (He subsequently remarried a woman 16 years his junior, Antonina, who also worked in the Russian bureaucracy.)
While in Washington, the family rented a house in Norfolk, Va., but it is not clear whether the diplomat lived at this address, which is several hours' drive from the capital. Mr. Smolenkov worked under the Russian ambassador at the time, Yuri Ushakov, a seasoned diplomat who later became Mr. Putin's diplomatic adviser in the Kremlin.
It is not clear where or when the C.I.A. recruited its informant, though it was decades ago, according to people familiar with the matter. If Mr. Smolenkov was the spy, his tour of duty in Washington would have given the agency ample opportunity to cultivate him further.
Mr. Ushakov is precisely the kind of official close to Mr. Putin the agency was interested in. Since 2012, Mr. Ushakov, now 72, has served as Mr. Putin's foreign policy aide in the Kremlin. And Mr. Ushakov has been involved in every major confrontation between Russia and the West in recent years -- from the incursions into Ukraine to the annexation of Crimea to the confrontations over arms control with the U.S.
RIA-Novosti, a state-controlled Russian news agency, quoted an unnamed former colleague as saying Mr. Smolenkov's duties at the embassy revolved around menial tasks like buying automobiles for the embassy car pool and goods for its shop. The colleague also said Mr. Smolenkov "often" drank and a "bit more than usual," which is saying something in the context of Russia's diplomatic corps. Another former associate said Mr. Smolenkov complained about his foreign ministry salary being too low.
After returning to Russia, Mr. Smolenkov appeared in a 2010 civil service ranking as a "third class" official serving as an adviser to the government. He left the government bureaucracy around 2012 and joined the presidential administration, a separate system, as an aide and then "chief adviser" to Mr. Ushakov, the former ambassador to Washington. He had an office in Old Square, a tightly guarded complex of buildings used by many of Mr. Putin's officials down the road from the Kremlin.
Mr. Galeotti, the Russian security expert, said that Mr. Smolenkov's position, though fairly lowly, would probably have granted him "considerable access." That said, he added, the "Russians operate 'compartmentalized intelligence' based on need-to-know, and I'd be skeptical he'd have any sight of operational materials."
As in many governments, Russia's foreign policy professionals have wary relations with their country's intelligence services, particularly the military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., which has been accused of spearheading Moscow's election meddling. This makes it highly unlikely, experts say, that Mr. Smolenkov or even Mr. Ushakov would have had detailed knowledge of a secret program to disrupt American democracy hatched by Russia's spies.
Mr. Smolenkov's known curriculum vitae is so thin that it has prompted speculation on Russian social media that rather than providing the C.I.A. with secret inside information he merely acted as a "courier" to the Americans for information obtained by a more highly placed agent who has yet to be exposed.
But such speculation could itself be disinformation, as there is no easier way to thwart the operations of a country's intelligence apparatus than planting seeds of suspicion of hidden traitors. In the 1960s and 1970s, the C.I.A. became paralyzed by an endless hunt for turncoats driven by James Jesus Angleton, the agency's deeply paranoid counterintelligence chief.
The Russian and American accounts of Mr. Smolenkov's activities diverge so sharply that even the manner of his escape from Russia is clouded by contradiction. United States officials describe a secret operation in 2017 to "exfiltrate" -- spy talk for extract -- him to safety. Russia, though, has detailed a far more mundane exit, saying Mr. Smolenkov took his second wife and their three children on holiday to Montenegro, a popular tourist destination for Russians on the Adriatic coast, and then traveled on to the United States, where he bought a house under his own name in Virginia for $ 925,000 in 2018.
The only certainty is that he and his family disappeared. Russian opened a murder case after they vanished but closed it when no bodies could be found. In the fall of 2017, friends of his son, Ivan, exchanged anxious messages on VKontakte, a Russian social networking site. "Is he dead or what?" asked one of Ivan's friends. When this drew flippant responses, the friend tried again: "Seriously, what has happened to him?"
"God only knows," replied another friend.

Texto completo: It is not even noon yet on the East Coast, and the New York Times has taken first place already for the worst take on the 18th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks:
EELiMdDXYAYap_q.jpeg
I count at least two problems in this since-deleted tweet. First, there is no mention of who carried out the 9/11 attacks or what motivated them. That is like writing a headline memorializing the Aug. 3 El Paso, Texas, mass shooting and not once mentioning that there was a white nationalist gunman involved.
Second, and I hate to be the one to say this, airplanes lack agency. They did not take aim or crash themselves. The terrorists flying them did.
In case you think the Times’ bizarre choice of words Wednesday morning is due to the limitations of Twitter, I am here to disabuse you of that notion. The report that this tweet linked to, titled "Remembering Those Lost 18 Years Ago on 9/11,” had all the same issues.
The article's second paragraph read originally, “Eighteen years have passed since airplanes took aim at the World Trade Center and brought them down.” There were also no mentions of the words “terror,” “terrorist,” or “terrorists" anywhere in the body of the story as it appeared originally on the Times’ website. The closest the report came to mentioning the ill intent behind Sept. 11 was when it said Mayor Rudy Giuliani “was heralded for his leadership as mayor of New York when it was attacked.” So at least there is an admission that it was an attack, although there is no explicit admission that it was an attack by people. It might as well have been an earthquake. In its original publishing, the report's sole mention of "terror" appeared in its subhead but nowhere in the story itself.
I am not alone in thinking this is all rather absurd. The Times editors appear to agree, at least once scolded. The article now includes at least two references to terrorism. The report's second paragraph now reads, “Eighteen years have passed since terrorists commandeered airplanes to take aim at the World Trade Center and bring them down.”
Considering the role that terrorism played in the attacks, and the way in which terror shaped U.S. foreign and domestic policy for the next 18 years, it must have taken the writers more effort not to mention terrorism in an article detailing Sept. 11 memorial events than to mention it. And the readers, unwilling to spend so much energy blinding themselves about the story, had to point out the problems.
You just have to wonder to yourself: What is the motive behind all that effort?

Hamas and ISIS hate Israel and each other

Texto completo: Explosions recently at two Hamas police checkpoints in Gaza City left three policemen dead. But it wasn't Israel that planted the explosives, as many might have suspected. Hamas says it was Islamic State suicide bombers.
A day after the deadly attacks, Hamas began mass arrests of supporters of Islamic State and other Salafist organizations in the Gaza Strip.
It's not the first time that Hamas and members of the Islamic State, or ISIS, have clashed in recent years.
So why do the two Islamist groups consider each other enemies? Here's a primer:
Islamist philosophies, different goals
The short answer is that Hamas, which is considered a part of the Muslim Brotherhood, is a national liberation movement, albeit with an Islamist bent, intent on forming an Islamic state in the area that is now Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
ISIS, which stands for Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, belongs to the Salafist branch within Islam that wants to re-create the Islamic caliphate and impose Sharia law throughout the region. ISIS views Hamas and its supporters as "apostates."
That is, in part, because Hamas participated in Palestinian democratic elections in the West Bank and Gaza, and worked to improve relations with Egypt, with which ISIS has been at war since at least 2013.
In January 2018, a video filmed by the Sinai branch of the Islamic State and released by ISIS called for attacks on Hamas members and institutions, and accused Hamas of betraying the Palestinians by imprisoning ISIS fighters and other extremists in Gaza, by not stopping the United States from recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and by accepting support from Iran. The video led many to say that ISIS was "declaring war" on Hamas, upping the enmity that had already been in place for many years.
The end of the video showed an Islamic State member originally from Gaza shooting execution-style a man who had been caught smuggling arms to Hamas.
The Sinai connection
The Islamic State's branch in Sinai, the sparsely inhabited Egyptian desert region on Israel and Gaza's southern borders, is considered one of the most effective local branches of ISIS and is the one that comes most into contact with Hamas next door in the Gaza Strip.
Among its achievements are shooting down a Russian jetliner in 2015, killing 224 people, and an attack on a Sufi mosque in the northern Sinai in November 2017, killing 311 in Egypt's worst terrorist attack.
The enemy of my enemy ...
It would appear that Israel and Hamas have a common enemy in the Islamic State.
As recently as 2017, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for firing long-range rockets at southern Israel.
In February 2018, The New York Times reported that over the course of two years, the Israeli military had carried out more than 100 airstrikes in Egypt's northern Sinai against jihadist groups allied with the Islamic State with the approval of then-President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt.
Israel's intervention in Sinai helped the Egyptian military take a decisive lead in its years-long battle against the jihadists, while for Israel it brought more security to its borders. The article called Israel and Egypt "secret allies in a covert war against a common foe."
... is hardly my friend
In 2014, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs published an article titled "Similarities between Hamas and ISIS."
It said both terrorist organizations view jihad and suicide attacks as primary tools; persecute and oppress non-Muslim minorities; execute people who are suspected of supporting their opponents; plan to establish a state ruled by Muslim law; have seized territory by force; educate children to sanctify death and to die as martyrs in jihad; and strive to commit "genocide" against their opponents.
So much for "the enemy of my enemy is my friend."
Hamas regularly lobs missiles into Israel, and Israel has launched military operations and imposed economic sanctions on Hamas-run territory for years. Yet both sides often need each other, in part to keep matters from getting even worse.

Antonio Brown accused of rape

Texto completo: Just a day after formally signing with the Patriots, the controversial and gifted receiver Antonio Brown was accused of raping his former trainer, who said in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that he sexually assaulted her three times in the past two years.
The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges Brown sexually assaulted Britney Taylor, a gymnast he met while they were attending Central Michigan University together. Brown later hired Taylor as a trainer.
In her lawsuit, Taylor alleges that Brown sexually assaulted her twice during training sessions in June 2017.
Then, the lawsuit says, on May 20, 2018, Brown forced her onto a bed, pushed her face into the mattress, and raped her. She tried to resist him, screaming and repeatedly shouting “no" and “stop," the lawsuit says, but Brown refused.
Brown's legal team released a statement denying the allegations.
“Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit," read the statement from Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown. “He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations."
The lawsuit adds to the legacy of Brown, who has had multiple run-ins with the law over the last few years and who was released by the Oakland Raiders after a brief, bizarre tenure.
In April 2018, while a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown was allegedly involved in an incident where he tossed furniture from the balcony of a 14-story apartment building in Florida, and was later part of a suit brought by the grandfather of a young child who was reportedly almost struck by the furniture. (That suit was settled by the two parties.) In January 2019, he was involved in a domestic disturbance in Hollywood, Fla., but wasn't arrested.
More recently, in Oakland, his list of transgressions included a social media movie narrated by a private phone conversation with his coach, a reported on-field altercation with his general manager, and another social media post that featured a photo of private, internal correspondence from his team.
The Patriots released a statement Tuesday night saying, “We are aware of the civil lawsuit that was filed today against Antonio Brown, as well as the response by Antonio's representatives. We take these allegations very seriously. Under no circumstance does this organization condone sexual violence or assault. The league has informed us that they will be investigating. We will have no further comment while that investigation takes place."
In a statement released to The New York Times by her lawyer, Taylor said the decision to come forward was a challenge.
“As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision," she said. “I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault."
According to the lawsuit, the two met in college as part of a Bible study group and became friends. They went their separate ways, it alleges, before they connected again in June 2017. Shortly after that, Brown hired Taylor as part of his physical training team.
In the suit, Taylor says she “never dated or had an interest in any romantic relationship with Brown." The suit describes her as an elite-level gymnast who opened a gymnastics training center for girls in her hometown of Memphis.
“Brown preyed on Ms. Taylor's kindness and her religious devotion, casting himself as a person equally dedicated to his religious faith and someone she could trust. In reality, he used manipulation and false promises to lure her into his world, and once there, he sexually assaulted and raped her," the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit says Brown bragged about the incident in text messages that are copied in the lawsuit.
There is no mention of criminal charges or a police investigation into the allegations in the lawsuit.
Heitner, Brown's lawyer, said that Brown was approached by his accuser in 2017 and asked to invest $1.6 million in her business project.
“Mr. Brown was not informed by his accuser that she had just been levied with a $30,000 IRS tax lien or that $300,000 of the $1.6 million so-called 'investment' was to be used to purchase property already owned by the accuser and her mother," Brown's lawyer said. “When Mr. Brown refused to make the $1.6 million 'investment,' the accuser supposedly cut off communications with Mr. Brown."
However, Heitner said, she “resurfaced" in 2018 and offered to train Brown for the upcoming season.
“Thereafter, the accuser engaged Mr. Brown in a consensual personal relationship. Any sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual," Heitner said in a statement.
Brown is scheduled to attend Patriots practice on Wednesday.
According to an NFL Media report, Brown's deal includes a $1 million fully guaranteed base, a $9 million signing bonus ($5 million immediately, $4 million later), and other incentives.
Brown had 104 catches, 1,297 yards, and a league-high 15 receiving touchdowns last season. He is a four-time first-team All-Pro.
For the Patriots, the lawsuit will force the team to confront a decision of how to handle the allegations.
When New England acquired defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth in the summer of 2011, he was facing a sexual assault charge following an alleged incident that February. Haynesworth later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor assault charge, and played a portion of that season before he was released by the team.

Timeline: The events leading up to the ousting of John Bolton

Texto completo: National Security Adviser John Bolton's departure on Tuesday was surprising, even in an administration marked by chaos and staff upheaval.
Versions of the circumstances around Bolton's departure varied. President Trump claimed he asked for Bolton's resignation on Monday and accepted it Tuesday, but Bolton claimed in his own tweet that he offered his resignation on Monday night and Trump told him they'd discuss the matter Tuesday.
A host of reports about what led to Bolton's departure filtered out of the White House through media reports on Tuesday. Fundamentally, Trump clashed with Bolton's hawkish approach to foreign policy.
White House Spokesman Hogan Gidley said Bolton's “priorities and policies just don't line up with the president."
Despite their differences, the departure was still unexpected: Bolton was set to appear Tuesday with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a White House briefing that was announced just hours before he was fired.
Here's a timeline of what led up to Bolton's departure:
Sunday, Aug. 28: Bolton was booked to defend the Trump administration on the Sunday morning talk shows, but backed out, according to CNN. The cancellation reportedly angered Trump.
Friday, Aug. 30: According the New York Times, Trump met with his advisers the Friday before Labor Day to discuss the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and Bolton, who joined via video conference, expressed opposition to any deal with the Taliban. Over the next several days, Trump proposed holding a meeting at Camp David to finalize the negotiations.
Saturday, Sept. 7: Trump announced on Saturday evening that he was canceling the previously secret meeting with Taliban leaders after an attack in Kabul killed an American service member. The Washington Post described the cancellation as one part of “a broader victory for Bolton."
Sunday, Sept. 8: NBC News reported that Bolton and Pence were united in their opposition to the Camp David meeting, a report denied by Pence and one that angered Trump.
Monday, Sept. 9: CNN reported that “a bitter argument" erupted Monday in the Oval Office over the Camp David plan.
Morning of Tuesday, Sept. 10: Despite the apparent fallout, Bolton was still leading meetings as late as Tuesday morning, according to CNN.
Noon on Tuesday, Sept. 10: President Trump announced Bolton's departure in a tweet around noon, claiming that he asked for Bolton's resignation and received it Tuesday morning.
As the news rocketed through Washington and beyond, Bolton began texting reporters with his version of events, claiming he resigned umprompted:
From the New York Times: “Offered last night without his asking," Bolton wrote. “Slept on it and gave it to him this morning."
Here's a look at the resignation letter:
1:30 p.m. Tuesday Sept. 10: Barely an hour after news of his departure, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin appeared together at the briefing on terrorism sanctions that was initially set to include Bolton.
Asked whether he was surprised Bolton had been fired given that he'd been on the White House schedule just hours earlier, Pompeo replied:
“I'm never surprised. And I don't mean that on just this issue."

Texto completo: A Shelby County woman alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown sexually assaulted and raped her in 2017 and 2018.
In the complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida and obtained by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday night, Britney Taylor, 28, claims that Brown sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions in 2017 while she was helping to train him for an upcoming NFL season. She alleges he raped her on May 20, 2018.
The complaint also states Taylor was born and raised in Memphis, began her college gymnastics career at Central Michigan and later transferred to LSU. Taylor's bio on the LSU athletics website lists her as a graduate of Ridgeway High School.
Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement that his client had a "consensual personal relationship" with Taylor but denied raping or sexually assaulting her.
"Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit," Heitner wrote in the statement. "He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false allegations. "
The NFL and the Patriots did not immediately respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday night.
In a statement released through her attorney, David Haas, Taylor said the decision to come forward was "incredibly difficult. "
“As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision. I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault. Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape. I will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies; however, at this time, I respectfully request that the media please respect my privacy. ”
USA TODAY does not typically identify victims of sexual assault unless they decide to come forward publicly, as Taylor has in this case.
In a statement released to The New York Times, which first reported the existence of the lawsuit, Taylor said the decision to come forward was "incredibly difficult" and that she will cooperate with the NFL in any forthcoming investigation.
According to the complaint, Taylor opened a gymnastics training center (Taylor'ed Gymnastics Training Center) in 2016 in Memphis.
Brown joined the Patriots this week after a tumultuous training camp with the Oakland Raiders. He was traded from Pittsburgh to Oakland in March but never played a game for the Raiders. He wasn’t eligible to play with New England against his former team Sunday, after the Raiders released him Saturday. But Brown is expected to be available for Week 2.
The allegations filed Tuesday stem from incidents in 2017 and 2018, and explain Taylor and Brown’s relationship even earlier.
According to the lawsuit, Taylor and Brown were student athletes at Central Michigan in 2010 and met through the Fellowship for Christian Athletes, when they were paired as bible study partners. Brown played football for the school while Taylor competed as a gymnast.
They reconnected in 2017 when Brown asked Taylor to train him. She flew to him in Pittsburgh and Florida for the sessions. In June 2017, the lawsuit says, she was staying at his home for a session when he walked into the bathroom she was in and exposed himself to her.
He then “grabbed and kissed her without her consent,” the lawsuit says, before she “pushed him away and immediately left the room. ” Another time in 2017, Brown masturbated behind her and ejaculated on her, the lawsuit says, with messages that Brown allegedly sent her about the incident.
The suit says the two cut off contact until 2018, when in April they agreed to restart a working relationship with conditions. Brown’s attorney Heitner says the lapse in communication resulted from Brown refusing to invest $1. 6 million in Taylor’s business project.
The lawsuit alleges that on May 20, 2018, Brown pinned Taylor down and penetrated her even as she shouted “no” and “stop. ” Heitner said “any sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual” and that Taylor traveled to Florida and returned at 2 a. m. to Brown’s residence 10 days after the alleged assault.
According to the lawsuit, Taylor contacted an anti-sexual harassment organization in January and described the incident.
Heitner followed up his initial statement with a tweet Tuesday night.
“Antonio Brown will leave no stone unturned and will aggressively defend himself, including exercising all of his rights in countersuits,” Heitner tweeted.

Texto completo: On a summer day in 1972, Paul Olsen and a friend trudged into a densely wooded area in Rockland County, New York, not far from the New Jersey state line in search of fossils.
Some time later, Olsen, a Yale University paleontology student at the time, made a historic discovery: Dinosaur footprints outlined in purplish mudstone in a Blauvelt hillside.
"The tracks were filled with white sandstone, so they stood out," Olsen recalled recently.
What the two men found were three-toed tracks of what turned out to be the Atreipus, a plant-eating dinosaur-like creature about the size of a large dog, from the Triassic Period some 215 million years ago.
It was big news at the time. "Dinosaurs roamed Route 303" read the front-page headline in The Journal News on July 27, 1972. A subsequent New York Times article hailed the find as the "first discovery of evidence that dinosaurs once lived in New York State."
Some of the tracks were removed and sent to the New York State Museum in Albany, where they remain on display.
But several footprints are still where the prehistoric creatures left them. They, and other fossils that might be in the vicinity, are now an issue in a very modern conflict over development. Residents concerned about a proposal to build condos near the Atreipus' former stomping grounds are pointing to Olsen's nearly 50-year-old finding as one reason for the town to back off.
Olsen, now a paleontologist and professor at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, recently recounted his discovery and its significance during a PowerPoint presentation at an Orangetown Town Board hearing.
Orangetown, New York, officials are weighing whether to rezone 17 acres that include the spot where Olsen found the footprints. The rezoning would allow a developer to seek approvals for 68 townhouse-style two-bedroom condominiums on about 8 acres.
Another 8 acres — including the woods where the tracks are located — would be donated to the town as parkland. The developer has also agreed to preserve and move any footprints discovered during excavation, even though they are not under historical protection.
The property straddles a residential and commercial area near the town line in West Nyack. At present most of the acreage is zoned for single-family homes; the rest can accommodate light industrial uses.
The public hearing on the request during which Olsen spoke attracted a crowd to Town Hall and will be continued on Oct. 1. The Town Board could vote on the request that night.
If the zone change is OK'd, the Patriot's Crossing condos proposed by developer William Brodsky's Ryserson Farms LLC would have to go through the normal process of satisfying planning, zoning and drainage requirements, and potentially of receiving input from Clarkstown.
The condos would be in the $450,000 to $500,000 range, targeted at young families and empty nesters looking to downsize, Supervisor Chris Day said.
"I wouldn't say I'm in favor of if, I would say I'm open to it being considered," Day said Wednesday. The supervisor said each of the uses now permitted on the two parcels presented risks.
"The question ends up being what's the best option that has the least risk," Day said.
Fran Oldenburger, who lives about a mile and a half from the property, opposes the development because of the loss of open space, as well as concerns about preserving the footprints "because they're irreplaceable."
Saving the footprints fits in perfectly with the town's motto — "rich in history" — she said.
Familiar footsteps For Elayne Armaniaco, who has lived several houses away from the property since 1988, the specter of development creeping into the neighborhood is nothing new.
In 2000, she was part of the Greenbush Road Coalition, which successfully sued to keep a car dealership from being parked on the same stretch of land.
John Palladino, who owned the land at that time, sold it to Rathmagurry Realty in 2016 for $850,000, according to the deed on file with the county clerk.
Armaniaco, now chairperson of the 100-member Greenbush Neighborhood Coalition, contends Brodsky's proposal is too dense and wants the number of units scaled back but would prefer the single-family zoning be retained. She also wants the exposed bedrock where other footprints may be discovered to be protected from excavation.
"At first I was excited that it was a residential proposal and I was excited to see that the developer wanted to leave some of the property as open space," she said. "But the more you look at the proposal you see that it's way too dense ... the density is frightening."
Armaniaco said coalition members have diverging opinions, with some wanting the land to remain as open space, others preferring the zoning to remain unchanged, and still others who are amenable to compromise.
She said the state has no criteria to protect dinosaur fossils but urged the town to see if the entire parcel can be preserved through a purchase by the Open Space Institute.
However, Armaniaco said it sounded like Day and other officials had made up their minds.
"It feels like the Town Board wants to move forward with this," she said.
Fossils controversy Locating the fossils Olsen discovered would present a stiff challenge; the area is overgrown and he said the impressions are only visible when the light is optimal. Wooden stakes with notices about the public hearing now border the parcel, which ends near the Fesco Fence property.
Olsen, now 66 years old and a member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, doesn't have an opinion about whether condo owners should be living alongside the prehistoric artifacts.
"I'm sympathetic to the people who want open space and I'm sympathetic to the landowner who wants to do something with it," he said. "Both sides have valid ideas for what should be done with the land."
But Olsen said Brodsky's plans showed "a first-class effort to preserve the footprints."
He added: "I would work with the contractor and I would visit the site. When I would visit the site I would keep track of what is pulled out. I have every confidence we'd see some interesting things."
The paleontologist said that having the fossils surface once again in the crosshairs of a development controversy was "deja vu all over again, it definitely is. I kind of expect it. This is not an easy parcel to develop."

Texto completo: Two years before the allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against Harvey Weinstein became public, his own brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein, confronted him, pleading with him to get medical treatment for what he described as many years of "misbehavior."
"You have brought shame to the family and your company through your misbehavior," Bob Weinstein wrote. "Your reaction was once more to blame the victims, or to minimize the misbehavior in various ways. If you think nothing is wrong with your misbehavior so in this area then announce it to your wife and family."
The previously unreported letter is reprinted in full in "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," a new book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, two reporters at The New York Times who broke the story of Harvey Weinstein's alleged misdeeds, helping to spark the global #MeToo reckoning. The book, to be published on Tuesday by Penguin Press, sheds new light on the roles that several figures played in enabling Mr. Weinstein and covering up his misdeeds, and names key sources who helped reporters break the story -- including company officials, Hollywood stars and other victims of the producer's alleged abuse.
Drawing on new reporting and previously undisclosed corporate records, emails and text messages, "She Said" uncovers more on the extent of Mr. Weinstein's alleged transgressions, and the labyrinth of secret settlements and restrictive nondisclosure agreements that allowed Mr. Weinstein and other men in positions of power to conceal their behavior and thrive in their careers, in some cases finding new victims.
Mr. Weinstein, who is facing a criminal trial on charges of sexual assault and rape, has denied ever having had nonconsensual sex and pleaded not guilty.
One of the central figures of "She Said" is a former top executive at the Weinstein Company: Irwin Reiter. Mr. Reiter, an accountant who worked for Mr. Weinstein for decades, was increasingly alarmed by his behavior toward women and had raised concerns within the company, to no avail. The book discloses that it was Mr. Reiter who provided the reporters with an explosive internal memo from an employee who described Weinstein's routine harassment of junior female employees and actresses. Mr. Reiter also alerted Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey, who were investigating financial settlements for sexual harassment from decades ago, to other recent accusations against Mr. Weinstein, bringing new urgency to the investigation.
"She Said" similarly discloses the identity of a Weinstein accuser who has put off inquiries from journalists for 15 years, Rowena Chiu, a former assistant at Miramax who received a settlement in 1998 after Mr. Weinstein allegedly assaulted her in a hotel room. In Ms. Chiu's account, which she shares in detail for the first time, she describes being silenced by a restrictive nondisclosure agreement and lured back to a job at Miramax in an apparent effort by Mr. Weinstein to keep her close. She struggled with depression and attempted suicide. She stayed silent for nearly 20 years, even declining to tell her husband about the predation or the settlement. (Mr. Weinstein has disputed her story.)
In his first extensive comments since the Weinstein story broke, Bob Weinstein explains that he mistakenly saw his brother's problem as sex addiction, a rationale rooted in his own previously unreported recovery from substance abuse, and how he abandoned his attempts to intervene. "I got worn out," he told the journalists. "I said, 'I surrender,' see?"
[ Read our review of "She Said." ]
"She Said," one of several forthcoming books about Mr. Weinstein and the #MeToo movement, is also an exploration of investigative journalism and how The Times executed a sensitive investigation. The book chronicles how the reporting came together behind the scenes, with accounts of the journalists' first calls to actresses who they suspected had stories about Mr. Weinstein, and their efforts to identify recipients of confidential settlements. Gwyneth Paltrow, one of Mr. Weinstein's biggest stars over the years, was scared to go on the record but became an early, crucial source, sharing her account of sexual harassment and trying to recruit other actresses to speak.
"She Said" shows how some figures who have presented themselves as allies of victims have profited from financial settlements that silence them.
The attorney Gloria Allred is one of the most vocal crusaders against sexual harassment and assault. Privately, her firm helped negotiate a settlement that muffled one of Mr. Weinstein's victims in 2004, taking a 40 percent cut. (The firm has also worked on settlements that silenced victims of Larry Nassar and Bill O'Reilly.) In an interview for "She Said," Allred defends her use of confidential settlements, arguing that clients are not forced to sign them and often prefer them for reasons of privacy.
Allred's daughter, the lawyer Lisa Bloom, a prominent victims' rights attorney, was working behind the scenes with Mr. Weinstein -- at a rate of $ 895 an hour -- to quash the journalists' investigation and thwart his accusers. In a confidential memo to Mr. Weinstein that Ms. Bloom wrote in December 2016, which is reproduced in "She Said," she offered to help him damage the reputation of one of his accusers, Rose McGowan, and portrayed her background as a victims's rights advocate as an asset.
"I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them," Ms. Bloom wrote, before laying out a multistep playbook for how to intimidate accusers or paint them as liars. One of Ms. Bloom's suggested tactics for undermining Ms. McGowan: "We can place an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she's discredited."
Ms. Bloom accompanied Mr. Weinstein on a surprise visit to the Times the day before the initial article was published, to present the journalists with information intended to portray several accusers -- including Ashley Judd, the first actress to go on the record -- as unreliable and mentally unstable.
Ms. Bloom has said she was crossing sides to work for Weinstein to encourage him to apologize for his behavior. She later told the reporters that she "deeply regretted" representing him, which she said was a "colossal mistake."
Another member of Mr. Weinstein's legal team, the attorney David Boies, helped Mr. Weinstein evade scrutiny for his treatment of women over 15 years, working to halt reporting on the producer by news outlets, blocking the board of Mr. Weinstein's company from reviewing his personnel file, and helping Mr. Weinstein execute a contract with Black Cube, an Israeli private investigations firm, that was promised a $ 300,000 bonus if it stopped the Times investigation. (Ronan Farrow, who published a separate Weinstein exposé in The New Yorker in October 2017, later broke the news of Black Cube's work for Weinstein.) "She Said" reveals emails showing that during the time that Mr. Boies represented Mr. Weinstein, the two men discussed potential film roles for Mr. Boies's daughter, an aspiring actress.
In an interview for the book, Mr. Boies said he was unaware of the underhanded tactics that Black Cube used against journalists and regretted not paying closer attention to that firm's work. But he defended the assistance he provided to Mr. Weinstein as the producer sought to conceal allegations and said he didn't have "any regret that I represented him the way I did."
"She Said" is among the first in a wave of new books about Mr. Weinstein and other powerful men accused of sexual misconduct. Earlier this year, Penguin Press acquired another Weinstein book by the New Yorker writer Ken Auletta. Little, Brown and Company plans to release Mr. Farrow's book "Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators," an account of his own investigation into Mr. Weinstein, scheduled for publication in October.
Other recent and forthcoming books that grew out of the #MeToo movement and its aftermath include the journalist Abigail Pesta's account of serial sexual abuse of young gymnasts by Larry Nassar; a book by the Times reporters Rachel Abrams and James B. Stewart about the former CBS chief executive Les Moonves, who was accused of sexual harassment and assault by multiple women; and a book by the Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown about the serial sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. There are also new books that grew out of reporting about Christine Blasey Ford's accusations of sexual assault against Justice Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, including the forthcoming "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," by the Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly.
Dr. Ford receives attention in "She Said," providing for the first time an extensive account of her experience as an ambivalent figure at the center of a polarizing national scandal. She told her lawyers she did not want to testify -- even as they spoke publicly about her willingness to do so in order to keep her options open.
Dr. Ford's story is often held up as a cautionary tale about the limitations of the #MeToo movement in a politically divided nation, and the cost for victims whose stories are often met with disbelief, scorn and threats. But "She Said" shows how Dr. Ford has motivated other women to open up about sexual assault.
Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey write about a group interview they conducted that included Dr. Ford and women who had made accusations against President Donald Trump and Mr. Weinstein, including Ms. Judd, Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Chiu, the former Miramax employee. As the women spoke, Ms. Chiu felt inspired by Dr. Ford and, soon afterward, decided she would go on the record for the first time.

Texto completo: U.S. Soccer's longtime chief executive, Dan Flynn, will leave the federation next week and be replaced by an interim successor while a search continues for outside candidates to run the organization, which is facing multiple lawsuits, including one by its world champion women's team, and internal dissent.
Some of the powers long held by Flynn, 64, will shift in the short term to another U.S. Soccer insider, Brian Remedi. He currently serves as the federation's chief stakeholders officer, a grandly named development and fund-raising role that has allowed him to build relationships with U.S. Soccer's disparate bodies and committees.
Flynn's desire to step down as chief executive was well known. After helping transform U.S. Soccer from a small-time governing body into a financial juggernaut with a $ 100 million annual budget and reserves of nearly twice that amount, he had a heart transplant in 2016, and most observers had expected him to leave after the 2018 World Cup. But when the United States men's team stunningly failed to qualify for that tournament, the defeat precipitated searing criticism of the way U.S. Soccer was run and ushered in a divisive battle for the federation presidency that culminated in the election of Carlos Cordeiro in February 2018.
With Cordeiro thrust immediately into a central role traveling the world to promote the American-led bid to host the 2026 World Cup in North America, he first persuaded Flynn, a veteran hand, to stay on to provide a sense of continuity at the federation's headquarters in Chicago.
The decision to place Remedi in charge, even temporarily, is a blow to the chief executive ambitions of the chief commercial officer Jay Berhalter, another longtime U.S. Soccer executive. Berhalter, the brother of the men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter, was viewed as the leading candidate to replace Flynn until this spring, when U.S. Soccer employees -- unhappy with what they described as a "toxic" workplace environment in Chicago that they blamed Flynn and Jay Berhalter for -- took the unusual step of mounting a coordinated campaign to alert federation board members of their dissatisfaction.
That campaign, sparked by a fear that U.S. Soccer was on the verge of naming Jay Berhalter as its chief executive, took the form of more than a dozen scathing anonymous reviews by current and former federation employees on the networking website Glassdoor.
A day after The New York Times published an article on the reviews during the Women's World Cup, Cordeiro sent a letter to U.S. Soccer's roughly 200 employees in which he said the company would create a new anonymous reporting system for workplace complaints. U.S. Soccer is also preparing an employee survey to solicit even more feedback.
The results of that survey could play a role in the choice of a new chief executive; U.S. Soccer said it had no concrete timetable for hiring one, but a federation official said it had identified internal and external candidates -- including Jay Berhalter -- and was continuing its search for more options from outside the organization.
And while he is leaving U.S. Soccer, Flynn's career in soccer may not be ending. Over the summer, it emerged that he had taken an unpaid role as a consultant to an ultimately successful bid to bring a Major League Soccer expansion team to his hometown, St. Louis. The role was potentially problematic for U.S. Soccer, since Flynn remained U.S. Soccer's chief executive at the time.
On Saturday, the M.L.S. commissioner, Don Garber, offered a hint that Flynn might be headed toward a more formal role with the St. Louis team when, at a U.S. Soccer board meeting, he thanked Flynn for his service to the federation and then joked that "I look forward to you yelling at me all the time in your new role."

Texto completo: How important do Democrats think it is to beat President Donald Trump in 2020?
Obviously, most Democrats would say it’s vitally important. Four more years of the Trump presidency could allow him to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. It would worsen the climate crisis. It could cement his paranoid racism and scorn for democracy as the new American normal.
Given these consequences, you would think that Democrats would be approaching the 2020 campaign with a ruthless sense of purpose. But they’re not, at least not yet. They are not focusing on issues that expose Trump’s many vulnerabilities. They have instead devoted substantial time to wonky subjects that excite some progressive activists — and alienate most American voters. Recent polls suggest that the Democrats really are increasing the chances Trump will win reelection.
The good news is that the campaign is still just getting started. Many Americans haven’t yet paid much attention. The next phase starts Thursday night, with a debate in Houston featuring the 10 leading candidates.
It’s a chance for Democrats to start treating the 2020 campaign with the urgency it deserves.
Before I get into the polling, I want to make clear that I’m not making the argument that some centrists and conservatives have made. By now, you’ve probably heard claims that Democrats are hurtling toward socialism and instead must return to the triangulation of the Bill Clinton years. The evidence doesn’t support that view.
Over the past two decades, incomes for most Americans have barely grown. Median wealth has declined. Americans are frustrated, and a majority supports a populist agenda: higher taxes on corporations and the rich, expanded government health care and financial aid, a higher minimum wage, even a Green New Deal.
The Democrats are on solid ground, substantively and politically, by pushing all of these issues. They should be casting Trump as a plutocrat in populist’s clothes, who has used the presidency to enrich himself and other wealthy insiders at the expense of hardworking middle-class families. It’s a caricature that has the benefit of truth. When pundits yearn for economic triangulation, they’re the ones confusing their own policy preferences with good political advice.

Resumen: Don't sentimentalize the framers' 1780s horse-trading. They saddled us with a system that is wrong for our times and nearly impossible to change.

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , recently inspired fresh debate over the hoariest of institutions, the Electoral College. "Every vote should be = in America," she tweeted, "no matter who you are and where you come from. The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it. "
On cue, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, protested: "Abolishing the Electoral College means the politicians will only campaign in (and listen to) urban areas. That is not a representative democracy. We live in a republic, which means 51% of the population doesn't get to boss around the other 49%. "
In Crenshaw's world, apparently, democracy works better when the 49% chooses for the other 51%. Indeed, The New York Times' Nate Cohn calculates, President Donald Trump could win reelection in 2020 "while losing the national vote by as much as 5 percentage points. "
Political parties and 50 states
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines democracy as "government by the people," implemented by the "rule of the majority. " But the word "democracy" appears nowhere in our foundational document.
Too often, we regard the Constitution as a repository of timeless wisdom. Far better to understand it as a remarkable but flawed product of its times. For within are embedded a series of awkward compromises that, after 232 years of national evolution unimaginable to its draftsmen, frustrate democracy as we now conceive it.
A few obvious facts explain this: The Founders did not imagine political parties. In apportioning representation by population, they acceded to Southern demands that slaves be counted as three-fifths of a person. Yet, like slaves, women did not vote.
That long ago America had 13 states, not 50. Our Founding Fathers, many slave owners themselves, were men of property who feared popular democracy. They could not anticipate the vast and varied America we now inhabit; the evolution of our social philosophy; or the needs of a diverse society for a government responsive to its people — all of which, one can reasonably imagine, many would have regarded with something akin to horror.
No longer free from 'sinister bias'
Which, of course, brings us to the Electoral College. If ever there was an institution rooted in the then, not the now, this is it.
Start with Alexander Hamilton's premise that the electors would be "free from any sinister bias" — a notion swiftly undone by the inevitable rise of political parties. The college itself was designed as a compromise between empowering Congress to pick the president and choosing him by popular vote — which, at the time, would have ruled out awarding more electoral votes to Southern states by counting fractional slaves. Unable to anticipate a 50-state America defined by demographic sorting, they bequeathed constitutional architecture that mocks Crenshaw's "representative democracy. "
Some defenders argue that the college creates "stability" by creating a "majority" of electors, others that it requires candidates to win over rural America. This sentimentalizes the Founders' horse-trading while dismissing its present impact.
To start, the Electoral College violates the principle of "one person, one vote," in which the votes of all Americans count equally. It renders irrelevant the votes of people in states dominated by one political party. It confines presidential campaigns to a handful of states where either party has a chance of winning.
From a onetime Romney strategist: Kill the Electoral College to help America and, yes, Republicans
Popular mythology notwithstanding, it does not force candidates to seek votes in rural states or districts. Only 35% of eligible voters live in the battleground states where almost all spending and campaigning occurs, and most of them are not small or predominantly rural.
Finally, twice in the past five elections, it gave us presidents spurned by a majority of Americans. Small wonder, then, that President Donald Trump is laser-focused on turning out the minority of voters who are his base: It worked for him the last time, and may well again.
The Senate is even worse
Yet there's another remnant of constitutional vote-swapping that makes the Electoral College look like a plebiscite: the U. S. Senate. In practice, the Senate upholds all the supposed virtues of the Electoral College, privileging small states and overrepresenting rural areas. Its very existence operates as a bulwark against urban dominance and, therefore, as a compelling argument against the supposed necessity of preserving the Electoral College.
That it empowers America's open spaces with a vengeance reflects a further remnant of small state leverage: Equal representation in a co-equal branch of Congress, two senators for every state, was their price for signing on.
At the time the Constitution was written, the ratio between the most and least populous states was a paltry 12 to 1. Thirty-seven states and more than two centuries later, the population of California is 69 times that of Wyoming. In 2016, half the country lived in just nine states with 18 senators. The half living in the other 41 states had 82 senators — and in about 20 years they'll likely have 84.
What did America writ large get in return for this trade-off? Not the disinterested body that our Founders fondly imagined, free from unruly political passions. Today's Senate is polarized between underrepresented blue states and overrepresented red states, allowing partisans from unpopulated states to help strangle popular legislation. It is, in short, a satrapy for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Does anyone truly believe that the Founding Fathers — transported to 2020 — would insist on this design? It's easier to imagine California and New York as separate countries, blissfully free of governance by Wyoming and Alaska.
But here we are, compelled to live with a Senate that the amendment process preserves in perpetuity. How? By requiring that any constitutional amendment be approved by two–thirds of Congress and three-quarters of the states, our Founders gave underpopulated states virtual veto power over any amendment deemed contrary to their interests.
America's contemporary problem is not too much democracy but too little. Even in terms of its supporters' best arguments, the Electoral College is constitutional excess. It should go.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; He lets the schmaltz do his talking; Barry Manilow gives fans showmanship, but personal revelation is lacking at the Bowl.

Texto completo: "God, you're a romantic crowd," Barry Manilow said approvingly from the stage of the Hollywood Bowl on Friday night. The veteran pop singer known for his lovey-dovey ballads had just belted one of the lovey-dovey-est of them all, and as he looked out at the thousands of excited middle-age fans before him, he gave a little shrug to assure us he got it. "It's a romantic song," he said of "Weekend in New England," in which the thought of a couple's reunion makes the narrator's blood flow. "I was turning myself on back there."
The line was just one of many well-practiced quips with which Manilow, a proud steward of the age before rock 'n' roll, expertly peppered the first of two weekend concerts. But it wasn't the certainty he'd repeat the joke the next night that made you wonder whether he actually meant it.
Now 76, Manilow is speaking more frankly than many show-biz lifers do about a career that in his case he insists he didn't want. In a recent interview with the New York Times, the songwriter -- who's long claimed he started singing only to get his material heard -- said he "never" had a good time when onstage. That report was followed by a gossipy item from the New York Post's Page Six that said Manilow was furious at his manager (who's also his husband) for booking a three-week Broadway engagement this summer.

The picture that emerges, four years after what Manilow described with excitement as his final tour, is of a guy now putting on his bedazzled lion tamer's jacket just to punch the clock.
Yet if he's truly miserable up there, he did an exemplary job of hiding it during Friday's show, a crisply paced survey of his splashiest and schmaltziest hits -- the pleading "Mandy" as well as the campy "Copacabana (At the Copa)" -- in which he was backed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. No, he didn't scowl at anybody (assuming that remains a possibility on his conspicuously unlined face) or flip over his piano bench. But you wouldn't say he was enjoying himself exactly; there was nothing loose or spontaneous or even especially cheerful about his act, particularly compared with the laugh-a-thons put on these days by peers such as Bette Midler and Lionel Richie. Rather, he appeared to accept that he had a job to do -- and that getting the job done can be a valuable source of satisfaction.
Part of his work, as Manilow seems to understand it, is pointing out the perceived shortcomings of his successors on the pop chart. Not long into the concert, he bemoaned that "today's radio has no melody" -- an absurd position, of course, but all the motivation he needed to haul out the undeniably tuneful "Looks Like We Made It," whose seamless blend of crooner-era theatrics and plush adult-contemporary sonics offered a reminder of how emotionally legible love songs used to be.
As a counterculture refusenik, he also seemed to want to defend against the hippie-centric idea that pop is cheapened by its commercialism. At one point, he played two of the indelible jingles he's written, for Band-Aid and State Farm, without the least bit of embarrassment; indeed, his surprisingly passionate rendition of the latter led directly to his recollection of the beginnings of his recording career -- "back in 1821," he said -- as though the years since had given him little reason to see a difference between writing well about car insurance and writing well about love.
The drawback to Manilow's coolly effective professionalism was that it left you unsure of his personal investment in his music. We've been trained to think of pop songs as illuminating singers' inner lives, but here it was anyone's guess if "Even Now" or "I Made It Through the Rain," both delivered in a voice only slightly less creamy than in his heyday, still touch anything like a nerve. That he made no mention of coming out in 2017 -- after decades of public speculation about his sexuality -- suggested he wasn't exactly burning to connect any dots.
For Manilow, perhaps, it was enough to give us our money's worth -- to hold up his end of an old-fashioned deal. He writes the songs; we pay his bills.

Climate Change as Protagonist

Texto completo: How do you capture the realities of climate change in a novel -- not just its causes and symptoms, but the ever-changing, ever-weirder ways it is manifesting, within the conventional framework of a story with a beginning, middle and end?
Answering that question is, according to the writer Amitav Ghosh, the literary world's great challenge. "I feel completely convinced that we have to change our fictional practices in order to deal with the world that we're in," he said.
"Something this big and this important, there have to be an infinite number of ways to just talk about it," he said, similar to how war, slavery, colonization, famine and other crises and events have seeped into so many forms of literature.
Ghosh, 63, is attempting to add something to the conversation with "Gun Island," his 12th book. The novel, which comes out Tuesday, leaps from the United States, to the Sundarbans mangrove forest between India and Bangladesh, to Italy, places where rising temperatures and water levels have uprooted human and animal lives and upended political systems.
It centers on Dinanth Datta, a rare book dealer also known as Deen, who reluctantly sets off on an Indiana Jones-esque trip to a temple in the Sundarbans, seeking clues to an ancient Bengali legend. That visit thrusts him into an adventure that connects him with Bangladeshi migrants in Libya, dolphins in the Mediterranean and venomous water snakes in California, while touching on migration, xenophobia and technology.
In his 2016 nonfiction book of essays, "The Great Derangement," Ghosh wrote about his ancestors, "ecological refugees long before the term was invented" who lived on the shores of the Padma River in what is now Bangladesh. "One day in the mid-1850s the great river suddenly changed course, drowning the village," he writes. "It was this catastrophe that had unmoored our forebears."
About a century later, Ghosh was born in Kolkata, a city that sits near India's border with Bangladesh and serves as the starting point for Deen's journey. Ghosh's life, like Deen's, has stretched across countries, from India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to Britain and eventually the United States, where he now lives.
While studying in New Delhi in the late 1970s, Ghosh experienced a tornado and hailstorm -- phenomena previously unheard-of in India. He struggled to incorporate the episode into his fiction because, as he explained in "The Great Derangement," it is difficult for a writer to use a case of "extreme improbability" without it seeming contrived.
Ghosh came up with the idea for "Gun Island" in the early 2000s when he was researching another novel, "The Hungry Tide," that explores the rivers of the Sundarbans, whose ecosystem supports the endangered Bengal tiger and thousands of other species. But Ghosh could already see the impact of climate change: bigger waves and worsening cyclones that hindered farming. That shift, over the years, has directly or indirectly forced a sizable number of the four million inhabitants of the Sundarbans to flee to parts of India and Bangladesh.
"Gun Island" is likely to resonate in Italy, said Anna Nadotti, his friend and Italian translator of over 30 years, as the country grapples with an influx of migrants fleeing war, persecution and climate crises. "Politically, socially and also culturally, it's important to give people all the means to understand what is really happening, why all these people are coming," she said.
"Even if sometimes in 'Gun Island' Amitav invents, nothing is fictional," she added, pointing out a scene from the book that is familiar to many Italians: a boat full of migrants, stranded at sea because it has been denied permission to dock.
At one point in "Gun Island," Deen arrives in Los Angeles for an antiquarian book dealers conference at a museum. Wildfires burn nearby. The conference, at first, goes on. But soon, the bibliophiles, librarians and book dealers are told to evacuate because the winds are changing direction, making the blaze's path increasingly unpredictable.
It seems to mirror when fires came perilously close to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles in 2017, raising concerns they would destroy the artifacts inside. Ghosh said he wrote the scene six months earlier.
Later in the story, Deen confronts a freakish hailstorm and fierce "gusts of winds" in Venice. Two months ago, the real-life city was battered by hailstones and winds powerful enough to toss a cruise ship about.
That a novel seems to anticipate some of these unusual weather events is proof to Ghosh that literature should devote more attention to the environment.
"Fact," he said, "is outrunning fiction."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee plans to vote this week to formalize procedures for a growing impeachment inquiry, clarifying its investigative authorities and granting President Trump new due process, a draft resolution shows.
The Judiciary Committee took similar steps in the 1970s and 1990s when it conducted impeachment inquiries into Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. Now, as then, Democrats believe the resolution, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, will allow the panel to speed up its work and potentially elicit more information than it otherwise could about instances of possible obstruction of justice and abuses of power by Mr. Trump.
The development carries significant symbolic weight, as well.
Though the committee has already informed federal courts and the public that it is in the midst of a full-scale impeachment inquiry, the three-page resolution will be the first time lawmakers have recorded a vote to that effect. Committee leaders hope the move will send a signal to Congress and the White House that their investigation is not only proceeding but intensifying, even as the broader Democratic Party caucus remains divided over the merits of ultimately voting to impeach Mr. Trump.
Based on the committee's investigative plans, the new procedures could be put to the test quickly in the coming weeks.
The committee is preparing to rapidly broaden the substance of the inquiry this fall beyond the investigation into any role by Trump associates in Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. On the agenda for new scrutiny are Mr. Trump's role in illegal hush payments to women who said they had affairs with him, reports that he dangled pardons to immigration officials and whether his hotels and resorts have illegally profited from government spending.
[Read more about the Democrats' expanding inquiry.]
If adopted, the new procedures would allow the committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, to designate hearings of either the full Judiciary Committee or its subcommittees to be a part of the inquiry and subject to special rules. Though it sounds inconsequential, including the smaller, nimbler subcommittees in the inquiry would allow Democrats to speed up their work or steer less significant witnesses to the smaller panels.
Another provision says that after lawmakers themselves have exhausted time for questioning, committee staff members would be allowed to question a witness "for an additional hour equally divided between the majority and minority." Democrats hope the arrangement will allow for more detailed, uninterrupted questioning.
The resolution also sets out standards that say information collected by the committee from witnesses or grand jury information shared by the courts should be kept private unless Mr. Nadler chooses otherwise.
And, for the first time, Mr. Trump and his legal team would be afforded specific due process by the committee, allowing them to regularly offer input on the findings of the investigation.
"The president's counsel may respond in writing to information and testimony presented to the committee in open session," the resolution says, adding that Mr. Trump's lawyers may also be invited to review and respond to information kept secret if the chairman chooses.
One of the aides involved in drafting the resolution said that the president's lawyers could yet play a larger, in-person role, as well, if they requested it.
There may be other benefits to taking a procedural vote, too. Though the resolution does not mention matters of decorum, Democrats believe the vote to adopt it will allow lawmakers to get around normal House rules that limit their ability to accuse the president of crime, the aide said.
The Judiciary Committee plans to finalize the resolution on Monday, the aides said, and could vote as soon as Wednesday to adopt it. Details of the procedures were first reported on Friday by Politico after Judiciary Committee aides briefed lawmakers on the planned vote, but the draft text has not previously been reported.
Lawmakers from the president's party have oscillated between criticizing the mechanics of Democrats' investigation and dismissing their' impeachment efforts as a pathetic and futile hunt for nonexistent evidence to oust Mr. Trump. But without the votes to overpower the Democrats, they have little recourse but to vocally object.
"If they really want to do this, they have to bring impeachment to the floor," the top Republican on the committee, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, said on Fox News on Sunday. "This is simply a show. It is a travesty. And, frankly, they should be ashamed."
The Judiciary Committee has been edging toward a full-scale impeachment inquiry since the spring, when Democrats began calling witnesses and demanding evidence related to a range of potential presidential misconduct.
But only in July, after testimony from Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, did the committee formally declare to a judge that what had begun as a regular congressional oversight investigation was now primarily focused on whether to recommend articles of impeachment.

Texto completo: In prisoner swap, Russia and Ukraine fly 35 each to freedom
MOSCOW - Russia and Ukraine conducted a major prisoner exchange that freed 35 people detained in each country and flew them to the other, a deal that could help advance Russia-Ukraine relations and end five years of fighting in Ukraine's east.
The trade involved some of the highest-profile prisoners caught up in a bitter standoff between Ukraine and Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy greeted the freed prisoners as they stepped down from the airplane that had brought them from Moscow to Kyiv's Boryspil airport. Relatives waiting on the tarmac surged forward to hug their loved ones.
Among those Russia returned was Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, whose conviction for preparing terrorist attacks was denounced abroad, and 24 Ukrainian sailors taken with a ship the Russian navy seized last year.
"Hell has ended; everyone is alive and that is the main thing," Vyacheslav Zinchenko, 30, one of the released sailors, said.
The prisoners released by Ukraine included Volodymyr Tsemakh, who commanded a separatist rebel air defense unit in the area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysian airliner was shot down in 2014, killing 298 people aboard.
Critics saw freeing Tsemakh as an act of submissiveness to Russia, but the exchange "allows Zelenskiy to fulfill one of his main pre-election promises," Ukrainian analyst Vadim Karasev told The Associated Press.
Zelenskiy has promised new initiatives to resolve the war in eastern Ukraine between government troops and the separatist rebels.

Director of MIT's Media Lab steps down over Epstein ties
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - The director of a prestigious research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned Saturday following uproar over his financial ties with financier Jeffrey Epstein, The New York Times reported Saturday.
Ito's resignation comes after The New Yorker reported that the Media Lab tried to conceal the extent of its fundraising relationship with Epstein.
Rafael Reif, MIT's president, said last month that the university took $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years. Epstein also reportedly arranged $7.5 million in donations.
On Saturday, Reif ordered an independent probe. Two researchers had resigned over news the lab and Ito took money from Epstein after he did time a decade ago for sex offenses with young girls.
Epstein killed himself last month while awaiting his sex trafficking trial.

In new blow, Cabinet minister quits Johnson's government
LONDON - A British Cabinet minister has quit Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, saying she disagrees with his Brexit strategy.
Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd's resignation comes days after the prime minister's brother Jo Johnson also quit the government over Brexit.
Rudd said she could not "stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled."
Just last week Johnson kicked 21 lawmakers out of the Conservative group in Parliament after they sided with the opposition to pass a law designed to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a divorce deal.
Rudd told the Sunday Times she will sit as an independent.
Johnson says Britain must leave the EU Oct. 31 even if there is no deal.

Hundreds march against first Bosnian LGBT pride parade
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina - Several hundred people marched in Bosnia's capital Saturday to show their disapproval of a weekend LGBT pride parade that will be the country's first.
A pride parade is scheduled for Sunday in Sarajevo, the only capital city in the Balkans that hasn't hosted one yet. U.S. and European Union officials working in Bosnia have expressed support.
Participants in the protest march said they wanted to promote what conservatives call "traditional family values."
They held banners and balloons, and the march ended without requiring police attention.
But Bosnian police have called for reinforcements at Sunday's parade. They worry Muslim and soccer hooligan groups with strong anti-gay views may try to disrupt the event.

Israeli PM decries suspected Gaza drone attack
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Gaza's Hamas rulers Saturday with a "vigorous response" after militants used a drone to drop a bomb on the Israeli side of the Gaza-Israel perimeter fence.
This appeared to be the first-ever attempt to carry out an attack with a drone piloted from Gaza. The Israeli army said the drone released "what seems to be an explosive device" and lightly damaged an army vehicle near the fence.
The military said it retaliated with an airstrike against Palestinian militants responsible for the attack. There were no reports of injuries on the Palestinian side.
Netanyahu is in the midst of a reelection campaign, with less than two weeks to go before a do-over vote after he failed to secure a parliamentary majority in April's election.

Hong Kong police manage to thwart airport protest
HONG KONG - Hong Kong police thwarted another disruption at the airport by pro-democracy activists but had to battle protesters at subway stations Saturday, as the months-long unrest showed no signs of abating even after the government offered a concession days earlier.
Police mounted road checks and inspected passengers on trains and buses heading to the airport to weed out protesters.
Hong Kong's airport, the world's eighth busiest, has been a frequent target during a summer of protests sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Wednesday that her government would withdraw the bill, but that failed to appease protesters.

In Zimbabwe: Former Presient Robert Mugabe will be buried at a hilltop shrine reserved exclusively for Zimbabwe's ruling elite, an official said Saturday, as the southern African nation began several days of official mourning.
Mugabe, who was 95 when he died Friday in Singapore, will be laid to rest in Harare at the National Heroes Acre, which has been set aside for Zimbabweans who have made huge sacrifices during the war against white-minority rule and who dedicated themselves to the nation, which emerged from the ashes of colonial Rhodesia.
Leo Mugabe, a nephew of Robert Mugabe, said the date of the funeral and other details weren't yet available.

Texto completo: "I didn't realize I would be living in poetry so much," says vocalist Carla Connors.
As the long-standing president of the Board of Directors for the Artist Series of Tallahassee, Connors is tasked with bringing classical musicians and vocalists to the city. A singer for many decades, she continually seeks inspiration for herself and audiences. Connors is looking forward to the series ringing in its 25th season this fall with "Vocal Tapestry" on Sept. 15.
As a performer, Connors understands the importance of experiencing live classical music. Her own standout operatic role occurred while touring with the New York City Opera National Company's production of "Le nozze di Figaro." Taking on the part of Mozart's Susanna, she recalls singing in Florida State's Ruby Diamond Concert Hall in 1991 as a part of another presenting series.
"I have performed in series like this and that experience isn't just fabulous for the audience, but for those performing as well," says Connors. "It's incredibly energizing to be in a place where there's an audience really listening and absorbing."
Connors caught her first glimpse of a professional performance after graduating with her BFA from the University of South Dakota. She attended the Metropolitan Opera on tour in Minneapolis as a graduation present. Though she was both a flutist and singer growing up, Connors made the decision to follow singing after falling in love with the words that accompanied the music.
"I craved storytelling, character creation and acting on stage," says Connors. "Whereas you can tell a beautiful story on a flute you don't have real words. I discovered I desperately needed words as part of my artistic output."
She earned a master's and doctorate degree from the University of Michigan and launched into a career touring the United States and Europe with a multitude of symphonies and orchestras. Connors earned acclaim for her roles in reviews by the Detroit Free Press and the New York Times, and made a Carnegie Hall debut in 2001. While Mozart tops her list in terms of favorite works to perform, he keeps good company with the music composed by her husband, pianist and FSU professor Dr. Timothy Hoekman. Connors appreciates the attention to detail Hoekman demonstrates when writing for voice. She also treasures the opportunity to collaborate and ask questions in real time — a rarity with classical music given that many popular compositions are centuries old.
Preparing for a performance can take from many months to a year. Connors will listen to recordings then learn the music and translate the text if it's in a foreign language. Memorizing the music means internalizing its story, working with pianists to hear harmonies and singing with a vocal coach.
"Classical solo songs are mostly poetry set to music," describes Connors. "Some words and vowels feel better in different parts of your range. If the language is set beautifully, it should sound natural and feel conversational."
A master class with renowned soprano singer, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf completely changed Connors' view on the voice. Schwarzkopf emphasized the importance of interpreting words and embodying a character when singing. These guiding principles stayed with Connors throughout her career as she sought to share her joy with audiences.
Connors gives similar advice to the students she teaches weekly. She believes that everybody has something to say, and that a person only needs to search for what fits their own instrument to find their "most gorgeous sound." She also talks about the importance of sharing life experiences through the music instead of mimicking other singers.
"A teacher told me once that when you look into that audience, send love out there because someone in that audience needs the message that you're bringing tonight," says Connors. "I try to encourage people to be really good musicians and committed to the words they're singing. There are many ways to tell a story but we are recreating the music of the composer every time we sing so we must be true to what was created as we let it pass through our instrument."
Vocal Tapestry's "Beyond Boundaries: Songs of Hope and Peace" will explore stories from World War I as it features the works of early 20th century impressionists like Claude Debussy. Connors is excited to hear the ensemble paint a vocal journey through this time period. The ensemble is comprised of soprano Cristi Catt, mezzo-soprano Laurie Monahan, and alto Daniela Tosic, with flutist Nikolai Radan and pianist Arsentiy Kharitonov.
While Connors has her eye set on the next 25 years of the Artist Series, and is hopeful for a community that will continue to patronize the arts. From her seat in Opperman Music Hall, she anticipates the emotional depths that will be stirred up by the music as it fills both the ears and hearts of attendees.
"Singing is a window to the soul of the singer," says Connors. "It can feel so vulnerable to be a singer because you're opening your soul to an audience but that's also the beauty of it. You're sharing something so personal so you can lift people's spirits."

Texto completo: Tommy Orange is coming back to Spokane.
The celebrated author of "There There" will be part of the 2019-20 Gonzaga Visiting Writers Series. His visit is planned for Feb. 4, less than 10 months after he was here for Eastern Washington University's Get Lit festival.
But Meagan Ciesla, who coordinates the Gonzaga series, doesn't think that's a problem.
"There were a whole bunch of people who didn't get to see him" at Get Lit, she said, including herself.
"I just know that it's someone the whole Spokane community will be really excited about," she said. And that's the point of the Visiting Writers Series, to engage with people off campus, too.
"Usually with the bigger names, we'll get a bigger, wider draw," she said.
Ciesla said she wants Orange's visit to be a very student-centered event, so his talk will be mediated by a Gonzaga student.
Orange, who was born and raised in Oakland, California, is an enrolled member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. In his novel, he follows 12 characters from Native communities as they travel to the Big Oakland Powwow.
"There There" won the PEN/Hemingway Award and an American Book Award and was picked as one of the best books of 2018 by the New York Times, Washington Post, NPR and others.
Orange will speak at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 4 at Gonzaga's Hemmingson Ballroom. Spokane Falls Community College is partnering with Gonzaga for the event.
The rest of this year's series features a range of poets, fiction and nonfiction authors.
"I always just make sure that we have diverse coverage in writing style and background," Ciesla said.
Sept. 17: "Disability Poetics," featuring Denise Leto and Adam Giannelli and facilitated by Roseanne Quinn, at 7:30 p.m. in the Wolff Auditorium in Jepson. Giannelli is the author of 2017's "Tremulous Hinge," winner of the Iowa Poetry Prize. He teaches literature and creative writing at Hamilton College. He's also a poetry translator and a person who stutters.
Leto is a poet who has dystonia, a neurological muscle/voice disorder. Quinn will frame disability poetics and prepare the audience to be present for the poets during the pauses caused by their speech disorders, Ciesla said.
"Always with an eye to diversity and inclusion, I thought it was a great idea because we've never had an event like this."
Oct. 24: Nicholas Carr will speak about "Technology and the Humanities" at 7 p.m. in the Hemmingson Ballroom. Carr's books include the New York Times best-seller "The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains," which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. Carr's lecture will consider the access to technology and how that changes what society can do in the humanities and what we think about it, Ciesla said.
April 2: Award-winning poet and short-story author Jim Daniels will speak at 7:30 p.m. at the Wolff Auditorium. Daniels is an English professor at Carnegie Mellon University. His most recent poetry collections are "The Middle Ages" and "Street Calligraphy." In May, he released "The Perp Walk," a collection of related short stories. His writing often focuses on the working class.
All of the events are free and open to the community. For more information, visit gonzaga.edu.

4. ESAI (Morales)
The answer ESAI consists of four common letters in the alphabet, making it helpful for puzzle makers to use in a tough-to-fill area of the grid. This explains why ESAI has made nearly 120 appearances in The New York Times Crossword since Will Shortz became crossword editor in 1993.

Five years later, Mr. Gere gained widespread acclaim after co-starring in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" alongside Diane Keaton, and he emerged as a sex symbol in the 1980s.
Mr. Gere's most notable films include 1990's "Pretty Woman," co-starring Julia Roberts, and the 2002 adaptation of "Chicago," for which he won a Golden Globe.

Mr. Rea was also nominated for a Daytime Emmy for his performance as a Jewish rabbi in the 2001 children's TV movie "Snow in August."
Like LON, REA can be clued as more than just the actor. Other possible clues include the blues rock artist Chris Rea or the legal phrase mens rea from the Latin for "guilty mind."

The appeal of "Monsieur Hulot's Holiday" led to an Academy Award nomination for best writing, story and screenplay, and paved the way for other Hulot films "Mon Oncle" (1958), "Playtime" (1967), "Traffic" (1971) and "Parade" (1974).
Fun fact: Before pursuing a career in film, TATI was a professional rugby player for the Racing Club de France team.
Possible clues: "French comic actor Jacques," "Slapstick actor Jacques," "Jacques of 'Mon Oncle'," "Jacques who played Monsieur Hulot," "'Play Time' director Jacques," "'Mr. Hulot's Holiday' Oscar nominee"

Texto completo: I am caught between a cab and a crazy lady.
Over and over, a woman is smashing a taxi door into me, but I can't understand her rage. In that moment, I don't even feel the weight of the door.
For a few seconds, I am outside of my body. I was just trying to catch a cab in Paris.
The driver was a few steps ahead of me. As I made my way to his car, a woman frantically ran toward us across the street, from the opposite direction.
I was already at his car door, so I opened it. And before I could get safely inside, the door was crashing into me.
I'd been in Paris for six days — my first European adventure. I'd heard stories about traveling while black, but France was everything I wanted it to be. “Bonjour," the natives greeted me everywhere I went. Each day, I explored the cafes where James Baldwin wrote “Go Tell It on the Mountain" and “Giovanni's Room." I found solace in the places he spent time, like Shakespeare and Company.
Paris was his escape. And as I sipped hot chocolate in the late of night on Paris sidewalks turned patios, I felt peace. Jumping on the trampolines at the Tuileries with a sisterfriend, hands way in the air, across the street from the Louvre, I felt free. Even if it was fleeting, it was freeing.
With my feet in the grass at Luxembourg Gardens, I understood how this place became his home.
“It wasn't so much a matter of choosing France — it was a matter of getting out of America," Baldwin told The Paris Review in 1984. “I didn't know what was going to happen to me in France but I knew what was going to happen to me in New York. If I had stayed there, I would have gone under."
But there is no escaping racism. It comes with you in the carry-on bag called your skin.
And as I stood outside of a fancy shopping district where security stands at the entrances, being attacked by a white woman wearing a suit in broad daylight, I knew I did not have the right to be right. I was taught to defend myself.
I am American. I am black. And I am in France. I do not have the fame or black excellence of James Baldwin and Josephine Baker. Sometimes the love of black culture is so high, a few of our famous can sample freedom so long as power systems stay intact.
But I'm an everyday black American woman visiting from Boston, where Crispus Attucks, a fugitive from slavery, was the first casualty of the American Revolution. I was born in Virginia, where the first enslaved Africans in America were sold 400 years ago.
I knew I could not fight this lady. Eric Garner was choked to death five years ago on a New York street as he said, “I can't breathe."
Last month, Daniel Pantaleo — the NYPD officer who choked Garner — was finally fired.
The chokehold was illegal. The killing was on video. Pantaleo didn't go to jail. Five years after Garner's death, he lost his job and pension. A GoFundMe for him already has raised over $160,000.
And folk call that justice. No, I could not hit her back.
All I could think about is how I might die or be detained if I defended myself from this woman shouting in my face and attacking me. I took a deep breath and shoved the door back in her direction, giving me just enough room to be, well, free.
Except I wasn't free. I couldn't even look back. I had to just keep pushing forward, toward my friend, toward safety.
And that's when I felt the sting of her violence on my arm, very red but only slightly swollen.
The next day, pain pierced my elbow as I boarded a plane back to the states. I dropped my phone and smashed it.
I was not mad about my arm or my iPhone. I was hurt because I had not fought back.
The day after that, Nikole Hannah-Jones and The New York Times released The 1619 Project, an initiative observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery by examining the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans.
We became black Americans in 1619, our roots stripped from us, a new culture born.
Our people, black American people, were seen as subhuman. Whiteness could not exist without our blackness. And richness rested upon our oppression.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was less than 55 years ago. And we're still fighting for equity, for black lives to matter.
“This belief, that black people were not merely enslaved but were a slave race, became the root of the endemic racism that we still cannot purge from this nation to this day," Hannah-Jones writes.
And the thing about this nation is America is a world leader. Our influence is everywhere. If we cannot correct racism, if our country continues to uphold systemic oppression and anti-blackness, how can we expect to move about the world and not have run-ins with crazy cab ladies?
I am a black American at all times. But being a black and brown Parisian isn't easy, either.
The Paris banlieues riots against brutality and inequality were in 2005. Protestors want liberation, too. Racism and classism live everywhere.
While walking through a lovely Parisian boutique the day before the attack, a salesman asked me, “Mademoiselle, are you finding happiness here?"
What a beautiful question, I thought. We should all stop and ask ourselves that throughout the day. And the thing is, I was happy. I felt, for the first time in a very long while, light.
Even as I held my elbow on the plane back to America, I clung to that buoyancy. I could still smell the fresh baked bread and that delectable taste of molten chocolate. I couldn't wait to sing “Bonsoir" to my friends.
I closed my eyes and held onto images of Monet's “Water Lilies" and thoughts of Baldwin and Richard Wright talking black creativity over cocktails back in the day.
Yes, I found happiness in France. And I smiled when my feet touched the cobbly sidewalks of Boston again, too. I'm back in Massachusetts, where Belinda Sutton successfully petitioned the courts for her promised pension when her master died. Reparations. There's a lot of ways to fight back the system that seeks to singe our spirit.
In America, in France, all around the world, I know this truth to be self-evident:
Despite all people being created equal, it is not our lived experience. From sea to shining sea, black is black, and we deserve joy and we deserve to be free.

Texto completo: NPR, the public radio and podcasting giant, has a new leader after years of growth and internal turmoil.
Its new president and chief executive is John Lansing, a former cable executive who for the last five years has run the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the federally funded organization behind broadcasters like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Lansing, 62, praised NPR as a home of high-quality journalism and audio production, and said that in addition to supporting traditional radio broadcasting he wanted to help NPR further its expansion into areas like podcasts, where the radio network has already been a leader.
"You have shows like 'All Things Considered' and 'Morning Edition,' which will continue to be broadcasting tent poles," Mr. Lansing said. "At the same time, we have to think creatively. Podcasting in particular allows NPR to reach audiences that are not necessarily tied to a radio."
Paul Haaga, the chairman of NPR's board, said in a statement that Mr. Lansing was "a listener and a collaborative leader with a passion for our public service journalistic mission who will help us continue to expand the audience for our storytelling."
According to Nielsen data supplied by NPR, its programs and newscasts had an overall audience of 27.4 million in spring 2019.
Podtrac, which measures the audiences of podcast publishers, has consistently placed NPR at the top of its monthly rankings. For July, NPR's 60 active shows -- among them "Planet Money," "Fresh Air" and "Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me!" -- were downloaded 141 million times and had nearly 21 million listeners in the United States, according to Podtrac.
Mr. Lansing will start in October, replacing Jarl Mohn, who has run NPR since 2014. Mr. Mohn led the push into podcasting and helped stabilize the organization after years of management turnover and budget deficits.
In Mr. Mohn's first full year on the job, NPR operated in the black after having run a deficit for five of the six preceding years. For the year that ended last September, NPR reported $ 241 million in expenses.
Yet Mr. Mohn's tenure was also marked by a sexual harassment scandal involving a senior news executive whom he had hired and a labor clash with hundreds of union workers.
In 2017, Michael Oreskes, NPR's senior vice president for news, left after two women accused him of unwanted physical advances in the 1990s, when he was the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. Mr. Mohn was pressed about his leadership in a tense NPR interview and later apologized to employees for not taking action sooner.
Mr. Lansing, who began his career as a teenage cameraman at a television station in Kentucky, spent two decades at Scripps Networks. At the U.S. Agency for Global Media -- known until last year as the Broadcasting Board of Governors -- he presided over 53 percent growth in the weekly audience for the agency's networks over the last three years, to 345 million. The agency has an annual budget of $ 808 million.
Mr. Lansing's colleagues attribute the growth to his embrace of digital formats and the understanding of audiences that he gleaned from the private sector.
"We are different from other federal agencies," said Grant K. Turner, the agency's chief financial officer. "We are not just putting out regulations or policies and paperwork. It's a real business with real market dynamics."
Networks like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are meant to counter disinformation from foreign governments by broadcasting objective reports, although they have always been dogged by an accusation that they are a form of American propaganda. Mr. Lansing rejected that accusation, saying that the agency was independent by law.
Last year, however, the U.S. Agency for Global Media came under fire when it emerged that it had bought Facebook ads targeting American citizens, in violation of laws meant to protect Americans from domestic propaganda.
A review by the House Foreign Affairs Committee faulted the agency for insufficient oversight but noted that an internal task force was already "having an impact." In an interview, Mr. Lansing called the ads a "rogue incident" and said it had been corrected.

Texto completo: Do retirees face a crisis of rising bankruptcies? That’s what pretty much every major news outlet would have you believe. “The boomers going bust: why elderly bankruptcy is rising in America,” headlines a recent long-form article in the Financial Times. “Bankruptcy Booms Among Older Americans,” says the New York Times, while the Washington Post tells us that “Bankruptcy filings surging for seniors.”
“Bankruptcy is hitting more older Americans, pointing to a retirement crisis in the making,” writes Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik. And these news stories all point to the same purported causes: declining incomes due to falling Social Security benefits and disappearing traditional pensions, coupled with rising retiree healthcare costs.
But claims of rising retiree bankruptcies are just plain false. They reflect the news media’s bizarre obsession with portraying Americans’ retirement security in the most dire terms possible, perhaps out of a desire for more clicks and views.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel is based on over 13 million credit reports drawn from the credit bureau Equifax. Despite the New York Times claims that bankruptcy is hitting “a rapidly growing share of older Americans,” the Fed’s data show that show that from 2000 to 2018, the bankruptcy rate for Americans age 60 and over fell by 37% — from 4.1 bankruptcies per 1,000 Americans in 2000 to just 2.6 per 1,000 in 2018.
As a 2018 Fed analysis points out, “bankruptcy filings among older Americans have always been quite low. Even after climbing during the Great Recession, filings fell again to very low levels.”
Moreover, other indicators of retiree financial distress in the Consumer Credit Panel, such as rates of home foreclosure and credit card delinquencies, are also lower today than they were in 2000. In short, you just can’t factually paint the picture these news stories portray.
The “bankruptcy boom” stories have a number of errors in common, all of which point to careless journalism.
First, the newspapers relied on a single study that used samples as small as 120 retirees and measured bankruptcies inconsistently between different years. The far superior Fed data were only a Google search away, yet none of these journalists seemed able to locate them.
Second, even the single study they relied upon finds only an increase in retiree bankruptcy rates between 1991 and 2001, with no indications of significant change in the nearly two decades since that time. That seems noteworthy in itself, but none of the media treatments of supposedly booming bankruptcies even noted it.
Moreover, from 1991 to 2001 bankruptcies rose among Americans of all ages, making retiree-specific causes like disappearing pensions a highly unlikely culprit. A more likely culprit is the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, which a Federal Reserve analysis states, “actually encouraged bankruptcy by increasing personal property federal exemptions.”
This point is key: bankruptcy rates depend as much on legal eligibility rules as on changing economic conditions.
So what can we say about retirees’ financial security? Well, what retirees themselves say is that they’re doing well. In the Fed’s 2018 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, only 4% of retirees said they were “finding it hard to get by.” Likewise, 75% of retirees in the Fed’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances said they had at least enough money to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living, versus only 61% in 1992. Congressional Budget Office data show that since 1979, incomes for retirees have risen dramatically faster than for working-age households, and Census Bureau data show that poverty in old age is rarer than among working-age adults or kids.
Things aren’t perfect, but this isn’t a picture of growing financial insecurity.
How do these major media outlets, supposedly employing the best-and-brightest journalists, get retiree bankruptcies so wrong? The same way they get nearly everything on retirement incomes wrong. They buy unquestioningly into a narrative that retirees are living on the brink and workers are saving little for old age. They cling to this erroneous notion in the face of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Federal Reserve, the IRS and others showing that poverty among retirees has never been lower and savings by workers has never been higher.
Retirement is a hugely important issue, but Americans are being disserved by the media’s coverage of it.

Michelle Goldberg: Dare we dream of the end of the GOP?

Texto completo: Toward the end of his new book, “R.I.P. G.O.P.,” renowned Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg makes a thrilling prediction, delivered with the certainty of prophecy. “The year 2020 will produce a second blue wave on at least the scale of the first in 2018 and finally will crash and shatter the Republican Party that was consumed by the ill-begotten battle to stop the New America from governing,” he writes.
It sounds almost messianic: the Republican Party, that foul agglomeration of bigotry and avarice that has turned American politics into a dystopian farce, not just defeated but destroyed. The inexorable force of demography bringing us a new, enlightened political dispensation. Greenberg foresees “the death of the Republican Party as we’ve known it,” and a Democratic Party “liberated from the nation’s suffocating polarization to use government to advance the public good.” I’d like to believe it, and maybe you would, too. But should we?
This is not the first time that experts have predicted the inevitable triumph of progressive politics. Seventeen years ago, John Judis and Ruy Teixeira published “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” which argued that the country was on the cusp of a liberal political realignment driven by growing diversity, urbanization and gender equality. In sheer numerical terms they were right; between then and now the Republican Party won the presidential popular vote only once, in 2004. But Republicans still have more power than Democrats, and in 2017, Judis disavowed his book’s thesis, arguing that only populist economics could deliver Democratic victories.
As it happens, Greenberg, who became famous as Bill Clinton’s pollster in 1992 and consulted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, told me he used to “shudder” at the “Emerging Democratic Majority” analysis. “I’m used to campaigns in which you impact what’s going to happen,” he said. “The idea that it’s just going to happen because of trends is dangerous. And it was dangerous with Hillary.”
There’s a fascinating tension in “R.I.P. G.O.P.” Greenberg is scathing about the failures of the Hillary Clinton campaign, accusing it of “malpractice.” Yet he believes that at least some of the political assumptions that were mistaken in 2016 will be sound in 2020.
Greenberg suggests that Clinton erred by focusing too much on multiculturalism at the expense of class, and by trying to discredit Donald Trump as a vulgarian rather than a plutocrat. As Clinton wrote in “What Happened,” her post mortem of her shattering loss, Greenberg “thought my campaign was too upbeat on the economy, too liberal on immigration, and not vocal enough about trade.”
Yet going into 2020, Greenberg believes that what he calls the “rising American electorate” — including millennials, people of color and single women — will ensure Democratic victory, almost regardless of whom the party nominates. “We’re dealing with demographic and cultural trends, but we’re also dealing with people that are organizing and talking to one and another and becoming much more conscious of their values,” he said.
In his polling and focus groups, he’s seeing that the reaction to Trump is changing people. “The Trump presidency so invaded the public’s consciousness that it was hard to talk to previously disengaged and unregistered unmarried women, people of color and millennials without them going right to Trump,” he writes. A few months after the election, he realized he could no longer put Clinton and Trump voters in focus groups together because indignant Clinton voters, particularly women, so dominated the conversations. “This turned out to be an unintended test of the strength of their views and resolve to resist,” he wrote.
That resolve to resist has led many voters to define their own beliefs in opposition to Trump’s. On immigration, for example, “every Trump outrage increased the proportion of Americans who said, ‘We are an immigrant country,’” writes Greenberg. Indeed, according to recent Pew data, 62% of Americans say that immigrants strengthen the country, while 28%, a near record low, see them as a burden.
Yet rather than modulating their anti-immigrant politics in response, Republicans have little choice but to double down because so many of their voters are driven by nativism. In this way, Greenberg sees an omen for the Republican Party in California. It’s hard to remember now, but the state was once the heartland of conservatism, nurturing the political careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. From 1968 to 1988, it voted Republican in every presidential election, and regularly elected Republican governors.
But in 1994, California Republicans, fearful of changing demography, campaigned for Proposition 187, a ballot initiative meant to make life miserable for immigrants living in the country illegally. It won — though courts blocked its implementation — but it also turned expanding constituencies in California against Republicans. Today the party has been reduced to an irrelevant rump faction in state politics.
The specter of California haunts the modern right; many conservatives see it as a portent of what demographic change will do to Republican power nationally. But California can just as easily be seen as a sign of how a political party can drive itself to ruin by making a cruel, doomed stand against the coming generation. If Greenberg is right, national Republicans, fearful of going the way of those in California, may have ensured precisely that fate.
But is he right? Unlike in California, you can’t win power in the United States just by getting the most votes. Political analyst David Wasserman has argued that Trump could lose the popular vote by as much as 5 million and still prevail in the Electoral College. Greenberg, however, is convinced that the 2018 midterms prove that mass turnout can overcome the Democrats’ structural disadvantages. “Every piece of data I have, the trends have moved to be more Democratic since 2018,” he said.
His confidence will not be enough to lessen the insomnia that has plagued me since the cursed night when Trump was elected. But his book should be a corrective to the media’s overweening focus on the mulish devotion of Trump voters. Trump hatred is a much more potent force in this country than Trump love. There is one way, and one way only, that Trump may surpass Barack Obama. Though Obama was a community organizer, Trump could turn out to be much better at mobilizing progressives.

This time, the road to New Hampshire might run through Iowa

Texto completo: The New Hampshire Democratic Party's convention on Saturday will feature the largest gathering of presidential candidates appearing on the same stage in state history.
Nineteen candidates — mayors, representatives, senators, businessmen, a governor, and a spiritual guru — are scheduled to speak inside a 12,000-person arena. While there, they might ask what exactly they need to do to win the state's first-in-the-nation primary in February.
Traditional answers — showing up early and often, wooing local activists, and buying television advertising — still apply. But this year, there is a growing belief that the path to winning New Hampshire might actually involve doing well somewhere else: Iowa, which is expected to hold its caucus eight days before the New Hampshire primary.
This is especially true for the frontrunners: former vice president Joe Biden and Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
And it's a dynamic quite different from the past, when Iowa and New Hampshire voters have generally gone in different directions.
“I think it is going to be very hard for all three of these candidates to come into New Hampshire with a full head of steam," said New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley. “At least one of them is not going to fare well in Iowa, and that is going to directly impact their chances in New Hampshire."
Biden never survived past the Iowa caucuses in his previous two runs for president. And for a campaign that is based on electability, losing Iowa could puncture his frontrunner status in a way that would make a New Hampshire comeback unlikely. And while many campaign analysts and donors believe New Hampshire will make or break Warren and Sanders, the way one could get a leg up is to best the other in the Iowa.
The campaigning so far this year has already reflected this reality. The campaigns are spending more time in Iowa than in New Hampshire. They have more staff there, and seven candidates are running television ads in Iowa, compared to one, businessman Tom Steyer, in New Hampshire.
To be sure, since 1972 when Iowa was placed ahead of New Hampshire on the presidential primary calendar, candidates who have fared well in Iowa have used momentum to buoy their campaigns back in New England.
But more often than not New Hampshire picked someone else for president. After George H.W. Bush won the 1980 Iowa caucuses, he declared he had “the big mo" — but then Ronald Reagan won the New Hampshire primary and eventually the Republican nomination and the presidency.
The two early states have split their votes ever since, with just two exceptions: Democrats Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004, who swept both states. No Republican has won both Iowa and New Hampshire in a competitive primary season.
But this time around, with such a large field, and with Democratic voters emphasizing electability, the notion of a candidate winning both states and quickly becoming the Democratic nominee is more likely than in past cycles.
This is especially concerning to those who support Biden, whose has long found his best early state is South Carolina, the fourth state to vote in the process.
Worried that Biden might not even make it to South Carolina if another candidate runs through the early states, the International Association of Firefighters, the first union to back Biden, will spend at least three weeks camped out in Iowa ahead of the vote there.
“Iowa is nothing less than huge," said Harold Schaitberger, the union's longtime president general, who concedes Biden might be at a disadvantage in New Hampshire against local candidates Warren and Sanders and need to put a win on the board. “We are going to be entirely focused on Iowa and doing what needs to be done, hoping that gives him a strong finish in New Hampshire."
As for Warren and Sanders, while New Hampshire is a must-win, they might be looking to Iowa to settle the New Hampshire grudge match.
“Both Warren and Sanders are evenly matched in New Hampshire and both know they need to win the state to survive, so I can see how they both are looking at Iowa as to how they are break their stalemate and get an advantage," said University of New Hampshire professor Dante Scala.
Indeed, both are heavily invested in Iowa. Sanders narrowly lost Iowa in 2016 to Hillary Clinton and still has the largest network of staff and volunteers there. Warren, meanwhile, has one of largest staffs in the state and visits there nearly as often as she goes to New Hampshire, which is a short jaunt from her home in Cambridge.
That said, former New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Joe Keefe is skeptical about the success of a New Hampshire-win-via-Iowa strategy in 2020.
“Sure, if a candidate can win both, that will be hard for anyone else to overcome," said Keefe, who is backing Senator Kamala Harris of California. “But an Iowa caucus voter is just different from the wide New Hampshire electorate made up of both Democrats and independents and probably more focused on electability."
However, Keefe and others all said that while Iowa could shift the playing field among the top tier of Democratic candidates, for the 15 or so other candidates it might be Iowa or bust.
“Given that only five or six candidates will even be able to continue their campaigns after Iowa, I think the most interesting thing to watch in the months ahead will be whether more of the minor candidates just shift to spend the majority of their time in Iowa as opposed to being 50-50 with New Hampshire," said Scala.

Texto completo: Ibram X. Kendi admittedly once trivialized racism.
The American University professor placed some of the blame for race relations in America on Blacks. In a speech delivered in 2000, while he was still in high school, Kendi suggested African Americans were too busy blaming their lot in life on racism life instead of being more proactive.
Today, the National BookAward-winning author is delivering a new take on racism in America through his latest work, "How to Be an Antiracist" (320 pages; OneWorld Publishing).
Kendi says that many Americans are smitten with the thought that they can somehow avoid being labeled as a racist only by a passive attempt at treating others as equals.
"When a person says that they are colorblind, to me, that means they are blind to racism, and they're blind to differences," Kendi told NBC News.
"People who say they don't see race is not seeing the diversity of humanity, whether that diversity is about skin color, or hair texture, or culture," he said.
In "How to Be an Antiracist," Kendi explains that his concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice inAmerica.
On his webpage, Kendi writes that evenmore fundamentally, his concept "points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other."
Instead of working with the policies and system in place, Kendi asks his readers to think about what an antiracist society might look like.
He questions how all can play an active role in building it.
Kendi weaves together a combination of ethics, history, law, and science - including the story of what he said is his awakening to antiracism.
A New York Times reviewer wrote:
"What do you do after you have written [Kendi's previous book] "Stamped From the Beginning," an award-winning history of racist ideas?... If you're Ibram X. Kendi, you craftanother stunner of a book... What emerges from these insights is the most courageous book to date on the problem of race in theWestern mind, a confessional of self-examination that may, in fact, be our best chance to free ourselves from our national nightmare."
Publishers Weekly reviewers wrote:
"A boldly articulated, historically informed explanation of what exactly racist ideas and thinking are... [Kendi's] prose is thoughtful, sincere, and polished. This powerful book will spark many conversations."
And, Kirkus Reviews said:
"A combination of memoir and extension of [Kendi's] towering Stamped from the Beginning... Never wavering... Kendi methodically examines racism through numerous lenses: power, biology, ethnicity, body, culture, and so forth... This unsparing honesty helps readers, both White and people of color, navigate this difficult intellectual territory... Essential."
Born in New York in 1982, Kendi's parents were student activists and Christians inspired by Black liberation theology.
He attended Florida A&M University, where he majored in journalism and freelanced for several Florida newspapers, and later, he interned at USA Today Sports Weekly, The Mobile [Ala.] Register and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
In 2004, Kendi graduated from Florida A&M with a degree in African American Studies.
At 27-years-old, he earned his doctoral degree in African American Studies from Temple University in 2010. A year earlier, Kendi took a job as an assistant professor of African American history at the State University of New York at Oneonta.
He became a full professor at 34-years-old.

Texto completo: It was a commemoration worthy of the ancestors. This past weekend was filled with nourishment for the spirit and the mind. "Welcome to these shores," Chief G. Anne Richardson, leader of the Rappahannock Tribe, told the audience of over five thousand. "No one had welcomed you upon your arrival," Richardson said. African Americans cheered. Some cried. This was one of many emotional moments during a week of events commemorating the African arrival to North America in 1619.
Activities included an acknowledgment of centuries of race-based harm against African Americans and ended with speeches about the possible ways to heal centuries of wounds. The Hampton, Va.-based commemoration gave breath to the essays recently published in The New York Times Magazine titled the "1619 Project." This year marked the 400th anniversary of the African arrival to the colony ofVirginia.
In 1619, "20 and odd Negroes" arrived at Old Point Comfort located on the shores ofVirginia. The colony was young, founded in 1607. John Rolf, secretary of the colony, noted the African arrival in his journal. It was from here that the nexus of African fortitude and European greed gave rise to presentday America. Africans were here before The Mayflower landed in 1620. They came with knowledge about farming, livestock and metalworks essential to the survival of this first permanent English colony in North America. Yet, relatively few Americans know of their existence in Virginia, the cornerstone of America. Few knew until this 400th commemoration held in Hampton.
Old Point Comfort is now named Fort Monroe. It is a National Park Service historic site and the largest fort in America. In Fort Monroe's Continental Park, white tents and a stage held dozens of speakers, like Chief Richardson, who were caught up in the somber experience on these historic grounds. Project 1619 founder Calvin Pearson and Dr. Bill Wiggins had been teaching the history of the African arrival in Virginia for 40 years. They persuaded scholars that the landing site was Hampton, Virginia-not Jamestown; thus, the location at Fort Monroe, in Hampton.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam was moved by the commemoration to pledge to create new pathways of opportunities for African Americans. He apologized for past racial transgressions. Northam had been publicly embanassed when photos of him surfaced wearing blackface at a Ku Klux Klanthemed party he attended during medical school. Sunday was a day of healing from past transgressions. Speakers provided their unique perspectives on healing. Rev. Dr. Michael Dyson spoke frankly of about how African Americans were denied credit for the building of America and said that an acknowledgement of their contributions would go far in their healing process.
Rev. Dr. Michael Battle, director of the Desmond Tutu Center, analyzed the word healing. Battle said that they "had taken the African identity and replaced it with their own." However, healing from tliis violent act could not be violent, he said. Bible verses and calls for forgiveness were intertwined with personal stories. Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax spoke of a friendship between his family and the descendants of the slaveholding Lord Fairfax of England.
Libations were poured to heal the land. Drummers played. Young people impressed adults, providing oratory, song and dance. Hip-hop performers Donovan Pollack and Imagine, Teens with a Purpose, gave a spoken word performance about the uprising of Nat Turner. These teens spoke of the prejudice against Black young people, ending their poem with the line "we are not strong enough to carry the weight of racial stereotypes."
This commemoration was possible through the work of grassroots organizations, nonprofit groups and politicians, including Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott, of Virginia. In 2018, Scott proposed the federal legislation creating a 400th Commission to commemorate the African arrival. But Scott spoke of legislation still needed to advance African Americans economically and educationally in the face of past and ongoing discrimination. There is still much to do, he said.
Forgiveness was offered and requested. A delegation from Nigeria and Ghana poured a libation to heal the earth and ask forgiveness for their role in the slave trade. Former Gov. Robert F McDonnell asked the attendees to forgive the acts of the first governor of Virginia who purchased the first Africans instead of protecting them. Terry E. Brown was the visionary behind this commemorative weekend. "Forgiveness is meant to heal yourself." Brown is a leader with the National Park Service and the superintendent of Fort Monroe. He led a recitation of forgiveness. Fort Monroe played a crucial role in the Civil War as a place of security for Africans who were escaping enslavement and were considered contrabands of war.
Officer Brown spoke of being visibly moved by the commemoration as were many in attendance. The brutality of enslavement was ever present. "After 246 years of slavery and over a century of discrimination, 1 am not going to resolve racism with one event," Brown said. He believes America is taking steps to acknowledge the contribution of African Americans and the harm of enslavement The 1619 commemoration was one ray of hope. Healing will be an ongoing process.
Gloria J. Browne-Marshall is the author of "Race, Law and American Society: 1607 to Present" and "The Voting Rights War." She is professor of constitutional law at John Jay College (CUNY), chair of the 400th Commemoration oj ASALH and a legal correspondent covering the U.S. Supreme Court.

How to Be an Anti-Racist, According to Educator Ibram X. Kendi

Texto completo: Ibram X. Kendi admittedly once trivialized racism.
The American University professor placed some of the blame for race relations in America on blacks. In a speech delivered in 2000, while he was still in high school, Kendi suggested African Americans were too busy blaming their lot in life on racism life instead of being more proactive.
Today, the National Book Award-winning author is delivering a new take on racism in America through his latest work, "How to Be an Antiracist" (320 pages; One World Publishing).
Kendi says that many Americans are smitten with the thought that they can somehow avoid being labeled as a racist only by a passive attempt at treating others as equals.
"When a person says that they are colorblind, to me, that means they are blind to racism, and they're blind to diferences," Ken-di told NBC News. "People who say they don't see race is not seeing the diversity of humanity, whether that diversity is about skin color, or hair texture, or culture."
In "How to Be an Antiracist," Kendi explains that his concept reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America. Instead of working with the policies and system in place, Kendi asks his readers to think about what an anti-racist society might look like.
He questions how all can play an active role in building it.
Kendi weaves together a combination of ethics, history, law, and science - including the story of what he said is his awakening to anti-racism.
A New York Times reviewer wrote:
"What do you do after you have written [Kendi's previous book] 'Stamped From the Beginning,' an award-winning history of racist ideas?... If you're Ibram X. Ken-di, you craft another stunner of a book... What emerges from these insights is the most courageous book to date on the problem of race in the Western mind, a confessional of self-examination that may, in fact, be our best chance to free ourselves from our national nightmare."
Publishers Weekly reviewers wrote:
"A boldly articulated, historically informed explanation of what exactly racist ideas and thinking are... [Kendi's] prose is thoughtful, sincere, and polished. This powerful book will spark many conversations."
Kirkus Reviews said:
"A combination of memoir and extension of [Kendi's] towering Stamped from the Beginning... Never wavering... Kendi methodically examines racism through numerous lenses: power, biology, ethnicity, body, culture, and so forth... This unsparing honesty helps readers, both white and people of color, navigate this difcult intellectual territory... Essential."
Born in New York in 1982, Kendi's parents were student activists and Christians inspired by Black liberation theology.
He attended Florida A&M University, where he majored in journalism and freelanced for several Florida newspapers, and later, he interned at USA Today Sports Weekly, the Mobile [Ala.] Register and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
In 2004, Kendi graduated from Florida A&M with a degree in African American Studies.
At 27 years old, he earned his doctoral degree in African American Studies from Temple University in 2010. A year earlier, Kendi took a job as an assistant professor of African American history at the State University of New York at Oneonta.
He became a full professor at 34 years old.
According to his biography, Kendi has been visiting professor at Brown University, a 2013 National Academy of Education/Spencer Postdoctoral Fellow, and postdoctoral fellow at the Rutgers Center for Historical Analysis.
He has also resided at the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress as the American Historical Association's 2010-2011 J. Franklin Jameson Fellow in American History.
In the summer of 2011, Kendi lived in Chicago as a short-term fellow in African American Studies through the Black Metropolis Research Consortium.
He has received research fellowships, grants, and visiting appointments from a variety of other universities, foundations, professional associations, and libraries, including the Lyndon B. Johnson Library & Museum, University of Chicago, Wayne State University, Emory University, Duke University, Princeton University, UCLA, Washington University, Wake Forest University, and the historical societies of Kentucky and Southern California.
In his new book, Kenzi noted that "racial inequity is a problem of bad policy, not bad people."
He says, "denial is the heartbeat of racism" and "being an anti-racist requires persistent self-awareness, constant self-criticism and regular self-examination."
The book is available on Amazon.com and other outlets.

Texto completo: Following a brief illness, best-selling author Dorothea Benton Frank died Monday, the family of the South Carolina writer said.
Frank wrote 20 books, all primarily set in South Carolina's Lowcountry, according to her website. Many titles bear the names of Palmetto State locales, such as "Sullivan's Island," "Isle of Palms," "Pawley's Island" and "Folly Beach," among others.
The 67-year-old's most recent book, "Queen Bee," debuted at No. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller List when it was released in May, the Charleston City Paper reported.
"I write about where I want to be. If I'm not there (in the Lowcountry), I want to be there," Frank said in an interview with the Post and Courier.
"I think I've learned that if you want to be successful, you have to tell your story honestly and from your heart — and I think a healthy sense of humor doesn't hurt either," Frank said of her writing style, according to a tweet from bookseller Barnes & Noble.
"A spokesperson for HarperCollins said Frank died after being diagnosed with "myelodysplastic syndrome, a cancer similar to leukemia," according to WCIV.
Frank's family confirmed her death with a post on her Facebook page.
"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing (of) Dorothea Benton Frank, on September 2. Beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend, there are no words for this loss," the post said. "... Please keep family and friends in your prayers."
On Aug. 15, her family posted that Frank had been hospitalized "after a sudden illness" and was receiving treatment.
Frank is survived by her husband, Peter Frank, and two children, Victoria Peluso and William Frank. Information on funeral arrangements was not available.
She was born and raised on Sullivans Island, and as an adult split time between there and a home in New Jersey, per WCIV.
The death of her mother helped inspire Frank to become an author, as she sought to write a book and sell a million copies to help purchase a family home, the Post and Courier reported.
"If I could only read one writer from now until the end of my life, it would be Dorothea Benton Frank," New York Times bestselling author Elin Hilderbrand said, according to WJCL.
"Her books are funny, sexy, and usually damp with sea water," fellow South Carolina best-selling author Pat Conroy said of Frank before his death in 2016, per the Charleston City Paper.
Conroy's widow, author Cassandra King, called Frank "a force of nature," who had "a big heart," according to the Post and Courier.
"Dottie Frank's books have the fizz of a gin and tonic, the hilarity of a night out at a comedy club and the warmth of a South Carolina sun," said Adriana Trigianis, another best-selling author, WJCL reported.
Author and TV producer Kathy Reichs tweeted, "I am gutted to hear of the passing of my dear friend Dorothea Benton Frank. We loved you Dottie. RIP."
Her 2000 debut novel "Sullivan's Island" has over a million copies in print and has been translated into 10 languages. She had published a new book each year since. "Queen Bee," published in May, reached No. 2 on the New York Times bestseller list.
"She was honestly the most disciplined person I have ever met," said friend and former Montclair, New Jersey, resident Christina Baker Kline, best-selling author of "Orphan Train," and "A Piece of the World."
At the same time, Kline says, Frank was "so much fun to be with, a very loving, generous, warm, down-to-earth person."
While Charleston held a special place for Frank, Montclair did too, according to Kline. "Dottie had a beautiful home in Montclair and loved to entertain and have friends over. But even when she did, she was up and at 'em the next day, writing."
The dramatic Montclair home of Dorothea Benton Frank and her husband Peter Frank, where they raised their two children, was featured this year in Montclair magazine and on NorthJersey.com. Though it is still the Franks' primary residence – Peter works in finance in New York City – the house has been on the market for the last couple of years, according to the couple's broker Sam Joseph. The listing price is $3.35 million.
Frank was active in the community. She has served on the boards of the Montclair Art Museum, Montclair Film Festival, Whole Theater, Drumthwacket Foundation and the NJ State Council on the Arts. She holds an honorary degree from Bloomfield College.

Texto completo: "I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space."
Marie Kondo
Our series "How I became a ..." digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From becoming fascinated with the art of tidying at the age of 5 to starting her own organizing business as a university student in Japan, Marie Kondo and her approach to tidying has sparked joy in people all across the globe. Her New York Times bestseller "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" helped Kondo share her lessons with the world, and her Netflix original series "Tidying Up With Marie Kondo" is up for two Emmy Awards.
USA TODAY caught up with Kondo to talk about everything from the happiness she gets from organizing items into tiny boxes to producing her own television show for Netflix.
Question: How did you get your start?
Marie Kondo: When it comes to tidying, I was interested in tidying ever since I was 5 years old, and by the time I entered middle school, I dove into researching tidying. I was 19 years old when I became a professional organizing consultant. One of my hobbies when I was in college was to go tidy my friends' homes, and the word-of-mouth quickly spread that when Marie comes to visit your home, your home becomes incredibly tidy.
When I began my organizing consulting business, the wait list became half a year long, so I received a request from one of my clients that they wanted to read my lessons in book form, (and) that was how the book came to be.
Q: How has your career changed since?
Kondo: What I do to impart what I know about tidying hasn't changed at all. But I've always mainly worked in Japan before – now, I have a lot of TV appearances, and the scale of my lectures and presentations I give certainly have changed. I also work predominantly in the U.S. now, so it's changed quite a bit.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Kondo: For today, for instance, I'm writing a new book, so sometimes I do that. I also create videos related to my tidying lessons, and for Japan I have a Japan exclusive online service, so I have to write content for that. Very full days.
Q: What is your favorite thing about your job?
Kondo: I love creating storage. I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space – my client's space – that we're working with. It feels so great.
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Kondo: I think I credit that to my home is tidy, but my decision-making skills are very tidy. I always feel like I'm attuned to what I need to be doing at that particular moment.
Q: How do you balance work, life and such a busy schedule?
Kondo: I wonder (laughs). In terms of balance, I always try to carve out a time that sparks joy for me, whether that is a time for reflection or relaxing and playing with my children. I make sure that I save that time so that I can always maintain myself to be at 100%, and then I try to think how to conduct my schedule in a most effective way.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Kondo: Producing my own TV show for Netflix – it's been amazing.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Kondo: To put it succinctly, I would to say to trust in what sparks joy for you. Trust in your own sense of what sparks joy for you.
"I like working with tiny little boxes, and it's almost like a puzzle when it fits exactly into that space."

Texto completo: The Boston Globe on Wednesday named Bina Venkataraman as its new editorial page editor. The 39-year-old Somerville resident brings a varied background as a journalist, author, and thinker on environmental and ­science matters to one of the highest profile jobs at New England's largest media company.
In a statement Wednesday, Venkataraman said she wants to see the Globe amplify “diverse voices of our city and better showcase Boston's groundbreaking ideas and knowledge, while holding our leaders and institutions accountable for meeting high ­expectations for public service."
“The Globe Opinion section has the opportunity to feature more of the voices and perspectives that hail from the many Bostons that exist today," she said. “We have the chance to reflect the richness of this region's vibrant neighborhoods and cultures, its world-class thinkers and community activists, its history-keepers and technology trailblazers."
During a brief phone interview Wednesday evening, Venkataraman spoke of the importance of level-headed editorials at a time when the country is at “perhaps a historic level of political polarization."
“There are a lot of opinions in our media environment right now, and a lot of people are able to offer their opinions, so it raises the bar for what we produce," she said.
Venkataraman has lectured on science communication, science writing, and the shaping of science policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 2011. She is currently a fellow at the think tank New America, and the director of global policy initiatives at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. She will assume her Globe position in November.
A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Kennedy School, Venkataraman has previously covered health and science for the Globe, and had stints as a Globe metro correspondent and on the Globe's editorial board. She also worked on the science desk of The New York Times. In 2013 and 2014, she served as a senior adviser for climate change innovation in the Obama White House.
Her book, “The Optimist's Telescope: Thinking Ahead in a Reckless Age," was released in late August. On Wednesday, she said the book “dispels the myth that human nature and human society is condemned to be short-sighted."
“It's about how we can reclaim the ability to think about the future and plan for the future," she said.
In announcing the hire, the Globe's managing director, Linda Henry, called the paper's editorial board “one of the strongest and most vibrant editorial boards in the country."
“We tackle big issues in bold ways as well as subtle and everyday challenges," she said. “We thoughtfully look for ways to advocate, to progress, and to help others use their voices to inform and inspire others. We are thrilled and fortunate to add Bina's perspective and leadership to our board."
Venkataraman takes over the role from Ellen Clegg, who retired last year. Globe business columnist Shirley Leung served as interim editorial page editor before returning to her column this spring.

'Lehman Trilogy' To Move to Broadway

Texto completo: "The Lehman Trilogy," an acclaimed play chronicling the rise and spectacular collapse of what was once one of the country's largest investment banks, will move into the Nederlander Theater in March 2020 for a 16-week run after several sold-out stints.
Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley -- the original cast of multigenerational Lehmans in the London and Off Broadway runs -- will remain with the show for its transfer to Broadway, where performances begin on March 7.
"Behold them with wonder, humble theatergoer," Ben Brantley, The Times's co-chief theater critic wrote in a review of their performance in London last year, "for they are multitudes."
The three actors slip into more than a century's worth of characters, from the original three Lehman brothers -- Henry Lehman, portrayed by Mr. Beale, immigrates to America early on in the show -- to their descendants, colleagues and rivals.
(And they do it all from a giant glass box -- presumably one of the more complicated elements of moving to a new theater.)
Both the original London production at the National Theater and the Off Broadway run at the Park Avenue Armory were New York Times Critic's Picks. The play, written by the Italian playwright Stefano Massini and adapted by Ben Power, also appeared recently in the West End and was staged several years ago in Paris and Milan.
"The Lehman Trilogy" has lined up an award-winning creative team, including the director Sam Mendes, who won a Tony Award this year for his direction of "The Ferryman," and the costume designer Katrina Lindsay, who has won two Tony Awards.
Producing the show are the National Theater, behind several recent Broadway hits including "Network" and "Angels in America," and Mr. Mendes's Neal Street Productions, whose "The Ferryman" won this year's Tony Award for best play. Scott Rudin, Barry Diller and David Geffen will also produce.
The Nederlander was previously home to "Pretty Woman," which closed in August. Harry Connick Jr. will begin performances of his ode to Cole Porter in December at the theater before embarking on a national tour.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

This is what 'total devastation' looks like

Texto completo: Hurricane Dorian claims its first life in the USA. Lyft faces a "sexual predator crisis. " And "Emily Doe" reveals her identity.
It's Ashley. Here's the news you need to know Wednesday.
But first, some fowl news: A 76-year-old woman was pecked to death by her rooster while gathering eggs.
Hurricane Dorian is on a collision course with the Carolinas
Hurricane Dorian swept past Florida on Wednesday, heading toward the Carolinas, claiming its first life in the USA and promising heavy rains, powerful winds and damaging surge. More than 1 million coastal residents from Florida to North Carolina faced evacuation orders. "Leave now if you are in an area where an evacuation has been ordered," North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper urged. "It is not worth putting your life – or the life of first responders – at risk. "
The death toll in the Bahamas from Dorian reached 20 people as a massive rescue effort was underway for those affected by the devastating storm. Photos of the damage caused on the islands are absolutely devastating. On two of the most severely ravaged islands, about 60,000 Bahamians need help immediately. “It’s total devastation. It’s decimated. Apocalyptic,” said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a hurricane relief group.
Even if Hurricane Dorian doesn’t make landfall in Georgia and the Carolinas, a storm surge is still a potentially deadly threat.
Marianne Williamson suggested the "power of the mind" to divert Hurricane Dorian's path.
Dorian isn't the only storm forecasters are watching: Tropical Storm Fernand made landfall in Mexico as Gabrielle spins in the Atlantic.
A 10-minute Lyft ride that ‘turned into a nightmare’
The ride-hailing company Lyft has a “sexual predator crisis,” a new lawsuit alleges, and has failed to protect its passengers. A case was filed Wednesday on behalf of 14 women who say they were sexually assaulted by their drivers in 2018 and 2019. The accounts in the lawsuit are harrowing: Gladys Arce, 40, a mother of four, told USA TODAY she was kidnapped for hours by a driver who teetered between professions of love and threats of violence before raping her. Months after she filed a police report, she says, police told her the man was still driving for Lyft. The allegations are at odds with Lyft’s public image as the socially conscious alternative to Uber – billing itself as a safe option for female passengers.
What everyone’s talking about
Superbad news if you wanted to end up with Jonah Hill – he is engaged to Gianna Santos, reports say.

A conversion therapy organization founder came out as gay.
Her name is Chanel Miller
Who is Emily Doe? That’s what many wondered about the anonymous woman Stanford University student Brock Turner sexually assaulted in 2015. Her 7,000-word victim impact statement went viral, sparking outrage and declaring to a nation swollen with survivors that they were not alone. Three years later, the woman wants us to know something else: her name. Wednesday, The New York Times reported the survivor who wrote the 12 pages of gut-wrenching eloquence is Chanel Miller.

Somebody give Brad Pitt a hug
Brad Pitt is opening up about his struggles with alcohol. Starring in two of 2019's biggest movies, "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" and "Ad Astra," Pitt spoke to The New York Times about an experience that contributed to his success this year: He quit drinking and began going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. “I had taken things as far as I could take it, so I removed my drinking privileges," he said before praising his AA group. “It was this safe space where there was little judgment, and therefore little judgment of yourself,” he said. "It was actually really freeing just to expose the ugly sides of yourself. ” We’re raising a can of La Croix to you, Brad!
She surrendered her deepest secrets to put Larry Nassar away
"Save me O’ God," Rachael Denhollander wrote in a journal tucked away with her most private thoughts detailing what her doctor, Larry Nassar, had done to her on his exam table. No one was supposed to see that journal – certainly not the man who violated her and more than 300 other women and girls – until the moment she knew her words were the only thing that could stop him. Denhollander became the first former athlete to publicly say Nassar, the famed Michigan State University team doctor for USA Gymnastics, sexually abused her. In a special USA TODAY Network report by the Louisville Courier Journal, we explore how Denhollander emerged as one of the nation’s most prominent advocates against sexual abuse and the never-before-told struggles she endured before deciding to tell authorities – and the world – about Nassar’s abuse.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Making their closing arguments in a closely watched trial, federal prosecutors and defense lawyers presented diametrically opposed versions of the conduct and motives of Gregory B. Craig, one of Washington's best-known Democratic lawyers, who is accused of lying to the Justice Department about work he did to help a foreign government burnish its reputation in the United States.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Craig, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration, deceived federal officials about his work for the government of Ukraine in 2012 because he did not want to register as a foreign agent.
In answering questions from the Justice Department about whether he was required to register under the foreign lobbying law, Mr. Craig cleverly omitted some facts and blurred others "to get the result that he believes he is entitled to," said one of the prosecutors, Jason McCullough.
But Mr. Craig's lawyer, William Murphy, countered that the government had built a false felony case on the basis of misinterpreted documents and the testimony of proven liars. He asked the jury to acquit Mr. Craig and "prevent this prosecution from sounding a horrible false note at the end of an incredible career of honor, service and integrity."
The case revolves around the interactions that Mr. Craig, 74, had with journalists seven years ago about a report prepared by his law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The Ukrainian government, then led by Viktor F. Yanukovych, had commissioned the $ 4.6 million-plus report in the hopes of blunting criticism that it had wrongly prosecuted and imprisoned one of Mr. Yanukovych's political rivals.
Mr. Craig would have been required to register as a foreign agent if he and his law firm went beyond writing the report to trying to shape American public opinion about it.
Prosecutors told the jury that Mr. Craig was determined to avoid that outcome in part because registration would have revealed unsavory details about his work. They include the fact that the report was almost entirely financed by a Ukrainian oligarch who had routed the payments through an offshore bank account. Mr. Craig had falsified and backdated an invoice to Ukrainian government to help conceal those payments, the government contends.
Mr. Craig, who testified on his own behalf, is now claiming that he was guilty of no more than sloppy errors and misremembered encounters in hopes of avoiding conviction, argued Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, another prosecutor.
"Come on, really?" he asked, in recounting Mr. Craig's testimony about his interactions with a New York Times reporter about the report.
"He is a man of position," Mr. Campoamor-Sanchez said. "He is very careful about what he does and how he does it."
Mr. Murphy argued that Mr. Craig would have willingly told Justice Department officials anything they wanted to know if they had only asked him for more details. He pointed out that the prosecutors had failed to call key witnesses, including the New York Times reporter, David E. Sanger, whose article about the Skadden report is at the crux of the their case.
Mr. Murphy said that Mr. Craig was truthful to the Justice Department officials when he told them that he did not try to advance Ukraine's media plan for the Skadden report, but strove to counteract it in his discussions with reporters. "He never thought he was a part of this media plan and, in fact, he wasn't," he said.

Stephen King’s New Book Accidentally Became an Allegory for the Trump Era

Texto completo: It’s difficult to describe a man who has enjoyed a successful 45-year career as “having a moment,” but Stephen King is enjoying a cultural renaissance of sorts. The massive global success of the 2017 feature adaptation It , which grossed more than $700 million worldwide, sparked a rabid spree of King-adjacent work.
On television, the Audience Network’s Mr. Merecedes and Hulu’s Castle Rock have thrilled fans, and upcoming projects such as Apple’s Lisey’s Story , CBS All Access’ The Stand and Amazon’s The Dark Tower are expected to leave a mark. On the big screen, the sequel to It will arrive in theaters this weekend, while a decades-in-the-making follow-up to The Shining is set for October. Maybe King really is having a moment.
SEE ALSO: The Must-Read New Books of Fall 2019
But at the end of the day, the prolific author is still a writer first and foremost, and his upcoming 61st novel, The Institute , has inadvertently positioned him as an allegorist of today. The book revolves around children who possess supernatural abilities and the mysterious organization that abducts them for their own nefarious purposes and then discards them.
“All I can say is that I wrote it in the Trump era. I’ve felt more and more a sense that people who are weak, and people who are disenfranchised and people who aren’t the standard, white American, are being marginalized,” King said in a recent New York Times interview. “And at some point in the course of working on the book, Trump actually started to lock kids up… That was creepy to me because it was really like what I was writing about. But I don’t want you to say that was in my mind when I wrote the book, because I’m not a person who wants to write allegory like Animal Farm or 1984 .”
The idea for the novel, which shares similar DNA to King’s other works, first popped into his head 20 years ago and really began making its way to the page in 2017. But under the current administration’s family separation policy at the border, The Institute has unintentionally become a reflection of current events in King’s eyes.
“But if you tell the truth about the way people behave, sometimes you find out that life really does imitate art,” he told the outlet. “I think in this case it really has.”

Texto completo: Emmanuel Macron may not technically be a celebrity, but he tweets like one.
Prior to the G-7 summit, the French president declared on Twitter, “The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produce 20% of our planet’s oxygen — is on fire.” He added that, “Our house is burning,” and called the fires an “international crisis.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
Macron’s tweet was deeply ill-informed, but indistinguishable from the misleading rants of sundry actors and singers.
At least Diddy and Leonardo DiCaprio don’t host multilateral meetings of Western heads of state. Macron does. He made the fires a major item of discussion at the G-7 summit, with the ready assent of other European governments.
The problem with the G-7 summit wasn’t that Donald Trump didn’t get with the program; it was that the program itself, insofar as it dealt with the fires, relied on a hysteria-induced misunderstanding of what’s happening in the Amazon.
The Amazon fires are catnip for proponents of radical action on the climate. They pine for a mediagenic, easy-to-understand planetary emergency and are happy to manufacture one as necessary.
It wasn’t just celebrities who hyped the fires. An NBC News headline declared, “Amazon wildfires could be ‘game over’ for climate change fight.”
According to CNN, “An inferno in the Amazon, two-thirds of which is in Brazil, threatens the rainforest ecosystem and also affects the entire globe.”
The meteorologist Eric Holthaus related the opinion of a specialist in prehistoric Amazon fires that “the current fires are without precedent in the past 20,000 years.”
This is the sense of imminent crisis that so moved Macron and his brethren. Some press reports, beneath the alarming headlines, related a more sober version of events, and a few isolated voices, most notably the environmentalist Michael Shellenberger at Forbes, resisted the dominant narrative.
The fires aren’t an epochal event. According to The New York Times, the Brazilian agency tracking fires by satellite reports that, at this point in the year, it’s the highest number of fires since 2010, which isn’t thousands of years ago — indeed, not even a decade ago.
The fires aren’t the spontaneous result of global warming. The program director of the group Amazon Watch told CNN, “The vast majority of these fires are human-lit,” noting that it isn’t easy for the rainforest to catch fire, even in the dry season.
Nor is it true that deforestation in the Amazon is spiraling out of control. Deforestation markedly diminished in the 2000s. It has picked up again under Brazil’s new populist president Jair Bolsonaro, a trend worth monitoring but hardly the onset of planetary catastrophe.
Is the Amazon the lungs of the world? No. This is drivel based on an erroneous understanding of how the atmosphere gets its oxygen.
At the end of the day, the offer that the G-7 made to Brazil of $20 million to help fight the Amazon fires was reasonable enough. The blustery Bolsonaro would be foolish not to accept it. The Amazon is a natural wonder worth preserving on its own terms, and it could at some point get caught in a cycle of drought and fire.
Still, Macron and Co. need to be aware of how their highhandedness comes across in Brazil. Advanced countries that deforested long ago should be humble when insisting that a poorer country not do the same. Proposals to buttress the Amazon have to run with the grain of Brazil’s interests, not against it.
This will require sobriety, care and a long view — in other words, exactly the opposite of what we have seen during the past couple of weeks. The most fervent devotees of climate change don’t really want science, no matter how often they invoke the word; they want drama and memorable images, believing they will catalyze action more than a properly modulated account of the best research.
If they have to blow their credibility, one faux emergency at a time, so be it.

CRACKUP IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE PARTY SEEMS DESTINED FOR A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN ELIZABETH WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS

Texto completo: Last week, we were served some less-than-breaking news. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination. If you've never heard of him, that's OK. Few Democrats have. He served in the Marine Corps for four tours in Iraq, but other than that, he hasn't done much.
What's interesting is why he's being forced to drop out of the race. By any sane standard, Mr. Moulton is a thoroughly liberal Democrat. On every issue, he's more left-wing than President Barack Obama was on the day he left office. Three years ago, Mr. Moulton would have been considered a liberal firebrand. But not anymore. By the lunatic standards of the modern Democratic Party, Mr. Moulton is now a flaming moderate, and that's the kiss of death. Moderates are no longer welcome in the Democratic Party.
Just look at what happened at the last debate when Rep. John Delaney tried to encourage his party to restrict its ambitions to the physically possible, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ordered him banished from Wonderland.
Mr. Delaney: "I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises, when we run on things that are workable, not fairy-tale economics."
Ms. Warren: "I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for. I don't get it."
Poor Mr. Delaney and his reality-based ideas. How dare he! This is demented, obviously, but politically, it has been highly effective. When he dropped out of the race, Mr. Moulton noted: "It's evident this is now a three-way race between [Joe] Biden and Warren and [Bernie] Sanders. And really it's a debate about how far left the party should go."
But there isn't really a debate. The farthest-left candidates are winning. Of the nearly 20 people in the field, only Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders can muster more than 10% support, which makes it a two-person race, if we're honest about it. Mr. Biden may be a decent person, but he's fading. And he often says strange things, as he recently did in New Hampshire:
"My senior semester, they [Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy] were both shot and killed. Imagine what happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would've happened in America?"
Imagine you're Mr. Biden's political director, sitting offstage. All of a sudden, Mr. Biden wanders into unscripted territory and says, "Imagine the assassination of Obama."
This is not an attack on Mr. Biden, but he's not going to be the nominee. So the actual race comes down to Ms. Warren's and Mr. Sanders' competing visions of how to achieve the same socialist fantasy. Ms. Warren is promising reparations based on skin color. That's popular. Mr. Sanders wants a government takeover of the entire energy sector. They will be working to out-crazy each other for the next six months.
That is a dynamic guaranteed to produce even more extremism. And it has some Democratic leaders worried. The Democratic National Committee voted on a proposal to hold a debate focused exclusively on climate change. Why wouldn't they? Well, because the solutions the candidates would promise live on television are insane: spend $16 trillion, ban airplanes, seize control of the entire U.S. economy.
The Trustafarians love stuff like that. Normal people find it terrifying. Even the party hacks here in D.C. don't like it, and that's probably a compliment. You really think Nancy Pelosi believes climate change is an existential crisis? Of course, she doesn't think that. Plus, she flies private. Mr. Obama can say whatever he wants about carbon emissions. He can shake his chin and be concerned, but when you're spending $15 million of your own dollars on a beachfront estate in Martha's Vineyard, you're not too worried about the oceans rising.
But the Democratic base doesn't get the joke. Democratic primary voters believe the talking points. And very soon, they will be powerful enough to nominate their own presidential candidate. And when that happens, it's going to be a very different party.

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.
Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Facebook's New Privacy Idea?

Texto completo: Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
When Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook's big privacy pivot, he was short on specifics. This past week, we got a glimpse at some of what he might be thinking.
Casey Newton of The Verge reported that Facebook was internally testing a new Instagram app called Threads. Instagram is increasingly Facebook's main engine of growth, so it's reasonable to assume that any product developed there is a reflection of Facebook's broader intentions. (A caveat: This app may never enter public use. Instagram declined to comment.)
More from The Verge:
Threads, which is designed as a companion app to Instagram, invites users to automatically share their location, speed and battery life with friends, along with more typical text, photo and video messages.
And:
Screenshots reviewed by The Verge show an app that's designed to promote constant, automatic sharing between users and the people on their "close friends" list on Instagram. Opt in to automatic sharing, and Threads will regularly update your status.
Beyond the usual privacy concerns, it's interesting to consider why automated sharing might be interesting for Facebook, as well as the impact it could have on users.
A private Facebook means less data shared publicly, but the company will still need reams of it to power targeted ads. Reducing friction for users posting content, so apps just do it for them, is useful to the company.
"The benefit of frictionless design for Facebook could be a limitless stream of data to analyze and mine," said Christopher Burr, who studies the philosophical and ethical issues surrounding the impact of technology on mental health at the Oxford Internet Institute.
Threads, if Facebook goes through with it, might not share much information automatically at first. But it could help normalize the practice for users who opt in, making it a more natural thing to do on other apps. Over time, people could start sharing more data automatically than they were originally comfortable with, d Dr. Burr said.
Automated data sharing could change us, too. Siân Brooke, another researcher from the Oxford Internet Institute, who studies online sociology, said constant visibility on a platform like Threads could cause people to act differently.
"You change your behavior if you're constantly being looked at," she said. "If you know people see where you are, what you're consuming, you'll change what you're doing, change what is normal in a group."
These kinds of worries aren't new: They've been raised about features in Snapchat (a platform that Threads would clearly rival). But Snapchat has fewer than 200 million users; Instagram has one billion and Facebook over two billion.

The limits of Chinese chips
Last Friday, the Chinese technology company Huawei unveiled its first high-end, artificial-intelligence processor, Ascend 910. It was widely viewed as another sign that China is doubling down on building its own chips. Per Dan Strumpf of the The Wall Street Journal:
The chip advances Huawei's goal of curbing reliance on American technology -- and China's national ambition to have chip makers capable of making complex processors.
Actually, things are more complex than that. The Ascend 910 is a cutting-edge chip, and, tellingly, it's being produced for Huawei by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, not a mainland Chinese chip manufacturer, according to ZDNet.
The reality for China: Its chip-making abilities lag the rest of the world. Badly. Research published this month by John VerWey, an international trade analyst at the United States International Trade Commission, puts the situation into perspective. Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, which he called "one of China's designated national champions," is "developing fabrication facilities that will produce chips that are five to six years behind the industry's leading edge at 10 percent of the volume of the world's leading firm."
The lag, Mr. VerWey explained, is down to several factors, including a historic inability to allocate funds strategically and a chronic undersupply of expertise in China. Attempts to fix both issues have so far yielded few results. In other words: There's a long road ahead for Chinese chips.
'Theft is not innovation'
Superstar engineers are rarely spotted.
But if you were to imagine such a creature, you could do worse than Anthony Levandowski: a wunderkind of self-driving who built a riderless motorcycle as a graduate student, then worked as a key member of Google's autonomous car project (later Waymo) before setting up his own autonomous-truck company, Otto, which Uber bought for nearly $ 700 million in 2016.
Phew. The guy clearly oozes innovation.
Well, maybe not the whole time. Federal prosecutors charged him on Tuesday with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets from Google, accusing him of downloading more than 14,000 files containing autonomous-vehicle research before leaving the company in 2016. (This is off the back of a settled trade secrets case between Uber and Waymo last year, after which Mr. Levandowski was referred to federal prosecutors.)
Mr. Levandowski faces 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for each count. But adding to the torment of this swaggering rock star engineer will surely be the remarks of David L. Anderson, a United States attorney, when announcing the indictment. "All of us have the right to change jobs," he said. "None of us has the right to fill our pockets on the way out the door. Theft is not innovation."

Texto completo: He's neither plaintiff nor defendant, but Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is a central figure in a legal battle between his brother and a Tennessee businessman.
McMinnville businessman Michael Frey is accusing Biden's brother of using the former vice president's name to con him in what Frey describes in a U.S. District Court lawsuit as a scheme to steal away his rural health care business model.
Now, Jim Biden is using his brother's name to defend himself against Frey's fraud claims in both his legal response to the lawsuit and a public statement issued by spokesman David Fuscus on Monday.
"The lawsuit presents a seriously misleading version of the events," Fuscus said. "It is nothing more than a cynical attempt to manipulate the press by taking advantage of Jim Biden's public profile as the brother of a presidential candidate.
"They are clearly trying to pressure Biden and his colleagues by introducing a story customized for the press during the 2020 presidential primary season," he continued. "The only purpose of these statements is to throw press bombs at Jim Biden because of who he is."
Joe Biden's press secretary did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Political star power? Frey and Diverse Medical Management partner Dr. Mohannad Azzam contend in the federal lawsuit they came up with a way to turn struggling rural hospitals into one-stop shops for physical and mental health services for residents — and make money doing it.
Jim Biden and Michael Lewitt, a hedge fund manager whose claims of money management expertise landed him on the pages of Forbes magazine and The New York Times, tricked them. He used Biden's brother's star power to get them to share the details of their business model and stole it, the lawsuit alleged.
The lawsuit, filed by attorney Robert A. Peal, accused Biden and Lewitt of deception and fraud and included copies of text messages and emails as evidence.
Lewitt's The Third Friday Total Return Fund hedge fund; the Platinum Group USA hedge fund and its owner Amer Rustom; and Americore Health rural hospital operator and owner Grant White are also defendants in the litigation. They are all alleged to have played a role, according to the lawsuit.
But the lawsuit paints Biden and Lewitt as the chief fraud puppet masters, painting Biden as a con artist who uses his ties to his brother to lure his victims and Lewitt as a bully who uses threats of lawsuits to keep them at bay.
The lawsuit states Frey and Azzam were in talks with Grant about merging with Americore in early 2018 when Biden offered up his business card bearing Americore's name and promised his brother could take their health care model nationwide.
Frey and Azzam allege in the lawsuit Biden and Lewitt promised they would find international investors — made easier because of Biden's brother — and, in the meantime, offered them loans through Lewitt's hedge funds and pushed them to buy up hospitals they couldn't afford.
The lawsuit claims Biden inadvertently confessed to the plot to steal the plan and bankrupt Frey and Azzam in the process, according to a text message now entered as an exhibit in the case.
"We can wrap a/c into Frey's entity further diluting them both in the process? After we take control of both," the text reads, according to court documents. "Just a thought. We must have complete control, too many moving pieces. Jim."
In their response to the lawsuit filed Monday, Biden and Lewitt are firing back, painting themselves as fraud victims and Frey and Azzam as the con artists. They don't deny the stack of text messages included as evidence but instead insist Frey and Azzam have "deliberately taken (the texts) out of context and have misconstrued (their) meaning."
Political character assassination? The response filed on behalf of Biden and Lewitt said they were the ones who were lured, conned and deceived.
Frey and Azzam, the response said, "sought out the expertise of the Defendants, certain of whom are experienced investors in the rural hospital industry, investing tens of millions of dollars in this important sector of the economy."
It continued: "Biden and his wife, Sara, have a long-held and passionate commitment to finding solutions for the improved treatment of both substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder and the linkage between them, particularly in rural areas where so many local hospitals are failing. DMM appeared to offer an opportunity to invest in a business that provided important services to this sector."
Biden and Lewitt admit via the response most of the meetings, discussions and negotiations detailed in the lawsuit. It was all, the response said, part of "good faith negotiations" by the pair to buy Diverse Medical Management.
"Defendants admit that they generally discussed the terms of a potential transaction with DMM but made it clear that any transaction would be subject to, among other things, satisfactory due diligence, definitive documentation, and financing," the response stated.
The pair denied pushing Frey and Azzam to buy up hospitals they couldn't afford. They admitted to loaning the pair roughly $750,000 through their hedge funds, but denied they promised investment money would cover it.
Biden and Lewitt also conceded the lawsuit's allegations they pitched the DMM business model to Turkish investors through a "white paper" bearing the names of "His and Her Excellency Jim and Sarah Biden" and omitting the names of Frey and Azzam.
The response states Frey and Azzam knew about it and approved it.
"Biden did not approve the honorary salutation of 'His' and 'Her Excellency' with respect to Biden and Sara Biden," the response added.
According to Biden and his fellow defendants, everything was going smoothly — both in negotiations to buy the business model and in finding investors to buy into the business model — until they learned Frey and Azzam had "exaggerated" their business success and health care expertise.
The response does not detail those exaggeration claims but said the information the defendants gleaned was enough to make them walk away from negotiations.
"Plaintiffs' contention that the defendants deliberately sought to drive DMM out of business is not only patently false, it defies logic," the response stated.
The defendants are now suing Frey and Azzam for that unpaid loan from Lewitt's hedge fund.

Texto completo: It's a story of clashing cultures, workers' rights, American-Chinese relations and the new realities of Rust Belt manufacturing.
And it's told with nuanced precision in "American Factory," an acclaimed documentary that's getting a free local screening on Sept. 4 at the War Memorial in Grosse Pointe Farms.
After a massive GM factory near Dayton, Ohio closed in 2008, Chinese auto-glass giant Fuyao purchased the plant, reopening it in 2016. Filmmakers Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert were given essentially unlimited access as Fuyao hired, trained and managed its employees — many of them former GM workers.
"American Factory" has moments of humor, tension and poignancy as Fuyao attempts to push the workforce toward its exacting standards.
A New York Times reviewer called the film "complex, stirring, timely and beautifully shaped," while Indiewire described it as "eye-popping" and listed it among contenders for a 2020 Oscar nomination.
It also won the directing award for U.S. documentaries at this year's Sundance Film Festival.
The film is bound to have particular resonance for residents of metro Detroit, which has seen its share of plant closings and the arrival of Fuyao in Plymouth in 2016.
The screening is being presented by Netflix and Freep Film Festival, the documentary film fest produced by the Detroit Free Press.
It's an encore performance in Detroit for the documentary, which screened twice at the 2019 Freep Film Festival before arriving for streaming on Netflix in late August. It is the first film that Netflix has released in conjunction with Higher Ground Productions, the new company founded by Barack and Michelle Obama.
Freep Film Festival's next annual event is April 22-26, 2020, but it hosts monthly screenings throughout the year.
'American Factory'
7 p.m. Wed.
Patriot Theater at the War Memorial, Grosse Pointe Farms
Free. Space is limited. Reservations for free tickets at www.gofobo.com/AmericanFactoryDetroit.
"American Factory" tells the tale of Americans and Chinese trying to work side-by-side in a glass factory that was once General Motors Moraine Assembly plant in Ohio.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: At a Starbucks in Pomona a month ago, the newspaper rack just inside the door had disappeared. Copies of the New York Times were on a bar by the counter, a placement that looked unlikely to last long. The other newspapers weren’t present at all.
The barista didn’t know what it was all about. As I’m in the gloom business, I had a pretty good guess.
This was borne out when I found the rack gone at a second Starbucks in Claremont. That barista said the chain would no longer be selling the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal. All that location had left was the New York Times, left on the counter.
A stack, not a rack.
“They did sell,” the barista told me of the newspapers. “Customers are, ‘nooooo!’”
The New York Post, it turned out, broke the story in July. Starbucks, which had been selling the N.Y. Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010, would stop selling newspapers at its 8,600 U.S. stores Sept. 1 due to “changing customer behavior.”
I have to be honest: I never bought a newspaper at Starbucks. I also never swiped a newspaper from Starbucks. Many customers did, treating papers as if they were free and leaving them behind on communal tables. Since people think news on the internet should be free, they must think that also applies to newspapers.
What I would do was pause at the rack, peer at the front page of the N.Y. Times and maybe read a few paragraphs. My philosophy was that page one was fair game. Opening the paper would be getting into “Hey, kid, this ain’t a library” territory.
Starbucks was probably the most visible retailer to carry newspapers, so even if I didn’t buy papers there, I hated to see them on the way out. And it’s a maxim that things (and people) can become more desirable if they’re unattainable.
And so, with newspapers leaving Starbucks, suddenly I was pining for a N.Y. Times.
My hope had been to buy a Times at Starbucks on one of the last Sundays and wade into its glory, section after section after section. But I ran out of time for the Times. Last Sunday morning at a Pomona Starbucks, I was only able to read my own two home-delivered dailies before needing to be somewhere, so I didn’t buy one of the two Times copies on the counter.
In Chino Hills that afternoon, a friend and I stopped at a Starbucks. (Breaking: Starbucks is everywhere.) The newspaper rack was empty except for two lonely copies of the Orange County Register at the bottom. I mentioned that Starbucks wouldn’t be selling newspapers anymore.
“That’s a harbinger of the future,” said my friend, who writes for a newspaper, and who had the demeanor of someone who’s just seen the Angel of Death drift past, chuckling.
I hit up two Starbucks later that day. The one in Pomona had sold out (or thrown its copies away). One in Claremont didn’t think it had received any.
“It’s the end of an era,” one barista said. Her co-worker added: “It’s so sad!”
So there went my plan to buy a Sunday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. My new plan was to buy a weekday N.Y. Times at a Starbucks. But there were none to be had. Newspaper sales apparently stopped a week early.
My final plan was to buy a N.Y. Times somewhere else, take it to Starbucks and read it. Give me this: Once I get an idea into my head, I will stubbornly see it through.
Finding a copy of the N.Y. Times was easier said than done. This despite what a Times spokeswoman had told the Post: “Although disappointed by the decision, we’re confident that given our wide retail distribution, readers will have no trouble finding The New York Times for sale at nearby outlets.”
Claremont, the college town where I live, seemed the likeliest bet for the Gray Lady. Downtown used to have two Times racks, one outside the Post Office, one outside Walter’s, but both are gone.
The Village Market sells only the Daily Bulletin, for which I commend them, and the Claremont Courier. Pomona College has a couple of spots where the NYT is available for free, meant for students, but classes haven’t resumed yet and neither has delivery. The college bookstore doesn’t stock newspapers. The libraries downtown and at the colleges get the Times, thankfully, but my goal was to buy one.
At the Barnes & Noble in neighboring Montclair, I asked if they carry newspapers, like the N.Y. Times. “Like, actual newspapers?” a clerk asked. A second clerk said: “We don’t. We used to, but not anymore.”
A gas station near the colleges had also given up. “No, we stopped selling newspapers last year, I think,” a clerk said. “You could try Starbucks.”
I delivered the bad news. “They stopped selling them too?” he said, eyes wide. He shook his head. “A printed newspaper. That’s a hard find.”
This reminded me of an encounter earlier this year at Creme Bakery in downtown Claremont. I often read my newspapers there, partly for pleasure, partly to model good behavior. A woman noticed me reading and said, a bit wistfully, “I miss newspapers.”
A few seconds went by.
I said, “They print new ones every day.”
Where else might one buy a New York Times locally? Suddenly I remembered the area’s only newsstand, Newsboy Books in downtown Ontario.
Newsboy stocks 10 daily newspapers, including the NYT, although the Starbucks decision seemed to throw a wrench into local distribution. The last copy delivered to Newsboy was last Sunday’s, although co-owner Roberta Gingold told me she expects to have copies again starting Tuesday.
In the meantime, on Friday morning she had one copy of last Sunday’s NYT, and to fulfill my goal, and also to round out this column, I handed over $6.47.
Next stop: an Ontario Starbucks, where the newspaper rack stood empty. I bought a drink, sat down with my fat copy of the NYT, with 10 sections and a magazine, and dug in.

Texto completo: Tarry Lodge, the Port Chester restaurant which bills itself as a "family-friendly enoteca/pizzeria," is closing.
But fear not: it will reopen in 2021.
According to a WARN notice posted by the New York Department of Labor on Aug. 23, the restaurant will lay off its 50 employees by Nov. 22. That is also the closing date listed on the notice for the restaurant.
The reason given on the notice for the restaurant's demise was "due to construction occurring on the premise."
According to Missy Adriazola, vice president of human resources of RSC Management Services, the group is working with a developer to bring a new mixed-use project to the Tarry Lodge site, with a new Tarry Lodge as its anchor. She expects the project to be done in 2021.
Restaurant had ties to Mario Batali Opened in the fall of 2008 by famed chef Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich, and chef Andy Nusser, Tarry Lodge was acclaimed for its high-end Italian trattoria experience, its sustainability initiatives and its extensive Italian wine list.
It was part of the then-named Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, eventually expanding to add the Tarry Market, a gourmet marketplace, around the corner.
After Batali was accused of sexual harassment and assault, the group – which has since changed its name – cut ties with Batali, who ended his relationship with all of the affiliated restaurants in March, including Tarry Lodge, according to the New York Times.
The Tarry Market closed last June after eight years in business. At the time, Kim Reed, communications director for B&B Hospitality, told lohud the building was being redeveloped. It will be part of the newly announced mixed-use project.

British leader faces backlash

Texto completo: LONDON - Britain's prime minister, Boris Johnson, faced a growing and angry backlash on Thursday as his decision to suspend Parliament next month prompted protests and legal challenges, and political opponents scrambled to salvage efforts to stop a disorderly Brexit.
The normally fractious opposition swiftly united in outrage at Johnson's maneuver on Wednesday, which brought protesters onto the streets in London and other cities across the country, while an online petition against the action drew well over a million signatures.
The move also strained relations within Johnson's Conservative Party and prompted claims from critics that the government was trampling the conventions of the country's unwritten constitution, undermining its democracy.
On Wednesday, Johnson had Queen Elizabeth II approve a plan to restrict the sittings of Parliament in September and October. That reduces his critics' chances of legislating to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without first reaching an agreement with Brussels, as the prime minister has threatened to do.
The Conservative Party leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, resigned on Thursday, and though she carefully avoided criticizing Johnson in a resignation later and a news conference, the British news media linked her action to the prime minister's.
Davidson opposes a "no-deal" Brexit, but said she trusted Johnson's assurances that he does intend to reach an agreement with the EU by Oct. 31.
Lord Young of Cookham, a former Cabinet minister, resigned as a Conservative whip in the House of Lords on Thursday, saying in a letter that Johnson's action "risks undermining the fundamental role of Parliament at a critical time in our history, and reinforces the view that the government may not have the confidence of the House for its Brexit policy."
Numerous reports by bodies including the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund have said a no-deal Brexit would be chaotic and would seriously damage Britain's economy. Leaks from the government itself have warned of the possibility of jammed ports and shortages of some medicines and fuel.
A majority of lawmakers are on record as opposing such an outcome. But Johnson, who became prime minister last month, has promised to leave the EU on the scheduled date, Oct. 31, preferably with an agreement but without one if necessary.
In an overnight poll, far more Britons opposed than supported his suspension of Parliament, and angry comments calling it undemocratic peppered social media, many with the hashtag #StopTheCoup.
The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, and a former Conservative chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, each called it a "constitutional outrage." Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, labeled it a "a sort of smash and grab on our democracy."
But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a hard-line Brexit supporter and the Conservative leader of the House of Commons, on Thursday defended the government's decision, arguing that there would still be adequate time to debate Brexit.
The real threat to Britain's unwritten constitution, he wrote in The Daily Telegraph, came from those who opposed Brexit and wanted to overturn the 2016 referendum decision to leave the bloc.
"The candyfloss of outrage that we've had over the past 24 hours - which is almost entirely confected - is from people who never wanted to leave the European Union," Rees-Mogg said in an interview with BBC radio. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Five men charged with plotting the 9/11 terror attacks, including alleged mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, will go to trial almost two decades after 2,976 people were killed.
A military judge on Friday set Jan. 11, 2021, as the beginning of a joint death-penalty trial at Guantánamo Bay, according to the New York Times. Selection of a military jury at the Navy Base in Cuba will begin on that date.
A 10-page scheduling order by the Judge, Air Force Col. W. Shane Cohen, outlines deadlines to successfully hold the trial as scheduled, including a list of materials that prosecutors must provide the five men’s defense teams by Oct. 1.
Prosecutors have been trying to get a trial date set for years, but none had been set until now. The group of accused plotters were arraigned in May 2012 at the Navy Base inside a special national security courtroom.
Mohammed, 55, is accused of being “the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks,” according to the 9/11 Commission Report. He has reportedly tried to wriggle his way out of facing the death penalty by floating the idea that he testify as part of a lawsuit implicating Saudi Arabia as being complicit in the terror attacks.
In addition to the Sept. 11 attacks, Mohammed is suspected in dozens of other Islamist attacks across the globe. He has confessed to the kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002. He was captured in 2003 and eventually transferred to Guantánamo Bay, where he has been held since.

Commemorating a 400 Year Journey

Texto completo: Gloria J. Browne-Marshall
It was a commemoration worthy of the ancestors. This past weekend was filled nourishment for the spirit and the mind. “Welcome to these shores,” Chief G. Anne Richardson, leader of the Rappahannock Tribe, told the audience of over five thousand. “No one had welcomed you upon your arrival,” Richardson said. African Americans cheered. Some cried. This was one of many emotional moments during a week of events commemorating the African arrival in 1619.
Activities included an acknowledgment of centuries of race-based harm against African Americans and ended with speeches about the possible ways to heal centuries of wounds. The Hampton-based commemoration gave breath to the essays written in the New York Times Magazine titled the “1619 Project.” This year marked the 400th anniversary of the African arrival in the Colony of Virginia.
In 1619, “20 and odd Negroes” arrived at Old Point Comfort located on the shores of Virginia. The Colony was young, founded in 1607. John Rolf, secretary of the colony, noted the African arrival in his journal. It was from here that the nexus of African fortitude and European greed gave rise to present-day America. Africans were here before The Mayflower landed in 1620. They came with knowledge about farming, livestock and metalworks essential to the survival of this first permanent English colony in North America. Yet, relatively few Americans know of their existence in Virginia, the cornerstone of America. Few knew until this 400th commemoration held in Hampton, VA.
Old Point Comfort is now named Fort Monroe. It is a National Park Service historic site and the largest fort in America. In Fort Monroe’s Continental Park, white tents and a stage held dozens of speakers, like Chief Richardson, who were caught up in the somber experience on these historic grounds. Project 1619 founder Calvin Pearson and Dr. Bill Wiggins had been teaching the history of the African arrival in Virginia for forty years. They persuaded scholars that the landing site was Hampton, Virginia, not Jamestown. Thus, the location at Fort Monroe, in Hampton.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam was moved by the commemoration to pledge to create new pathways of opportunities for African Americans. He apologized for past racial transgressions. Northam had been publicly embarrassed when photos of him surfaced wearing black-face at a ku klux klan-themed party attended during medical school. Sunday was a day of healing from past transgressions. Speakers provided their unique perspectives on healing. Rev. Dr. Michael Dyson spoke roughly of about how African Americans were denied credit for the building of America and an acknowledgement of their contributions would go far in their healing process.
Rev. Dr. Michael Battle, director of the Desmond Tutu Center, analyzed the word healing. Battle said that they “had taken the African identity and replaced it with their own.” However, healing from this violent act could not be violent, he said. Bible verses and calls for forgiveness were intertwined with personal stories. Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax spoke of a friendship between his family and the descendants of the slaveholding Lord Fairfax of England.
Libations were poured to heal the land. Drummers played. Young people impressed adults, providing oratory, song and dance. Hip hop performers Donovan Pollack and Imagine, Teens with a Purpose, gave a spoken word performance about the uprising of Nat Turner. These teens spoke of the prejudice against Black young people, ending their poem with the line ‘we are not strong enough to carry the weight of racial stereotypes.”
This commemoration was possible through the work of grassroots organization, nonprofit groups and politicians, including Rep. Robert C. “Bobby” Scott, of Virginia. In 2018, Scott proposed the Federal legislation creating a 400th Commission to commemorate the African arrival. But Scott spoke of legislation still needed to advance African Americans economically and educationally in the face of past and ongoing discrimination. There is still much to do, he said.
Forgiveness was offered and requested. A delegation from Nigeria and Ghana poured a libation to heal the earth and ask forgiveness for their role in the slave-trade. Former Gov. Robert F. McDonnell asked the attendees to forgive the acts of the first governor of Virginia who purchased the first Africans instead of protecting them. Terry E. Brown was the visionary behind this commemorative weekend.
“Forgiveness is meant to heal yourself.” Brown is a leader with the National Park Service and the superintendent of Fort Monroe. He led a recitation of forgiveness. Fort Monroe played a crucial role in the Civil War as a place of security for escaped enslaved Africans who were considered contraband of war.
Officer Brown spoke of being visibly moved by the commemoration as were many in attendance. The brutality of enslavement was ever present. “After 246 years of slavery and over a century of discrimination, “I am not going to resolve racism with one event,” Brown said. He believes America is taking steps to acknowledge the contribution of African Americans and the harm of enslavement. The 1619 commemoration was one ray of hope. Healing will be an ongoing process.

‘Raise Hell’? Yes, Molly Ivins certainly did, as new documentary film shows

Texto completo: Molly Ivins saw it coming.
Around the turn of the century, as the Texas governor she (and others) called “Shrub” became the president of the United States, the increasingly legendary Ivins opined in her national column that U.S. politics was about to become a lot more like the Texas from which George W. Bush came, no matter the “compassionate conservative” tag. As she once put it, “Texas has always been the national laboratory for bad government.”
Welp.
It is impossible to watch “Raise Hell: The Life & Times of Molly Ivins,” director Janice Engel’s sharp, well-paced and thoroughly enjoyable documentary on this remarkable woman, and not have your wig pushed back at the thought of how Ivins, who died in 2007 from a savage form of breast cancer, would regard the White House’s current occupant. (The film screened at South by Southwest earlier this year and hits Texas theaters this week.)
Then again, to watch it is to wish she was around to comment on all sorts of things: An incredible Astros season. The culture of annoying IPAs. And, oh, yeah, the fact that we have concentration camps in her home state.
Born in 1944 to a well-heeled Houston family (you don’t get to be third-generation Smithee without being part of the elite) headed up by a domineering father, Ivins grew up extremely tall, extremely funny and extremely smart. The latter
two made her a good journalist; her compassion made her a great one.
She started out covering civil rights, eventually landing at the Texas Observer in the early 1970s (not a bad spot for a woman who admitted freely that she didn’t believe in the existence of journalistic objectivity), where she covered the Texas Legislature with a savage wit.
It didn’t hurt that she could match her colleagues, sources and opponents drink for drink, a habit that became the full-blown alcoholism that shadowed her until a comparatively late-life intervention. Engel spends only little bit of time on that issue and almost none on Ivins' private life. Her pals seemingly declined to discuss it, other than to note a couple qualities of Ivins' that proved problematic for romantic relationships: She didn't want to be controlled by a guy, and men were reluctant to ask out someone funnier, tougher and smarter than they were.
After a turn at the New York Times reminded Ivins why it was colloquially called the "Gray Lady" in the first place, Ivins returned to the Dallas Times Herald in the early 1980s, a place that offered her the “complete freedom” to write whatever kind of politics column she chose, which is also known as hitting the jackpot. Ivins soon was syndicated in about 400 newspapers, becoming a one-woman industry of political wiseacre-ism mostly (but not always) directed at conservatives. She grew a little sick of Bill Clinton, writing him off completely after the 1996 welfare reform bill.
Post-9/11, Ivins saw the writing on the wall, so she in turn wrote about the greatly limited freedoms she knew were just around the corner. She also got sober, eventually, after the drinking got less fun and less funny. Most of the talking heads in "Raise Hell" are fellow journalists, both nationally known (Rachel Maddow and Dan Rather, naturally) and famous in Texas (looking good, former American-Statesman reporter Dave McNeely). But naturally, Engel's film pops to life whenever archival footage of Ivins appears. A substantial presence even when sitting, Ivins mixed a million-watt smile with a bone-dry delivery such that even when the jokes don't completely land (they can't all be winners), you find yourself just happy to be witnessing her weapons-grade sarcasm.
When Ivins' columns ended weeks before her death in 2007, the absence was felt across the country. As “Raise Hell” notes, perhaps the greatest thing Ivins did through her work was making her readers feel less alone. May that be said of anyone in the writing game. Resquicat, ma’am.

Texto completo: The Department of Justice's inspector general on Thursday issued a devastating report finding that former FBI Director James Comey violated department policy and "set a dangerous example" by leaking memos to the New York Times through an intermediary. The rebuke demonstrates once again how President Trump manages to bring out the worst in his opponents.
Trump, no doubt, often behaves outrageously and improperly. But the sense that he is an unprecedented threat to American democracy has also made his opponents feel justified in lowering their own standards to oppose him. Just this week, we've seen Trump opponents promote the presidential candidacy of recovering birther Joe Walsh. MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell on Wednesday was forced to apologize for airing a thinly sourced report on Trump's financial ties to Russia, acknowledging that it didn't go through the normal standards of verification. And now, on Thursday, we get this OIG report.
[READ: The full DOJ inspector general report on James Comey]
The OIG recounts that Comey wrote seven memos about his interactions with Trump before Trump fired him, of which he took four with him when he left the FBI (one in redacted form). Eager to see a special counsel appointed, Comey shared the contents of one memo to Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman with instructions that he share the substance of the memo with a specific New York Times reporter. The result was this May 16, 2017 story: "Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation." The next day, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel.
As part of his employment with the FBI, Comey signed an agreement that stipulated that all information and materials he acquired over the course of his official duties remained the property of the government, that he had to surrender all materials once he left the FBI, and that he could not reveal the information.
The OIG determined that the memos were FBI records and that Comey's handling of them "violated Department [of Justice] and FBI policies concerning the retention, handling, and dissemination of FBI records and information, and violated the requirements of Comey's FBI Employment Agreement."
In its conclusion, the OIG notes that the FBI is given significant power to carry out investigations, but it's important that proper procedures are followed to protect the dissemination of sensitive information.
"The responsibility to protect sensitive law enforcement information falls in large part to the employees of the FBI who have access to it through their daily duties," the OIG wrote. The report determined, "Former Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility. By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees — and the many thousands more former FBI employees — who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information."
But it's clear that it was his feeling that disclosing information from the memos was borne out a patriotic duty to oppose Trump.
"Comey said he was compelled to take these actions “if I love this country … and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI,'" the OIG notes. "However, were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director's example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly, as Comey himself noted in his March 20, 2017 congressional testimony."
The report ends with a salient point — that even if Comey perceived a unique threat, it was still important to uphold standards.
"In a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions," the report concluded. "Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure. What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome."
Those concerned with the destruction of norms in the Trump era need to consider the question in two ways. There is the threat of Trump's actions eroding norms, but there is also the danger that his opponents take actions in opposing Trump that actually hasten the destruction of norms instead of preserving them.

Boris Johnson’s surprise Brexit ploy: delay Parliament

Texto completo: London • Normally, in times of national crisis, British leaders convene Parliament. But as the country confronts its biggest crisis in many decades, Prime Minister Boris Johnson seems intent on doing the opposite.
On Wednesday, Johnson threw the Brexit debate into new turmoil by shortening the already dwindling time Parliament has left to try to prevent a potentially chaotic no-deal departure from the European Union. Opposition politicians denounced the move to limit the time for debate as undemocratic and possibly unconstitutional.
Johnson’s startling maneuver to tighten Parliament’s schedule in October set the stage for a heated compressed showdown with Parliament as the Oct. 31 deadline for Brexit bears down.
The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, called Johnson’s decision a “constitutional outrage.” Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, denounced it as “reckless,” while the party’s finance policy spokesman, John McDonnell, called it a “very British coup.”
“Whatever one’s views on Brexit, once you allow a Prime Minister to prevent the full and free operation of our democratic institutions you are on a very precarious path,” McDonnell wrote on Twitter.
Parliament was scheduled to meet during the first two weeks of September and then to be suspended for annual political party conferences. It was then scheduled to reconvene around Oct. 9.
But in a letter sent Wednesday to all members of Parliament, Johnson said he intended to ask Queen Elizabeth II to “prorogue,” or suspend, Parliament for around a further week and to have it resume on Oct. 14, with the “Queen’s speech,” in which the monarch traditionally lays out the government’s agenda.
The monarch’s approval is considered a formality, and hours after the announcement, the government said that the queen had approved the request.
In a video interview Wednesday morning, Johnson said he had made his decision in order to progress with “our plans to take this country forward” and to “get on with our domestic agenda.”
But his ploy is risky. Just how risky became clear Tuesday evening with reports that the widely admired Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, unable to defend Johnson’s Brexit policies, was on the verge of resigning.

Texto completo: The New York Times is trying especially hard this week to play the victim after it discovered pro-Trump operatives have been digging through its employees’ public statements.
Fortunately, the Times’ peers in the press are not indulging the newspaper in its pity party.
“[O]f all the thin-skinned beasts prowling the journalistic forest, few have a thinner epidermis than the boys and girls who work at the New York Times,” said Politico’s Jack Shafer in an article titled, “Why Journalists’ Old Tweets Are Fair Game for Trump.”
Elsewhere, the Washington Post’s Eric Wemple penned an analysis, titled “Breitbart burned the New York Times. And the Times really doesn’t like it,” accusing the newspaper of wanting to “tar the motivations” of the operatives while also refusing to admit “they have brought actionable information to public attention.”
The thrust of the Shafer and Wemple's analyses is this: It is not dirty pool for pro-Trump operatives to spelunk through newsroom employees' public remarks. It is not unfair for political operatives to document carefully the past statement of journalists and editors in the employ of the nation’s largest and most powerful newsrooms. It most certainly is not an “assault” or an “attack” on the free press or democracy itself, as New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger claimed this weekend in a memo to staff.
The White House has paired with activists to embarrass hostile newsrooms, which Sulzberger claims is “an escalation of an ongoing campaign against the free press.”
“[T]he political operatives behind this campaign will argue that they are ‘reporting’ on news organizations in the same way that news organizations report on elected officials and other public figures. They are not. They are using insinuation and exaggeration to manipulate the facts for political gain,” he added.
My reaction to Sulzberger's and similar statements this week was simple: Get over yourselves.
Shafer and Wemple say basically the same thing.
“[I]t doesn’t strike me as unreasonable to ask [journalists] to own or repudiate vile or impolitic things they might have stated in the past,” writes Shafer. “Nor is it remotely unfair for the president’s supporters to demand that journalists, who are forever denouncing him as a racist (because he is), be held accountable for their bigoted speech, on Twitter or anywhere else.”
He adds, “Journalists don’t deserve a get-out-of-bigotry-jail free card just because they’re journalists. If their past tweets, however ancient, undercut their current journalistic work or make them sound hypocritical, they can’t blame their diminished prestige on Trump’s allies.”
Wemple, for his part, writes, “For decades now, representatives of the mainstream media have answered conservative critiques by imploring: Judge us by the work we produce, not by the fact that more than 90% of us are liberal/Democratic ... Mainstreamers cannot have it both ways. Cut the idle and unverifiable talk about motivations. If the tweets presented by the 'loose network of conservative operatives' are racist or anti-Semitic or otherwise problematic, take action. If they’re nonsensical distractions, ignore them.”
I think “get over yourselves” is a more succinct response, but yeah — what Schafer and Wemple said.

VAPING IS VAPID THE FDA MUST GET INVOLVED, PA. SHOULD CHANGE LAW

Texto completo: Concerns over nicotine addiction among teenagers is worrisome. Boosting concern to alarm is a rash of recent cases involving people hospitalized with vaping-related lung conditions - and many are young.
In 14 states, 94 patients, most of whom are young adults, recently were hospitalized with severe pulmonary issues, including coughing, fatigue and shortness of breath. Some patients also experienced chest pain, fever, nausea and diarrhea.
Illinois officials said Aug. 23 that a person who had recently used an e-cigarette and was hospitalized with severe lung illness had died. The death appears to be the first among the rash of lung illnesses under investigation by state and federal health officials in connection to vaping - at least 193 cases in 22 states, many involving teens and young adults, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The affected individuals have had symptoms including cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Some also experienced vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms worsened over a period of days or weeks before they were hospitalized.
Doctors in the Pittsburgh region have reported treating at least seven patients for lung injuries associated with vaping.
While some of the cases appear similar, officials said they don't know whether the illnesses are associated with the e-cigarette devices themselves or with specific ingredients or contaminants inhaled through them. Health officials have said patients have described vaping a variety of substances, including nicotine, marijuana-based products and do-it-yourself "home brews."
In a few extreme cases, hospitals have reported patients suffered collapsed lungs or required placement in medically induced comas.
The Food and Drug Administration, which assumed oversight of e-cigarettes in 2016, must get involved. E-cigarettes have not been subject to a government health and safety review because of multiple decisions by the FDA delaying that review. That must end - and quickly.
And while there may be some benefit for adults who want to kick the traditional smoking habit, there should be keen concern about young people. Pennsylvania is weighing legislation to raise to 21 the legal age for the purchase of all tobacco products, including vaping products.
Even as teenagers and young adults are smoking less, vaping rapidly became popular among young people. More than 1 in 5 high schoolers and nearly 1 in 20 middle school students reported using electronic cigarette devices in 2018, which is a 78% increase over 2017.
The vaping devices are marketed as a safer alternative to cigarettes, and for adult smokers looking to kick their habit, they can be useful. But health experts are concerned that young people are ignoring the very real risks of nicotine addiction presented by both smoking and vaping - memory impairment, impulse control problems, and cardiovascular and pulmonary damage.
The federal government wisely cracked down on e-cigarette manufacturers' marketing to teens, including banning the sweet, fruity vaping liquid flavors that critics contend are aimed at attracting young users. And many states already have acted to raise the legal purchase age for tobacco, including vaping products, to 21.
More must be done to curb the use of these dangerous products by a generation that clearly does not appreciate the risks. Parents must have serious conversations with their teens about the consequences of vaping.
More research is necessary to fully understand how vaping products are affecting users' health, as the recent string of hospitalizations demonstrates.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
While working at The New York Times this summer, I had a job that didn't include reporting or calling up politicians:
I was an intern.
Starting in June, I helped make the print edition of the paper that hits doorsteps every morning. This included writing captions and making sure names were spelled correctly. I was on staff for only 10 weeks before returning to the University of Maryland, where I study journalism and government and politics. Here's a little bit about what it is like to work at The Times.
It is a kind of a nerve-racking place to work when you're 20.
Even among the interns and fellows, I was one of the youngest people working in the building. In a place where people report on the news stories that are seared into the American memory, this can create some confusion. For example, I don't remember the death of J.F.K. Jr. or 9/11. This isn't bad necessarily, but it came with obstacles. I accidentally called a 44-year-old editor old -- to his face. Twice. Almost unconsciously, I said that being over age 40 seemed like a long life to live. Sometimes people referenced events from 10 years ago and laughed a little because I call that fifth grade.
Famous people just show up.
I saw Cory Booker on my first day. Megan Rapinoe visited after winning the World Cup. DeAndre Hopkins of the Houston Texans made an appearance. According to a supervisor, that happens a lot? It's cool when it does.
Reporters are people, too. Even the "famous" or heavily branded ones.
Sometimes, meeting the people behind the bylines was a little anxiety-inducing. Katie Benner covers the Justice Department and has a Pulitzer Prize. Michael Barbaro and Lisa Tobin have two million listeners for "The Daily."
That being said, reporters are funny. They're open to answering questions. They have kids and want to get back to their families each day.
This isn't an easy job.
Times reporters can be intense. Yet, as at any news organization, gathering the news all the time can be tiring. Covering tragedies back-to-back is not easy for anyone. Two mass shootings in less than 24 hours had people exhausted. Sometimes even great reporters and editors need a break from traumatic things.
Impostor syndrome. All of it.
I've never heard people talk so freely about owning their impostor syndrome. But in a place where others have broken huge stories that have changed the discourse of society, it seems almost inevitable that one would feel as if being hired was some kind of mistake. Many people at The Times are very empathetic to that sentiment -- probably because they've felt it themselves.
As an intern, part of beating that impostor syndrome is taking the small wins, like catching spelling mistakes or extra commas.
People outside really think you're responsible for everything that goes on in here and it's confusing. I'm an intern.
Our readers have plenty of critiques. Those people can sometimes expect interns to make those changes autonomously. This can be a bit frustrating because interns do not have that power. If you know any interns anywhere, please stop asking them to fix something they cannot change.
The Times has changed.
People sometimes think it's all old men who run the paper and make the news and decide everything that goes on in the building. The Gray Lady, as the reputation goes, is ancient, and so are its managers.
The staff overall is younger than one might expect. Innovation is important. New mediums matter. Audio and video thrive, and young people -- even 20-year-old interns -- play a part.
There's a lot of passion here about random things that aren't the news.
The biggest Yankees and Mets fans I've ever met are in this office. Cat people are aplenty. Someone might go insane about a favorite actor if asked (or not asked). There could be hourlong rants about the fate of humanity with social media. Times people aren't nerdy solely about journalism.
But there is a feeling that what we do is important. Journalists like to be right, but they can make mistakes, and want to fix them. It feels as if people here are not motivated by fame. The job exists because journalism matters. People at The Times are invested in the news and the world. They care about making the paper.
At least as much as they care about newsroom snacks.

Texto completo: Since 1980, when the series launched with Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, the Westminster Town Hall Forum has brought “voices that inspire, issues that matter” to the Presbyterian Church on Nicollet Mall and 12th Street in downtown Minneapolis. Leading authors, activists, journalists, and analysts have spoken on politics, economics, civil rights, world affairs, science, society, spirituality, arts and literature, and other topics we could all stand to know more about. Here’s who’s coming to the Forum this fall:
Tuesday, Sept. 24, noon: Kathleen Belew. Author of “Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America,” Belew has been featured on “PBS News Hour,” “Fresh Air,” “Weekend Edition” and more, and in the PBS “Frontline” documentary “Documenting Hate: New American Nazis.”
Tuesday, Oct. 22, noon: Jim Sciutto. CNN’s chief national security correspondent and co-anchor of “CNN Newsroom,” Sciutto is an award-winning journalist who reports and provides analysis on all aspects of U.S. national security. He is the author of “The Shadow War: Inside Russia’s and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America.”
Tuesday, Nov. 12, noon: André Thomas. A renowned choral conductor and educator, Thomas is the author of “Way Over in Beulah Lan’: Understanding and Performing the Negro Spiritual.” He will speak on the meaning and impact of African-American spirituals.
Saturday, Nov. 16, 11 a.m.: Parker Palmer. An educator, spiritual leader, activist, recipient of 13 honorary doctorates, founder of the Center for Courage & Renewal and Carleton graduate, Palmer is a prolific author whose best sellers include “The Courage to Teach: Healing the Heart of Democracy” and “On the Brink of Everything: Grace, Gravity & Getting Old.” His Forum topic – in conversation with Sondra Samuels, president of the Northside Achievement Zone – will be “We the People: A Time to Act.”
Forums are an hour long and include a speaker presentation and a Q&A. Most take place at noon on weekdays. (Parker Palmer is the exception this season.) Local musicians perform a half-hour before each forum, and a public reception, often with a book signing, follows. Forums are always free and open to all. If you can’t be there, you can listen in to the live broadcast on MPR or catch the podcast later. Audio recordings are available for most programs from the start (more than 300 to date). Video recordings are available for those after 2004. Access all through the smartly organized, user-friendly archive.
The picks
Tonight (Tuesday, Aug. 27) at the Lagoon: “Deconstructing the Beatles: Abbey Road Side 2.” Beatleologist Scott Freiman explains the whys, hows and wherefores of side 2 of the final album the Beatles recorded together at EMI Studios. It’s the side that starts with “You Never Give Me Your Money,” goes gorgeous in “Sun King,” gallops through the short, rather silly songs “Mean Mr. Mustard,” “Polythene Pam” (thanks a lot for that one, John and Paul) and “She Came in through the Bathroom Window,” resolves into the lullabye “Golden Slumbers,” and transitions through “Carry That Weight” into “The End” with its great closing line, “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.” One night, one screening. 7 p.m. FMI including trailer and tickets ($15).
Wednesday at the Parkway: Mixed Company: Composition, Improvisation and Place: Bill Cottman, Davu Seru & No Territory Band. Seru’s No Territory Band is like a big sonic playground with a formidable horn and woodwinds section: Scott Fultz on saxophones, JC Sanford on trombone, Pat O’Keefe on clarinets, Jake Baldwin on trumpet and Nathan Hanson on saxophones. With Seru on drums and Levi Schwartzberg on vibraphone, they perform Seru’s original compositions and their own improvisations. Add Bill Cottman’s projections – images collected around a north Minneapois narrative – and this will be an evening of unexpected sounds and visuals, mixed live on the spot. Doors at 6:30 p.m., show at 7. FMI and tickets ($10 advance, $15 door).
Wednesday at Jazz Central: Sound/Simulacra featuring Kip Jones of ETHEL Quartet. It’s possible (also recommended, if you have the time) to catch Mixed Company at the Parkway, then head to Jazz Central in Northeast and make it a night of head-exploding music. Sound/Simulacra is the monthly series from John Keston (keyboards, electronics) and Cody McKinney (bass, voice, electronics) that explores improvisation. This month’s special guest will be violinist, composer and Duluth native Kip Jones, a member of the New York-based modern string quartet ETHEL, which the New York Times called “indefatigable and eclectic.” Over the past five years, ETHEL has premiered more than 150 new works, many commissioned by the quartet. Set 1 will be Kip Jones solo; for set II, he’ll be joined by McKinney and Keston. Doors at 8:15, music at 8:30. FMI. $10 admission, $5 with student ID.
Wednesday and Thursday at the Trylon: 6th Annual Altered Aesthetics Film Festival. A program of avant-garde and experimental shorts created by local and international filmmakers. Tip: If you go the first night, you can help create a film by animator Maret Davies Polzine that will screen the second night. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($10 advance, $5-15 sliding scale at the door).
Thursday at the Walker: Mn Artists Presents: CarryOn Homes . Take a tour of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden led by a live donkey. See a film, view a lighting installation, and watch live performances. Curated by the members of CarryOn Homes – five artists from five countries – this series returns for a third year to consider the question, “How and why do we learn the way we do?” Local artists who have experienced immigration or emigration will turn the halls of the Walker into an experimental classroom. CarryOn Homes is Zoe Cinel (Italy), Preston Drum (USA), Aki Shibata (Japan), Peng Wu (China) and Shunjie Young (Malaysia). 5-9 p.m. Free.

Comey friend expects criminal charges against McCabe 'any day' now

Texto completo: A "good friend" of former FBI Director James Comey says he expects criminal charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe any day now.
Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of Lawfare, wrote in a blog post that he was shocked by a New York Times report Monday that revealed McCabe's lawyers met with top Justice Department officials in recent weeks.
"Such meetings generally take place when indictment is imminent; they happen when the government plans to bring charges," Wittes said on Tuesday. "You should thus expect charges against McCabe to be forthcoming any day. And if such charges don’t happen, that doesn’t mean they weren’t planned but, rather, that some extrinsic event has intervened."
McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This indicates federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents.
Wittes, an author and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the report was "shocking." He argued that "as best as I can tell, the facts available on the public record simply don’t support such charges." Wittes also suggested the White House may be a factor because of a "sustained campaign by President Trump demanding McCabe’s scalp." Trump has repeatedly criticized McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire, prompted by a DOJ inspector general report that found he misled Comey and investigators about leaks to the media regarding the Hillary Clinton emails investigation and an inquiry into the Clinton Foundation which had not yet been made public.
Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, says he did not give McCabe permission to leak that information to the media. Comey has yet to comment on the latest developments in the McCabe investigation.
McCabe's lawyers have called the inspector general's report "deeply flawed," and McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued the Justice Department in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired. He is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged.
Wittes said if prosecutors bring criminal charges against McCabe, which he views as excessive, they will have to overcome "substantially mitigating factors," such as McCabe correcting the record after he misled investigators and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page telling a grand jury that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie.
Wittes admitted there could be "evidence that is not public yet" against McCabe. He also predicted that McCabe's defense will be that he was confused and under a lot of pressure, given the circumstances at the time.
Although Wittes said he will not rush to judgment, he expressed concern about assistant U.S. attorneys dropping off the case. He also said, "I would be lying if I said that, as I look at it now, it all seems on the level to me. I worry that what’s happening here is simple corruption of the Department of Justice in precisely the fashion I have been worrying about since before Donald Trump was even elected."

David Brooks: The one united struggle for freedom

Texto completo: Hong Kong • Thirty years ago, I covered a lot of democracy rallies. They were held in the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Central Europe, South Africa and the Middle East. Last week, I covered some more, this time in Hong Kong.
In many ways the Hong Kong rallies felt exactly like the rallies I covered as a cub journalist. There was the same fervent faith in democracy, the same roiling conviction that human beings deserve to live at their full dignity — able to think what they want, read what they want, govern themselves and not simply exist half-strangled and suborned.
There was the same indignant desire not to live in a rigged economy run for the benefit of state-favored oligarchs.
There was the same turning to America that we see at democracy rallies everywhere, the same sense that America is a beacon in the struggle for freedom, the same expectation that of course America is going to step in and help.
There were even the same tactics. Decades ago, the Czechs built “Lennon Walls,” brightly covered walls where people post slogans and encouragement. Today, the Hong Kongers use those, too.
In 1989 democracy protesters across the Baltics formed a vast human chain called “The Baltic Way.” On Friday night, 135,000 Hong Kongers formed “The Hong Kong Way,” a chain that stretched 50 kilometers (31 miles) through the city. The protesters held hands, chanted slogans. When the lights were red, they stretched from sidewalks across the streets. When the lights were green, they politely withdrew to let traffic pass.
There was the same resolute pessimism that I remember from those democracy rallies decades ago. On the one hand these people are fervently committed. On the other hand, they don’t exactly see how a ragtag bunch can beat a powerful regime that has tanks. They don’t see the power of the powerless, that sometimes a shift in consciousness is stronger than military might.
I asked several Hong Kong protesters how they thought this thing would end up. They were not optimistic. “We’re 7 million,” one man told me. “They’re 1.4 billion.” And yet they were not going to stop protesting and putting their lives at risk.
The big difference between now and then is technology. Today’s protests feel like a frenetic, online media campaign. There is a constant flow of memes, symbols and videos to keep the clicks coming: anime art, Pepe the Frog, bloody eye patches that refer to a woman who was shot in the eye.
The protesters sample and quote from the great buzz of global culture, which is of course what they are fighting to stay part of. A quote from “Hunger Games” was popular, then some Pink Floyd lyrics. The anthem of this uprising is “Sing Hallelujah to the Lord,” a 1974 Christian song from America.
Technology allows the protesters to suddenly appear and suddenly disappear, ebb and flow — to “be water,” in Bruce Lee’s phrase.
The protesters have online votes about where to take their protest next. They use AirDrop to download subversive pamphlets into the phones of unsuspecting tourists from mainland China.
There’s an amazing diversity of strategies. The accountants listen to speeches. The Christians sing. The radicals storm the subways.
Of course, the technology helps the Chinese government too. Years ago, we lived under the illusion that the nimble and decentralized swarms of New Power geeks would be more technologically savvy than the clunky, Old Power hierarchies. That’s not true. China’s Communist government seems to be more technologically advanced than the protesters.
There’s a sense the government has the ability to surveil everything. Protesters spend enormous energy trying to go unseen. They don’t use their normal subway cards for fear the state will be able to track their movements. Some protesters have been doxxed, with their private information and photos of their children splashed online. There’s no pro-democracy graffiti in Hong Kong, no posters or T-shirts, no day-to-day sign that anything is happening. When they are not rallying, the protesters evaporate because even the light poles have eyes.
My guess is that if technology helps the protesters become 30% more effective, it helps the state become 70% more effective.
Many suspect that China will eventually crush these protests. They’ll round up leaders and force businesses to fire participants. Many suspect America will never step in to help. The American right no longer believes in spreading democracy to foreigners. The American left embraces a national narrative that emphasizes slavery and oppression, not that America is a beacon or an example. Neither party any longer sees America as a vanguard nation whose very mission is to advance universal democracy and human dignity.
But there’s something stubborn about the Hong Kongers and deceptively powerful about their cause. Other protesters dreamed of freedom. These people have already lived it. It’s part of their identity. They will prove more ferocious in defense of liberty than the skeptics imagine. Along the way they might rekindle the sense of democratic mission that used to burn so forcefully in American hearts.

Texto completo: Back in 2016, Jeff Koons announced that he would be donating a sculpture to the City of Paris in order to commemorate the victims of terrorist attacks that had claimed 130 lives the year before. Theoretically, this gesture could be interpreted as both beatific and solemnly respectful, but many critics instantly took issue with Koons’ choice of gift: a 34-foot-tall hand grasping a cluster of semi-inflated pastel balloons called Bouquet of Tulips. After years of municipal squabbling over the location of the sculpture’s eventual home, this week installation finally began in the gardens behind the Petit Palais, a classical art museum in the city’s 8th arrondissement.
“I hope the work is life-changing to people,” Koons told the New York Times three years ago. “I hope that the Bouquet of Tulips can communicate a sense of future, of optimism, the joy of offering, to find something greater outside the self.” From the perspective of many Parisian artists and intellectuals, this distinctly sugar-coated Koonsian offering was not so welcome. For starters, the colorful sculpture was interpreted by some to be an inappropriate work for commemorating victims of terrorist attacks. In the aftermath of the project’s initial announcement, a cohort of famous dissenters including director Olivier Assayas, former minister of culture Frédéric Mitterrand and industrial designer Matali Crasset wrote a letter to the French newspaper Libération that highlighted their concerns.

Before settling at the Petit Palais, Bouquet of Tulips was intended to be planted between the Museum of Modern Art and the Palais de Tokyo, which would have potentially obscured a pedestrians’ views of the Eiffel Tower. “Without any relation to the tragic events invoked and their location,” the letter explains, this initial plan would “appear at least surprising, if not opportunistic, even cynical.”
This isn’t the first time Koons has gotten a chilly reception in France. His 2008 exhibition of his famous balloon animals in the Château de Versailles compelled Le Monde to label Koons the “paragon of kitsch.” Kitsch can be compelling and dynamic, but perhaps it’s not best to turn memorials into ironic shrines.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump denied Tuesday that there were bedbugs at his private golf resort near Miami, a day after he suggested that his property was a leading contender to host the G-7 summit next year.
"No bedbugs at Doral," Trump wrote in a Tuesday tweet. "The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!"
Trump said Monday that Trump National Doral Miami, a golf resort and hotel, was being considered as a location for next year's G-7 conference, which the U. S. is hosting.
"We haven’t found anything else close to competing with it," he said, touting the location of the resort and it's "incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants. " The property is near Miami International Airport.
"It's like – it's like such a natural," he said of his resort.
Shortly after Trump's comments, #TrumpBedBugs began trending on Twitter and a report of lawsuit resurfaced in which a traveler sued the property for bedbugs.
The Doral resort was sued by Eric Linder, a guest at the hotel, in July 2016, according to the Miami Herald. Linder claimed that during a March 2016 trip he woke up with dozens of bites after staying at the Jack Nicklaus villa. The lawsuit was settled in January 2017.

In addition, the Doral property had 524 health-code violations between 2013 to 2018, the Daily Beast reported. Inspectors in 2015 found “approximately 20-25 live roaches. . . on the walls, baseboards and floors in the kitchen food prep area and behind a utensil table inside a wall crack," according to the report. Between 20 and 30 small flying insects were also living in the kitchen and dishwasher room.
At the time, it was recommended that the state issue an emergency order and temporarily close the kitchen at the property. However, it is unclear whether the kitchen was actually shut down, the Daily Beast reported.

He Donated $900,000 To Politicians. Was It His?

Texto completo: Of all the billionaires, hedge fund managers and chief executives who have showered politicians in New York with money in the last five years, no one has given more often than David C. Rich.
Since 2014, Mr. Rich has doled out more than 200 contributions totaling over $ 900,000. Last year alone, he gave away nearly a quarter of a million dollars across dozens of campaigns, according to an analysis by The New York Times, and has donated at least 39 times so far this year.
The scale of personal contributions put Mr. Rich in the rarefied ranks of the fabulously wealthy, like Steven A. Cohen, the investor, and the Walton family, heirs to the Walmart fortune, who write huge checks to favored causes, often to charter schools.
But Mr. Rich is no billionaire. He is the in-house lobbyist for the Greater New York Hospital Association, the state's most powerful hospital and health system trade association.
His contributions go to Democratic and Republican candidates alike, and the donations have one thing in common: They seem to neatly line up with the interests of his employer.
No comparable in-house lobbyist gives as much as Mr. Rich, nor appears to earn as much: He made $ 1.7 million in total pay in 2017, according to the nonprofit organization's most recent tax filings.
The scale of Mr. Rich's donations and his compensation raised questions about the hospital association's lobbying methods in Albany, at a time when a new Democratic majority in the Capitol is weighing the future of health care in New York.
Although the nonprofit hospital association is free to make political contributions without an annual cap, it gives nothing to individual candidates -- essentially allowing Mr. Rich's personal donations to speak for the organization. That setup seems structured to enhance the profile and influence of Mr. Rich, an executive vice president responsible for all of the association's federal, state and local advocacy.
Mr. Rich's pattern of donations, while unusual, is emblematic of an openly money-focused political culture in Albany in which lobbyists crowd fund-raisers for elected officials steps away from the Capitol, and trade associations pour contributions into campaigns.
Mr. Rich said that his donations were personal and had no connection to his job.
"My personal contributions are mine alone and reflect my passion for, and participation in, the political process," Mr. Rich said in an email.
But seven candidates who have received checks from Mr. Rich in recent years said they assumed the checks represented donations from the association, rather than expressing Mr. Rich's personal political beliefs. That the checks came from his personal account caused some confusion.
"I always wondered about that," said a state senator, who, like other candidates and elected officials who spoke to The Times, requested anonymity to discuss Mr. Rich's contributions for fear of antagonizing a major contributor. "It's an unusual arrangement, even in Albany."
Employers are barred from paying their workers extra compensation with the expectation that the money would be used for political contributions, said Henry Berger, a veteran election lawyer. "If anybody could ever prove that such an arrangement was made, it would be found illegal," he said.
Mr. Rich said that no such arrangement existed.
"No part of my compensation is determined by or connected to my campaign contributions," he said. "In my 26 years at G.N.Y.H.A., I have never been directed or required by my employer to make a campaign contribution, nor have I ever been reimbursed by my employer for a campaign contribution."
Other major trade associations do not pay nearly as much, even to their top officials. John Banks, then the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents developers' interests, was paid about half as much as Mr. Rich in 2017.
Mr. Rich, who joined the hospital association in 1993, has been a longtime donor to political campaigns, mostly at the state level. But his contributions have increased in recent years, according to an analysis of state filings by The Times.
They appear to represent a significant portion of his pretax income in some years. For example, in 2015, Mr. Rich made $ 1.5 million in total compensation and gave away $ 162,000 to political candidates. The next year, he made $ 1.6 million and gave away $ 128,000. (Political contributions are not tax deductible.)
"Given the donor's job, these hefty contributions raise all kinds of questions, but the larger issue here is New York's ridiculously high contribution limits, which invite pay to play," said John Kaehny, the executive director of Reinvent Albany, a good government group. "The Campaign Finance Commission has to lower contribution limits, or nothing will really change in Albany."
The hospital association is a behemoth in Albany, commanding respect and close connections in the Legislature and the governor's office, even though it does not give money directly to candidates.
The association has, however, given more than $ 5 million through its for-profit arm to Democratic and Republican Party committee housekeeping accounts since 2014. It also spends heavily on outside lobbyists, employing four separate firms in the first half of 2019 for more than $ 415,000, according to state filings.
Greater New York forged a bond years ago with 1199SEIU, a health care workers union, and has presented a unified front against health care funding cuts. Its president, Kenneth Raske, enjoys a close relationship with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, and has been seated at the governor's table at fund-raisers. (Mr. Raske earned more than $ 8 million in 2017.)
With the collapse of real estate's influence in Albany evident in the rent law changes during the last session, the health care industry has remained a power center, one of the few left standing. Greater New York, whose most prominent members are New York City hospitals, is a major reason for that influence.
And Mr. Rich is the association's most recognizable face in the state capital.
"I would say he's among the best and most well-regarded lobbyists in Albany," said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit business group. "He is probably more effective than anyone at stopping legislation that will be damaging to his industry."
The association, along with 1199SEIU, was successful earlier this year in restoring proposed budget cuts to Medicaid funding, and has resisted proposals supported by trial lawyers, another major spender in Albany, to increase damages in wrongful death cases.
Many trade groups and business associations employ in-house lobbyists, and many of them funnel money to political campaigns on behalf of their employers through vehicles like political action committees. They also make personal donations, but none on the scale of Mr. Rich.
The Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents hospitals statewide, contributes large amounts of money through its political action committee. But its lobbyists have made few personal contributions.
For example, Robin Frank, a government affairs employee at H.A.N.Y.S., never gave more than $ 2,000 in a year during her time, state records show. Another government affairs worker, Susan Van Meter, made similarly small contributions, mostly to the association's political action committee. Both earned less than $ 300,000.
A spokesman for the hospital association, Brian Conway, said Mr. Rich "cannot be meaningfully compared to anyone" who might be considered a counterpart at another association because of his large staff and many responsibilities, which include overseeing communications, public policy and independent expenditure campaigns, as well as lobbying.
Mr. Conway also pointed to the uniqueness of the association, whose for-profit arms afford the association "more resources to serve our members" than other hospital associations, he said.
Mr. Rich's top recipients have included Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, as well as members of a group of breakaway Democrats known as the Independent Democratic Conference, who until last year's elections helped Republicans maintain control of the State Senate. He has also made a smaller number of contributions to federal candidates, mostly in the New York area.
Mr. Rich has given tens of thousands of dollars to the current chair of the State Senate health committee, Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat, and to the former chairman, Kemp Hannon, a Republican.
"He's an incredibly smart, effective and thoughtful advocate for his constituency. We won't always agree, but I will always listen to him," Mr. Rivera said in a telephone interview. "My decisions as a policymaker have never been influenced and will never be influenced by who supports me financially."
Mr. Rivera and Mr. Hannon both also received contributions from Scott R. Smith, who is Mr. Rich's domestic partner.
Since 2014, Mr. Smith has contributed $ 70,000 to state candidates' campaigns and to a health care political action committee. Every one of those entities also received donations from Mr. Rich.

Texto completo: On Sunday, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh addressed his role in stirring racist rhetoric in politics in the past while announcing his intentions of challenging President Donald Trump in the Republican primary.
Walsh apologized for his past comments in an appearance on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" in which he said he had a role in Trump's ascension.
"I helped create Trump, there's no doubt about that," he said.
Walsh went on to offer his opinion of Trump: "He's nuts, he's erratic, he's cruel, he stokes bigotry."
He also wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed that Trump "inspires imitators" but brought up his own "share of controversy."
"At times, I expressed hate for my political opponents. We now see where this can lead," he wrote. "There's no place in our politics for personal attacks like that, and I regret making them."
Walsh announced his campaign on Twitter Sunday morning, saying, "It won't be easy, but bravery is never easy."
ABC News' Jonathan Carl said on the show that the Trump campaign's only response thus far to Walsh's challenge was one word: "Whatever."
Walsh joins former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld in the primary against Trump.
In 2014, Walsh was pulled off the air during his talk radio show for using racist slurs. He also promoted the "birther" conspiracy during President Barack Obama's time in office and said Obama was elected only because he is black.
When asked by Stephanopoulos on Sunday to address instances of his own racism, including his promotion of the conspiracy theory that Obama is Muslim and remarks against Sen. Kamala Harris, Walsh said he has reflected on his previous statements.
"I said some ugly things about President Obama that I regret," Walsh said.
Walsh has a history of inconsistency in his opinions of Trump's rhetoric. At times, he has denounced the president as a racist. This summer, when Trump told four Democratic congresswomen, who are people of color and citizens of the U.S., to go back to their countries of origin if they do not like this country, Walsh spoke out.
"To say 'go back to where you came from' is gross. It's offensive, ignorant, anti-American, and racist," he tweeted.
Walsh said the one good thing about the president's language is that it has made him realize his attacks were inappropriate.
"We have a guy in the White House who's never apologized for anything he's done or said. I think it's a weakness not to apologize," Walsh told Stephanopoulos.

Texto completo: Former U.S. Sen. Al Franken, who told the New Yorker in July that he regretted resigning over sexual misconduct allegations, is taking more steps to raise his public profile.
Tickets went on sale Friday for "An Evening with Al Franken" on Oct. 2 at Revolution Hall in Portland, Ore. Its website says the Minnesota Democrat is "delighted" to share behind-the-scenes details about his time on "Saturday Night Live" and in the Senate.
The best tickets are $89.50.
The former comedian earlier rolled out a website that includes his writings and a series of podcasts, many of them about serious policy issues but leavened by humor and profanity. He recently launched a YouTube channel.
Franken and New Yorker writer Jane Mayer both faced backlash over her story, which debunked some allegations made by Leeann Tweeden, his original accuser. Several other women made similar charges.
A Slate writer concluded that Mayer sometimes seemed "too eager to see Franken as a childlike innocent." New York Times columnist David Leonhardt said that, taken together, the charges "suggest that Franken behaved inappropriately."
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., a presidential candidate who called for Franken's resignation, wondered after the New Yorker piece why it "only seemed to delve into" one of the eight allegations.
Still, she told the Washington Post there's "a path for redemption" for Franken.

Texto completo: Science teacher Heather Overkamp has her eye on biotechnology kits that will help her teach medical health lessons this coming school year.
The field changes fast, she said, and her independent research students need to keep up with the newest technologies.
But the price tag - $500 - is one her district likely won't pay.
So she's crowdsourcing.
The website she's using, Donors Choose, is one of several that teachers are increasingly using to fill the gap between classroom supplies they want and how much their schools can afford. As teachers prepare for the school year to begin, the scene is heating up.
In Hampton Roads, nearly 6,000 projects have been funded for a total of more than $2.9 million since 2007, according to Donors Choose. Norfolk teachers have had the most projects funded in the area, about 1,700, the company said.
Teachers propose a project, spell out the cost and then post it, and the website helps them craft a compelling message. Sometimes the donations are matched or doubled by large corporations. Some teachers also use GoFundMe and Amazon, which lets teachers create wish lists. All are easier than constantly applying for grants, which may take a significant amount of time and documentation.
"It gives you that freedom to pick whatever it is you need and you're not constrained by budget line items," said Overkamp, who teaches science and engineering at I.C. Norcom High School in Portsmouth. In the past she's successfully crowdfunded 3D printers, 3D doodler pens and other high-tech gadgets.
At most school systems around Hampton Roads, teachers are required to get approval from their principals or supervisors before soliciting donations. But for the most part, they are supportive, several teachers said.
Hampton Roads school divisions vary on how they help teachers with school supplies. Norfolk gives $100 stipends while some others give gift cards or leave decisions up to principals. Teachers are also eligible for a $250 tax deduction for classroom expenses that have not been reimbursed.
But most still reach into their own pockets.
Ninety-four percent of public school teachers spend their own money on supplies, according to a federal Department of Education study cited by The New York Times. Teachers spend nearly $500 of their own money, according to the story.
In Virginia Beach, there's a room at Newtown Elementary that teachers call "the Christmas room."
It has a 65-inch interactive screen, a Lego wall, a video studio and tables that fold up to move so there's more space for Lego robotics. Instructional technologist Kevin Rickard made it into a maker space funded by projects on Donors Choose.
He also created a science lab with donated tables, magnets, shelving units, blenders and other supplies. And he helped create two garden spaces stocked with hoses, rain barrels, compost bins, umbrellas and even bird baths.
Rickard said he wants to get moving on projects faster than the district is able to fund them. He uses social media to engage in discussions with teachers around the country, find donors and put a spotlight on projects that need attention.
He's led training sessions for colleagues, including teacher Amanda Lewis, who has netted more activities and games for her classroom at Newtown through crowdsourcing.
"It's nice for the extra things that make school more fun," Lewis said. "It's for those extra things to make it more meaningful for them." She also said parents will stock classrooms in the beginning of the year, but as time goes on, the supplies run low.
Molly Loch, who teaches art at Providence Elementary in Virginia Beach, has had nine projects funded through Donors Choose. This year she's after cameras, a wireless compact photo printer and printer paper, which will all cost about $700. She wants them so students can learn how to compose a picture and document their work.
Her school is "on the generous side" she said, and she has a "fantastic principal who rarely tells me no." But she also doesn't want to keep going back to ask for more.
Jennie Paden, who teaches first grade at Providence, said it can be eye-opening for people beyond the school community to see teachers' needs in a list format. She's used Donors Choose and Amazon wish lists in the past, and this year is asking for books that focus on social and emotional growth and development.
"It gives you the feeling that I'm not asking someone to donate but can give back, too," she said. "It's nice to be able to do something for somebody else. We all kind of benefit from it."

CNN editor who resigned over ‘Jewish pigs’ tweets says he was victim of ‘coordinated attack’

Texto completo: A former CNN photo editor and writer who resigned after his past anti-Semitic tweets resurfaced is now saying the incident was "like a coordinated attack" by the Trump administration.
Last month, Mohammed Elshamy resigned from his position with the network when several tweets of his from years ago gained attention, including one 2011 tweet that read, "More than 4 jewish pigs killed in #Jerusalem today by the Palestinian bomb explode. #Israel #Gaza."
Now, he's pointing the finger at Trump officials amid reports that they have been scouring the social media history of reporters viewed as hostile toward the president.
“It felt like a coordinated attack,” Elshamy, who said he had received death threats, told the New York Times in an article published Sunday detailing the administration's alleged campaign. “It was overwhelming.”
He went on to claim that he posted the various tweets when he was a teenager growing up in Egypt and still learning English.
“I was repeating slogans heard on the streets during a highly emotional time in my nation’s history,” he said. “I believe that my subsequent work and views over the years redeems for the mistakes I made as a kid.”
Elshamy admitted that he understands "the severity and harm of my comments." However, he slammed the alleged campaign by Trump officials.
"It is a very dirty tactic that they are using to cause as much harm as they can to anyone who is affiliated with these media outlets,” he said. “It actually feels like a competition and every termination or vilification is a point for them."
New York Times editor Tom Wright-Piersanti, who also found himself in hot water over his past controversial tweets that were recently uncovered, similarly defended himself despite calling them "not funny" and "clearly offensive."
"I feel deep shame for them, and I am truly, honestly sorry that I wrote these," he said, adding that he had forgotten about the tweets as his career in journalism was starting.
“For my generation, the generation that came of age in the internet, all the youthful mistakes that you made get preserved in digital amber, and no matter how much you change and mature and grow up, it’s always out there, waiting to be discovered,” Wright-Piersanti said.
The White House denied the reports, however, saying, "We know nothing about this, but it’s clear that the media has a lot of work to do to clean up its own house."

The Grey named to world's best list

Texto completo: If you want to dine at one of the world's best restaurants, you don't have to travel very far.
The Grey on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Savannah has earned a spot on Food & Wine and Travel + Leisure's inaugural World's Best Restaurants list, which was released Tuesday.
The list, which is unranked and includes 30 establishments from around the world, was curated by writer Besha Rodell, Food & Wine editor Hunter Lewis, Travel + Leisure editor Jacqueline Gifford, a panel of 22 culinary personalities and one anonymous critic.
"Being included in something called 'Best in the World' by such highly regarded publications certainly tells us that we are doing something that resonates here and abroad," said founding partner Johno Morisano, who opened the restaurant alongside executive chef Mashama Bailey nearly five years ago.
"But more importantly, it reminds that we have built a team that is world-class and we have not yet even begun to tap the potential of this extraordinary group of people. That's really exciting for all of us."
The inaugural list celebrates the very best of cuisine and culture, and The Grey earned a spot because it's one of a handful of restaurants in North America that best reflect their places of origin, Lewis told the Savannah Morning News.
"From a design point of view, The Grey is a beautiful gathering place with historical resonance, and Mashama Bailey's talent for elevating the foodways of the region and creating modern, luxurious and soulful dishes is second to none," he said. "We're also impressed with Mashama and Johno's leadership and the work culture they've created at The Grey that other restaurateurs can learn from."
The Grey has regularly earned national acclaim, including from the New York Times, Eater, Time magazine and Southern Living. Most recently, Bailey was awarded the 2019 James Beard award for best chef in the Southeast. She's also featured on the latest season of the Netflix series "Chef's Table."
Morisano said when he and his wife moved to Savannah eight years ago, their goal was to become part of the community and contribute to it. He and Bailey approached The Grey the same way, he said.
"I think outlets like these take notice of The Grey because we stick to our knitting. We're just making food and creating experiences for our guests," he said.
"In the larger scheme of things in this world, it's not that big a deal. But, in order to make those experiences complete, we have to endeavor to get them exactly right 100% of the time, which we do not accomplish because it's really difficult.
"So while recognition like this is awesome and puts some gas in our tank, tomorrow we will be back to being completely focused on that night's dinner service."

'Peanut Butter Falcon' showcases Florida actor commentary

Texto completo: Boynton Beach actor Zack Gottsagen wanted an opportunity to be a movie star. He challenged friends Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz to come up with a film for him.
Writer-directors Nilson and Schwartz delivered "The Peanut Butter Falcon," which opens in about a thousand theaters Friday. They don't see the movie as a star vehicle for 34-year-old Gottsagen, who has Down syndrome.
"It's a story about family and love and connection, and I think Zack is probably, from a public standpoint, the most interesting aspect of that," Nilson said. "We used somebody who has a different ability in a way that hasn't been used before. People are gravitating to that aspect of the story, but if you look at the nature of the film, it isn't a star vehicle."
The first feature from Nilson and Schwartz collected an audience award in March at the South by Southwest Film Festival. The admiring reviews started arriving this month. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called it a "lovely debut feature." Glenn Kenny of The New York Times said Gottsagen is "a disarming performer who creates a sweet and funny character."
"I'm proud of everybody," Schwartz said. "If we're coaches of the team, I like to see our players recognized."
The team includes Shia LaBeouf, Dakota Johnson and three Oscar nominees, Bruce Dern, John Hawkes and Thomas Haden Church. Their characters interact with Gottsagen's, a young man who flees an old-age home and longs to become a wrestler.
Nilson marveled at Gottsagen's work with the cast. "He really prepared," Nilson said. "I was a little nervous that he would get stage fright. He was so loose and prepared. He had studied so hard."
The directors say a five-minute trailer they made with Gottsagen helped them land the impressive cast. "We sent it off. It was the first thing that people started saying yes to," Nilson said.
Florida figures in the plot, but the directors considered North Carolina, New Orleans and Georgia as the places to film. Georgia was selected. "There are great crews there. It's also because of the [tax] incentives," Schwartz said. "Georgia made the most sense."
The executive producers include three who are familiar with the Down syndrome community: Tim Shriver of Special Olympics, Anthony Shriver of Best Buddies and Michelle Sie Whitten of the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.
"They were a great help," Schwartz said. "We wanted to depict a character with Down syndrome authentically. We wanted feedback from the community. We show bullying that's authentic to people with Down syndrome. It's edgy."
The experts urged the filmmakers to show the bullying and to make Gottsagen's character nuanced, Schwartz added. "Zack's character experiences frustration, sadness, happiness," he said.
The actor is going through those feelings, too, after losing his job as a movie usher. At a Los Angeles screening, Gottsagen asked people to help him get his job back. Nilson comforted him by telling him he's a movie star. "As one door is closing, another door is opening," Nilson said.
The movie could open doors for others. Nilson cited the reaction of a woman at a screening in Bloomington, Ind. "The woman said her son had Down syndrome and he was trying to get a job," Nilson said. "She was so excited about the way the film might affect the world and the way the world sees her son. She thinks her son might be able to get a job."
"Sometimes this country we're living in, this world we're living in can feel angry," Nilson added. "Maybe we can accept each other and listen a little more. It's nice to put that message out there."

‘Free press’ has hatred for president

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 24 Aug 2019: 8.

Resumen: [...]a coup to oust a duly elected president is far worse. [...]the "free press" frees itself from its bond of hate, the threat to democracy remains. Short-term memory seems to be a common marker for dementia, Alzheimers and just old-age memory loss. Since doing crosswords, I know my short-term memory has improved tremendously. According to the 2018 American Express State of Women-Owned Business Report, there are approximately 12.3 million women-owned businesses nationwide, a major contrast to the approximately 402,000 nearly 50 years ago.

Texto completo: ‘Free press’ has hatred for president The Daily Herald opinion of Friday, Aug. 16, echoes the same theme of a year ago, namely President Donald Trump describes the "free press" as "enemies of the people." The theme has not changed, neither has the "free press" MSNBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, etc. These commentators, expert analysts, entertainers and talk show hosts harbor enormous hatred for Trump.
To shape public opinion, the press has called the president unspeakable names and accusations; mentally unfit to be president, collaborated with the enemy, become a dictator, etc. They lied, conjectured and manufactured false accusations. One "expert" analyst suggested treason. Treason is punishable by death. Outrageous.
For two years it was the Russia collusion hoax. The Mueller report ended that. Obstruction of justice, fizzled. Next came the perennial favorite smear: He is a racist. This baseless accusation is currently raging. All this time not one favorable comment about the president? Where is fairness, integrity and balance?
Tune in anytime to CNN or MSNBC for verification. In a nutshell that is the state of our "free press."
When the "free press" dedicated itself to remove from office our legitimately elected president, using slander and vicious lies, and turned on the very citizenry that it was constitutionally entrusted to protect against actual government abuse, it has indeed betrayed the public trust and has turned itself into "the enemy of the people." Period.
The Opinion is correct that such adversarial relationship between President Donald Trump and the "free press" is bad for democracy. But a coup to oust a duly elected president is far worse. That is treason. Until the "free press" frees itself from its bond of hate, the threat to democracy remains. An Opinion on the responsibility of the free press is much awaited.
Laszlo Stephan Elmhurst Asylum at home I have one question for the Democrats. Where do the tens of millions of people living in violence, fear and poverty in their cities, counties and states get to go and apply for asylum?
Tony Atkins Wheaton Try this ‘clump of cells’ test In his recent letter "Opponents of choice use religion, not fact," John Gleason opens with this: "It boggles the mind that writers like Michael Ellegood and other anti-choice fanatics continue to assign human qualities to what amounts to a clump of cells in a woman’s body." A bit further on, he informs us that, "Most of the legally terminated pregnancies are of embryos, not babies."
Clump of cells, John? That’s all you see? OK, then let’s test your thinking. Do a web search for the Decorah eagles. You’ll find a page that includes live-streaming video of an eagle’s nest there. Bookmark the page and go back there daily, beginning in, oh, say, late January of next year. Keep going to that page until you see that the nest contains an egg or two.
Then, drive to Decorah, climb the tree and take an egg. When you get back down on the ground, start up a little campfire and make yourself an omelette using that egg you just retrieved from the nest. Keep it warm, and then sit there and wait for the IDNR officers and/or other officials from the state/county.
Not to worry, however, as you can explain to them that the egg was not an eagle, but merely a "clump of cells" inside an eggshell. Just convince them that your meal does not involve an eagle, and in fact, is a mere embryo, and does not even have "eagle qualities."
If you manage to convince them, who knows? They might ask if they could join you for breakfast. If, as I suspect, you can’t convince them, you could well find yourself having some "quiet time" away from your home and family. If that should happen, write another letter and tell us all about how and why everything happened as it did.
John Babush Big Rock Crosswords are more than ‘just puzzles’ For years we’ve been reading our favorite health articles about how to enlarge our pecs, our abs, our delts and any other of the muscles that we are so proud of, but how about the systems that help those muscles function? The nervous system. Let’s fire up our neurons, axons, dendrites and synapses. How? I’m convinced that crossword puzzles are the best way to meet the cognitive challenges of memory, intelligence, memory loss, even Alzheimers.
Doing crosswords helps us to: read between the lines; think outside the box; be decisive; take chances; improve memory. Short-term memory seems to be a common marker for dementia, Alzheimers and just old-age memory loss. Since doing crosswords, I know my short-term memory has improved tremendously.
Crosswords were instrumental in saving a 7-year-old boy’s life. When in college, my summer job for two years was teaching swimming and lifeguarding for the Chicago Park District. One night, I locked the door to the pool and went to supper at a local restaurant. I always brought a crossword to do at the table. This time I forgot, so I hopped in the car and returned to the pool. As always, I took a quick scan of the pool. To my utter dismay, a body was at the bottom. I jumped in immediately and pulled one of my 7-year-olds to the deck. Luckily he was still gurgling and coughing up water, but was OK. It turned out the cleaning lady left the door between the girl’s and boy’s locker room open and he just had to take one more jump from the diving board, but panicked.
That story is probably why at the age of 91, I still start the day with a cup of coffee and a puzzle.
Ed Berge Rolling Meadows Advances for women, but more to be done August 26, Women’s Equality Day, marks the 99th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment — the day women were given the Constitutional right to vote.
In the last 99 years, women have made remarkable strides, especially in the world of politics and business. In 2018, America elected 117 new women to the U.S. House or Senate, a record number, bringing the total number of women in Congress to 127 and 25 in the Senate. Plus, nine women were elected governor in 2018. As we look to the presidential election, six women are viable candidates.
The same can be said for women business owners and entrepreneurs. According to the 2018 American Express State of Women-Owned Business Report, there are approximately 12.3 million women-owned businesses nationwide, a major contrast to the approximately 402,000 nearly 50 years ago. The Women’s Business Development Center, with offices throughout the Midwest, including Chicago, is proud to be part of that success.
When we began in 1986, roughly 1 in 4 privately held businesses were owned by women. Today we serve several thousand woman-owned businesses in our nine-state region. Despite this progress, there is still more work to be done such as equal pay for women and men. Access to capital for women-owned businesses and programs and networking opportunities for women to continue to grow and move ahead.
So, this Women’s Equality Day, we celebrate the past and look forward to a future of great things for women. Let’s all strive to do more in the next 365 days to continue moving women ahead as we march forward to the 100th anniversary next year.

Texto completo: This week’s White House Report Card finds President Trump culminating another extraordinary week in France at the G-7 economic summit where his latest tirade against China will dominate the talks.
Of course, our graders were at odds. Democratic pollster John Zogby failed the president again, citing his conflicting positions on issues. Conservative analyst Jed Babbin saw lots of examples of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”
John Zogby
Grade F
As the late comedian Joan Rivers used to say, 'Can we talk?'
There is no way to see this week as anything but a complete disaster. President Trump insulted the prime minister of a solid ally, Denmark, and canceled a trip over their rejection of a silly whim — the U.S. buying Greenland. A reminder: Greenland is not for sale, the Danes knew nothing about this, and the citizens of the island are opposed.
Tweet
Then, the president said he will consider payroll tax cuts to stave off a recession — and backed off the next day because someone reminded him (probably Larry Kudlow) that it is not good form to talk about a recession until there is one.
Then, he continued his flap with two freshmen lawmakers over Israel and, in the process, managed to insult Jewish voters who do not vote for Republicans (around 79%). Then, he said he will try to end the policy of citizenship to children born here of illegal residents (which, I think, would take a constitutional amendment because it is in the Constitution).
Tweet
And then, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the federal government will experience its second trillion dollar deficit in a row. But then ... that's enough. One important note: Trump awarded my childhood hero NBA legend Bob Cousy the Presidential Medal of Freedom this week. Bob has been the best on and off the court. But not enough to save this week.
Jed Babbin
Grade B-
This was a very significant week for President Trump, more for what others did — especially the New York Times and China — than what he did himself.
Dean Baquet, the NYT's executive editor, told the newspaper’s reporters and editorialists in no uncertain terms that, with the “Russia collusion” narrative having collapsed around them, their job between now and November 2020 was to convince voters that Trump is a racist. In a leaked transcript of Baquet’s remarks, he said that the Times had built its newsroom around the Russia collusion narrative and that because it had failed to oust Trump, it was time to move on to a racism narrative. Between the NYT, Washington Post, and the rest of the liberal media, there’s not even a pretense of objectivity. They will make as much trouble for Trump as they can.
Tweet
China, meanwhile, is still held off from crushing the Hong Kong freedom demonstrators by Trump’s relative restraint in their mutual trade war. China did announce that another 10% tariff will be imposed on U.S. goods, including agricultural products. Trump proclaimed himself “the chosen one” for dealing with China and ordered U.S. businesses to find alternatives to China, which is beyond his power to compel. Stocks took another hit from the China trade news.
The week’s main kerfuffle resulted from Trump’s comments that Jews who voted for Democrats displayed a “total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.” To whom the loyalty was owed, he didn’t say. He was attacked immediately for playing on anti-Semitic tropes, which clearly wasn’t his intent. Trump doesn’t understand that Jews haven’t, for many years, equated support for Israel with earning their votes. He also doesn’t understand that his strong friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is, in the Democrats’ minds, a fatal taint on the Israeli state. It’s another manifestation of Trump Derangement Syndrome.
Tweet
Meanwhile, the government of Gibraltar let the Iranian tanker that had been seized by the Brits go along its way despite U.S. efforts to arrest the ship. Our peace talks with the Taliban stumble on without the cease-fires we’d demanded. Another two U.S. troops were killed there this week. The Taliban-U.S. talks closely resemble the U.S.-North Vietnamese talks an era ago. We know how they turned out.

Brazil military mobilizes to fight Amazon fires, and restore ‘positive perception’

Texto completo: Rio de Janeiro • Rocked by global outrage and threats of economic losses over its handling of fires raging in the Amazon rainforest, Brazil on Saturday began a hastily planned military operation to battle the blazes and generate a “positive perception” of the country.
As of Saturday, at least four Brazilian states had formally requested military assistance to contain hundreds of fires, which have been burning for several weeks but plunged President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration into crisis mode only this past week after photographs began circulating widely.
The number of fires tracked by satellite this year is the highest since 2010.
Military officials said they had deployed two C-130 cargo planes equipped with firefighting tools to the state of Rondônia and were assessing how many of the nearly 44,000 troops based in the Amazon area to mobilize. In addition to Rondônia, the armed forces will support firefighting efforts in the states of Pará, Tocantins and Roraima.
The plan got underway hours after Bolsonaro — a longtime critic of Brazil’s strict, but sparsely enforced, environmental regulations — told the nation in a televised speech that the government would take a “zero tolerance” approach to environmental crimes.
That was a remarkable statement for a leader who has called environmental fines an “industry” that must be abolished and has pledged to make it easier for industries to access protected areas. Bolsonaro himself was issued a fine in 2012 for fishing in a protected area. The fine went unpaid.
Bolsonaro had dismissed concerns about the Amazon fires for days, but was moved to announce the military effort soon after European leaders threatened to cancel a major trade deal and calls for a boycott of Brazilian products resounded on social media.
Brazilian officials said the military was uniquely equipped to battle the fires and help enforce environmental laws. But restoring the country’s image was also at play.
Lt. Brig. Raul Botelho, the chief of the Armed Forces’ Joint Staff, said an important part of the mission was creating “a positive perception of the country.”

Employee Class Action Against Ford Is Denied

Texto completo: A federal judge in Chicago ruled this week that a lawsuit brought by female Ford employees over sexual misconduct at two Chicago plants cannot proceed as a class-action suit.
The ruling was a setback for the plaintiffs, who said they had endured groping, vulgarities and sexual violence despite the company's efforts to change a longstanding culture of harassment.
The lawsuit, filed in 2014 by more than 30 women, accuses the company of not doing enough to ensure a safe and equitable work environment. It sought to include all women who worked at Ford's assembly or stamping plants in Chicago from 2012 to the present.
But Judge Robert M. Dow Jr., of the Northern District of Illinois, ruled that the women's experiences were too disparate to be considered as a single class. The plaintiffs can still sue as individuals.
The culture of harassment at Ford was described in a 2017 investigation by The New York Times that included detailed accounts from workers in the two plants dating back to the 1990s. It concluded that the company's efforts to stamp out sexual misconduct had fallen short.
The accounts of the working conditions at the Ford plants threw into stark relief how little attention blue-collar workers had received as the #MeToo movement gained steam that year, following revelations of harassment by celebrities and white-collar professional women. A former worker at one of the Ford plants proposed a new hashtag: #WhatAboutUs.
The company's president and chief executive, Jim Hackett, apologized for any harassment that had occurred in an open letter days after the article was published. In a statement on Friday, Ford said that it had a "comprehensive approach" in place to prevent and address sexual harassment and discrimination.
"While we are pleased with the judge's decision," the statement said, "we will continue to reinforce the importance of respectful, harassment-free environments at all of our facilities, including our Chicago plants."
The company said that it had increased its human resources staff by 30 percent and put a number of new policies in place, including additional training and rules that employees disclose personal relationships.
Lawyers for the women did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company first faced sustained criticism about sexual harassment at the two plants in the 1990s, when dozens of women sued or filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In a settlement with that agency in 2000, Ford agreed to pay $ 22 million, including $ 9 million in damages to at least 100 women. As part of the deal, the company denied liability but pledged to make changes overseen by outside monitors.
Conditions seemed to improve for a time, but complaints about sexual harassment surged once again around 2011. By then, the company was recovering from the Great Recession, and new hires had flooded into factories.
By August 2017, the E.E.O.C. and Ford had reached another settlement, for $ 10 million, over sexual and racial harassment at the two Chicago plants. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the company said that 835 workers had received checks as part of the settlement. The full terms were confidential, but the deal required more improvements at the company, including greater accountability for managers. Monitors will oversee the plants for five years.
The Ford plants, which offered good pay and benefits at a time when the nation's manufacturing base was eroding, had once been the exclusive preserve of men. Some of the harassment was fueled by resentment at the presence of women on the factory floor.
Many of the female employees who sued are African-American, and accused black, white and Latino men of misconduct. Some of the women said they also endured racial slurs, and some who complained faced retaliation.
Their union, the United Auto Workers, offered limited recourse. The 2014 lawsuit accuses union representatives of harassment and of trying to stop women from filing complaints.
Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting, and Susan C. Beachy contributed research.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong authorities said on Thursday that they had charged two men with rioting over a mob attack on protesters and passers-by in a train station in a satellite town last month. The assault led to widespread criticism of the police for their failure to stop the violence and of prosecutors for the time it took to charge anyone.
Dozens of people were injured -- including journalists, protesters, a pro-democracy lawmaker and bystanders -- when more than 100 men dressed in white shirts and wielding sticks and metal bars swarmed inside the Yuen Long train station in northwestern Hong Kong on July 21. On Wednesday, thousands gathered in Yuen Long to remember those injured in the attack and to call for swifter prosecution.
No suspects were arrested in the hours after the violence. A police official said that none of the men were seen with weapons, despite photographs and video of officers talking to men in white shirts holding sticks and metal rods.
In the weeks after the attack, the police arrested more than 20 people, including some who had connections with organized crime. On Thursday, Kong Wing-cheung, senior superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch, sought to justify the apparent delay, saying that the police sometimes do not make immediate arrests when they fear it could escalate volatile situations.
Police officials had previously acknowledged shortcomings in their response in Yuen Long but had defended their overall actions, saying the need to send officers to other parts of the city had put strains on their response times. When Matthew Cheung, the No. 2 official in the Hong Kong government, apologized for the police response, some officers and police associations denounced him.
On Thursday, John Tse, chief superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch, said that the investigation into the attacks was continuing, but he did not discuss the possibility of additional charges.
Lam Cheuk-ting, the lawmaker who was injured in the attack, said on Thursday that many more should face prosecution.
"I hope the police could also catch all of them," he said. "There were more than a hundred people in Yuen Long that night. It must not be the end."
The protests in Hong Kong began months ago over a now-suspended proposal that would allow extraditions to mainland China. Demonstrators continue to call for a full withdrawal of the legislation, and their demands have grown to include an amnesty for arrested protesters, expanded elections and an investigation into the use of force by the police.
Also on Thursday, a newspaper controlled by the Chinese Communist Party reported that an employee of the British consulate in Hong Kong who was being held in mainland China had been accused of visiting a prostitute. The family of the employee, Simon Cheng, a trade officer for the consulate, said he did not return from an Aug. 8 work trip to Shenzhen, a mainland city bordering Hong Kong.
He exchanged text messages with his girlfriend that night as he returned to Hong Kong by high-speed train. "Pray for me," Mr. Cheng said.
His family said in a statement on Wednesday that they had been trying without success to find out where he was being held or what charges he faced.
Hu Xijin, editor in chief of Global Times, a Communist Party-owned tabloid, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Cheng had asked the police to not tell his family. "Police are willing to help reduce damage to his reputation," Mr. Hu wrote, adding, "U.K. diplomats and media ruined him." He did not explain why the police chose to release the information to state-owned news outlets.
Mr. Cheng's family and his girlfriend declined to comment on the report.
"Everyone knows it's not the truth," Tommy Cheung, a friend, wrote on Twitter. "But time will tell."
The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement on Friday that it had not been able to speak to Mr. Cheng since his detention, adding that it had repeatedly raised the case with the Chinese authorities and was "urgently" seeking further information.
Mr. Cheng's supporters in Hong Kong had raised questions about his disappearance. His involvement in the demonstrations, if any, is not clear, but Chinese officials have accused Britain and the United States of supporting the protests.
Michael Mo, an organizer of a demonstration to show support for Mr. Cheng, called his arrest "lame smear tactics" against a "seemingly politically active person."
The accusations against Mr. Cheng were also a reminder of one of the main reasons for the demonstrations. Many protesters said they feared that allowing extraditions to mainland China would drastically increase residents' exposure to the mainland legal system and the risk of arbitrary and political prosecutions.
In a sign that such fears were being taken seriously outside the city, a senior Canadian official said on Thursday that local staff would no longer travel outside Hong Kong. The move comes amid growing concerns that China could retaliate against Chinese employees of governments that have criticized its handling of the crisis.
The official said that Britain and Australia had undertaken similar restrictions and that Canada was coordinating with its allies to address potential risks to staff members who were not accredited diplomats and do not have diplomatic passports.
On Sunday, Chinese authorities warned Canada to stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs after the country joined the European Union in calling for China to respect peoples' rights of assembly. Speaking on Wednesday in Montreal, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated Canada's stance.
There are roughly 300,000 Canadian citizens living in Hong Kong, according to Canada's Foreign Ministry. Canada and China have been ensnared in a geopolitical squabble following the arrest in Vancouver in December of Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the United States. In response, China arrested two Canadians and has accused them of espionage.
Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese control in 1997 after more than 150 years as a British colony, has its own political and legal systems that provide far greater protections for civil liberties then those in the mainland China. But fear of the erosion of those systems under pressure from the mainland has been a major factor in recent discontent.
Since suspending the extradition legislation in June, the Hong Kong government has done little to respond to the demonstrations. The police have become the most public face of the authorities, clashing with confrontational protesters and firing more than 1,800 canisters of tear gas since early June. In recent days, however, both the police and protesters have pulled back before standoffs have escalated into serious violence.
Police officials have defended their use of force. In response to a New York Times investigation about the use of tear gas, Mr. Kong, the police superintendent, said on Thursday that video of tear gas canisters falling from height on Aug. 5 "seems to be an illusion created by the camera angle."
He said officers fired tear gas from a platform about four or five stories high at protesters on an elevated area about two or three stories high. "I believe that our colleagues were shooting tear gas at an angle toward the sky from the lower floor close to the ground, then the tear gas fell," Mr. Kong said.
He did not respond to other accusations the police had violated standards for use of tear gas, including inside a subway station or firing canisters directly at people.

Texto completo: In the coming weeks, customers who order a meal via DoorDash, the nation's biggest food-delivery app, will get something extra: a promise that when they tip, the money will go straight to the worker, rather than into DoorDash's pocket.
The company's one million delivery workers will also get something else extra: an increase in minimum base pay.
The result, the company promised on Thursday, will be that on average, the workers, known as Dashers, will make more money -- though how much more remains unclear -- and "on average" means that some Dashers will make more and others will make less on a particular order.
DoorDash had been widely criticized for its old pay model, in which customer tips effectively went to DoorDash rather than to the worker in many cases. Last month, after a New York Times article described the tip policy, the company said it would drop it.
The new system is being rolled out gradually and will be in place nationwide by the end of September, DoorDash's C.E.O., Tony Xu, said in a phone call.
There is a catch for the workers, though: DoorDash's old policy had the counterintuitive effect of insulating them against customers who left no tip or a small tip. Many Dashers liked it; some hated it.
Mr. Xu said that under the new policy, "there's going to be greater variability" in earnings.
"If there's two orders, and Dasher A had a $ 3 tip and Dasher B had a $ 6 tip, Dasher B will make $ 3 more," Mr. Xu said.
But he said the company would engineer its payouts to make sure that workers make "meaningfully more" than they do now.
In the piecework world of delivery apps, like across much of the so-called gig economy, workers are considered independent contractors and are not covered by minimum-wage laws, and the apps use complex and frequently changing methods to calculate pay. Deliverers typically juggle orders from competing apps and decide which ones to take on.
Under the new policy, DoorDash is increasing its base pay from $ 1 per order to at least $ 2, and often more, based on variables like the distance and difficulty of delivery. It will also run more "promotions," where workers can make more during certain hours or in certain neighborhoods.
Mr. Xu also said that before accepting or rejecting an order, a Dasher will be shown the whole amount of the payout -- base pay, bonus pay and any tip the customer added at checkout -- as well as the pickup and delivery location.
Many delivery workers find such information crucial in deciding whether an order is worth doing, and many of DoorDash's competitors do not show all of that information.
Uber Eats, for example, does not reveal where the food is being delivered to until after the courier picks it up, which often leads to an unpleasant surprise for the courier if the delivery address is far away.
Mr. Xu said that last year, the average DoorDash worker made $ 17.50 per hour, though delivery apps define an "hour" as time actually spent doing pickups and deliveries, not time spent waiting for orders to come in.
Here is how DoorDash's old system worked: If DoorDash guaranteed a worker $ 7 for delivery and a customer did not tip, DoorDash would pay the worker the whole $ 7. If the customer tipped, say, $ 3 via the app, then DoorDash would pay the worker only $ 4, then add on the $ 3 tip so that the worker would still get just $ 7.
When customers learned of this system, it seemed to many of them that they were effectively tipping DoorDash rather than the person who brought them their food.
But DoorDash's payouts on orders where customers did not tip were often higher than other apps' payouts, which never included tips. As a result, many Dashers preferred DoorDash's old system because they knew they would make a decent amount on a delivery, whether or not a customer tipped.
"We always tried to have the Dasher's back," Mr. Xu said.
DoorDash has more than 36 percent of the national market for meal delivery, three percentage points ahead of GrubHub, according to Second Measure, an analytics firm.
Under the new system, Mr. Xu said, DoorDash will hire a third party to track workers' earning -- including tips -- and let DoorDash know whether the workers are making more or less than they were making under old system, and DoorDash will adjust its payouts accordingly. DoorDash would not disclose the name of the third-party firm.
Niels van Doorn, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam who studies working conditions for app couriers, said that DoorDash's announcement didn't provide enough detail to make it clear how much it will help the workers, though he called it a "step forward" that DoorDash will no longer use tips to subsidize payouts.
On a Reddit forum for DoorDash workers, r/doordash, reaction was also mixed.
"It's almost guaranteed to be a big win for drivers, being able to cherry pick high tip orders is what made Grubhub so good for so long," wrote a user posting as GTFOtheLeftLane.
"I don't think I have too many expectations with this," responded a user posting as rogeliana. "I just want to know how much I'll be paid (meaning I'll get no less than $ X). As long as the minimums I'm used to being offered don't get lower (and there's a good shot at more) then I'm okay with it. I just don't want it to be worse than it is now."

Australia to Help Shield Shipping in Vital Strait

Texto completo: CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia will join a fledgling American-led effort to protect ships from Iranian threats in the critical Strait of Hormuz, the country's prime minister said on Wednesday, dismissing concerns that the United States was pulling Australia once again into a faraway military intervention in the Middle East.
Oil tankers passing through the waterway came under attack in May and June, with crews forced to abandon their vessels and at least one ship set on fire. The United States has blamed Iran for the attacks, a charge that Iranian officials have rejected.
The tanker strikes came after the United States abandoned the multinational 2015 agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program and reimposed sanctions on Tehran meant to cripple its oil sales, a pillar of the Iranian economy.
So far, only two other countries have joined the United States in the ship-protection mission: Britain and Bahrain.
Britain, which hopes to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal, at first hesitated to join the effort, wanting to avoid being seen as contributing to President Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran. But Britain later relented, after failing to assemble a separate European coalition to protect ships in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran seized a British-flagged tanker in July.
Asked if Australia's decision contributed to the American pressure campaign against Iran, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said flatly that it did not.
"This is about freedom of shipping," he said at a news conference. "They're completely separate issues. And I think to conflate those issues would be ill informed."
A third of the world's petroleum makes its way through the Strait of Hormuz, and Mr. Morrison portrayed the decision as an economic one.
"Fifteen to 16 percent of crude oil and 25 to 30 percent of refined oil destined for Australia transits through the Strait of Hormuz," Mr. Morrison said. "So it is a potential threat to our economy."
Mr. Morrison said that Australia would contribute a frigate and a surveillance aircraft, and that it would station officials at the mission's headquarters in Bahrain.
But the assistance will be limited, Mr. Morrison said. The aircraft will not be deployed until the end of the year, he said. And the frigate, which will be stationed in the strait for six months next year, had already been headed to the Middle East for a separate mission, so it will not be diverted from any tasks closer to home in the Pacific, he added.
Mr. Morrison said he had spoken with Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and the American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, before making the announcement.
Questioned about whether Australia was being drawn into another American-led military effort in the region, Mr. Morrison pointed to Britain's involvement as evidence of broader goals. "It's also the U.K.'s view that this provides the opportunity for others to be involved in a multinational engagement," he said.
Australia, a longtime ally of the United States, has fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan as part of American-led coalitions, and it still has troops in both countries.
But the new commitment in the Persian Gulf comes as Australia seeks to reorient its military and diplomatic posture toward its own region again, in an attempt to temper China's growing influence.
The tensions between Iran and the West escalated in early July when British marines and Gibraltar port officials seized an Iranian ship, saying that it was carrying oil to Syria in violation of a European Union embargo.
Iran's detention of the British-flagged tanker last month in the Strait of Hormuz was in retaliation for that. The day before, the American military had downed an Iranian drone in the strait, in what Mr. Trump called an act of self-defense.
Last week, the authorities in Gibraltar released the Iranian ship and freed its crew, hours after the United States applied to seize it.

Warren Asks Wells Fargo To Explain Fee Practices

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has asked Wells Fargo's interim chief executive to explain the bank's policies for charging overdraft fees on transactions in accounts its customers believed to be closed, costing them hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
In a letter to C. Allen Parker on Monday, Ms. Warren asked how much money the bank had collected over the past five years by charging overdraft fees on empty accounts past the dates on which accounts were supposedly closed. The practice was disclosed in a New York Times article last week.
Ms. Warren, one of the banking industry's harshest critics and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, suggested the zombie account problem indicated that Wells Fargo had not lived up to its promises to fix its corporate culture. A series of scandals in recent years has sullied the bank's once-sterling reputation and cost it more than $ 1.5 billion in penalties.
"These new revelations raise grave concerns that despite these assurances, Wells Fargo is still fundamentally broken and has not only continued to scam customers out of thousands of dollars with impunity, but has even targeted customers who were attempting to leave the bank -- and may have been victims of previous scams -- to unfairly collect one final set of lucrative fees for Wells Fargo," Ms. Warren wrote.
Wells Fargo has been operating under a growth freeze imposed early last year by one of its regulators, the Federal Reserve, after the bank was caught in scandals that included secretly opening accounts in customers' names, forcing financial products on them and charging them unnecessary fees.
The bank has remained a frequent target of lawmakers and regulators since settling investigations into those and other problems. Mr. Parker took over the company after Timothy J. Sloan abruptly resigned in March following a hearing at which Mr. Sloan was closely questioned about the bank's lingering corporate culture problems.
The Times article published last week revealed the bank had continued to collect fees on supposedly closed accounts even though two employees complained it was hurting some of Wells Fargo's most vulnerable customers.
Wells Fargo acknowledged on Monday that it had received Ms. Warren's letter, but did not provide further comment.
The letter also asked for information that would help illustrate how widely known the issue was inside the bank, such as when employees first realized it existed and whether it had been described to regulators.
Ms. Warren asked for a response by Sept. 3.

Calling Out Racism, White Supremacy and White Nationalism is More Vital Than Ever

Texto completo: The spectre of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and others that wrongly maintain that the American flag and free speech provide them with moral justification and protection for their abhorrent behaviors, has seen too many journalists frame their inadequate coverage under a cloak of "objectivity." Journalism is reverting to the impersonal mode of coverage that chronicled the civil rights movement: The Spectator's Perspective.
That the President of the United States can get away with telling four American citizens and congresswomen of color to "go back to your country," reminds too many black journalists of a strikingly similar message from Alabama Governor George Wallace, a Democrat, more than 50 years ago.
During his 1963 inaugural speech, Wallace said: "I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever."
In its All Things Considered and Radio Diaries series, NPR called the speech, "A fiery pledge forgiven, but not forgotten."
"Reflecting on his response to the speech at the time," writes NPR, "Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, originally from Alabama, says he took Wallace's words personally. 'My governor, this elected official, was saying in effect, you are not welcome, you are not welcome. Words can be very powerful. Words can be dangerous,' Lewis says. 'Gov. Wallace never pulled a trigger. He never fired a gun. But in his speech, he created the environment for others to pull the trigger, in the days, the weeks and months to come.'"
Reporting both sides of a viewpoint may enable a publication to boast about high journalistic standards but ignoring larger truths in the process nullifies any benefits gained.
Earlier this month, while in the midst of a rant-by-racist-tweet barrage from the fingertips of President Trump, the New York Times ran the headline, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." Many Times readers reacted by threatening to cancel their subscription.

Facts matter: In defense of a free press

Texto completo: A year ago last Friday, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason."
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
Why is the assault on the press dangerous?
* It undermines our democracy.
* It allows those in power to say, "Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be."
* It allows partisans of both parties to say, "Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology." Or, "because you agree with my cult personality."
* It allows anyone who screws up to say, "The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger."
The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Texto completo: President Trump attacked NBC White House reporter Peter Alexander as being "so obviously biased" while speaking to reporters Wednesday.
The president spent time answering questions from reporters on topics ranging from background checks to trade with China before going on a tangent to criticize members of the media.
"This guy is the most biased reporter, NBC," the president began. "I used to like them, but they are the most biased. Peter, you should be able to ask a question, same question, in a better way. You are so obviously biased, and that’s why the public has no confidence in the media."
Trump then turned from NBC to the New York Times.

"I think the New York Times now has totally lost credibility," the president added. "They’ve given up on the Russian collusion delusion. And now what they’re doing, they're trying the racist deal. And that's not gonna work because I am the least racist person ever to serve in office. OK? I am the least racist person. But the New York Times, they're trying everything they can. It is a totally dishonest newspaper. It's a paper that really has lost tremendous credibility."
He went on to claim the New York Times would go out of business in "six years, or maybe 10, or maybe 14," which he tweeted earlier this week.
Tweet
Trump concluded, "You know who else goes out? NBC News. NBC News has less credibility, in my opinion, with guys like you than CNN. I think CNN has more credibility than NBC News. Did you hear what I said? I said you have more credibility than this guy. And that’s not saying much. You know why? 'Cause I don't think you have very much credibility. But I will tell you this, NBC, I think, has less credibility than CNN. That’s not saying much, but that’s the way I feel."
Alexander, 43, has been NBC's White House correspondent since December 2012. In October 2018, he became co-anchor of NBC's Today on Saturdays.

'Amoral, monstrous': Critics unload on Dancing with the Stars for inviting 'professional liar' Sean Spicer

Texto completo: Many television critics are up in arms over ABC’s decision to include former White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Dancing with the Stars.
Spicer, 47, served as press secretary for President Trump from January to July 2017. His inclusion on the show met with derision Wednesday from James Poniewozik, the chief TV critic for the New York Times.
“To treat Spicer, and his reason for notoriety, as a harmless joke is to whitewash the harm of what he did, which was to say things so absurdly false that he invited his political side to join him in denying their own eyeballs, to encourage people to believe that facts don’t matter if they hurt your team,” Poniewozik wrote.
“To put him on a silly reality show is to say that he committed a silly offense and that you’re silly if you still make a big deal about it,” he added.
Writing for Variety, TV critic Caroline Framke said that “Spicer’s previous life as a professional liar should really disqualify him from public life, period.”
Framke wrote that the decision to include him in the show “helps to re-contextualize his place in American history as a ridiculous oddity rather than the loathsome truth of his ascendance.”
Film and TV critic Mo Ryan said that she would “never think it’s an amusing diversion” for the former press secretary to be on the show.
“He defended and lied about amoral, monstrous if not criminal policies and actions. Way to launder amorality, ABC. Gross,” she tweeted.
Tweet
Even Tom Bergeron, the host of the hit show, said in a statement that he had hoped to avoid political hot potatoes during this season. He said he had met with the show’s executive producer and said he hoped the season “would be a joyful respite from our exhausting political climate and free of inevitably divisive bookings from ANY party affiliations.”
“Subsequently (and rather obviously), a decision was made to, as we say in Hollywood, ‘go in a different direction,’” he wrote, without directly naming Spicer.
Tweet
Others on Twitter also panned the decision.

Texto completo: Accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein signed a will just two days before he died by suicide in a New York jail, court records show, leaving behind an estate valued at more than $577 million, including more than $56 million in cash.
The 66-year-old's death was ruled a suicide by hanging last week by New York's chief medical examiner.
The will was filed last week with officials in the U.S. Virgin Islands and listed no details of beneficiaries, according to the New York Post.
Court papers filed in St. Thomas reveal that Epstein, a former hedge-fund manager, was worth about $18 million more than what he stated in court papers while trying to land bail for sex-trafficking charges related to underage girls, the newspaper reported.
Epstein put all of his holdings in a trust, called The 1953 Trust, which a legal expert told The New York Times may have been an attempt to keep his dealings from public scrutiny.
"It avoids prying eyes because the trust is private," Patrick D. Goodman, a probate law expert at the University of California-Los Angeles law school, told the Times.
Epstein signed the document Aug.8. Less than 48 hours later, he was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
He named Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, two longtime associates, as the executors and his brother, Mark Epstein, as the single remaining heir, according to the Times.
Attorneys vowed to go after his assets even if the will had named beneficiaries, because Epstein's death means there will be no trial on the charges against him.

Texto completo: The killing season
The small screen may be overrun with serial killers, but "Mindhunter" manages to stand out as the best of the bunch. That's what happens when a talent like David Fincher is on board. The acclaimed director behind "Zodiac" and "Seven" shot the first three episodes of the second season, which focuses on the Atlanta child murders that terrorized Georgia from 1979 to 1981.
Now streaming on Netflix
Food for thought
No one has feasted on jokes about food quite as successfully as Jim Gaffigan. He keeps up the tradition in his latest stand-up special, "Jim Gaffigan: Quality Time," musing on everything from the French obsession with cheese to the intimidating nature of cannibals. Hot Pockets, however, are not on the menu.
Now streaming on Amazon Prime
Second opinions
The New York Times' mission to transfer some of its most popular columns to the small screen continues with "Diagnosis," a new series in which writer Dr. Lisa Sanders uses crowdsourcing to help figure out medical cases that have left even doctors at the Mayo Clinic scratching their heads. It's "House" without the snark.
Now streaming on Netflix

Texto completo: Accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein signed a will just two days before he died by suicide in a New York jail, new court records show, leaving behind an estate valued at more than $577 million, including more than $56 million in cash.
The 66-year-old's death was ruled a suicide by hanging last week by New York's chief medical examiner.
The will was filed last week with court officials in the U. S. Virgin Islands and listed no details of beneficiaries, according to the New York Post.
Court papers filed in St. Thomas reveal that Epstein, a former hedge-fund manager, was worth about $18 million more than what he stated in court papers while trying to land bail for federal sex-trafficking charges related to underage girls, the newspaper reported.
Epstein put all of his holdings in a trust, called The 1953 Trust, which a law expert told The New York Times may have been an attempt to keep his financial dealings from public scrutiny.
“It avoids prying eyes because the trust is private,” Patrick D. Goodman, a probate law expert at the University of California, Los Angeles law school, told the Times.
Epstein signed the 21-page document Aug. 8. Less than 48 hours later, he was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was awaiting trial.
He named Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, two longtime associates, as the executors and his brother, Mark Epstein, as the single remaining heir, according to the Times.
Decades of accusations: Newly revealed accusations against Jeffrey Epstein date back 22 years
The existence of the will raised new questions about Epstein's final days inside the Manhattan detention center.
Lawyers, representing women who claim they were sexually abused by Epstein when they were teenagers, were closely following the existence of a will.
Several attorneys vowed to go after his assets even if the will had named beneficiaries, as Epstein's death means there will be no trial on the criminal charges against him. One woman filed suit against the estate last week, claiming Epstein repeatedly raped her when she was a teenager.
"Give his entire estate to his victims. It is the only justice they can get," one of those lawyers, Lisa Bloom, wrote in an email. "And they deserve it. And on behalf of the Epstein victims I represent, I intend to fight for it. "
Former federal prosecutor David S. Weinstein, who is now in private practice in Miami but not involved in the Epstein case, said states and U. S. territories have certain time frames within which to make a claim against someone's estate.
"There are certainly going to be a lot of lawyers involved," Weinstein said. "It's not going to be over any time soon. "
The death of Jeffrey Epstein: Fact, fiction, confusion and a warden reassigned
Epstein owned a Caribbean island, homes in Paris and New York City, a New Mexico ranch and a fleet of high-priced cars.
Epstein had more than $112 million worth of equities, according to the will, and nearly $200 million in "hedge funds & private equity investments. " Among the properties that will be subject to appraisal and valuation are his collection of fine arts, antiques and other collectibles.
As part of his 2008 plea deal to Florida state charges, Epstein made undisclosed financial settlements with dozens of his victims. It's unclear how those settlements might affect any claims made on his estate.
William Blum, an attorney for Epstein's estate, said in a statement to The Associated Press that any debts or claims against the estate will be "fairly administered. " He said the document was Epstein's original last will.

Elizabeth Warren apologizes at Native American forum: ‘I have listened and I have learned’

Texto completo: Sioux City, Iowa • Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaking at a presidential forum on Native American issues Monday, offered a direct, public apology for the “harm” that she caused and pledged to uplift Native people as president.
Warren was met with a standing ovation when she took the stage and she began by addressing the controversy over her past claims of Native American ancestry.
“Like anyone who’s being honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,” Warren said. “I am sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations that we’ve had together.”
She continued, “It is a great honor to be able to partner with Indian Country, and that’s what I’ve tried to do as a senator, and that’s what I promise I will do as president of the United States of America.”
Warren, in keeping with her reputation as the presidential candidate with an enormous collection of detailed plans, has made a concerted effort to develop a policy agenda that would help Native Americans.
But her appearance at the forum, held at a theater in Sioux City, was closely watched because of the long-running controversy over the ancestry claims, an issue that is certain to be used against her if she is the Democratic nominee. Warren faced criticism from some Native Americans last year after she released the results of a DNA test that provided evidence she had a Native American ancestor. After entering the presidential race, she apologized for the DNA test and for identifying herself as Native American during her career as a law professor.
On Friday, Warren rolled out a set of proposals intended to help Native Americans, covering topics like tribal sovereignty and missing indigenous women. She also released a wide-ranging legislative proposal with Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. The proposal covers areas like criminal justice, health care and economic development.
In addition, some of the policy plans Warren released earlier in her campaign would provide funding earmarked for Native American communities to address issues like housing and the opioid crisis. She has also worked on Native American matters in the Senate, sponsoring legislation about suicide prevention and child abuse in Native communities.
The two-day forum, named in honor of Frank LaMere, a Native American activist who died in June, is being hosted by Four Directions, a Native American voting rights group, and the Native Organizers Alliance. Warren was the second candidate to speak, after Marianne Williamson. Other candidates scheduled to attend include Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, as well as Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, who in July released his own plan to support indigenous communities.
OJ and Barb Semans, co-executive directors of Four Directions, decided that Warren would not be asked about her ancestry during her appearance, OJ Semans said in an interview. He said the Warren campaign made no requests about what she would or would not be asked.
Semans, a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe, faulted President Donald Trump for mocking Warren by calling her “Pocahontas.” He said he had no problem with how Warren had referred to her ancestry and that it was more important to spend time on issues that could help the lives of Native Americans, “not whether or not her DNA test was done properly or improperly.”
“How many times do you have to argue something that’s already done?” he asked. “That issue has been dealt with, it’s been taken care of, and we move on. But what hasn’t been dealt with and taken care of is President Trump’s continued use of it in a derogatory way.”
It remains to be seen how much the ancestry issue will linger over Warren as the campaign goes on. At a rally in New Hampshire last week, Trump repeated the “Pocahontas” slur and promised there would be more to come.
“I did the Pocahontas thing,” he said. “I hit her really hard, and it looked like she was down and out, but that was too long ago. I should have waited. But don’t worry, we will revive it.”
No amount of outreach or contrition from Warren will make the issue go away entirely among some Native Americans, said Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today, who is moderating the forum.
“There is a significant group, mostly on Twitter but significant nonetheless, who will never take any apology from her,” he said. “They see it as a felony.”
Haaland, who endorsed Warren in July, takes a different view than those critics.
“I think she’s been able to move past it, quite frankly,” she said. “Her heart is in the right place. She cares deeply about Indian Country.”

Texto completo: Amid documentaries with serial killers, insights into the broken criminal-justice system and environmental disasters, it's nice to watch one that inspires rather than saddens.
That's especially true on Netflix, which has carved out a reputation for great true-crime docs since "Making a Murderer" became a sensation in 2015. But the streaming service may have found the trendy new documentary subgenre in its latest series, "Diagnosis."
The seven-episode "Diagnosis" (now streaming) is based on the New York Times Magazine column by Lisa Sanders, a New York City physician who chronicles strange medical mysteries. Yet the series doesn't just tell stories about hard-to-diagnose patients; instead, Sanders crowd-sources the cases after detailing patients' symptoms. (TNT is trying a similar format with Ann Curry's "Chasing the Cure.")
The patients receive second opinions from far-flung doctors, other patients and medically interested civilians. In some cases, it leads to a definitive diagnosis and cure for someone who has suffered in medical limbo; in others, it simply offers community to a patient who felt alone.
Each episode lays out the patient's history, as they (and Sanders) describe symptoms, treatments and doctors that have failed them. One young girl has unexplained pain in her legs. A 40-something veteran has memory loss and emotional changes, but Alzheimer's and dementia are ruled out. Two patients are plagued by unexplained paralysis. A girl has seizures that might be fixed only by surgery to remove half her brain.
The series wisely stays in the realm of patients without short life expectancies, so weeks or months of research are possible. It also means no overtly tragic endings, even if all aren't perfectly happy. And while internet trolls cloud one episode, most of the crowd-sourced advice is well-intentioned and informed.
Sanders, a consultant on Fox's hit medical drama "House," is a soothing presence and leads the audience through each story, explaining the medical jargon. Her faith in the power of people to help strangers is infectious, and gives a potentially heartbreaking series a hopeful tone.
Besides solving riddles of why a man's heart stops or a young child has intermittent paralysis, "Diagnosis" delves into the thornier issues of how the medical community interacts with patients, and how racist or sexist doctors can harm patients they should be helping. Sanders usually slanted to the side of the medical professionals over the patients who feel wronged, but it still is impressive to see a black woman and a teen girl talk about doctors' biases in such a frank way. It's even more impactful to have Sanders and the series recognize systemic discrimination as a major part of why some of the documentary's subjects don't receive proper diagnoses or treatment.
"Diagnosis" is designed for a binge-watch: Each episode ends with a preview of the next case before the credits roll, leading the viewer onward to the next episode. But it isn't distracting or annoying; You want to see people find community, comfort and a cure. You want them to beat the odds of a health-care system that is expensive, slow and resistant to change.
In "Diagnosis," sometimes people beat the odds, and that's enough.

Texto completo: The police officer accused of placing Eric Garner in a deadly chokehold five years ago was "untruthful" and "disingenuous" in his recounting of the incident, says the city judge who recommended he be fired.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo didn't testify at his departmental trial this year in the death of Eric Garner - but when interviewed by NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau cops, he claimed he did not use a prohibited chokehold on Garner as he tried to arrest him on a Staten Island sidewalk in 2014.
"I found [Pantaleo's] uncorroborated hearsay statements explaining his actions to be untruthful," NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemary Maldonado said.
Maldonado's ruling was published in The New York Times on Sunday night.
"First, I found [Pantaleo] to be disingenuous when he viewed the video and denied using a chokehold, even though his actions were completely consistent with his own erroneous and restrictive definition of the Patrol Guide prohibition."
She continued, "Second, the preponderance of the credible evidence contradicted his rationalization that the positioning of his elbow protected Mr. Garner's neck and that he exerted no pressure to the throat."
Video of Garner's death, first published by the Daily News, showed Pantaleo (inset) wrapping one arm under Garner's right armpit and around his shoulder, and his other arm over Garner's left shoulder and upper chest.
Maldonado focused on the moment after Pantaleo pulled Garner forward to prevent him from crashing through a store window. "[Pantaleo] had the opportunity to readjust his grip from a prohibited chokehold to a less lethal alternative; he did not," the judge wrote.
She added that Pantaleo kept the grip even as Garner lay on his side. "It was here that Respondent's conduct escalated from a Patrol Guide violation to criminal recklessness," she wrote.

Texto completo: A Good Provider is One Who Leaves: One Family and Migration in the 21st Century
By Jason DeParle
Penguin, 400 pp., $28
A young reporter in Manila wanted to live as a Filipino, preferably in a slum. A 40-year-old woman was willing to take him in. Thus began the education of New York Times reporter Jason DeParle, thus began a decades-long friendship, and thus began a remarkable book.
The United States has 44 million immigrants — more than the entire population of Canada and, as DeParle tells us, “it's no exaggeration to say their future is America's."  But migration also shapes countries around the world, the places migrants leave as much as the places where they settle, often temporarily, sometimes permanently. 
“Migration is to the Philippines what cars once were to Detroit: the civil religion," DeParle argues. More than a million people leave the country every year, and in examining the phenomenon at close range, DeParle himself was transformed from journalist to student of migration. “I wasn't thinking about migration when I arrived in Leveriza," he writes of his perch in the Philippines. “I was thinking about rats and eggs, about people...endure such hopeless poverty. Migration was part of the answer." 
This three-decade journey took him to that Filipino home and to periodic visits with the family in the Philippines, Abu Dhabi, Florida and Texas. “This was immersion journalism," he wrote. “I immersed."
In the course of this tutorial in migration, DeParle saw that all of Tita Comodas's five children became overseas workers and he came to understand, perhaps even to endorse, the unofficial family creed: A good provider is one who leaves. Thus the otherwise inscrutable title of this indispensable book, a Baedeker to an unnoticed and largely unappreciated global phenomenon, and a guide to understanding not only the flow of people worldwide but also the tensions that infuse politics worldwide.
This may be a portrait of Tita's world, but it is also the portrait of the world today — a world, DeParle shows us, that is in profound transformation as millions seek to better their lives. 
“My study of the global poor shrank to a sample size of one," he writes. “I was absorbed by Tita and her world." 
But the book's real personification of these changes is Tita's daughter Rosalie, a 15-year-old C student when DeParle met her, and a 48-year-old Texas nurse now: “She never crossed a border illegally. She doesn't sport gang tattoos. To the challenges of assimilation, she brings advantages the poor and unauthorized lack. She's the kind of immigrant who's become invisible in the political debate, yet increasingly common."
In these pages DeParle offers us a brisk history of immigration and immigration policy and wise reflections on contemporary migration. “The average immigrant a century ago was a penniless European in a big city," he writes. “Now the foreign born are economically diverse, ethnically varied, and geographically scattered."  
Indeed, he's a historian in seeing the process with a centuries-long perspective — he notes that Benjamin Franklin called the German immigrants of the mid 18th century the “most ignorant Stupid Sort"  — but is a journalist with a reporter's eye on contemporary events, seeing how corruption, poverty, and violence spur great waves of migration. 
Fleeing war and woes, migrants are changing our world both literally and metaphorically, and the evidence may be sturdiest in the Philippines. By 1871, Filipino workers were in 108 countries. DeParle's preoccupation is to tell their 21st century stories. 
As a result, this book is a journey: on foot, in planes and on cruise ships, to the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Singapore, Taiwan, Canada, and Hong Kong. With DeParle as tour guide, the reader discovers that the phenomenon of migration is not only a transfer of people but also a transfer of money.
“The case for migration as a development tool starts with the migrants' loyalty," he writes. The workers leave, the money goes home. Mexicans in the United States send a third of their salaries home, Senegalese in Spain send half. “Since the money bypasses the government, it is less susceptible to corruption that foreign aid," he explains. “It's also counter-cyclical; private investors pull back in bad times, but migrants send more." 
But while migration eases poverty it doesn't boost countries' GNP. “Migration hasn't enlarged the Philippine economy," he writes, “but it's enlarged the incomes of millions of Filipinos."
These journeys are not endeavors of ease. DeParle shows us that they are full of peril: fears of false and real failure, disorientation and disappointment, visa problems and health threats. Families split geographically are split psychologically as well. Technology helps and hurts: “Webcams don't replace mothers," he reminds us. That's especially true when the migrants are rearing other people's children. 
As the pages turn — as the book develops — the focus turns as well, bringing into sharp relief the issue of immigration to the United States, and here the story turns from heartbreaking to heartening. DeParle understands what he calls the “moral hazard"  posed by amnesty for the undocumented. He also sees challenges faced by the new immigrants that makes assimilation more challenging: “[E]conomic mobility has waned; legal status is often an impediment; and most of today's immigrants are racial minorities."
But in the end he brings us back to Tita's daughter, and his closing argument is a potent one: “Migration was her vehicle of salvation. It delivered her from the living conditions of the 19th century. It respected her talent, rewarded her sweat, and enlarged her capacity for giving. It made her life deeper, fuller, and more filled with hope... That her quest ended in Texas is something for Americans to cheer. It's good for your country to be the place that people go to make dreams come true." 
In short, DeParle shows us, immigration was very, very good for her. But it's also very, very good for us.

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein reportedly paid his lawyers to visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being held while awaiting trial, so that he could leave his cell for as many as 12 hours a day.
His numerous lawyers would sit with him, sometimes in silence, in a private meeting room where they would eat snacks and drinks from the vending machines, the New York Times reported.
He also put money in other inmates’ commissary accounts to avoid being targeted by them.
The part of the prison where Epstein was being held was infested with rodents and cockroaches. There was often standing water and urine and feces that leaked from faulty plumbing.
A judge refused to release Epstein on bond after his arrest, even after the financier said he would put up his Manhattan mansion and jet as insurance that he would not flee.
Epstein was facing charges of exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, as well as other locations. He was found dead in his cell earlier this month. The New York City medical examiner's office said Friday that Epstein died by suicide.

Barack Obama Shares His Reading List

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama shared his summer reading list on social media on Wednesday, offering a mix of novels, short story collections and nonfiction for anyone, in his words, "looking for some suggestions."
The list covers both new releases and older works from authors such as Téa Obreht, Colson Whitehead, Ted Chiang, Haruki Murakami, Dinaw Mengestu and Hilary Mantel. Mr. Obama started with an invitation to read works by the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, who died last week at the age of 88.
"Beloved, Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, Sula, everything else -- they're transcendent, all of them," he wrote. "You'll be glad you read them." The former president presented the author with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.
Mr. Obama's interest in reading has been well documented. The former New York Times chief book critic Michiko Kakutani reported at the end of Mr. Obama's presidency that he would read for about an hour on most nights. Mr. Obama said that reading fiction left him "better able to imagine what's going on in the lives of people throughout my presidency."
He shared recommendations for books and movies throughout his presidency and has continued the tradition after leaving office. Last summer, he posted a more academic list of nonfiction works to his Facebook page. At the end of the year he released a list of his favorite works of 2018. His wife Michelle Obama's memoir "Becoming" topped the list.
In the reading list he shared on Wednesday, Mr. Obama continued to promote a diverse group of writers, many of whom focus on issues of race, immigration, gender and class.
"I am deeply honored to be on @BarackObama's summer reading list, and more than a little nostalgic for a president who values reading," the author Lauren Wilkinson wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Obama wrote that Ms. Wilkinson's "American Spy," her debut novel about a black female secret agent, is "a whole lot more than just a spy thriller, wrapping together the ties of family, of love, and of country."
The list also includes "The Nickel Boys," Mr. Whitehead's fictionalized account of the state-run Dozier School for Boys, where dozens of students were tortured. Mr. Whitehead was among a handful of novelists, along with Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Junot Díaz and Dave Eggers, whom Mr. Obama invited to a luncheon at the end of his presidency.
Stephanie Land's recent memoir, "Maid," which chronicles her time as a single mother and cleaner, offers an "unflinching look at America's class divide" and "a reminder of the dignity of all work," according to Mr. Obama.
"I'm so dead rn," Ms. Land wrote on Twitter in response to the list. "I can't believe I get a chance to be on this list with these very incredible writers."
Another memoir, Hope Jahren's "Lab Girl," follows both the writer's personal journey to becoming a scientist and her work on the secret life of plants. In her 2016 review of the work, Ms. Kakutani called it "a book that, at its best, does for botany what Oliver Sacks's essays did for neurology."
Here's the full summer reading list, with links to reviews:
The collected works of Toni Morrison
"The Nickel Boys" by Colson Whitehead
"Exhalation" by Ted Chiang
"Wolf Hall" by Hilary Mantel
"Men Without Women" by Haruki Murakami

Texto completo: An autopsy performed on Jeffrey Epstein showed he "sustained multiple breaks in his neck bones," the Washington Post reported Wednesday.
People familiar with the autopsy report told the newspaper the bones broken in Epstein's neck included the hyoid bone, which is near the Adam's apple.
This sort of break can happen when a person hangs themselves or dies by strangulation, forensics experts told the Post.
Epstein, 66, was found dead in the special housing unit of the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York on Saturday. He was in a cell by himself.
The multimillionaire hedge fund manager had been jailed since early last month, awaiting trial on federal charges accusing him of operating a sex trafficking ring from 2002 to 2005 at his Manhattan mansion and his Palm Beach estate in which he paid girls as young as 14 for sex. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Two prison staff members who'd been guarding the unit where Epstein died by apparent suicide failed to check on him that night for about three hours, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing several law enforcement and prison officials with knowledge of the investigation.
Officials have cautioned to CNN that they don't know what the staff members were doing during that time and are still trying to pin that down.
Guards are supposed to check on detainees in the special housing unit every 30 minutes, a source with knowledge of Epstein's time at the prison previously told CNN.
Representatives for Epstein are not disputing preliminary findings of FBI investigators and the New York City medical examiner that Epstein died by suicide, according to a source briefed on the matter.
The medical examiner is awaiting toxicology reports before officially ruling on Epstein's death.
Epstein's family hired its own pathologist, Michael Baden, who was present during the autopsy, according to the source, and he is also not disputing preliminary findings from the medical examiner that Epstein killed himself.
Fractured hyoid occurs in both suicides and homicides, experts say
While a break in the hyoid bone is common in victims of homicide by strangulation, Epstein's autopsy also showed signs of other neck fractures, the Washington Post reported.
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said, "With multiple neck fractures, that is less likely to be strangulation alone."
"In strangulation, while you can break the hyoid bone, it is less likely to actually break bones in the neck," Gupta said. "By hanging, someone can break both the hyoid bone and other bones in the neck. None of these factors in isolation give you a complete story."
Dr. Lawrence Kobilinsky, a professor of forensic science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, noted the hyoid bone is a weak, fragile structure, and it can break from a hanging. A fractured hyoid bone does not necessarily indicate a homicide, Kobilinsky said.
To make a determination about a death, medical examiners look at other factors in addition to the autopsy, like a person's psychological history and video surveillance.
"A lot of pieces have to come together in order to make the final determination," Kobilisnky said.
One staffer was not currently a regular guard; both were on overtime
Of the two officers who would have had responsibility to monitor Epstein, one was not currently a detention guard but was temporarily reassigned to that post, according to a person briefed on the matter. The guard, a man not identified by officials, had previously been trained as a corrections officer but had moved to another position.
Rules at the Federal Bureau of Prisons allow for people who work in other prison jobs, such as teachers and cooks, to be trained to fill in at posts usually manned by regular guards.
The second staff member on Epstein duty, a woman, was a fully trained guard, according to the person briefed on the matter.
Both guards were working overtime shifts, but it's unclear whether that was mandatory. One person familiar with the matter said both employees had volunteered. Union officials say the overtime was mandatory.
The FBI, one of the agencies investigating Epstein's suicide, is looking into what the guards were doing during their shift. The two guards aren't talking to investigators and have hired lawyers, people briefed on the matter have told CNN.
Most of the staff on duty early Saturday were on overtime, according to numbers provided by a Department of Justice official. From midnight until 8 a.m. ET, 10 of the 18 people there were working extra hours. One other person was scheduled to work but didn't.
On the shift from 4 p.m. Friday until midnight, six of 20 people present were on overtime and one person scheduled to work was absent.
Epstein was no longer on suicide watch
Epstein had been placed on suicide watch last month after an incident in the jail. But after he was given daily psychological assessments, he was taken off suicide watch in late July, a person briefed on the matter said, and went back to the facility's special housing unit, which is a section more restricted than general population.
He initially had a cellmate in the special housing unit, but that person was removed for unknown reasons, the source with knowledge of Epstein's time at the prison told CNN.
It's protocol for detainees coming off suicide watch not to be placed alone in a cell, according to the source.
The FBI and Justice Department's inspector general are investigating the earlier incident as part of the broader probe into Epstein's death, it was revealed Wednesday in letters between the judge overseeing the Epstein case and the former warden of the jail where he died.
In the letters dated August 12, US District Court Judge Richard Berman wrote to the warden to inquire about the July 23 incident, saying "to my knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP (Bureau of Prisons) concluded about that incident."
The warden at the time, Lamine N'Diaye, replied that an internal investigation into the incident had been completed, and that the matter would be reinvestigated as part of the investigations into Epstein's death. N'Diaye said he couldn't divulge any information about the original investigation.
Prison warden has been temporarily reassigned
The warden of the MCC is being moved temporarily as the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general investigate the circumstances of Epstein's death, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
The move, directed by US Attorney General William Barr, came one day after Barr said there were "serious irregularities" at the New York prison and that he was "appalled" and "angry" to learn of the facility's "failure to adequately secure this prisoner."
The warden, N'diaye, will be moved to a Bureau of Prisons regional office and will be replaced by James Petrucci, the warden of the federal prison in Otisville, New York. - (CNN)

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Israel Denies Entry to Omar and Tlaib After Trump's Call to Block Them" (nytimes.com, Aug. 15):
President Trump's urging Israel to show strength by denying entry to Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar and Israel's complying are only a show of weakness. What does Israel have to fear from two critics, no matter how radical their position might be perceived?
It would be a perfect opportunity for them to see what Israel is about and to meet with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. What is Israel afraid of? These two congresswomen are in a position to open dialogue and build bridges. They should have the possibility of experiencing what is happening on the ground in both Israel and the West Bank.
Barring people from visiting countries because of differences of opinion and criticisms of that country represents actions more appropriate to dictatorships and autocrats.
Peter Dunner
Bethesda, Md.
To the Editor:
All countries, including Israel, have the right to bar entry to hostile foreigners. Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar are vigorous supporters of B.D.S. (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions). They are rightfully barred from entering Israel by the 2017 Israeli law preventing entry to hostile foreigners who support B.D.S.
History is replete with examples of democracies damaged or subverted by enemies misusing the democratic rights such democracies grant.
Israel is not required to walk down this path of national suicide, public relations -- Democratic Party preferences or New York Times sensibilities notwithstanding.
Daniel H. Trigoboff
Williamsville, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is as small and as shortsighted as the current United States president, who prompted the move to bar the two Democratic congresswomen from entering Israel, believing -- wrongly -- that this will win him the votes of hundreds of thousands of American Jews.
The women are elected United States representatives. Denying them entry to Israel over political views strikes at the soul of Israeli and American democracy,
Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar must go to Israel.
Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump simply must go.

Gardner’s tenuous hold on Colorado Senate seat may hinge on Hickenlooper

Texto completo: Sen. Cory Gardner’s already difficult reelection bid could get tougher.

The one-term Republican is facing a state electorate that voted for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and has become increasingly Democratic over the past 15 years.

But elections tend to favor the incumbent, race analysts say, and Democrats still lack a star candidate to challenge Gardner. Instead, Democrats are facing a divisive primary with nearly a dozen lesser-known candidates.

That changed on Tuesday, when the New York Times reported former two-term Gov. John Hickenlooper is considering dropping his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of the Senate race.

“That primary field will clear,” Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the Cook Political Report, told the Washington Examiner. “I would expect all or most of the other candidates to drop out.”

Hickenlooper’s entry into the race would likely force Gardner to ramp up his reelection bid much earlier, especially if there is no Democratic primary.

“If Hickenlooper gets in, the general election starts right away,” Duffy said.

Gardner is among the most endangered Senate GOP incumbents.

Most election analysis sites rate his race as “toss up” even though Democrats haven’t selected their challenger yet.

Among those running are former state Sen. Mike Johnston and former State House Democratic Leader Alice Madden.

Little polling has been conducted on the race, but Public Policy Polling released an Aug. 12 survey that pitted Gardner against Hickenlooper in a hypothetical matchup.

Hickenlooper came out 13 points ahead with 51% of support among voters, compared with 38% for Gardner in the poll, which was paid for by the Democratic group 314 Action Fund.

Gardner’s approval rating in the poll was only 30%, with 49% of voters disapproving of his Senate tenure and 22% unsure.
Hickenlooper’s favorability rating in the poll was 45% while 38% reported an unfavorable opinion.

A July Colorado Poll conducted by a consortium of Democrats found 40% of voters viewed Gardner favorably while 39% viewed him unfavorably. Among Republicans, only 63% viewed Gardner favorably, compared with 90% of GOP voters who said they viewed President Trump favorably.

In other words, Gardner is falling flat among all Colorado voters and isn’t generating much enthusiasm even among voters in his own party.
Gardner, 44, was elected to the Senate in 2014 by beating incumbent Democrat Mark Udall.

Gardner served in the Senate GOP leadership for two years as head of the campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Gardner’s voting record is consistently conservative, and he’s occasionally spoken out against Trump over his rhetoric. Democrats are eager to tie Gardner to Trump, who is unpopular in Colorado, along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.

"Coloradans are fed up with Sen. Gardner’s record of being a rubber stamp for his party leaders in Washington like Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump and voting against their interests, and they’re going to hold him accountable at the ballot box in 2020.” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Stewart Boss told the Washington Examiner.

A Colorado statewide voter poll conducted in June by Keating-Onsight-Martin found 56% viewed Trump unfavorably while 42% viewed the president favorably. Among those voters, 51% viewed the president “very unfavorably.”

Hickenlooper, 67, served as governor from 2011 to 2019 after serving as the mayor of Denver since 2003.

He’s one of the most well-known politicians in the state and had been hoping his popularity would help launch his presidential bid.

But Hickenlooper has failed to gain enough traction in either fundraising or poll numbers, and his obscurity could exclude him from the next Democratic debate in September.

Democrats are now urging him to drop his presidential bid and challenge Gardner, whose defeat they believe is critical to winning back the Senate majority from Republicans. The GOP currently holds a 53-47 edge in the chamber.

The group that paid for the Public Policy Polling survey, 314 Action, has launched a “Draft Hickenlooper” movement.

“Flipping Colorado blue is the key to putting an end to Mitch McConnell’s Senate majority,” the group proclaimed on its website.

Duffy said Hickenlooper’s entry into the race doesn’t guarantee Gardner’s defeat, but rather it makes the outcome of the toss-up race even more uncertain.

“Does it make it harder for Gardner? Sure it does,” Duffy said. “Is it his undoing? Not necessarily.”

A spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Joanna Rodriguez, said Hickenlooper would return to a Colorado Senate run damaged by his failed presidential bid and would also be hurt by the liberal tilt of the current field of candidates.
"After flopping on the national stage, Hickenlooper would be crawling back to Colorado to face a crowded field of competitively funded primary candidates who’ve spent months racing to the Left," Rodriguez told the Washington Examiner. "Cory Gardner has worked tirelessly to deliver real, bipartisan results for the people of Colorado in the Senate, and it’s made him the most effective member of the state’s entire delegation. He’ll be the toughest opponent any Democrat that survives this donnybrook primary has ever had to face.”

Tyler Sandberg, a Colorado Republican strategist, said Hickenlooper’s ability to defeat Gardner has been over-hyped.

Hickenlooper, he said, won his first bid for governor in part because former Republican Rep. Tom Tancredo ran a third-party race as a Constitution Party candidate, splitting the GOP vote.

And Sandberg said there is no guarantee Hickenlooper would be spared a Democratic primary challenge.

“He’s never faced a truly tough opponent,” Sandberg told the Washington Examiner. “Nor has he ever won a Democratic primary.”

By the time I got to Woodstock

Texto completo: Awkward silences are common when baby boomers get together. Beyond the grandkids or aging parents, everything else worth talking about seems to have happened so long ago. But a guaranteed icebreaker, at least for me, is to dig deep into my hippie past and announce, "I was at Woodstock."
A few roll their eyes, but Woodstock usually sparks a nostalgic if curious conversation. "I wanted to go but my parents wouldn't let me" is a common reply. I did go, and now, 50 years later, those three days of peace and music remain as real as the downpour that drenched us moments after Joe Cocker finished his version of "With a Little Help from My Friends."
Not to minimize the woes of the millennials who endured the fraudulent Fyre Festival in the Bahamas in 2017, but at least they had makeshift shelters, cellphones and credit cards before the thing was canceled.
The conditions for the 400,000 of us at Max Yasgur's farm were far worse:
Torrential downpours produced a clingy, blob-like mud that came alive as you trudged through the muck, pulling off sandals, sucking down sneakers and swallowing up picnic baskets.
Blazing hot August days turned to shivers, the crowd shaking not to the music but to the chill of cold Catskills nights. Our clothes still soaked, we huddled by a bonfire just beneath the stage as Ten Years After played "I'm Going Home" on Sunday night.
Despite some makeshift stands, finding anything to eat was a daily "do you have a spare muffin?" ritual.
Portable toilets were clogged in the worst ways imaginable.
Very few of us brought tents, and the few previous music festivals of note -- Monterey Pop in California, the Atlanta International Pop Festival -- had either normal seating or controlled areas for blankets and folding chairs.
Totally unprepared for Woodstock's ticketless anarchy, my girlfriend and I slept under trees, using clothes stretched on sticks as makeshift tents. Thousands slept together in the woods along the "Groovy Way" path, whether in relationships or not.
Of course there was no internet, no way to communicate with the outside world beyond enduring the long lines at a few pay phones. When we did call our freaked out parents -- I was a 21-year-old college student -- we didn't realize that The New York Times, the New York Daily News and newsman Gabe Pressman on WNBC were treating the festival as a natural disaster. My parents calmed when I assured them that despite what they were hearing, Woodstock was "groovy."
My brother and I had driven the family's 1968 Chevy up the New York State Thruway, parking it on a lawn already packed with cars. My girlfriend, Eileen, now my wife, had taken a bus and somehow met us near the medical tent. No one ever collected our tickets.
Marijuana and LSD abounded, but it didn't take drugs to realize we were in a new American landscape. If the moon landing a few weeks earlier had been, as Time magazine called it, a "triumph of the squares," this "gathering of the tribes" at Woodstock would be the high point of the 1960s counterculture. The crowd, the people, us, it turned out, was to be the story -- sharing, dancing, chanting, skinny-dipping, surviving. It was wonderful in its misery.
We were given oatmeal one morning by the famed hippie Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm collective, a psychedelic bus playing Grateful Dead bootlegs as women, of course braless, swayed to the music.
The tiny stage, so far away at the bottom of a natural amphitheater, had no giant video screens, no way to see the performers. Only the superb sound system conveyed the power of Janis Joplin; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; The Who; Jefferson Airplane and, best of all, Sly and the Family Stone.
I remember one woman, someone's date (an archaic notion in the hippie paradise), was out of place in a bright suburban pantsuit and halter top, hair coiffed and her back angrily turned from the stage. She wanted to go home, but of course she couldn't. Once you got there, Woodstock was for keeps.
The festival wasn't heavily hyped -- another sign of how times have changed. A modest ad in The Village Voice, some ticket sale ads on the radio. You had to be in on the 1960s rock scene to even know it was happening. Rumors abounded: The Beatles would be there. The Rolling Stones were flying in. Bob Dylan, who lived in the real town of Woodstock 60 miles away, would make a surprise appearance. None did.
As many as three babies were said to have been born at Woodstock. Singer John Sebastian, who says he was tripping during his performance, told the crowd, "That kid is going to be far out."
Years later, when I became a reporter, I and other journalists tried to track down the Woodstock babies, but local hospitals had no records of a birth; neither did the medical staff working the festival.
To this day, no one has ever come forward as a "Woodstock baby." If any do exist, happy 50th birthday! I bet you're far out.

Texto completo: The second anniversary of the Charlottesville riots passed on Monday, but President Trump couldn’t leave bad enough alone.
On Tuesday he retweeted, with a “thank you” message, a misleading video that attempts to defend his much-maligned reactions to that racially charged tragedy.
The reality, despite the misdirection offered by Trump’s defenders, is that Trump, for whatever reason, went out of his way to recast the tragedy in ways that were fundamentally dishonest.
According to the new video and a growing meme among the pro-Trump commentariat, Trump is actually a victim of bad reporting about his comments in 2017. In those comments, Trump said he “condemned totally” the “neo-Nazis and white nationalists,” but then infamously insisted there were “very fine people on both sides” during the two days of protests and counterprotests.
He did so while clearly showing a defensiveness about one side in particular, namely the “side” that supposedly was “protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.” Those there to “innocently protest” in favor of the statue were, according to Trump, “not all” white supremacists “by any stretch,” but instead among the “many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists.”
Again and again in the press conference, Trump insisted on the supposed existence of these peaceful protesters, and took great pains to say “there’s blame on both sides.” He also insisted that while he “saw the same pictures as you did,” he “watched those very closely — much more closely than you people watched it.” This bears repeating: He didn’t have a special Oval Office feed of the rallies and counterprotests. He saw the same coverage we all saw.
Trump’s defenders, especially in the video by Steve Cortes of the conservative Prager U, go to great lengths to insist that Trump was making a legitimate point in defense of real people that were “very fine.”
The problem is, there’s no evidence they really existed in Charlottesville that weekend, and certainly not that there were “many” of them.
Cortes (see the 1:56 mark, and following) and other conservatives have emphasized “another group” of “peaceful protesters,” and said “lest you have any doubts that there were good people in Charlottesville …, the New York Times confirmed it in a story they published the next day.”
What was the evidence? A quote from one woman, and only one, named Michelle Piercy, who said she and a conservative group had traveled from Wichita, Kansas to protest the statue’s removal.
So, who was that group? Well, Piercy herself identified it as an outfit called “American Warrior Revolution.” They were there supposedly as “neutral protesters” who traveled all that way to, get this, “talk to antifa and Black Lives Matter and let them know that the way they were protesting is the wrong way to go about it.”
If that sounds suspicious — if you doubt that a group with the martial name American Warrior Revolution is a peace-loving dampener of tensions — your doubts are justified. A little Internet research shows that they consider themselves a militia. Lest their outlook be misunderstood, they provide a helpful video as self-advertisement. Please watch it, here.
Watch it, and gasp. And then read this “official” statement by the group, effectively blaming liberal counterprotester Heather Heyer for her own death.
The kicker is that Trump insisted that the very fine people specifically were at the rally the night before Heyer was killed by a neo-Nazi. He said it twice. That is howlingly false. The night before was the rally in which white nationalists by the hundreds marched in paramilitary order, bearing weapons, holding aloft tiki torches, yelling racist and anti-Semitic epithets.
The media should defy Trump to produce one single video, just one, of “very fine people” and “innocent” protesters in that group. Even if Michelle Piercy is a very fine person, it beggars belief that she or anyone else could join that crowd, that night, for innocent purposes. And if Trump watched the same scenes we all watched, there is no way he saw any separate group of innocents. Zero.
One need not speculate on what synapses in Trump’s brain led him repeatedly to insist on the presence of many very fine people where none existed. It is an insult to our intelligence, though, and to decency, for him two years later to still insist on it, and to try to make any excuses whatsoever for the white nationalists who were the only ones who openly and deliberately organized their hateful rally.

Texto completo: The New York Times said in a statement on Tuesday that Jonathan Weisman, a deputy Washington editor of The Times, had been demoted and would no longer oversee the paper's congressional correspondents because he repeatedly posted messages on social media about race and politics that showed what the paper called "serious lapses in judgment."
Mr. Weisman, 53, will lose the title of deputy editor, a designation for Times editors with wide-ranging duties and significant input into news coverage, a spokeswoman for the paper said.
Mr. Weisman met with Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, on Tuesday and apologized, the Times statement said. He will also no longer be "active on social media," the statement added.
In a brief interview after the meeting with Mr. Baquet, Mr. Weisman, who will stay on at the paper as an editor, said: "I accept Dean's judgment. I think he's right to do what he's doing. I embarrassed the newspaper, and he had to act."
The reprimand came amid a broader discussion in the Times newsroom of how the paper covers race and the Trump administration in a polarized time. On Monday, Mr. Baquet led a staff meeting at which a recent front-page headline that generated heavy public criticism was a main topic.
Mr. Weisman, who joined The Times in 2012, was under scrutiny for messages he posted on Twitter on July 31 and Aug. 7. In the July 31 posts, he implied that it was inaccurate to describe certain politicians from urban areas as being representative of the Midwest and the South. He specifically mentioned four Democrats: Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and John Lewis of Georgia. Three of the four are minorities.
"Saying @RashidaTlaib (D-Detroit) and @IlhanMN (D-Minneapolis) are from the Midwest is like saying @RepLloydDoggett (D-Austin) is from Texas or @repjohnlewis (D-Atlanta) is from the Deep South," Mr. Weisman wrote. "C'mon."
Mr. Weisman, who is white, deleted the tweet and a pair of follow-ups after they were criticized as racist on Twitter and in the African-American-focused online publication The Root.
The Times's standards editor, Phil Corbett, advised Mr. Weisman to be more careful on social media, Mr. Weisman said. But on Aug. 7, he ventured into similar territory.
Replying to a Twitter post by the progressive political organization Justice Democrats that included a photograph of Morgan Harper, a candidate the group was backing for a United States House seat in Ohio, Mr. Weisman noted that she would be challenging Representative Joyce Beatty, an African-American Democrat.
Ms. Harper quickly replied to Mr. Weisman's message, telling him, "I am also black."
To that, Mr. Weisman replied, "@justicedems's endorsement included a photo," as if that settled the matter.
Roxane Gay, a contributing opinion writer to The Times since 2015, joined the discussion with a tweet that said, "Any time you think you're unqualified for a job remember that this guy, telling a black woman she isn't black because he looked at a picture and can't see, has one of the most prestigious jobs in America."
According to screenshots posted by Ms. Gay, Mr. Weisman sent messages to her saying she owed him "an enormous apology." Ms. Gay made it clear in a subsequent tweet that she strongly disagreed with Mr. Weisman's demand.
Erica Green, a national education reporter at The Times, said in an interview that she understood why the tweets by Mr. Weisman, who was her editor, had provoked a backlash. She also defended him as a journalist and colleague, based on her experiences working with him on stories about minorities.
"As a black woman, I feel a little bit better that he is in the room," Ms. Green said.
Mr. Weisman, the author of the 2018 book "(((Semitism))): Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump," stepped away from Twitter for a few months in 2016 after becoming a target of online trolls. Before joining The Times, he worked at newspapers including The Baltimore Sun, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
Last week, The Times drew intense criticism -- from readers, some of whom canceled subscriptions; members of its own staff; and prominent politicians -- because of a front-page headline that Mr. Baquet described as "credulous." The headline, "Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism," was changed for later editions.
In the first edition of the Aug. 6 paper, it sat atop an article that quoted President Trump's prepared remarks on the mass killings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, while also noting that Mr. Trump "has himself amplified right-wing voices online with histories of racism and bigotry." Editors changed the headline to "Assailing Hate but Not Guns."
At the staff meeting on Monday, Mr. Baquet acknowledged "a couple of significant missteps" and likened the current political climate to the turbulent 1960s. He asked those in the packed 15th-floor room of The New York Times Building for their help in reporting on a difficult time, an effort that would require the paper's journalists to pay close attention to how they covered race and a divisive administration.
"This is hard stuff," he said, reading from prepared remarks.
Mr. Baquet, who became the first African-American executive editor in the history of The Times in 2014, took responsibility for the much-criticized headline, adding that the paper's print hub, which produces the newspaper's print version, was not given enough space to convey the story fairly.
The other main topic of discussion was the paper's reluctance to describe certain actions and comments by the president and some of his supporters as "racist." Mr. Baquet said that, in general, it was sufficient to describe racist speech or behavior plainly in news articles without necessarily labeling it as such.
"My own view," he said, "is that the best way to capture the kinds of remarks the president makes is to use them, to lay it out in perspective, and that is much more powerful than the use of a word."
Some journalists in attendance expressed disagreement with that view, and Mr. Baquet said he was working with other editors to establish a written standard that would try to clarify when the use of "racist" and similar terms was warranted in news coverage.
Part of the reason for the gathering on Monday, he said, was the online behavior of Mr. Weisman, which seemed emblematic of larger debates inside and outside the newsroom.
"By the way," Mr. Baquet said toward the end of the meeting, "let's catch our breath before tweeting stupid stuff or stuff that hurts the paper."

Texto completo: Antolín López Aguilar , un ciudadano guatemalteco de 23 años, intentó el 3 de diciembre de 2017 cruzar la frontera de Nogales, Arizona, para entrar en territorio de EEUU. Pero Matthew Bowen , un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza que dos semanas antes había definido a los inmigrantes como él “infrahumanos”, y “salvajes asesinos”, interceptó el intento.
El agente fue acusado posteriormente de golpear y herir al migrante con un vehículo del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) cuando este trató de escapar de él y de otros compañeros que trataban de detenerlo. El joven fue hospitalizado tras el accidente.
Ahora, Bowen reconoce que trató de atropellarlo. “Lo golpeé de manera intencional con fuerza desmesurada” , aseguró en una declaración recogida en documentos de una corte federal y citada por The New York Times y otros medios. El abogado del agente, Sean Chapman, confirmó a EFE que su cliente admitió ser culpable de esos hechos.
Bowen agregó en su declaración que sus actos “no estaba justificados” y violaron los derechos de López-Aguilar “protegidos por la Constitución de EEUU”.
Tras el accidente, el migrante fue sentenciado a 30 días de prisión por tratar de entrar ilegalmente al país, según el diario The Arizona Republic. The New York Times dice que se desconoce lo que pasó después con él.
Este y otros medios aseguran que el agente se enfrentaría a hasta un año de prisión y podría ser multado con 100.000 dólares cuando una corte determine en octubre la sentencia por el caso. El abogado dijo a EFE que a cambio de la admisión de culpabilidad y de renunciar a su posición en la Patrulla Fronteriza, Bowen evitará el juicio en su contra y quedará en libertad provisional.
El agente, que estuvo trabajando de patrullero desde 2008, fue suspendido de empleo y sueldo a partir de su procesamiento judicial en junio de 2018, según algunos medios.
El caso de Matthew Bowen cobró relevancia nacional en mayo de este año, cuando se supo que, dentro del proceso por el intento de atropello del migrante guatemalteco en la corte de distrito de Tucson, Arizona, salieron a la luz mensajes de corte racista y agresivo contra los inmigrantes enviados por Bowen a otros agentes fronterizos anteriormente a ese hecho.
En estos mensajes, el agente se refería a los inmigrantes con expresiones como “escoria”, “repugnante basura infrahumana” que “no merece ni ser astillas para prender un fuego”. Según su abogado, lo que se dice en ellos no es extraordinario, y responde a sentimientos “habituales entre los patrulleros de Tucson”.
Posteriormente, sin embargo, el abogado aclaró que sus explicaciones concernían sólo a la palabra “tonc”, usada en los mensajes para referirse a los inmigrantes, y que se sospecha que puede ser una onomatopeya del sonido de un agente golpeándoles con una linterna en la cabeza. Otra interpretación podría ser el acrónimo “temporalmente fuera de su país nativo” (escrito en inglés).
The New York Times asegura que la corte determinó que los mensajes enviados antes del accidente no se podían considerar relevantes para el caso. Pero una juez estableció que a partir de la fecha del intento de atropello, los mensajes de Bowen que pudieran referirse a este asunto o con contenidos racista sí lo serían.
El día después del accidente, Bowen confesó en un mensaje a un compañero que sí había usado una camioneta Ford F-150 para intentar detener a un migrante, pero que solo había sido “un pequeño empujón”.
El agente fue acusado también de falsificar un documento enviado al jefe del Sector de Tucson de la Patrulla Fronteriza y en el que “declaró falsamente que no estaba seguro si su vehículo contactó a López-Aguilar, y que nunca tuvo la intención de golpear, asustar o entrar en contacto con el hombre que huía del agente”. Tras su admisión de responsabilidad, los fiscales acordaron desestimar esta acusación, dice The Arizona Republic.
En el pasado, Bowen ya había sido acusado de usar fuerza excesiva sin motivo para realizar arrestos en al menos cinco ocasiones.

The Phony Patriots of Silicon Valley

Texto completo: Not long ago, many leading technologists considered themselves too lofty and idealistic to concern themselves with the petty affairs of government. John Perry Barlow, a lion of the early internet, addressed his "Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" to the "governments of the industrial world," saying that for him and his fellow netizens, these creaky institutions had "no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear."
But that was before privacy scandals, antitrust investigations, congressional hearings, Chinese tariffs, presidential tweets and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Now, as they try to fend off regulation and avoid being broken up, some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley are tripping over their Allbirds in a race to cozy up to the United States government. These companies' motives vary -- some are vying for lucrative public-sector contracts, while others are lobbying against regulation by painting China as a red menace that must be defeated for the good of the country.
Either way, the game is the same: Salute the flag, save our bacon.
The latest example of Silicon Valley's patriotic playacting comes courtesy of Peter Thiel, the Trump-backing venture capitalist. In an op-ed in The New York Times this month, Mr. Thiel took Google to task for opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing while canceling a controversial Pentagon contract, accusing the company of trying to "evade responsibility for the good of the country."
Mr. Thiel's obvious conflicts of interest aside (he is on the board of Facebook, Google's rival, and is the chairman of the technology firm Palantir, which has lucrative government contracts of its own), seeing him lecture anyone on patriotism is rich. He was among the first major supporters of the Seasteading movement -- a group of libertarians who wanted to flee the United States and build a floating city in international waters -- and in 2011, he became a New Zealand citizen after buying up property there. ("It would give me great pride to let it be known that I am a New Zealand citizen and an enthusiastic supporter of the country," Mr. Thiel wrote in his citizenship application.)
But Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment, is far from the only tech titan trading in his hoodie for a flag pin.
Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief, has also been warning that if the social network -- the proud, American social network, that is -- is broken up or harshly regulated, it will be only a matter of time before China takes over the global tech industry.
In an interview last year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that if Facebook were broken up by American regulators, "the alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies."
David Marcus, one of Mr. Zuckerberg's lieutenants and the executive in charge of Facebook's digital currency project, Libra, echoed that point while testifying before Congress last month.
"I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will," Mr. Marcus said. "If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different."
Mr. Zuckerberg, who speaks Mandarin, is an odd choice to lead the charge against China. He has spent much of the last decade trying desperately to curry favor with the Chinese government in hopes of getting Facebook's apps -- which are banned there -- permission to operate in one of the world's most lucrative markets. Mr. Zuckerberg even reportedly offered to let Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, name his second child. (Mr. Xi declined.)
Google, too, is rallying around the flag. The company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, went to the White House to visit with President Trump in March, to discuss government contracts and reassure the president that Google does not discriminate against conservatives. This month, in a series of tweets attacking Mr. Pichai and Google, Mr. Trump recalled that meeting, which he described as "Mr. Pichai working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election."
Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai was a China booster before he began distancing himself from the country. Last year, Mr. Pichai had a large team of Google engineers building a prototype search engine, called Dragonfly, that was designed to be compatible with China's censorship regime. The project was dropped amid heated internal dissent from Google employees. But it reportedly would have blocked sites like Wikipedia, as well as other material considered objectionable by Chinese authorities.
Amazon and Apple, two tech giants that love America so much that they have gone to elaborate lengths to avoid paying taxes to its Treasury, are also promoting themselves as national champions. After Mr. Trump criticized Apple's plans to do some of the assembly of its Mac Pro in China, the company reiterated its desire to keep much of the computer's assembly in the United States. And Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has knocked rival firms for insufficient patriotism, saying that "if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble."
Representatives for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple all declined to comment.
Conspicuous patriotism is not a new tactic for companies accused of bad behavior. In the 1980s and 1990s, defenders of American tech giants like IBM and Microsoft argued that those companies' monopolistic behaviors were necessary to stave off competition from Japanese rivals. During World War II, Hollywood movie studios delayed a federal antitrust crackdown, in part by agreeing to help the military in the war effort.
Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University and a former Google employee, characterized the tech industry's scaremongering about China as a tactical move meant to deflect criticism.
"It's a really convenient narrative," Ms. Whittaker said. "It evokes nationalism and a red scare trope that has worked in the past. And it implies that regulation, accountability and taking a pause to consider ethics would be counter to 'winning."'
Patriotic posturing may be a cynical tactic, but it could also be a smart one. Today's big tech companies are in a better negotiating position than most industries under fire. The meteoric growth of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon has bolstered the American stock market and made Silicon Valley a global innovation hub. Even if the motives of the tech giants are questionable, the importance of technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence to the country's competitive position isn't lost on lawmakers.
Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley in Congress, has called for greater regulation of tech companies. But in an interview this month, he told me that the risk of losing ground to China worried him.
"There is a risk that we could see a Berlin digital wall," Mr. Khanna said. "The question is, are the values of liberty, privacy and freedom of speech going to be embedded in technology platforms? China's platforms do not have many of the values that liberal democracies believe in."
There is nothing inherently wrong with the belief that America's values are superior to those found in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or that American tech companies should act in the country's best interest. But lawmakers should be appropriately wary of Silicon Valley's charm campaign, and they should avoid conflating what's good for Facebook, Google and other tech companies with what's good for the nation. Tech executives might be whistling "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy," but they really just want to be left alone.

Motives range from vying for lucrative public-sector contracts to lobbying against regulation.

McDaniel: Cannot overlook injustices of death penalty

Texto completo: Some conservative Christians have gone “the full Monty,” exposing themselves as they leave Jesus in the rearview mirror. Following Donald Trump, they repudiate Jesus as much as Peter, who when identified as a disciple of Jesus, loudly proclaimed, “I do not know that man.” Suppose Trump-following Christians hear the cock crow?
Jonathan Lange, a Lutheran Pastor speaking for the Wyoming Pastor’s Network (WPN) denied the transformational power of Christ in his Aug. 2 op-ed, “Executions teach the value of life.” Lange attempted to give religious creds to Trump’s decision to resume executions while avoiding any reference to Jesus’ teachings.
Reminds me of my favorite 20th-century prophet, the Rev. Clarence Jordan. He would have read the Rev. Lange’s op-ed and considered it evidence that “the Bride of Christ has been unfaithful.”
Lange employed what theologians call eisegesis, an intentional process of scriptural interpretation starting with one’s own bias.
After the flood, Genesis 9 recounts God’s Noahic Covenant. “Never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” The rainbow symbolizes the covenant, a reminder of God’s grace.” It reminds Lange of God’s vengeance, as he tortures scripture to provide Trump religious cover to take human life.
Lange disregards Paul’s reasoning (Hebrews 8) that, in Christ, God abandoned Old Testament covenants in favor of the “new covenant” based on God’s grace. Paul quotes God from Jeremiah, “I will be merciful toward their iniquities and I will remember their sins no more.”
To support Trump’s decision to restart executions, the WPN spokesman circumvents God’s grace, shrugging off the Jesus part of the New Testament, with a Trump-serving reading of Paul’s letter to the church in Rome.
He situationally interprets Romans 13:4 to give divine authority to governments to “execute wrath on him who practices evil.” I say “situationally” because Lange probably didn’t interpret this verse the same when the government was the Obama administration.
Greek scholar David Bentley Hart says the better translation of Paul’s words recognizes the right of authorities to “exact justice” rather than to “execute wrath,” a translation that turns Lange’s opinion on its head.
Christian writer Marcus Borg suggested Paul’s advocacy for subordination to Roman authority may have been tainted by his Roman citizenship just as Lange’s views are tainted by devotion to Trump. Imagine Paul with a “Rome-Love it or Leave” sticker on his donkey’s hind end.
Regardless, Paul’s Letter to the Romans was likely written early in Nero’s Emperorship, before the 64 CE fire that destroyed much of Rome. Back then the Emperor was more tolerant of Christians. However, Nero had to blame someone for the fire. He pointed at Christians and used it as an excuse to dip them in oil and set them afire. Nero dressed Christians in “the hides of beasts” enticing vicious dogs to tear them apart. Hundreds were crucified, others set ablaze to “illuminate the night.”
Paul never meant the words Pastor Lange selected to apply to the post-fire Roman government much less authorities such as the Third Reich, North Korea, or governments like ours, who execute people without guaranteeing the death penalty will be applied only to those who are actually guilty and without regard for race.
A Wyoming Republican legislator, Jared Olsen, wrote in a New York Times op-ed that “conservatives don’t trust the government to get capital punishment right.” Why should Jesus followers?
In his zeal to follow Trump, Pastor Lange fails to acknowledge that at least 4% of those sentenced to death are innocent. The exoneration rate is half that number, meaning innocent people are executed. Contrary to Lange’s op-ed, wrongful executions do not “teach the value of human life.” They teach the value of abolishing the death penalty.
The Rev. Lange overlooks racial bias in meting out the death penalty. From the decision to arrest and prosecute, through jury selection and verdicts, the skin color of an accused and/or the victim plays an outsized role in deciding whether to kill the defendant.
A “full-Monty” Trump backer might overlook those injustices. A disciple of Christ cannot.

Texto completo: Meredith Vieira is the rare TV personality who can do whatever she wants. Her 40-year career has included network news ("60 Minutes" and "West 57th" on CBS, ABC's "Turning Point" and NBC's "Today"), daytime talk ("The View," "The Meredith Vieira Show") and a dozen years as a quizmaster ("Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"). Along the way, Vieira, 65, became an icon for working mothers, balancing career decisions with her commitment to family life.
Having a few laughs is also a priority, which is why she returns to TV on Sept. 16 as the host of "25 Words Or Less," a new daytime show based on the popular board game with teams of celebrity and civilian contestants competing for cash. The show from Lisa Kudrow's Is Or Isn't Entertainment will air on Fox-owned TV stations across the country including KTTV in Los Angeles.
--

You've always been a game show fan.
I have. When I was offered "Millionaire" by [producer] Michael Davies, I had friends who said, "Why are you doing that?" And I said, "Because I like it. I'm not ashamed of it. I think it's cool. I'm giving people money, and it's not mine." What's better than that?
--
There aren't a lot of serious TV journalists able to pull that off.
I thought what made me an effective host was the fact that I was a journalist -- I knew how to draw contestants out. I knew how to relax them. I knew how to ask them questions. I knew how to listen. And all those things are important even in a show like that. People walk in so nervous to a game. There's a lot on the line for them. And you just have to remind them "It's a safe place, it's good -- tell me about you." And then they relax and then they play the best game they can.
--
Game shows can get very physical. People get excited and hug each other. Now, we're in the age where you have to ask permission. Do they need intimacy coordinators on a game show set?
I have no idea about that. I'm a hugger; that's just who I am. So it hasn't come up in front of me. I think you know where the line is. But if George Clooney won on our show, all bets would be off.
--
Have you asked him to come on the show?
No. Now he'll never come on.
--
You were the original moderator of ABC's "The View." Are you surprised about the place show has taken in the country's political discourse?
Cut to the New York Times article, yeah.
--
They called it the most important political TV show in America. Is that true?
I don't know. For somebody who's getting back into television I don't watch a lot of TV. I'll see the clips, like a lot of people do. I'm thrilled that "The View" continues to be relevant and reinvent itself. And quite frankly those political candidates would not come on that show unless they felt there was a real need to be on that show. So they've touched a chord with people in this country, for sure, and it's become sort of a must-do for those candidates.
--
Why is there so much more yelling on the show than there was when you were there?
Well, I'm not a yeller. I think discourse in general on television has become that way -- a lot of fire, a lot of heat. When I was hosting, it was all about no crosstalk. Let somebody have their say and then the next person. But now that's kind of part of the mishegoss that's part of the game.
--
Do you think about getting back into TV news in any significant way?
No. I never say "never," but I'm not looking for it. Right now, I don't want to be part of that. I find the times right now very difficult and depressing.
--
What do friends of yours in the business say about it?
They find it very frustrating, because this lack of trust in the media that's been brewing and fermented by certain folks. It has made it very hard to do your job, because your integrity is constantly being questioned. And there are so many journalists who are people of integrity. And to have them painted with this broad brush is extremely difficult for folks.
--
You had a close workplace friendship with Matt Lauer. What was it like for you to see him taken down by the #MeToo movement and fired by NBC for inappropriate sexual behavior?
It was very difficult, because -- and I think I speak for so many people -- I never would've expected it. And it was heartbreaking. I was in L.A. [when Lauer was fired in November 2017], and my phone started going crazy at 4 in the morning. And I'm thinking, what the hell's going on? I found out in the middle of my night.
--
And you were surprised by it?
Yes, I was. This was a guy that I thought I knew. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that goes on in television. There are people who have affairs. This was a different level; this wasn't that.
--
Have you remained friends with him? Have you talked with him at all?
I haven't.
--
Do you think he'll ever come back to TV?
I would bet not. I don't think television drove him; I really don't. I don't think he felt, "If I'm not on TV, then, my life is useless." He had a restaurant that he invested in, and he had the horses. And I think he probably loved a lot of the stories that he told, but I never felt it just totally defined him.
--
You also worked at "60 Minutes" during its years as a boys' club.
Yes, I did. Do I bring this stuff on?
--
But your issues there were very public at the time. You were the youngest correspondent ever hired by the program in 1989, and you walked away two years later to have your second child when then-executive producer Don Hewitt would not let you work part time. It was a big statement. Do women remember this?
I just had a young woman say, "Thank you for the message you sent to working mothers." I would not have expected it -- this was a young woman who knows the story. And I don't sit around talking about it, but, yeah, I hope that it somehow had gotten into the DNA.
--
Can you imagine someone today saying the kind of things about you that Don Hewitt said back then?
I don't think you could get away with it today. And also that was Don Hewitt. I mean, he was the king. "60 Minutes" was the crown jewel in the network. And so he could probably do no wrong. He was a very, very powerful man. And I made my peace with Don after ... I've said this before -- but it was two parents fighting against each other -- me with my kid then, and pregnant with Gabe, and Don with his baby, "60 Minutes." And that really was what it was, that we both felt so strongly about our "kid."
--
So Gayle King has a big job at "CBS This Morning." Jane Pauley is the host of "CBS Sunday Morning." You keep getting shows. It doesn't seem like women in their 60s were getting these kind of opportunities 10 years ago.
We didn't. And I still think there is a certain element of, you know, women of a certain age -- I can't stand that expression -- being shelved. I remember when I was 30-something, or 40-something, a friend of mine said -- "Oh, there was a news director the other day saying, 'We want Meredith Vieira, only younger.' " She thought it was funny. It's a very visual medium obviously. If you're experienced and you're good at what you do, why not? The men have been doing it forever.

Saracho of 'Vida' pushes for diversity celebrities

Texto completo: When Variety's Marc Malkin sat down for a conversation with "Vida" showrunner Tanya Saracho as part of the 2019 National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) Media Summit, she admitted that her Mexican heritage wasn't always a point of pride.
In fact, she once attempted to erase the evidence: "When I came to this country, I was trying to get rid of my accent," she said, explaining that her motivation was a desire to join the speech and debate team as a student in Texas.
But Saracho has since emerged as an outspoken voice for Latinx representation in Hollywood, which is why she was honored with the Media Advocacy Award at the organization's Latino Media Awards gala.
Last year, Saracho signed a three-year production deal with Starz, and she's currently working on Season 3 of the series in addition to a new show titled "Bruja."
During her conversation with Malkin, Saracho recounted her journey from aspiring actress to playwright to TV writer (writing for mainstream hits like "Girls" and "How to Get Away with Murder"), which ultimately culminated in the opportunity to create "Vida."
"Me being here is an accident," she said.
As it turns out, instead of perfecting the art of American enunciation, competitive public speaking awakened something in Saracho. "I was always a ham," she said, and soon she fell in love with performing in front of an audience. More important, she learned about the lack of diversity in American theater, which inspired her to pursue playwriting, and since Saracho tends to think big, she also founded Teatro Luna - the first all-Latina theater company in the country.
Standing out as a fresh voice in the contemporary theater scene, her plays soon attracted the attention of The New York Times, which helped Saracho get an agent.
Her gift for storytelling also led to her first job as a staff writer for Marc Cherry's "Devious Maids."
Saracho became determined to prove her value as a TV writer with her next job on HBO's LGBTQ series "Looking."
"I was there because of my queerness," she said, and this experience informed her inclusive vision for "Vida," where she writes sex scenes for nonbinary people too. Saracho is the first to acknowledge that she didn't have to fight to get her passion project made - Starz pitched it to her, and its offer included the creative control to hire Latinx talent behind and in front of the camera.
But one victory does not constitute a movement in her eyes. "I can count the Latinx-themed shows with my hand," she said. (Meanwhile, only 5% of showrunners are people of color and the numbers aren't much better for Latinx lead actors.) "We're definitely having a moment, but it's dangerous to congratulate ourselves too much - we're not there yet."
So how does Hollywood get to a place where Latinx talent isn't vastly disproportionate to the overall population? "It's about the gatekeepers believing that our worlds are worthwhile - and that is what we have to change, because that's systemic," Saracho said. "I'm talking about the people in the towers" who have the power to greenlight diverse projects.

Moulton says he's still in running

Texto completo: US Representative Seth Moulton has been running for president for nearly four months. During that time he has made repeated stops in the early primary states, been a frequent guest on national cable news programs, and raised a million dollars.
But the Salem Democrat has yet to crack the debate stage — or even the second tier of candidates in the party's 24-person field. Here's a brief look at what's going on with his presidential campaign:
■  On Wednesday, The Washington Post reported Moulton was laying off half his staff, suggesting this was the beginning of the demise of his campaign. Moulton spokesman Matt Corridoni told the Globe there was some restructuring early last month that has led to a reduction of staff, but it's not half of the team.
Among those who have left the campaign is Adnan Mohamed , Moulton's deputy national political director, who is now working for former representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas.
Moulton's most recent campaign finance report, which covered April to June, showed about 25 people on staff. Moulton's campaign says it still has staff in states that come early on the nominating calendar, including New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.
■ Last week, a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll of likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters showed not a single person of 500 surveyed said they would vote for him. (Two respondents said Moulton was their second choice.)
■ Moulton told the Lynn Item he has no plans to withdraw from the presidential race. He said that rumors he will drop out before Labor Day were false.
■ Moulton is planning to skip a major Iowa Democratic dinner this weekend to attend a reunion of his Marine buddies. He will campaign in Iowa and Minnesota later this week, said Corridoni.
■ After not qualifying for the first two rounds of debate, Moulton isn't expected to make the stage in September, either. He'll have more company on the sidelines though: The Democratic National Committee has raised the threshold for participation to 130,000 unique donors and at least 2 percent support in four sanctioned polls.
Still, Moulton is unique in that he has had zero support in every qualifying poll for the debates since he entered the race in April.

The Justice Democrats, a progressive organization that backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley in their underdog races for Congress last year, announced Wednesday morning that they have endorsed Holyoke's mayor, Alex Morse, in his primary challenge to US Representative Richard Neal.
The group highlighted Morse's record of declaring Holyoke a sanctuary city, implementing a needle exchange program, and being the first mayor in the state to support marijuana legalization. In a statement, the executive director of Justice Democrats, Alexandra Rojas, described Neal as a “bulwark against progressive priorities in the Democratic Party," citing issues such Medicare for All, free public college, and “holding the Trump administration accountable."
Neal, 70, is an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. He was first elected to the Western Massachusetts district seat in 1988, but he's taken a lot of heat from liberal groups for not pursuing President Trump's tax returns more vigorously (Neal issued a subpoena for them in May).
“Congressman Neal is on the front lines of holding the Trump administration accountable and is the one being sued by this administration. Richie has always fought to make sure this district gets its fair share and we aren't left behind," said Peter Panos, a spokesman for Neal's campaign.
Morse announced his candidacy in late July, calling Neal “largely silent on the issues that matter most" as well as “absent, unaccountable, and unavailable."
One of the state's first openly gay mayors, Morse, 30, told the Globe this week that he is excited about the endorsement and the enthusiasm that people have about this race across the country.
“I want to represent everyday people in Western Mass. who are struggling," said Morse in a phone interview. “When you think about the struggles people have here, we would never think that we have one of the most powerful Democratic congressmen representing us."

Texto completo: Perhaps it's best to leave Woodstock to its legacy. The original festival was a communitarian moment during a movement of the same — lightning in a bottle. In today's fraught environment of public safety and accountability, it's hard to imagine pulling off any such gathering with casual disregard.
In August 1969 — a time of cultural upheaval more tangibly disruptive than that of the current day — more than 400,000 people and 32 musical acts found their way to a dairy farm in New York for "An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music."
The event, which would become known in the American vernacular as Woodstock, was a legendary failure — which is to say, a failure that became a legend. The location was settled late in the planning process. Roads clogged with traffic. Grounds got muddy. The organizers gave up control of the gates. The masses were fed by the grace and generosity of area residents but also by the euphoria of mind-altering additives. In short, it was groovy.
Naturally, then, there's nostalgia. The last few years have seen a cavalcade of 50th anniversaries — not just tragedies but also triumphs like the moon landing. A Woodstock 50 festival would have had to be in the works. But like its progenitor, the effort suffered organizational woes. The location was elusive. Ticket information was, too. On Wednesday (July 31), festival organizers gave up the ghost.
Perhaps it's best to leave Woodstock to its legacy. The original festival was a communitarian moment during a movement of the same — lightning in a bottle. In today's fraught environment of public safety and accountability, it's hard to imagine pulling off any such gathering with casual disregard.
In any case, today's young people have other interests. Like video games, to name one. According to a Washington Post-University of Massachusetts Lowell poll in 2018, almost three-quarters of Americans ages 14 to 21 had either played or watched multiplayer online games or competitions in the previous year.
Last month, the 16-year-old winner of the inaugural Fortnite World Cup took home $3 million. About 40 million players had tried to qualify for the competition. "The point of the game is simple," the New York Times once reported for the sake of those who don't play: "Be the last man, woman or child standing. Kill everyone else."
It's wrong, as it was at the time of Woodstock, to try to pinpoint the motivating thrust of an entire generation. But it's worth wondering, as the British singer/songwriter Nick Lowe did in 1973 as the hippie movement was fading out: What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?

Perhaps it's best to leave Woodstock to its legacy. The original festival was a communitarian moment during a movement of the same — lightning in a bottle.

Texto completo: A woman who says convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein kept her as a teenage sex slave claims in a sworn deposition that a woman who served as the New York financier's procurer directed her to have sex with Bill Richardson while he was governor of New Mexico.
Epstein died early Saturday from an apparent suicide.
A spokeswoman for Richardson, who has not been charged with any crime, denied Friday that he has ever met Virginia Giuffre, who says in her deposition that she was ordered to provide erotic massages and sex to several powerful men associated with Epstein.
Richardson's name showed up in a 2016 deposition ordered released Friday by a federal judge as part of a 2,000-page cache of documents in a defamation lawsuit Giuffre filed against Ghislaine Maxwell, a former Epstein girlfriend who has been described as the billionaire's "madam."
"In several depositions — excerpts of which were included in the documents unsealed Friday — Giuffre said that Maxwell would send her to have erotic 'massages' and sexual encounters with various powerful men" including Richardson, the Daily Beast reported Friday.
Epstein had been facing federal charges in New York of sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex in that state and Florida. The New York Times, which said Epstein hanged himself, quoted officials as saying his body was found at 7:30 a.m. Saturday in his Manhattan cell.
Dozens of accusers say they were underage, some as young as 14, when Epstein allegedly sexually abused them.
The Daily Beast quoted part of the deposition in which Giuffre said, "They instructed me to go to (former U.S. Sen.) George Mitchell, (modeling agent) Jean-Luc Brunel, Bill Richardson, another prince that I don't know his name. A guy that owns a hotel, a really large hotel chain, I can't remember which hotel it was."
Mitchell and Brunel also have denied Giuffre's allegations, the Miami Herald reported Friday.
Giuffre has claimed she was forced to have encounters with men including Britain's Prince Andrew, Epstein's lawyer Alan Dershowitz, the late MIT scientist Marvin Minsky and others. The prince and Dershowitz — who has sued Giuffre for defamation — have denied the allegations.
The Daily Beast noted that "court documents unsealed on Friday did not contain any corroboration or further details, though many documents remain sealed."
Defamation suits Giuffre filed against Maxwell and Epstein were settled in 2017.
Richardson spokeswoman Madeleine Mahony said in a statement Friday, "These allegations and inferences are completely false. Gov. Richardson has never even been contacted by any party regarding this lawsuit. To be clear, in Gov. Richardson's limited interactions with Mr. Epstein, he never saw him in the presence of young or underage girls. Gov. Richardson has never been to Mr. Epstein's residence in the Virgin Islands. Gov. Richardson has never met Ms. Giuffre."
Current Attorney General Hector Balderas said last month his office is looking into possible criminal activity by Epstein in New Mexico and will turn over any evidence to federal prosecutors.
Epstein owns the secluded, 10,000-acre Zorro Ranch in southern Santa Fe County, which he purchased from former Gov. Bruce King in the early 1990s. On that property is a 26,700-square-foot hilltop mansion as well as a small airplane hangar and airstrip.
Epstein also owns properties in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Epstein was generous to Richardson in his two successful gubernatorial campaigns, contributing $50,000 in 2002 and 2006.
Richardson was one of several New Mexico politicians whose campaigns got money from Epstein. Others include former Attorney General Gary King — Bruce King's son — in 2006 and 2014, former state Land Commissioner Jim Baca, who was seeking another term in 2006, and former Santa Fe County Sheriff Greg Solano in 2006.
Richardson during the 2006 campaign donated Epstein's contribution to charity after the Palm Beach, Fla., police chief went public with accusations that Epstein was recruiting girls for sex. In a controversial plea bargain that many have called a sweetheart deal, Epstein eventually pleaded guilty to soliciting sex.
Richardson's name appears in Epstein's infamous "little black book," which was stolen from the billionaire by one of his butlers and became evidence in a court case against the butler. Others whose names and phone numbers appear in the book are the late former Gov. King, the real estate company of former state Rep. Rhonda King, Bruce King's niece, which sold the Zorro Ranch property; John Kelly, who is listed as "attorney general" but served as U.S. attorney for New Mexico through most of the 1990s; and the Santa Fe Institute.
The "black book" also contains phone numbers for several women or girls, listed only by first names under the heading "Massage — New Mexico."
Last month the New York Times reported Epstein had confided to scientists and others about a scheme to "seed the human race with his DNA" by impregnating women at the Zorro ranch.

Trump Shares Fringe Theory About Epstein And Clintons

Texto completo: BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. -- President Trump used Twitter on Saturday to promote unfounded conspiracy theories about how Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sex trafficking, died in a federal prison, even as the administration faced questions about why Mr. Epstein had not been more closely monitored.
For years Mr. Trump has brashly -- and baselessly -- promoted suspicion as fact and peddled secret plots by powerful interests as a way to broadcast his own version of reality. Those include the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and that millions of votes were illegally cast for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
Hours after Mr. Epstein was found to have hanged himself in his Manhattan jail cell, Mr. Trump retweeted a post from the comedian Terrence Williams linking the Clintons to the death. Mr. Epstein "had information on Bill Clinton & now he's dead," wrote Mr. Williams, a Trump supporter. In an accompanying two-minute video, Mr. Williams noted that "for some odd reason, people that have information on the Clintons end up dead."
There is no evidence to substantiate the claim, which derives from groundless speculation on the far right, dating to Mr. Clinton's early days as president, that multiple deaths can be traced to the Clintons and explained by their supposed efforts to cover up wrongdoing.
[How Mr. Trump uses conspiracy theories to erode trust.]
Responding to Mr. Trump's retweets, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton mockingly wrote, "Ridiculous, and of course not true -- and Donald Trump knows it." The spokesman, Angel Ureña, added, "Has he triggered the 25th Amendment yet?" The 25th Amendment contains a provision allowing for the removal of a president if he is unable to perform his duties, potentially in the event of mental instability.
Posting from his luxury golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Trump also shared another tweet, from an unverified account, which claimed that recently unsealed documents involving accusations of Mr. Epstein's abuse had revealed that Mr. Clinton "took private trips to Jeffrey Epstein's 'pedophilia island."'
A spokesman for Mr. Clinton has denied that Mr. Clinton traveled to Mr. Epstein's private island in the Virgin Islands. The documents unsealed Friday also include an acknowledgment from one of Mr. Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, that an earlier claim she made about Mr. Clinton visiting Mr. Epstein in the Caribbean was untrue.
Mr. Epstein's death, 12 days after being taken off suicide watch, prompted questions about the safeguards prison officials took to keep him alive and ensure he answer for yearslong allegations of sexual abuse. The Justice Department immediately faced criticism, drawing outrage from accusers seeking justice and from legal experts questioning why prison officials deemed Mr. Epstein was no longer at risk of taking his own life.
The attorney general, William P. Barr, said on Saturday that the Justice Department's independent watchdog would conduct an inquiry into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death in a federal prison cell. The F.B.I. also said it would investigate.
The pair of retweets come on a day when Mr. Trump expressed outrage on Twitter over what he called "dishonest" and "inaccurate" coverage of his presidency by the news media, including The New York Times. Mr. Trump insisted that reports that several survivors of the mass shooting in El Paso last weekend had refused to see him when he visited their hospital on Wednesday were false, but provided no evidence.
Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Clinton had been friendly with Mr. Epstein but broke ties with him many years ago. In a July statement, Mr. Ureña, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, said that the former president had taken several trips with Mr. Epstein on his private plane in 2002 and 2003 but that the men had not spoken in more than a decade. Mr. Clinton "knows nothing about the terrible crimes" of which Mr. Epstein has been accused and, in one case, had been sentenced, the statement said.
Even before Mr. Trump weighed in on the subject, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter that while scrutiny of Mr. Epstein's death was warranted, "the immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone on the 'other side' of partisan divide having him killed illustrates why our society is so vulnerable to foreign disinformation & influence efforts."
Earlier Saturday, one of the president's senior appointees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lynne Patton, posted a headline about Mr. Epstein's death on Instagram, perpetuating a debunked right-wing narrative. Including the comment, "Hillary'd!!" she also referred to Vincent Foster, the Clinton White House counsel who died by suicide in 1994 -- a crucial episode in the unfounded theory tying the Clintons to allegedly suspicious deaths.
Adding to the extraordinary nature of Mr. Trump's retweets was the fact that Mr. Clinton is a former president. American presidents have traditionally treated their predecessors and successors with pronounced respect, even when they are from different parties or ran bitter campaigns against one another. But after defeating Mrs. Clinton in a 2016 campaign during which he suggested he might imprison her, Mr. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed and taunted both Clintons.
Tweeting on another subject earlier in the day, Mr. Trump seemed to criticize joint United States military exercises with South Korea that have enraged North Korea, calling them "ridiculous and expensive." The president said that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had offered him "a small apology" for that country's recent short-range missile tests, which violate United Nations resolutions but which Mr. Trump has brushed off. "I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un in the not too distant future!" he wrote.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: What's on TV
SUCCESSION 9 p.m. on HBO. Nominated for five Emmy Awards this year, this dynasty drama is under more pressure to provide ample family intrigue, and the show hopes to avoid disappointment. After a near-catastrophic betrayal concluded the first season, the second promises to continue the corporate saga in true-to-life dramatic fashion. Edmund Lee wrote in The New York Times that the show "manages to provide viewers with an accurate reconstruction of the boardroom machinations behind the merger-mad media industry of recent years." The second season begins with the Roy family, the owners of one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world, facing a growing threat to their empire. As each member searches for his or her own path to secure control, their struggles may wind up undoing their family's legacy.
CLAWS 9 p.m. on TNT. Neon lights, a nail salon and a slew of the worst -- and most entertaining -- stereotypes about Florida set the stage for the absurdist, female-centric dark comedy "Claws." The third season of this wickedly funny noir followed Desna (Niecy Nash) and her crew of manicurists-turned-criminals as they attempted to take charge of a shady yet lucrative casino. Just as Desna seemingly manages to secure the casino and get rid of her most formidable enemies, the explosive finale takes an unexpected turn for the worse, with the welfare of her friends on the line.
THE FOOD THAT BUILT AMERICA 9 p.m. on History. The United States is the birthplace of several industries: airplanes, automobiles, mobile phones -- and processed food. In this three-part mini-series, the first episode of which premieres Sunday, History examines how several titans, including Henry Heinz, Milton Hershey, John and Will Kellogg, C.W. Post and the McDonald brothers, forever changed how people consume food. While each may be considered an example of American innovation and ingenuity, the series reveals just how ruthless these visionaries became to win over the hearts -- and stomachs -- of the country, establishing legacies that define the food industry to this day.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
CURSE OF AKAKOR Stream on Facebook Watch. In the 1980s, three explorers disappeared on separate missions to find the Amazonian lost cities of Akakor and Akahim, both of which, according to legend, store a wealth of gold. Karl Brugger, the author of a book on Akakor, was murdered under mysterious circumstances around the same time. This documentary series follows six investigators -- including Paul Connolly, a journalist, and Bobby Chacon, a former F.B.I. agent -- as they seek to find the mythical cities, armed with modern expedition tools and a series of ancient clues. While the researchers aim to find evidence that proves the existence of the cities, they also hope to unravel the unsolved mysteries of the missing explorers.

Last year around this same time of the year, I wrote an article entitled, "Reimagining Civility in an Uncivil Society (Part I)," and at that time over 69 percent of American's stated that we have a civility problem in the country, and one year later the 2019 civility report, states that now over 93 percent of Americans identify incivility as a deep concern in the country - classifying it as a "major problem."
A recent New York Times report stated:"We are in a real dark place" when immigrants are warehoused in unsanitary conditions, and we normalize a dead father and his daughter lying face down in the water along the Rio Grande. "We are in a real dark place" when the President of the United States sets a negative racial cadence at a rally in Greenville N.C., while the crowd yells concerning Ilhan Omar to "send her back." "We are in a real dark place" when a sitting president of the entire United States makes comments concerning our great city of Baltimore by tweeting to Congressman Elijah Cummings that: "If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous and filthy place," a district in which he considers "the worst in the USA" and "no human being would want to live there." We are in a real dark place in the city of Baltimore if we don't use this moment to continue to coalesce and come together to further demonstrate that this city was, and is, critical to the success of the entirety of the country at large.
Subsequently, the original civility article discussed that since the times and legacy of President George Washington, many have attempted to codify general rules for a civil society but have then gone on to allow for and support the dehumanization of people of color, women, and what the sacred prophetic book calls "the other." However, If civility is to be imagined, it must consider the "Commandments of Public Civility (adapted)" which suggests, where possible:
* Explore areas of common ground where legitimate disagreements exist, in an effort to move forward on matters of public importance;
* Always remember that it is okay to agree to disagree, and that reasonable people can indeed disagree reasonably;
* Do not ridicule or belittle a colleague, or a member of the public, simply because he or she disagrees with you on an issue;
* Always serve as a bridge for others to make it from one vantage point to the other in that it will serve as a catalyst to a more civil society;
* Serve as a conduit of empowerment in that it creates potential self-sufficient communities, and
* Seek the well- being of all people, and it will potentially build a stronger humanity.
Lastly, for civility to be realized in the city and around the country, we must be prepared to go beyond just codified "Commandments of Public Civility;" we must become activists whose actions seek to develop what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deemed a "Beloved Community" of reconciliation of the human ethos and redemptive acts of human progress and achievement. The "Beloved Community" was not a lofty utopian goal to be confused with the rapturous image of the peaceable kingdom, in which lions and lambs coexist in idyllic harmony, but the "Beloved Community" is a realistic, achievable goal that could be attained by a critical mass of people committed to what is now considered "societal and human respectability," human uplift and a societal change that reflects the same.'
Jim Nelson Black said that a nation and a city begin to die when the social, cultural, and moral respectability of its people has begun to decay. We cannot keep calling ourselves "a city on the hill, "while allowing some of the citizens of that hill to live in valley conditions. Again, for civility to take place, it must be an intentional reboot in our public discourse that allows for no one to be fractured nor paralyzed in their endeavors towards access and emerging opportunities. The prophetic and sacred book calls for leadership "To be repairers of the breach," and "Not to let unwholesome talk to come out of our mouths, but only what helps build others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen."

Texto completo: Palantir's technology is central to U.S. immigration officials' work, including raids and deportations, a new report says.
The 46-page report, released Thursday by immigration advocacy group Mijente, came to that conclusion based on public records that contradict the data-mining company's previous statements that its work with ICE is limited to criminal investigations.
Mijente cites a WNYC public radio report from last month that showed Palantir's Falcon Mobile app is used during workplace raids. In May, the group released a report that showed how Palantir software was used to track the arrival of unaccompanied minors at the border.
The Silicon Valley company's contracts with the U.S. government total $1.5 billion, Mijente found. More than $150 million of that is from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The report also details the reach and influence of Peter Thiel, the billionaire entrepreneur and co-founder of Palantir who was a member of President Donald Trump's transition team and "helped to staff agencies that went on to award major contracts to Palantir, and seeded the federal government with appointees in department- and cabinet-level positions including U.S. chief technology officer."
Palantir, based in Palo Alto, has not returned requests for comment.
Mijente spokeswoman Jacinta Gonzales said Thursday that the group did not try to contact the company, which has refused its requests for meetings. In late 2018, Palantir told the New York Times that it does not work with the ICE division that handles immigration enforcement, including deportation and detention of undocumented immigrants.
But Mijente's latest report shows otherwise. In fact, the group found that the company's "support staff works at ICE facilities in Northern Virginia to provide real-time technical support for raids."
The report came a day after the largest immigration raids in a decade, during which ICE arrested 680 people at food-processing plants in Mississippi.
Although Mijente's report focused on Palantir's entry into the U.S. military-industrial complex and its vital part in immigration operations, it also mentions that other tech companies some of which have faced protests from their workers over their contracts with ICE play a role.
"If you are a tech worker at one of these companies, history will ask what you did," Mijente writes. "You will have to explain to your children what role you played when the government was raiding homes and caging children and whether you did all in your power to prevent suffering on your watch."

Texto completo: Boondoggle’s roots
Editor: A Times-Tribune editorial notes that the state Turnpike Commission “has no choice” but to raise tolls because of state law (“Turnpike tax,” July 22).
That’s only half true. The legislation for the turnpike to borrow billions and endlessly raise tolls was crafted by the commission itself. The commission - using toll dollars - hired a contract lobbyist to push this scheme. The commissioners wanted to keep their fiefdom as a haven for patronage jobs, which was threatened at the time by Gov. Ed Rendell’s proposal to lease the turnpike. The lease was a far superior plan that would have yielded $12 billion in upfront payments and capped toll hikes.
Today, the turnpike’s $450 million in annual payments to the state all go to mass transit, as does more than $500 million in vehicle registration fees, driver fines and rental and tire fees. Thus, drivers are forced to subsidize transit systems they don’t use.
On top of tolls and fees, Pennsylvania drivers pay the nation’s second-highest gasoline tax at 58.7 cents per gallon, mostly for road and bridge work, with some going to state police.
The problem with our transportation systems isn’t that Pennsylvanians are undertaxed; that’s hardly the case. It’s because our taxes and tolls are misspent. Instead of more taxes, lawmakers should stop directing driver charges to mass transit, end prevailing wages that drive up the cost of construction and reconsider leasing the turnpike.

Prosperous festival
Editor: On behalf of all who benefit from the ministry of St. Joseph’s Center, we would like to extend heartfelt thanks to so many for overwhelming support, generosity and presence.
Friends, near and far, turned out in great numbers to donate, volunteer, dine and celebrate during the recent 58th annual summer festival. More watched the WNEP-TV telethon and made contributions. Throughout July, sponsors and donors supported Joe Snedeker’s 500-mile bike ride from Ohio to St. Joseph’s Center Summer Festival.
We are deeply grateful to all partner organizations that ensure the success of this annual event. We are so fortunate to host the festival on the beautiful and spacious campus of Marywood University and benefit from the hospitality of its staff, especially campus safety and maintenance.
Each year, we rely on funds raised to implement plans for program expansion, renovations and equipment purchases. We are honored by the commitment of so many to support these endeavors and assure that those who turn to us receive the support and resources they need to reach for their God-given potential and be affirmed with respect.
The festival is always a place of welcome for all and a great witness to what is possible when a community cares. Throughout the year, St. Joseph’s Center benefits from the thoughtfulness, prayer and action of this caring community.
We appreciate the many examples of how this is experienced, especially sharing of the precious resources of time, talent and treasury; showing up and responding when asked for help. We offer our most sincere thanks and promise to be good stewards of all that is entrusted to us.

Notorious company
Editor: Amnesty International has listed countries facing human rights crises: Syria, China, El Salvador, Venezuela, the Central African Republic, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Myanmar, Azerbaijan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia and the United States.
I don’t think there are words to express the shock and shame reflected in this. For those who heard the message, “If you don’t like it, leave,” I would say, don’t leave - stay and vote.

One small step . . .
Editor: Fifty years ago, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
planted a United States flag on the surface of the moon.
Given the hysterical “wokeness” that permeates the Democratic Party, I’m surprised that none of its leaders have denounced the moon landing - and the entire Apollo space program for that matter - as being a product of racism, white privilege, toxic masculinity, misogyny and American imperialism.
Indeed, it is not much of a stretch to speculate - as did one commentator - that if the first moon landing had taken place in today’s warped sociopolitical atmosphere, The New York Times’ headline would not have been “Men walk on moon” but rather, “Cisgender heteronormative patriarchal oppressors walk on moon.”

Put halt to hate talk
Editor: Up until now, I had believed that the best way to defeat President Donald Trump in 2020 would be to focus on advocating for the federal government to do more to help people in the lower and middle classes with their economic and financial struggles to survive and to pay their bills.
So, I largely have ignored his hateful, dumb and ignorant remarks in which he demeans, degrades, insults, bullies and disrespects all minority groups, women, and immigrants. I have done this partly because I have believed from day one that this all has been a big act, that he is a master manipulator and con man who really doesn’t believe the ridiculous, idiotic and moronic things that he says. I believed he cleverly figured out that he could win the presidency by pretending that he believes in what he thinks that 51% of the American people believe in - hate.
But his hate talk has become too dangerous. He is playing with fire. This big act and game has to stop.
Good-hearted conservative Republicans who have a conscience should call out Trump. All Republicans in Congress who have been silent about this evil should call out Trump on this hate talk.
The people whom he has insulted and disrespected don’t deserve to hear any more of his brutality. He might already have damaged our country beyond repair.

A quandary for Never Trumpers

Texto completo: The Democratic debates have been hard on Never Trumpers. The small but vocal group of Republicans and former Republicans who oppose President Donald Trump has watched in horror as Democrats veered leftward, embracing "Medicare for All," virtually open borders, sky-high taxes and other positions no conservative could ever accept.
The Never Trumpers see disaster coming in the form of the president winning re-election over a Democrat who moved too far left for the American voter.
So they issue warnings. The Democrats’ performance in the most recent debate was "worse than farcical," The New York Times’ Bret Stephens wrote. "It’s tragic. It will make the Trump campaign’s job of selling the president as the non-insane option in next year’s election shamefully easy."
Bill Kristol, the former Dan Quayle aide who founded the now-shuttered Weekly Standard, tweeted, "Best moment in this debate: ‘It’s time for closing statements.’" After the first debate — a widely watched event that gave voters across the nation their initial impression of the Democratic field — some Never Trumpers were deeply alarmed.
"Trump wants to portray Democrats as open-border socialists," wrote The Washington Post’s Max Boot. "And in their eagerness to court progressive primary voters, the candidates are playing into his hands."
The fretting and complaining, coming from people who had been Republicans until Trump came along, set some liberals on edge.
"I, for one, have pretty much had it with the chorus of center-right voices braying that the Democrats are heading for certain doom ... if the party picks a nominee who actually embraces the party’s ideals," wrote the Post’s Eugene Robinson, adding that "Never Trump Republicans and independents may be shocked to hear this, but the Democratic Party is likely to nominate a Democrat for president."
The pushback served to highlight the Never Trump dilemma. First, they went through a torturous process searching for a candidate to support in the 2016 election. Now, it’s happening again.
The 2020 problem is twofold. The first part is that there is no hope of challenging Trump within the Republican Party structure. As sitting president, Trump controls the Republican National Committee and has the support of the vast majority of GOP voters.
The second part is the depressingly woke Democratic field. Only a few Never Trumpers would be able to support a Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. Some would probably be happy with Joe Biden, but perhaps more the Biden of their memories than the man who will have to move far enough left to capture the Democratic nomination.
The fact is, barring some extraordinary event that no one can predict, the 2020 presidential race will be between President Trump and a Democratic challenger.
Trump will be chosen by Republicans. The Democrat will be chosen by Democrats.
And one of the two will be sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2021.

Texto completo: In August 1969 — a time of cultural upheaval more tangibly disruptive than that of the current day — more than 400,000 people and 32 musical acts found their way to a dairy farm in New York for "An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music."
The event, which would become known in the American vernacular as Woodstock, was a legendary failure — which is to say, a failure that became a legend.
The location was settled late in the planning process. Roads clogged with traffic. Grounds got muddy. The organizers gave up control of the gates. The masses were fed by the grace and generosity of area residents but also by the euphoria of mind-altering additives. In short, it was groovy.
Naturally, then, there's nostalgia. The last few years have seen a cavalcade of 50th anniversaries — not just tragedies but also triumphs like the moon landing. A Woodstock 50 festival would have had to be in the works. But like its progenitor, the effort suffered organizational woes. The location was elusive. Ticket information was, too. On Wednesday (July 31), festival organizers gave up the ghost.
Perhaps it's best to leave Woodstock to its legacy. The original festival was a communitarian moment during a movement of the same — lightning in a bottle. In today's fraught environment of public safety and accountability, it's hard to imagine pulling off any such gathering with casual disregard.
In any case, today's young people have other interests. Like video games, to name one. According to a Washington Post-University of Massachusetts Lowell poll in 2018, almost three-quarters of Americans ages 14 to 21 had either played or watched multiplayer online games or competitions in the previous year.
Last month, the 16-year-old winner of the inaugural Fortnite World Cup took home $3 million. About 40 million players had tried to qualify for the competition. "The point of the game is simple," the New York Times once reported for the sake of those who don't play: "Be the last man, woman or child standing. Kill everyone else."
It's wrong, as it was at the time of Woodstock, to try to pinpoint the motivating thrust of an entire generation. But it's worth wondering, as the British singer/songwriter Nick Lowe did in 1973 as the hippie movement was fading out: What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?

Texto completo: Back when I was a rookie editor in ABC's Manhattan newsroom, we used to place bets — actual cash wagers — on how the New York Times would design the next day's front page.
Rather than wait until morning for results, we gathered around a radio to savor the 9 p.m. broadcast on WQXR, which began: "Front Page! Tomorrow's New York Times! What will it look like?" A fellow named Bill Blair described every inch of page one, reading each headline and how it was positioned.
Though the radio program is long gone, some news executives still play the game using digital images. But here's a news flash: Among them are the Times's top editors. Many of the people who used to spend hours planning the page now check an email or tweet at 9 p.m. to see what it looks like. For them, the print edition has taken a backseat to the company's various digital products.
This resulted in quite a fuss the other day when the Times's print headline as of 9 p.m. read, "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM." A tweet of the page brought an angry response from those who felt the wording, while accurate, failed to contextualize the president's remarks in the wake of shootings in Texas and Ohio. The headline was changed in subsequent editions to, "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
My take on all this is twofold. First, the Times's front page, much like its tabloid cousins in New York, The Daily News and The Post, has impact as an information snapshot that extends beyond actual print circulation. Second, and far more important, journalists are on dangerous ground when they shift too heavily from reporting the news to analyzing and interpreting it outside of carefully labeled "opinion" columns.
The Wall Street Journal's page-one headline that day, for example, was bland but straightforward: "Trump Speaks Out as Death Toll In Two Shootings Climbs..."
Few stories frustrate journalists — and those who second-guess them — as much as mass murders across this nation. They are covered in print and on television in a predictable pattern: anxious eyewitnesses and grieving relatives speaking to shirt-sleeved reporters, along with streams of politicians who appear genuinely concerned but also aware of a prime-time opportunity to be seen and heard.
Nothing changes, prompting some to blame the messenger. If only, they argue, journalists went beyond the facts and called for action to restrict guns and curb hate crimes. A sad take along those lines comes from a former editor at Denver's defunct Rocky Mountain News, who guided award-winning coverage of the 1999 school massacre at Columbine.
The more politically divided the nation becomes, the greater the thirst for news coverage that reinforces thinking rather than inspires it. At the same time, the shift from print to digital platforms makes opining easier, opening the door for the oxymoronic endeavor known as advocacy journalism.
If the Times erred in judgment, it was probably by placing the President's remarks too high on the page. There was nothing wrong with what the original headline said, only with the thinking of critics whose 9 o'clock bet would have been for something that more matched their opinion.

Texto completo: What's on TV
DAVID BOWIE: FINDING FAME 9 p.m. on Showtime. "I think there's a lot of searching to find the individual within oneself," David Bowie says in a recording near the beginning of this documentary. It's in some ways a thesis statement of the film. "Finding Fame," the final installment of a trilogy of Bowie documentaries from the English filmmaker Francis Whately, explores a period of Bowie's career starting in 1965, around the time he dropped his stage name of Davie Jones in favor of Bowie, to 1973, when he dropped the Ziggy Stardust persona that had cemented his stardom. Produced by the BBC, the documentary shows an artist during a period of both commercial and self discovery.
RED SPARROW (2018) 5:35 p.m. on HBO2. In Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan," Natalie Portman plays a New York ballerina who finds darkness and violence in her dancing. In Francis Lawrence's "Red Sparrow," Jennifer Lawrence takes it several steps further by playing Dominika, a Moscow ballerina who pivots from a prestigious career dancing for the Bolshoi to become a murderous spy. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie "preposterously entertaining," and wrote that Lawrence "goes all in, seamlessly meeting the movie's physical demands -- whether she's dancing onstage or crawling in blood -- while turning Dominika into a character who grows more real with each unreal scene." Lawrence will also be on the hunt Friday night in THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE at 7 p.m. on USA Network.
What's Streaming
STREET SCENE Stream on BroadwayHD. Kurt Weill finds opera in a New York City tenement in "Street Scene," his late '40s adaptation of a play by Elmer Rice. With lyrics by Langston Hughes, the show melts together the sensibilities of American musicals and European opera, exploring love and conflict between a set of neighbors and families over the course of two sweltering New York days. This production, with stage direction by the English opera director John Fulljames, was recorded last year at the Teatro Real in Madrid.
ROCKO'S MODERN LIFE: STATIC CLING Stream on Netflix. With its surreal inclinations, anthropomorphic Australian wallaby main character and theme song sung by members of the B-52's, "Rocko's Modern Life" stands among the likes of "Rugrats" and "Hey Arnold!" as a quintessential slice of childhood nostalgia for many who grew up in the 1990s. This new special brings the long-dormant Rocko and company to the 2010s, where they're confronted with smartphones and 3-D-printed comic books.
RAISING ARIZONA (1987) Stream on Starz; Rent on Amazon. Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine, Nicolas Cage reflected on his oddball performance as a baby-stealing former convict in this early Coen brothers comedy. "Perhaps there was confusion about where I was going, but the Coen brothers went along," Cage said. "They didn't mind that I was channeling Woody Woodpecker. They, on some level, got it." Revisit the movie -- the second feature from the Coens -- to see what he's talking about.

Texto completo: Egyptian-born Rajia Hassib, who earned a master's degree in Creative Writing at Marshall University and now makes her home in Charleston, opens her new novel, "A Pure Heart (Viking, $27), with a newspaper account of a suicide bombing:
"A suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device at a security checkpoint outside of the police headquarters in Cairo, killing three police officers and six civilians and injuring dozens more.
But while the bombing is a pivotal part of her novel, Hassib paints her story on a much bigger canvas. "A Pure Heart is an in-depth exploration of the tangled relationship between Egyptian sisters Rose and Gameela Gubran.
The two sisters could not be more different.
Rose, an Egyptologist, marries an American journalist and immigrates to New York City, where she works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gameela, a devout Muslim since her teenage years, stayed in Cairo.
During the aftermath of Egypt's 2011 revolution, Gameela is one of the civilians killed in the suicide bombing at the Cairo police headquarters.
When Rose briefly returns to Egypt after the bombing, she sifts through some of the possessions Gameela left behind. She's desperate to understand how her sister came to die, and who she truly was.
As Rose struggles to reconcile her identities as an Egyptian and as a new American, she investigates Gameela's devotion to her religion and her country. The more Rose uncovers about her sister's life, the more she must reconcile their two fates, their inextricable bond as sisters, and who should - and should not - be held responsible for Gameela's death.
Rich in depth and feeling, "A Pure Heart is a brilliant portrait of two Muslim women in the 21st Century, and the decisions they make in work and love that determine their destinies.
Rajia Hassib was born and raised in Egypt and moved to the United States when she was 23.
In a Q-and-A interview released by her publisher, she decries the pre-conceived notions about Muslims and terrorism held by many Americans: "There seems to be a general satisfaction, at least in the media, that the terrorist's religion - if he is a Muslim - is explanation enough for the act. In reality, of course, things are never that simple ... There are almost always personal or political grievances driving the terrorist.
In "A Pure Heart, she paints a sorrowful portrait of Saaber, a young Muslim boy whose father and brother both died at the hands of the Egyptian government. His radicalization ultimately casts him as the suicide bomber cited in the news article that opens the novel.
Hassib's first novel, "In the Language of Miracles, was a New York Times Editors' Choice and received an honorable mention from the Arab American Book Award. She has written for The New York Times Book Review and The New Yorker.
On her web page, Hassib writes: "I owe more than I can possibly express to Dr. Jane Hill, Chair of the English Department at Marshall University, and to Marie Manilla, author of, most recently, The Patron Saint of Ugly.' Dr. Hill made me a writer; Marie Manilla showed me how to write a novel.

Refugees and the real-life implications of climate change

Texto completo: There’s nothing like a scalding surge of Saharan summer across Europe and the United States to focus minds on the real-life implications of climate change – especially since the record heat wave has coincided with the release of a number of new reports charting the extent and effects of global warming.
But another event – just days after the record European and U.S. heat waves – received scant media attention. It was a fatal shipwreck in the Mediterranean, off the coast of Libya. And it claimed the lives of dozens of economically desperate refugees fleeing African countries that, amid steadily rising annual temperatures, have been suffering devastating droughts and sudden torrents of rain – the kind of “extreme events” climate scientists predict will become ever more frequent.
The omission offered an important snapshot of the current state of the climate debate in the developed nations of the West. The message: While the science around global warming is becoming more widely accepted, the politics remain complex and contested.
At the core of the political conundrum lie two interlocking issues: the dire climatic conditions facing some of the poorest agricultural areas in the less-developed world, whether in sub-Saharan Africa or Central America; and the growing numbers of their people ready to risk everything in the hope of finding sanctuary in Europe or the U.S.
For international charities and advocacy groups working in Africa or Central America, the priority is clear. They argue the need for a well-funded, targeted drive to help the millions in rural communities threatened by destitution, ill health, or outright famine. Some want the United Nations to endorse the idea of adding a new category of internationally accepted refugee: “climate refugees.” Their view is that a concerted effort to deal with the problem represents a critical step in any long-term answer to the wider issue of migration.
Science does play some part for those making the counterargument. Their view is that it’s yet to be shown that climate change is the sole driver of the surge of refugees seeking safe haven in Europe or the U.S. And they’re right to cite other factors as well: growing populations, civil strife or gang violence, bad governance or a history of resource mismanagement.
But the picture on the ground – nowhere more powerful than in a series of Christian Science Monitor special reports on famine in Africa in 2017, and the “Out of Africa” reporting of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman a year earlier – leaves no doubt that climate extremes have played a major part in the economic hardships driving growing numbers northward. Indeed, a new U.N. report underscores that point, noting that climate change will likely cause food shortages and spur cross-border migration.
The key challenge facing those seeking coordinated world action is not the science. It’s the current international political environment – with multinational alliances and organizations more fragile, and a mix of nationalism and populism in the ascendancy. The priority for key Western governments has become the shorter-term aim of keeping large numbers of migrants from reaching their borders.
The European Union, through programs like its Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, has made an effort to use economic support and training schemes to stem the flow of refugees from their home countries. But by far the main EU focus, largely through the increasingly unstable government in Libya, has been to try to keep those fleeing Africa from reaching European shores in the first place.
The U.S. has devoted development and assistance funding to the “Dry Corridor” states of Central America – Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. But President Donald Trump has made stemming migration to the U.S. a centerpiece of his administration’s political message, and of his bid for a second term in office.
Last week, in an initiative resembling the EU’s arrangement with the Libyans, he announced an agreement with Guatemala that, assuming it wins congressional approval there, would require would-be migrants from Central America to register asylum claims in Guatemala rather than on the U.S. border.
Will priorities shift? Recent polling does show that, especially among younger people, climate change is becoming an ever more important concern in the West, with data points getting ever more arresting.
Just a couple of days after the recent heat wave, Britain’s national weather service reported that every one of the country’s 10 hottest years since the late 1880s has occurred since 2002. And a series of studies published in Nature and Nature Geoscience focused on the sustained, worldwide pattern of temperature increases since the Industrial Revolution, concluding there had been no similar trend over the past two millennia.
Still, at least so far, the main focus of the debate in Europe and the U.S. has remained on reducing their own carbon emissions, not on the countries beyond their borders that so many migrants are fleeing.

Appearing on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, McCarthy was asked about how to understand factors contributing to a shooting.
"This may be a place where we could find this ahead of time," said McCarthy who discussed ways to detect future shooters.
"The idea that these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals," continued McCarthy, "I've always felt that it's a problem for future generations and others. We've watched studies show what it does to individuals, and you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.

McCarthy added that he wanted to "get all the facts. "
"But what I'd like to do is get all the facts, are there indications? There are times before that we have found this," he said.
McCarthy's comments came after a mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart left 20 people dead and 26 injured and before a shooting spree early Sunday at an entertainment district in Dayton, Ohio left at least nine dead and 16 hurt.
The New York Times reported last year that there was little evidence to suggest there was any link between video games and mass shootings.
Among other evidence, the New York Times cites a 2011 court opinion from conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, "Psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. "

Texto completo: I'm a fan of self-help books.
Maybe it started in high school in the 1970s when an older cousin mailed me a paperback copy of "I'm OK-You're OK," by Dr. Thomas A. Harris.
Receiving an unexpected book in the mail was a treat, and the idea that she thought I was smart enough to enjoy this book made my head swell. Turns out, the book went onto the New York Times Best Seller list about the time she gave it to me and stayed there for two years. It has sold more than 15 million copies and been translated into a dozen languages.
It's now a self-help classic about self-understanding.
Not long after, a group at my childhood church, Parkview Baptist, studied "The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth" by M. Scott Peck. It, too, sold several million copies and was translated into 23 languages. The book opens with "Life is difficult" and discusses the journey to spiritual growth.
Recently, seeing so many self-help books on bestseller lists, I've thought about why I pick up this genre:
— I like learning about myself and what makes me tick. Even if I don't agree with all an author says (and who does, really?), I like hearing the perspectives of others and looking for ways to enrich my daily life. When I ponder a book, I consider my own life, routine, goals and so forth.
— Inspiration and motivation. Just like I need a cup of dark-roast Community Coffee to get me going each morning, I like to read encouraging words early in the day. I start with a Psalm from the Bible and go from there. Having a fresh self-help book is like a second jolt of caffeine. Even reading a page or two can help me handle my day better.
— Curiosity. Sometimes I want to see what the big deal is about a certain book or how common-sense info is repackaged. Why has it attracted so much attention? What does its sales tell me about our national psyche?
Recent self-help reads
— Curiosity drove me to check out a library copy of "Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your Goals," the new book by Rachel Hollis. I'd read a magazine interview about her and was fascinated in the immense popularity of her books, which are geared to women younger than me and centered on the author's "lifestyle brand." The premise of the new book: "I believe we can change the world. But first, we've got to stop living in fear of being judged for who we are."
Even though I'm not her target reader, I enjoyed her breezy, personal, almost in-your-face style and can see why her brand of encouragement is popular. Hollis is also the author of the bestseller, "Girl, Wash Your Face: Stop Believing the Lies About Who You Are So You Can Become Who You Were Meant to Be." The premise of this book: "Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don't have a clue. If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that's a lie." (For those of you who don't think self-help sells: This is a No. 1 NYT bestseller, this book has 10,745 reviews on Amazon, most of which are four or five stars.)
— A desire to eat healthier and lose weight brought me to "Food Rules: an eater's manual" by Michael Pollan with fantastic illustrations by Maira Kalman. (OK, I might also have bought this book because I love the way it looks.) This is a newer edition of Pollan's book that has been a bestseller as people embrace better ways to eat. I first saw his philosophy painted on the wall of a restaurant in Denver: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I was curious about that philosophy and found his books. If you're a foodie or a fan of the Slow Food movement or want to give a pretty, smart book as a gift, I recommend this one.
— I was working with a writing coach on a screenplay a few years ago when I first heard about "You are a Bada--: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life" by Jen Sincero. The book, which came out in 2013, had just released, and I winced at the title and didn't buy it. (This was the first self-help book I noticed with profanity in the title, but I'm now seeing many more...) But it kept coming up on "best of" lists and hit No. 1 on the NYT bestseller list. In an airport one day with too much bookstore time, I bought a copy—and enjoyed it. Sincero is a witty writer who believes strongly in her message. (Warning: She sprinkles profanity throughout the book, so this one definitely won't be for everyone.) While I don't agree with all the absolutes she puts forth, I like her words about being grateful and going for the things we want in life. Again, young adult readers may find lots of nuggets in here.
—A friend and I were discussing today's contentious politics, and she gave me a copy of a book she loves, "Unoffendable: How Just One Change Can Make All of Life Better" by Brant Hansen. This book, written from a Christian perspective, talks about dropping anger, embracing forgiveness and choosing not to be offended. An example: "The thing that you think makes your anger 'righteous' is the very thing you are called to forgive." (Ironically, if you're offended by my recommendation of "You Are A Bad---," you might really enjoy this book.)
We need to be reminded
Will a self-help book transform your life and teach you something brand-new? Likely not. But maybe it will help you with a course correction or a new perspective. As Dr. Samuel Johnson said, back in the 1700s, "People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed." A good self-help book is a fine reminder.
Book columnist Judy Christie is the author of 18 books, including the self-help "Hurry Less Worry Less" series (her first published books) and the upcoming nonfiction work: "Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society," which releases October 22.

Texto completo: RETAIL
More Sears and Kmart stores to close, including one in Palmer
The padlocks are coming out again for Sears stores. The struggling retailer will shutter 26 more of its large-format Sears and Kmart stores in late October, it revealed on its website. Any of the locations with auto centers will close those divisions in late August, it said. Liquidation sales are expected to start as soon as next week. The Kmart store in Palmer is among those that will close. The once-dominant chain, which has already closed more than 100 locations, is trying to rebuild itself by investing in smaller footprint stores, a key tenet of its turnaround plan. BLOOMBERG
DELIVERY
FedEx cutting ties with Amazon
FedEx is severing ties with Amazon as the online retailer builds out its own delivery fleet and becomes more of a threat. The announcement Wednesday that FedEx would no longer make ground deliveries for Amazon comes two months after the delivery company said it was terminating its air delivery contract with Amazon. Amazon.com Inc. is building its own fleet of ground and air transportation to have more control of how its packages are delivered and cut its reliance on FedEx, UPS, and the US Postal Service. The Seattle-based company has been leasing jets, building several package-sorting hubs at airports, and launching a program that lets contractors start businesses delivering packages in vans stamped with the Amazon logo.

Waffle House chairman, former housekeeper settle lawsuit
A settlement has been reached in a seven-year long dispute between Waffle House Chairman Joseph Rogers Jr. and his former housekeeper, who secretly recorded them having sex. The confidential deal was announced moments after Rogers's attorney gave his opening statement in a civil trial Tuesday in a Georgia courtroom. News outlets report the terms weren't disclosed and both sides declined to comment. Rogers accused his former housekeeper Mye Brindle in a lawsuit filed in 2012 of recording their sexual encounters in an attempt to extort him. Rogers also sued Brindle's attorneys for allegedly conspiring with her. Brindle said she recorded the acts as proof of Rogers's repeated sexual harassment. Brindle and her attorneys were indicted on unlawful surveillance charges but were cleared last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ENTERTAINMENT
taking a lightsaber to disney's profits
The force may be with them, but the bucks, apparently, are not. Walt Disney Co. shares took their worst tumble in nearly four years after the opening of the most highly anticipated theme-park attraction in the company's history fell flat, hammering results in its latest quarter. Profit at the company's domestic resorts slumped in the period, which was marked by the ballyhooed opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, the largest addition ever to the Disneyland resort in Anaheim, Calif. A second version of the space-themed land opens in Florida this month. The earnings shortfall was a shock to investors who were counting on Disney's market-dominating theme parks and films to shoulder the burden of growth as the company goes head to head with Netflix Inc. in streaming. BLOOMBERG
PHARMACIES
CVS raises earnings forecast once again
CVS Health Corp. raised its 2019 earnings forecast for the second time this year after topping Wall Street's estimates, driven by growing revenue and profit at the drug-benefits unit. The company, based in Woonsocket, R.I., expects adjusted earnings for the year to be $6.89 to $7 per share, an increase from its May forecast of $6.75 to $6.90. CVS's success as a mix of corner pharmacies, drug-benefit services, and health insurance is a contrast to its competitors. While CVS raised its forecast, retail rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has been slashing costs and closing stores — including Tuesday's announcement that it would shut down 200 more US locations.

SOCIAL
Match Group shares soar, fueled by Tinder subscriber growth
Like striking a match to a tinder box? Explosive growth at the dating app Tinder is propelling Match Group Inc. shares to record highs. The dating company gave an optimistic earnings report and outlook, fueled by Tinder's growth. The shares gained as much as 24 percent, the most intraday since May 2016. Match is owned by billionaire Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp. Since going public in 2015, Match has quadrupled its market capitalization, largely driven by explosive growth in Tinder, the app where people swipe right on photos of prospective dates to indicate romantic interest.

REAL ESTATE
Prices retreat in some of the costliest markets
Home prices slipped in some of the costliest US markets in the second quarter, a sign that would-be buyers are sitting out the competition for a scarcity of affordable properties. The median price for a previously owned single-family house increased 4.3 percent from a year earlier to $279,600, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Wednesday. Prices climbed in 162 of 178 metropolitan areas measured. The high-cost regions of San Jose, San Francisco, and Honolulu were among those where prices fell. Median single-family prices in Greater Boston were up 2.2 percent over the second quarter in 2018, to $506,700. BLOOMBERG
MEDIA
For New York Times, the news is not good
The New York Times is having a week from hell. After the publisher drew flak for a headline earlier this week on President Trump and suffered a legal setback against Sarah Palin on Tuesday, the company warned that advertising revenue would decline sharply this quarter. The outlook sent New York Times Co. shares down 20 percent Wednesday — their worst intraday plunge in almost seven years — and cast a shadow on what had been an upbeat year for the Gray Lady. The stock was up 60 percent in 2019 through Tuesday, fueled by signs that the 168-year-old publisher is successfully pivoting to the digital age. The Times expects ad revenue to decrease by a percentage in the high-single digits in the third quarter. The stock rout was another headache in a week full of them. On Monday, presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke slammed the newspaper for running the print headline “Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism," which he and other critics said mischaracterized the story in favor of the president. New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet acknowledged to the Daily Beast that it was a “bad headline" but noted that it was quickly changed. On Tuesday, the Times learned that it must face a defamation lawsuit by Palin, the former Alaska governor, over an editorial that linked her to the shooting of Arizona lawmaker Gabrielle Giffords.

Nike buys Boston analytics company
Nike Inc. has purchased a data-science firm that it believes will provide insight into what its customers want, and how to deliver it. The acquisition of Boston-based Celect dovetails with Nike's biggest initiative — its digital presence. In just the past year, Nike has opened a new type of retail store, enhanced its member app, and unveiled a new product line, all of which is centered on learning more about its customers on an individual level. Celect, which last year raised $15 million from a handful of investors, offers predictive analytics that will help Nike optimize retail inventory and predict consumer patterns. BLOOMBERG

Novartis CEO in hot seat in falsified data allegation

Texto completo: Novartis chief executive Vas Narasimhan began his tenure with an inherited scandal. Now he's got one all his own.
The revelation on Tuesday that AveXis, Novartis's gene therapy division, submitted falsified data to the Food and Drug Administration is at the very least a blemish on the brief reign of Narasimhan, a rising figure who took over in early 2018 with a promise to change the culture at the Swiss drug maker, which has a major presence in Cambridge. But it also threatens to become a much bigger scandal.
At issue is what Novartis knew — and when it knew it — about the manipulation of data used to win approval of its gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. According to the FDA, company officials at AveXis were aware of the issues as early as March but didn't inform regulators until late June. The drug, the first gene therapy for a type of SMA and the most expensive therapy on the market to date, was approved in May.
The FDA's investigation of the issue could take months. For Novartis — and particularly for Narasimhan — the stakes are high, even if FDA officials stressed that they remained confident the therapy should remain on the market.
Narasimhan, 43, took the reins at Novartis with the stated goal of changing the culture at a drug company that traces its roots back to 1859. In more recent years, Novartis has faced a string of allegations of bribery, charges of data falsification, and accusations of illegal marketing. Narasimhan promised to transform the company and make such scandals a thing of the past.
“One of the five priorities I've set up for our company is building trust with society, which I see as a long game," Narasimhan told The New York Times in its “Corner Office" column published Sunday. “This is not going to be fast."
Indeed, his first test came quickly. In May 2018, Novartis got dragged into the circus surrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney for President Trump who was convicted of fraud and perjury. The company's association with Cohen, who had pitched himself as a fixer for Novartis, “completely blindsided" Narasimhan, he said months later.
The damage from the crisis, however, was limited for Narasimhan, largely because the relationship with Cohen had been cemented under his predecessor. Over the following months, Narasimhan won industry praise for his candor and his efforts to transform Novartis, including by selling off parts of the company not focused on its core business of prescription drugs.
Now, though, the latest missteps occurred solely under his watch.
“He comes off a great high, and then they get slapped with this," said John LaMattina, a pharmaceutical executive who led Pfizer's research operation from 2003 to 2007. “If he's going to be a CEO when things are going well, it's tough things like this that really test you and prove your worth."
Novartis' $8.7 billion acquisition of AveXis, signed within months of Narasimhan taking the job, was meant to be the new CEO's signature move, one he described as a pivot away from pharmaceutical dogma and an embrace of futuristic — and potentially curative — medicines including gene therapy.
Zolgensma, AveXis's banner product, looked to be a transformational medicine for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disorder whose most severe form is almost universally fatal within two years of birth. Novartis shepherded Zolgensma to FDA approval, putting a $2.1 million price tag on the one-time therapy.
Now, Novartis needs to explain how it could have overlooked manipulated data in such a crucial filing to the FDA.
According to the agency, Novartis knew as early as March 14 that one or more people at AveXis had manipulated data supporting Zolgensma's approval. But the company didn't inform regulators until June 28, more than a month after the treatment had been on the market, the FDA said.
In a statement, Novartis stressed that it had brought the concerns to the FDA's attention, and did so once it had “interim conclusions" from its own investigation. It wasn't clear, however, why the company did not notify the agency about potential issues with a decision on Zolgensma pending.
The situation thrusts Novartis back into crisis management, and it interrupts Narasimhan's ascent as a warmly received figure in an industry otherwise beset by criticism. It is perhaps not where the chief executive expected to be.
“I've now visited over 33 countries, seeing the cultural change I've talked about actually happening," Narasimhan said in the spring. “Whether it's sales reps or senior level people, the company feels different. The company really feels like it's changing."

Texto completo: EL PASO — Hours before President Trump arrived in this desert city on the Mexico border, high school students clad in black released white balloons for every one of the 22 victims killed in one of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history.
Hundreds of people later gathered at a central park to protest the president's visit, saying he had inflamed the kind of racial and ethnic hostilities that led the shooter to target Latinos at a Walmart in the commercial center of the city. Condemnation of the president's anti-immigrant rhetoric has been inescapable, too, at a memorial near the site of the shooting where people have stopped by the thousands — after work, between lunch breaks, often in scorching heat — to march and pray and drop off flowers, stuffed animals, and balloons.
As Trump and his wife, Melania, visited survivors and offered what administration officials said was a message of national unity, they found a city fighting through grief, and some grappling with its identity as the epicenter of the nation's immigration battle. And there were many who didn't want him there at all.
“I think he should have waited," said Aracely Calderon, 40, a native of neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico and a retail manager at a Fort Bliss store, who came to pay her respects Wednesday evening at the memorial. “I just think it was very disrespectful of him."
The president's visit to El Paso came after a stop at the site of another mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio, that left another nine dead just hours after the massacre in Texas. Against the backdrop of the Franklin mountains, he jumped into his motorcade with only a wave to reporters after shaking hands and briefly chatting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and El Paso Mayor Dee Margo.
Speaking to reporters on the tarmac, Margo said Trump asked him how it was going: “I told him it was one day at time."
“Your thoughts on the president coming to El Paso?" a reporter asked.
“Well, he is the president," Margo replied as he walked away.
Deflecting questions about the president's racist comments toward four congresswomen and anti-immigrant rhetoric, Cruz instead shifted attention to the shooter in Dayton, saying he was a supporter of Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
“Sadly no party has a monopoly on hate, no party has a monopoly on racism and bigotry," he said.
Latinos nationwide have been grappling with new levels of fear after the targeted attacks, and the impact has been acutely felt in El Paso, which is 80 percent Hispanic and where people live fluidly between Mexico and the United States. Investigators say a white supremacist drove almost 11 hours from the Dallas area before opening fire inside the Walmart. Prosecutors are investigating the crime as an act of domestic terrorism after investigators linked an anti-immigrant and anti-Latino screed to the 21-year-old white man accused in the attack. The posting used some of the same rhetoric the president has used regarding immigrants.
The president further angered some El Pasoans on Monday, when he condemned white supremacy but omitted any reference to Latinos and failed to address his own incendiary language.
Trump didn't help matters on Wednesday when — before boarding Air Force One on his way to Ohio — he took shots on Twitter at his political foes, The New York Times, and “radical left Democrats." Among his targets was Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native and former US representative, whom the president taunted over his name.
O'Rourke shot back with a tweet of his own, “22 in my hometown are dead after an act of terror inspired by your racism. El Paso will not be quiet and neither will I."
At a tribute ceremony for victims at El Dorado High School on Wednesday morning, student council members said they organized the event and invited O'Rourke to speak because they wanted to show the nation a positive image of their city.
“I think it's like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't," senior class vice president Khendra Jacome, 17, said of her conflicting feelings about the president's visit. “That is why I fought so much to get Beto O'Rourke here because he's from here, he knows the type of community that we have . . . so you know, I thought let's fight the negative with the positive."
After praying with students and shaking hands, O'Rourke told reporters he shot back at the president “because he's trying to intimidate this community, make us afraid of one another, of our differences, of the border, of immigrants, and we will not stand down."
He and US Representative Veronica Escobar, whose district includes the Walmart where the shooting took place, later opted to attend the counter-rally at Washington Park.
By the time the sun began to set over the mountains, the crowds were back at the Walmart, where white crosses with the names and photos of victims overlook a parking lot still filled with cars left behind. Some have left placards denouncing the shooter and also Trump for their hateful views.
“If you only got to know our people, our streets, our culture," reads one sign, “then you would see how precious our city is."

Texto completo: Novartis chief executive Vas Narasimhan began his tenure with an inherited scandal. Now he's got one all his own.
The revelation on Tuesday that AveXis, Novartis's gene therapy division, submitted falsified data to the Food and Drug Administration is at the very least a blemish on the brief reign of Narasimhan, a rising figure who took over in early 2018 with a promise to change the culture at the Swiss drug maker, which has a major presence in Cambridge. But it also threatens to become a much bigger scandal.
At issue is what Novartis knew — and when it knew it — about the manipulation of data used to win approval of its gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. According to the FDA, company officials at AveXis were aware of the issues as early as March but didn't inform regulators until late June. The drug, the first gene therapy for a type of SMA and the most expensive therapy on the market to date, was approved in May.
The FDA's investigation of the issue could take months. For Novartis — and particularly for Narasimhan — the stakes are high, even if FDA officials stressed that they remained confident the therapy should remain on the market.
Narasimhan, 43, took the reins at Novartis with the stated goal of changing the culture at a drug company that traces its roots back to 1859. In more recent years, Novartis has faced a string of allegations of bribery, charges of data falsification, and accusations of illegal marketing. Narasimhan promised to transform the company and make such scandals a thing of the past.
“One of the five priorities I've set up for our company is building trust with society, which I see as a long game," Narasimhan told The New York Times in its “Corner Office" column published Sunday. “This is not going to be fast."
Indeed, his first test came quickly. In May 2018, Novartis got dragged into the circus surrounding Michael Cohen, the former attorney for President Trump who was convicted of fraud and perjury. The company's association with Cohen, who had pitched himself as a fixer for Novartis, “completely blindsided" Narasimhan, he said months later.
The damage from the crisis, however, was limited for Narasimhan, largely because the relationship with Cohen had been cemented under his predecessor. Over the following months, Narasimhan won industry praise for his candor and his efforts to transform Novartis, including by selling off parts of the company not focused on its core business of prescription drugs.
Now, though, the latest missteps occurred solely under his watch.
“He comes off a great high, and then they get slapped with this," said John LaMattina, a pharmaceutical executive who led Pfizer's research operation from 2003 to 2007. “If he's going to be a CEO when things are going well, it's tough things like this that really test you and prove your worth."
Novartis' $8.7 billion acquisition of AveXis, signed within months of Narasimhan taking the job, was meant to be the new CEO's signature move, one he described as a pivot away from pharmaceutical dogma and an embrace of futuristic — and potentially curative — medicines including gene therapy.
Zolgensma, AveXis's banner product, looked to be a transformational medicine for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disorder whose most severe form is almost universally fatal within two years of birth. Novartis shepherded Zolgensma to FDA approval, putting a $2.1 million price tag on the one-time therapy.
Now, Novartis needs to explain how it could have overlooked manipulated data in such a crucial filing to the FDA.
According to the agency, Novartis knew as early as March 14 that one or more people at AveXis had manipulated data supporting Zolgensma's approval. But the company didn't inform regulators until June 28, more than a month after the treatment had been on the market, the FDA said.
In a statement, Novartis stressed that it had brought the concerns to the FDA's attention, and did so once it had “interim conclusions" from its own investigation. It wasn't clear, however, why the company did not notify the agency about potential issues with a decision on Zolgensma pending.
The situation thrusts Novartis back into crisis management, and it interrupts Narasimhan's ascent as a warmly received figure in an industry otherwise beset by criticism. It is perhaps not where the chief executive expected to be.
“I've now visited over 33 countries, seeing the cultural change I've talked about actually happening," Narasimhan said in the spring. “Whether it's sales reps or senior level people, the company feels different. The company really feels like it's changing."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that South Korea has agreed to begin discussions about increasing payments to the United States for its military assistance.
"South Korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the United States in order to defend itself from North Korea," Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts.
"Talks have begun to further increase payments to the United States," he said. "South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the United States of America. "
Trump has long complained about the number of troops the United States has stationed in South Korea, and the costs of maintaining them. The U. S. has kept up to 28,500 troops in the country, a legacy of the 1953 armistice that stopped the Korean War.
In one of his tweets, Trump claimed South Korea paid the United States $990 million last year. The New York Times reported in February that South Korea agreed to pay $925 million this year.
Trump did not address renewed missile tests by North Korea, which leader Kim Jong Un said are a response to the latest round of joint military exercises by the U. S. and South Korea.
The South Korean government has not commented on the new talks announced by Trump.
The tweets came hours before Trump travels to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, to meet with the survivors of mass shootings in those cities over the weekend.
Trump's demands for more money from South Korea also come at a time of uncertainty over U. S. efforts to strike an agreement with North Korea to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
The North Korean news agency said Wednesday that leader Kim Jong Un supervised a demonstration of newly developed, short-range ballistic missiles in order to send a warning to the U. S. and South Korea.
Trump, who has met with Kim three times, has said he is not bothered by a spate of recent North Korean projectile tests because they involve short-range weapons.

Texto completo: After weeks of speculation, the fabled department store Barneys New York announced on Monday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection. An arbiter of cutting-edge luxury and creativity, Barneys has been a mainstay of the New York fashion scene since it opened its doors in 1923. Its standing was cemented 70 years later when it opened its flagship store, a nine-story building on Madison Avenue with large windows that let daylight stream in.
Department stores across the nation have struggled as social media changed shopping habits and consumers were lured online by lower prices, drastically reducing foot traffic. Yet Barneys' woes faced heightened scrutiny, perhaps because of its reputation for shrugging off convention with an air of arrogance.
The attention may have hastened the retailer's troubles, but it was also emblematic of what made Barneys special in the first place. It stood apart from other department stores as a symbol of aspirational elitism, an attitude of exclusionary elegance that made it a New York institution and a must-see destination for well-heeled shoppers.
Barneys plans to close 15 of its 22 locations, but will maintain its flagship store, at Madison Avenue and 61st Street in Manhattan. Sheathed in French limestone, the building is known for its open, spacious design and large windows on every floor.
Despite its focus on high-end goods, Barneys' signature awnings often make appearances in pop-culture fare, including TV shows like "Will and Grace" and "Sex and the City." Barneys changed the awnings from a friendly cherry red to a sleeker black in 2011.
Barneys has cultivated a vaunted status as the place to see and be seen. Designers are willing to cut exclusive deals just to hang their clothes on Barneys racks. The rarefied air draws celebrities looking to buy avant-garde fashion or to introduce their own.
Barneys built a brand of cool by breaking the rules of retail. Its Madison Avenue store was an ambitious venture of extravagance when it opened in 1993, two years before Amazon sold its first book. Affluent New Yorkers and tourists were drawn to the opulence and sharply edited selection of upscale designer apparel.
In 1986, Barneys hired Simon Doonan, a British window dresser, who created the retailer's attention-grabbing holiday windows. The displays became renowned for their contradictory, theatrical approach with a twist of social commentary. "It's not so much to be shocking or daring," Mr. Doonan told The New York Times in 1993, "but to turn the windows into sort of a magazine with ideas, entertaining ideas."
Barneys has faced bankruptcy before, in 1996, after which the Pressman family lost control of the business. The company survived then, and it does not appear ready to shut its doors now, either. It struck a financing deal to stay afloat during bankruptcy proceedings and is moving ahead with openings in East Rutherford, N.J.; Las Vegas; and Miami Beach.

Eli Lake: Who should fight the war on white nationalism

Texto completo: In the aftermath of the mass shootings in Ohio and Texas, a bipartisan consensus is emerging that America must wage a war on white nationalist terror.
There were editorials in the liberal New York Times and the conservative National Review. George P. Bush, son of Jeb and the Texas Land Commissioner, published an eloquent call to arms. Decrying the left for downplaying radical Islamic terrorism and the right for failing to confront the white nationalist variety, Bush wrote: “Both are evil, both are real, and both must be confronted and conquered.”
What Bush and others mean to say is that white nationalism, the warped ideology that claims (among other things) that non-whites are seeking to replace whites, is toxic and must be battled with the urgency of other political wars of the past. Think of the war against poverty or the war on drugs. What the scourge of white nationalism does not demand, however, is the kind of shooting war launched after Sept. 11, 2001.
The current threat cannot be met with drone strikes against militia compounds in Idaho or public diplomacy campaigns to cleave non-violent white supremacists from violent ones. There will be no U.S.-led global war on white nationalism. The CIA will not be on the front lines.
Instead, the threat of white nationalism requires a law enforcement approach. So how is that going? On the one hand, FBI director Chris Wray recently testified that 40% of the bureau’s 850 domestic terrorism investigations involved individuals and groups motivated by racial hatred. In February, the FBI arrested a Coast Guard officer who had stockpiled arms and was plotting a race war. The country is fortunate he was arrested before he could carry out his plans.
Many of these attacks are harder to prevent. Unlike American recruits to the Islamic State or al Qaeda, white nationalist terrorists are usually not part of a formal group. The closest parallel would be the toxic Internet forums like 8chan, where the El Paso shooter is alleged to have posted his manifesto. Also, the bureau does not investigate ideologies, Wray testified last month, “no matter how repugnant.”
Civil libertarians would disagree with that assessment. A 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union found some political spying in the 2000s on environmental and peace groups such as Greenpeace and the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center.
Then there is the FBI’s aggressive posture against suspected radical Muslims. There have been hundreds of suspects charged with a conspiracy to aid foreign terrorist groups before committing an act of violence. Much of this is made possible by an aggressive approach to infiltrating and disrupting jihadist cells before they strike.
The argument now is that similar tactics should be unleashed against white supremacists. As the Times said in its editorial, “American law enforcement needs to target white nationalists with the same zeal that they have targeted radical Islamic terrorists.”
This is a fair point. The civil liberties of online bigots may need to be violated in order to prevent the next attack. But it’s also important to remember some of the lessons of the last war on terror - including the tendency to overreach. As a Human Rights Watch report put it in 2014, “In some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target’s willingness to act.”
In the aftermath of the horror of El Paso, many Americans may be more willing to strike a bargain under which some innocent people have their lives ruined to prevent the next mass shooting. This instinct is understandable, but we should also be careful. The extraordinary powers granted to the FBI in a moment of crisis will inevitably be abused once the crisis has passed.

Texto completo: Un nuevo reporte deja en evidencia la relación entre la retórica que maneja el presidente Donald Trump y las palabras del asesino de El Paso consignadas en el manifesto que dejó antes del tiroteo.
La investigación de The Hill concluyó que la campaña del presidente Trump ha colocado miles de anuncios en Facebook desde enero de este año advirtiendo de una “invasión” en la frontera sur de Estados Unidos.
Los más de 2000 anuncios se publicaron entre enero y mayo y muestran cómo la campaña del presidente se ha aprovechado de un lenguaje que los críticos califican de racista y xenófobo para obtener apoyo político.
“La crisis en la frontera sur es aún peor de lo que la mayoría entiende”, dice un anuncio, publicado por primera vez en enero.
“Hice MÚLTIPLES viajes a la frontera para mostrar la verdadera invasión que ocurre, pero los demócratas y los medios de comunicación falsos simplemente no me escuchan” .
El uso de la palabra “invasión”, ha sido objeto de duras críticas en los últimos días después de que apareció en un manifiesto escrito por el asesino de El Paso, Texas. Patrick Crusius supuestamente escribió que el ataque, que mató a 22 personas, fue una respuesta a una “invasión hispana de Texas”.
El uso repetido de la campaña de Trump de la palabra “invasión” en los anuncios de Facebook fue informado por primera vez por The New York Times el lunes.
Otro anuncio de la campaña de Trump, publicado por primera vez en Facebook en febrero, acusa a los demócratas de no negociar de buena fe la financiación del muro fronterizo propuesto por el presidente, diciendo que “LA OBSTRUCCIÓN es mucho más importante para ellos que SU SEGURIDAD”.
“¡Tenemos una INVASIÓN! Entonces estamos CONSTRUYENDO EL MURO para DETENERLO. Los demócratas nos demandarán. ¡Pero queremos un PAÍS SEGURO! ”, Dice el anuncio.
La campaña de Trump ha invertido millones de dólares en publicidad digital, particularmente en Facebook, y los datos del sitio de redes sociales muestran que los anuncios que usan la palabra “invasión” representan solo una pequeña fracción del total de anuncios comprados por la campaña, reportó The Hill.
Según datos de la firma digital demócrata Bully Pulpit Interactive entre el 5 de enero y el 27 de julio, la campaña gastó $8.7 millones en publicidad en Facebook
Además de los anuncios de Facebook, Trump ha mencionado repetidamente una llamada invasión en la frontera sur durante manifestaciones de campaña y en Twitter.

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed writer, who died Tuesday at age 88, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones. Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books
Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint was soon acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people
In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. “Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. “I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people . . . as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books. "
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali
While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do. ' And he would look up and recognize . . . a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number
After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey. ' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s
"Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no. ' "
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men. ' He said. 'Yes, but. ' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but. ' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You. "
She got the money.

Texto completo: New York Police Department's beekeeping unit removed 25,000 bees that took up residence on an awning in a Staten Island Ferry subway terminal, officials tweeted Sunday.
The bees were safely removed from the scene, and no injuries were suffered in the "sting" operation, police said – and that's partially true.
“I actually got stung,” Officer Darren Mays told The New York Times. “It happens. There’s a lot of people amazed. There’s a lot of people who are like, ‘I could never do something like that,’ and commended me for being brave. ”
The NYPD's beekeeping department is made up two officers, one who works weekday swarms, while the other covers nights and weekends, according to a 2018 profile by The New Yorker.
“We’ve always had an officer who shares their knowledge of beekeeping with the department,” Officer Michael Lauriano told the news outlet. “Now that beekeeping has been becoming more of a new thing for New York City – people are having rooftop bees, balcony bees, bees in the parks – we’re faced with the challenges of: what if they swarm off?”
Buzz: Bees are healing these turtles
Cornell University Senior Honey Bee Extension Associate Emma Mullen said in May that swarming is the natural phenomenon of honey bee colony reproduction.
"Under the right environmental and colony conditions, the queen leaves the hive with a few thousand of her daughter bees, and they temporarily cluster on a tree branch or other structure, where they remain while they collectively decide where their new home will be," she said in a statement on the university's website.
Bees pollinate approximately 75% of the fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the United States, and one out of every four bites of food people take is courtesy of bee pollination, according to the U. S. Geological Survey.
"In sum, bee pollination is responsible for more than $15 billion in increased crop value each year," the agency reports.
This means that taking any action to kill a bee swarm is the wrong idea, Mullen said.
"Honey bees face many stress factors in New York, so calling a swarm catcher instead of a pest controller can help preserve these colonies," she said.

Website for haters is finally taken down

Texto completo: The long-criticized online message board 8chan, which has frequently been used by extremists - possibly including the gunman in Saturday's mass shooting in El Paso - went dark just after midnight Monday when its security firm cut off support to the "cesspool of hate."
Matthew Prince, the CEO of Cloudfare, announced Sunday that his website security company was dropping support to 8chan, leaving the website vulnerable to cyberattacks that quickly shut it down.
"The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths," Prince wrote in a blog post. "Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit."
Prince's announcement came after a manifesto authorities suspect is linked to the El Paso shooter appeared on 8chan just minutes before the massacre that left 22 dead and dozens injured.
Law enforcement officials have not confirmed that the manifesto was posted by 21-year-old shooting suspect Patrick Crusius, but said they believe he penned the rant. The four-page hate-filled document blasted immigrants and Hispanics.
The online message board dates back to 2013. Under the banner of free speech, it allows users to post graphic and extremist content and doesn't censor posts.
If there is a connection to Crusius, it would be the third known instance of a shooter posting to the site before going on a rampage. In March, the gunman in mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques posted a rambling manifesto to the site, as did another who injured several people and killed one at a California synagogue in April.
On its official Twitter account, 8chan warned that there would be "some downtime in the next 24-48 hours while we find a solution."
The board soon found found a new online host - but it didn't last long.
Online records indicated the site was moved to a new domain host: Sammamish, Wash.,-based web services provider Epik.com.
The company bills itself on its site as "the Swiss bank of domains."
That company also provides support for Gab.com, another social media site frequented by white supremacists that doesn't ban hate speech.
But the plug was soon pulled on Epik by the company who runs its web services, known as Voxility.
"As soon as we were notified of the content that Epik was hosting, we made the decision to totally ban them," Voxility business development VP Maria Sirbu told The Verge.
8chan founder Frederick Brennan, who stepped down from the company in 2016, even called for the site to be shut down Sunday.
"It's not doing the world any good," he told the New York Times. "It's a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It's a negative to them, too. They just don't realize it."

Scholten running again in 4th District

Texto completo: Democrat J.D. Scholten is taking his second swing at the Democratic nomination in Iowa's 4th District, the most conservative area in the state.
The former professional baseball player announced he is running again to represent northwest Iowa in 2020 after narrowly losing the general election to incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve King in 2018. The Kiron conservative won by 3.4%, the smallest margin he has faced in a general election in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats 190,000 to 120,000.
This time, Scholten said he was hoping to improve on last year's results. He's already confident coming into his announcement with much higher national and local name recognition, as well as more attention on Iowa's 4th District seat at large.
"It's hard to comprehend how different this is," he said in an interview with the Des Moines Register. "The amount of attention we're receiving in just hours compared was months and months worth last time. But we're still trying to get out with the same thing we did last time: prove that we're trustworthy and prove that we're going to fight for the people of this district."
He launched his new campaign with a video narrated by Kevin Costner Monday morning, and with support from national Democratic groups like Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
He's coming back with a lot of the same priorities as he had in 2018 — fixing health care, supporting farmers — but with a new goal of meeting even more new voters. He has a "70% goal" for 2020: making sure come Election Day, at least seven of every ten voters in the district have seen him or "Sioux City Sue," his Winnebago RV with their own eyes.
"We saw the success we had last time," he said. "We saw that we got 25,000 more voters than there are Democrats in this district. We're looking to improve on that and it's by going to all 39 counties, multiple times, and continuing to go where the people are at and listen."
This week, he's kicking off his campaign touring in his Winnebago, holding rallies in Sioux City and Ames, as well as visiting the Iowa State Fair Thursday and the Iowa Democratic Party Wing Ding Friday.
While King has been a controversial political figure for many years, tensions reached a boiling point after the Republican's 2018 reelection. King was removed from his House committees by U.S. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy in January after he was quoted by the New York Times saying: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
The backlash from Republicans means Scholten is no longer the only challenger to the prominent Republican official. Prominent GOP challenger state Sen. Randy Feenstra significantly outraised King, and gained support from several national and state conservative figures.
"Two years ago, Congressman Steve King almost handed Iowa's 4th Congressional District to Nancy Pelosi when liberal Democrat J.D. Scholten nearly won," Feenstra said in a statement. "Today's announcement that Scholten will again seek the seat further highlights the need for Iowa Republicans to nominate an effective conservative that will win in November."
Scholten said even if King doesn't win the primary, his campaign strategy and message is going to stay the same.
"My game plan is the same as when I was a pitcher in baseball," he said. "It didn't matter what the batter was, it didn't matter who the opponent was, I was going to pitch my game. ... My campaign is about who we are and what we can do for the district."
That doesn't mean getting King out of the representative seat isn't a priority.
"He has a voice as a member of Congress that is far too controversial, far too loud — nobody should know who the 4th Congressional District representative is," he joked. "I really think its time for a change in this district."
King bashes fellow Americans online, can't do much in Congress because of his committee removals and has turned off voters on both sides of the aisle, Scholten said, adding that the 4th District is ready for a change.
"American voters are sick of punching down," he said. "That's not what I learned in Sioux City, growing up here ... That's our message, no matter who the opponent will be."
In February, King said he would run for reelection, saying he had nothing to apologize for. King's campaign could not be reached for comment.
"Don't let the elitists in this country, the power brokers in this country, tell you who's going to represent you in the United States Congress," he told voters in the district.

Gunmakers' stock rises following mass shootings
Shares of US gunmakers rose Monday, bucking huge declines in the broader market, amid renewed calls for gun control measures following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio over the weekend. Gun company stocks have typically traded higher after mass shootings as consumers may step up purchases to get ahead of potential regulatory changes that could make it more difficult to obtain guns. President Trump on Monday morning tweeted about linking “strong background checks" and immigration reforms, although he didn't discuss gun control in later remarks on the shootings. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
BANKING
Fed wants workers to get paid more quickly
The Federal Reserve said Monday that it will create a real-time payments system, with the goal of making paychecks and money transfers available for use more immediately. The move is aimed at narrowing the amount of time between when money is deposited or transferred into an account and when it is available for use. That gap can span several hours or several days, putting individuals — particularly low-income Americans — at a disadvantage. Community groups, smaller banks and advocates for low-wage earners have been calling for the Fed to limit the delay and to create a public sector option for real-time payments. But some in the banking industry, particularly large banks, have pushed back against the effort over concerns that the Fed's involvement will compete with their products and potentially crowd out private-sector efforts. The round-the-clock service will be called FedNow and is expected to become available in 2023 or 2024, according to the Fed's news release. — NEW YORK TIMES
BRANDING
Vegas stadium being built for Raiders will bear Allegiant name
A $1.9 billion stadium being built for the NFL's Oakland Raiders when the team moves to Las Vegas next year is being named for Allegiant Travel Co., team and company officials said Monday. The announcement came during a ceremony marking installation of the final steel beam for the roof of the 65,000-seat indoor stadium just off the Las Vegas Strip. Las Vegas-based Allegiant Travel is the publicly traded corporate parent of Allegiant Air, a low-fare carrier with 55 nonstop routes in the United States. Company chairman and chief executive Maury Gallagher said in a statement the facility name will "amplify" the airline's focus on leisure and vacation travel and its own resort development in Florida. Terms of the agreement weren't made public, but experts told the Las Vegas Review-Journal the deal might cost up to $25 million annually in cash and in-kind services. The Raiders are moving after the upcoming season. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
AVIATION
Planned strike at Heathrow averted, for now
Heathrow management made an 11th-hour offer to a union representing thousands of ground staff, leading to the suspension of a planned strike on Tuesday which would have disrupted flights at Europe's busiest airport. The Unite labor group will take the improved offer to members for a vote and hold off on Tuesday's walkout, according to a statement Monday from the airport. A walkout on Aug. 23 and 24 is still planned. The union said it would not disclose details of the pay offer until after the ballot. The announcement came just hours before the workers were set to walk off the job, although the chances of getting a breakthrough had improved after the two sides in the pay dispute agreed to continue to talk. While the first day of the labor action on Monday was cancelled, 16 of 676 scheduled departures were still scrapped, according to the airport, with five more moved to other London terminals. “We remain hopeful that we can find a resolution and stop this disruptive and unnecessary threat of strike action," Heathrow said in the statement. “We regret that passengers have been inconvenienced by this." The threat of travel upheaval at Heathrow adds to risks at British Airways, where a separate dispute over pay between management and pilots may also lead to strikes. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SHIPBUILDING
Yard that built Titanic in danger of sinking
The Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic has called in administrators after last-ditch efforts failed to rescue a company that had once typified Britain's industrial might. Harland and Wolff appointed BDO as administrators after its Norwegian parent company, Dolphin Drilling, failed to find a buyer, union officials said. An insolvency hearing is set for Tuesday. The shipyard was best known for constructing the doomed White Star liner, Titanic, which sank on its maiden trans-Atlantic voyage in 1912 after striking an iceberg. But the firm was one of the UK's key industrial producers during World War II, building some 150 ships. Its massive yellow cranes, Samson and Goliath, are considered landmarks of Belfast — a point of pride. It once boasted a workforce of 30,000, but now employs only about 125, though it supported hundreds of other jobs in its supply chain. Workers vowed to occupy the shipyard until heavy industry and shipbuilding could be secured, but the government so far has declined to intervene. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
BANKING
HSBC chief executive resigns after just 18 months
HSBC's chief executive, John Flint, is stepping down after 18 months in the role, a surprise announcement that the bank said Monday was “by mutual agreement with the board." Noel Quinn, the bank's chief executive for commercial banking, will fill the top job on an interim basis while the bank begins a global job search. Flint resigned on the same day that HSBC, Europe's largest bank by assets, reported what several analysts described as solid results. Profit after tax for the first half of 2019 rose 18.1 percent to $9.9 billion, while revenue was up 7.6 percent to $29.4 billion. But the bank also announced job cuts amounting to nearly 2 percent of its global workforce of close to 238,000. One analyst, Benjamin Toms at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank, cited “geopolitical uncertainty" as affecting the bank's global business. HSBC, with headquarters in London, appears to be preparing for a more challenging environment as the trade wars between the United States and China cast shadows over its critical Asia businesses, and Brexit remains unresolved. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Senators want Google to offer temp workers staff jobs
A group of Democratic senators has demanded in a letter sent to Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, that the Internet giant convert its more than 120,000 temporary and contract workers to full-time employees. The letter, written by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also urged Google to stop its “anti-worker practices" and treat everyone at the company equally. Among the 10 senators who signed were three running for president: Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. As of March, Google had more temporary workers than full-time employees — 121,000 temps and contractors and 102,000 full-timers, according to company data viewed by The New York Times. The senators pushed for a number of changes to how the company treats temps and contractors, including moving them to full-time status after six months as well as equalizing their wages and benefits with permanent staff. While many of the temps and contractors sit in the same offices as Google employees and often do similar work, they usually make less money, have worse benefit plans, and do not enjoy the same rights. — NEW YORK TIMES

What's on TV
WOODSTOCK: THREE DAYS THAT DEFINED A GENERATION (2019) 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings.) The Woodstock Music festival turns 50 next week. Although the anniversary concert has been canceled, both would-be attendees and those who planned to stay home can experience the original vicariously through the subjects in this documentary. Unlike Michael Wadleigh's 1970 concert film -- the definitive movie about Woodstock -- this film by Barak Goodman and Jamila Ephron centers on the 400,000 people who descended on a dairy farm in upstate New York in the name of "peace and love," despite poor weather and a lack of infrastructure (including plumbing). Writing in his review for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny said the movie "uses the perspective of nearly 50 years' hindsight to demonstrate anew how the festival was both a mess and a miracle, and implicitly argues that it was a good deal more miracle than mess."
THE 100 9 p.m. on CW. The Season 6 finale of this post-apocalyptic drama series sees the believers and nonbelievers go head-to-head in the lunar city-state of Sanctum, while the mystery of the anomaly grows ever more elusive. Jason Rothenberg, the show's creator, announced on Sunday that the seventh season will be the last. And, coincidentally, the series finale will be the 100th episode.
BLOOD & TREASURE 10 p.m. on CBS. Last week, Danny (Matt Barr) and Lexi (Sofia Pernas) -- the team hunting down a terrorist in this espionage series -- learned the dirty truth about Reece (John Larroquette). But whether that will help them stop Farouk (Oded Fehr) before he puts his plan into action in this season finale remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: With the show's renewal for a second season, viewers can expect the intrigues to continue. .
DRUNK HISTORY 10 p.m. on Comedy Central. In this comedy sketch show's sixth season finale, the comic Jackie Johnson drunkenly narrates the story of Mary Mallon (Betsy Sodaro), also known as Typhoid Mary, an Irish cook who worked in New York and caused multiple outbreaks of typhoid fever in the early 1900s. In the second half of the show, the narrator, the inebriated actress Lyric Lewis, recounts the life of Arsinoe IV, Cleopatra's younger sister, who briefly tasted power before her tragic end.
What's Streaming
PLUS ONE (2019) Stream on Hulu. Wedding season is upon us, which makes this indie romance a fitting watch. Maya Erskine ("PEN15") and Jack Quaid (whose mother is the romantic-comedy god Meg Ryan) play two single friends who agree to be each other's dates to 10 weddings over a single summer. She's recovering from a nasty breakup; he's obsessed with finding the perfect match. It's clear from the outset that they will inevitably land in each other's arms. Yet despite the predictability, the film thrives on the stars' palpable chemistry and Erskine's comedic talent.

THE WORLD WILL STILL THIRST FOR FOSSIL FUELS IN 2040: Fossil fuels will still provide the vast majority of the world’s energy in 2040, according to new projections released by consultancy Wood Mackenzie, leaving the planet far short of the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
“The energy mix is not changing nearly as quickly as the world needs it to,” Wood Mackenzie president Neal Anderson wrote in an op-ed accompanying the report, released Friday.
The report, based on a “conservative” scenario, said coal, oil, and gas will provide 85% of the world’s primary energy supply by 2040.
The forecast illustrates the scale of the ambition in Democratic presidential candidates’ plans for the U.S. economy to reach net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050, phase out the use of fossil fuels, and expand investments into renewable sources. The U.S. emits about 15% of the world’s carbon pollution.
It also comes after United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned countries last week ahead of a major Climate Action Summit in New York on Sept. 23 that they must increase their targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions in order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.
Far away from goals: The report says despite “rapid technological advancement across a variety of industries,” the energy mix is changing “only gradually” and the world “risks relying on fossil fuels for decades to come.”
It said zero-carbon sources need to account for 40% of the world’s energy by 2040 — compared to 15% projected by the report — in order to limit temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius, the target of the Paris agreement.
The planet has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius. Under the current pace, the world temperature would rise above 3 degrees Celsius, Wood Mackenzie said.
Carbon emissions worldwide will continue to rise into the 2020s, with growth slowing only in the 2030s, as global energy demand increases from 13 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 2018 to 16 billion in 2040.
Policy, political, and technological hurdles: Industry, aviation, shipping, heating, and agriculture all lack the technology required to decarbonize them, Wood Mackenzie said.
The more high-profile power and transportation sectors have more ready means for decarbonization, with falling wind and solar costs for electricity, improvements in battery storage technology, and expected growth in electric vehicle use. Yet despite those developments, Wood Mackenzie projects wind and solar to contribute just 24% of the world’s power supply by 2040 compared with 7% today. It says 50% of renewable power will be hard to reach without long-duration energy storage, which does not exist yet.
Wood Mackenzie also flags policy concerns, with carbon pricing remaining unpopular across much of the major energy consuming countries and insufficient investment in tax subsidies and research and development into clean energy technologies.
The consultancy group cites troubling political hurdles as well, including the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration against China, and rising populist and protectionist agendas in the U.S. and across Europe.
“I see that as at odds with the collaborative, can-do spirit that emerged from Paris at the end of 2015,” Anderson said.

DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS GENERAL SUE TRUMP FOR WEAKENING PENALTIES ON AUTOMAKERS FOR BREAKING FUEL RULES: A coalition of 12 Democratic state attorneys general sued the Trump administration Friday for suspending an Obama-era rule that would have increased penalties on automakers that fail to meet federal fuel efficiency standards.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on July 12 finalized its repeal of a rule adopted under the Obama administration that imposed an inflation-adjusted penalty of $14 for every tenth of a mile-per-gallon that an automaker consumers in excess of the federal fuel rules, known as corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE).
NHTSA’s replacement rule would reduce the penalty for automakers violating standards to $5.50 per tenth of an mpg. The attorneys general, who sued in U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, said the Trump administration is failing to follow the intent of a law passed by Congress, which mandated that public agencies update their civil penalties to account for inflation.
“This rule is just another misguided and reckless attempt by the Trump Administration to roll back the clock on our clean air standards, which is why we will stand up and fight to protect the health and well-being of New Yorkers and every person living in this country,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was among attorneys general from a dozen states and Washington, D.C. filing the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes as the Trump administration is preparing to finalize a weakening of Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks for model years 2020 through 2026, a move that Democratic states have also vowed to challenge in court.
TRUMP’S ROLLBACK OF CLEAN CAR RULES GOES TO OMB FOR REVIEW: The Environmental Protection Agency and NHTSA on Monday submitted its final rule to rollback fuel efficiency standards to the Office of Management and Budget for review.
The move is the last step before the final rule is made public.
The Trump administration has indicated it plans to weaken the strict Obama-era rules despite protests from leading automakers, including some that recently struck a deal with California to continue to produce more fuel-efficient cars in an act of defiance.
“EPA and NHTSA firmly believe that this rule will benefit all Americans by improving the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, reducing air pollution, helping make new vehicles more affordable for all Americans, and, because new vehicles are safer than ever, ultimately saving thousands of lives and reducing the number of Americans seriously injured in car crashes,” said EPA spokesman Michael Abboud and Transportation Department spokesman Andy Post, in a statement provided to me.
EPA NAMES FORMER OIL AND GAS EXECUTIVE AS REGION 6 ADMINISTRATOR: The EPA on Monday named former oil and gas executive Ken McQueen as administrator for Region 6 — the agency’s local office covering Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and 66 Tribal Nations.
McQueen was most recently New Mexico's energy and natural resources secretary from 2016 to 2018, where he worked to “streamline rules and regulations,” according to EPA.
Prior to that, McQueen was the long-time vice president of oil and gas giant WPX Energy. McQueen has previously questioned the consensus of human-caused climate change.
“Ken’s experience in public service and familiarity with natural resource issues make him an excellent choice to lead the Region 6 office,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.
DEMOCRAT JOHN LARSON INTRODUCES CARBON TAX BILL FUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS: Democratic Representative John Larson of Connecticut added to a slew of recent carbon tax bills on Friday, introducing legislation that would spend most of the tax’s revenue on infrastructure investments.
Larson’s “American Wins Act” would impose a $52 per ton carbon tax, rising 6% annually above inflation and generating $2.3 trillion over 10 years. It dedicates more than half the revenue to infrastructure spending, including for traditional projects like roads and bridges, and also supporting “green” projects such as levees and energy efficiency.
The rest of the revenue would fund a hybrid of things, including clean energy research and development, health and pension benefits for people living in fossil-fuel dependent communities, and on rebates for low-income households to help pay for higher energy costs from the carbon tax.
Larson projects the bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions 52% in 10 years, “laying the groundwork” for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
“The America Wins Act would reduce greenhouse gas emissions above and beyond our Paris Climate Accords commitments, while funding historic investments in rebuilding America’s infrastructure and combating climate change,” Larson said.
Larson’s legislation is among a handful of carbon tax bills introduced over recent weeks, including bipartisan proposals by Republican Francis Rooney of Florida and Dan Lipinski of Illinois that would use most of the revenue to cut payroll taxes.
Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy has published a helpful primer comparing the various carbon tax bills, and showing how they would allocate revenue.
IRAN SEIZES ANOTHER OIL TANKER IN PERSIAN GULF: Iran seized another oil tanker in the Persian Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz, according to state media, adding to tensions in the vital throughway for world oil.
The seizure, reported Sunday, is the third time Iran has claimed to detain a tanker in the last month, as Tehran as lashed out at the Trump administration’s sanctions on its oil exports.
Iran says the oil tanker belonged to Iraq, and accused the ship of “smuggling” fuel to Arab states, without providing evidence, according to the New York Times.
The U.S has increased military patrols in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, and is working to assemble an international coalition to help maintain security there.
Iran has repeatedly threatened to blockade the Strait of Hormuz — through which a third of the world’s seaborne oil is transported — in retaliation for U.S. sanctions.
LAID-OFF MINERS PROTEST MINING COMPANY FOR BACKPAY: Laid-off coal miners in Kentucky continue to protest against the mining company Blackjewel for suddenly shutting down mines after the company filed for bankruptcy.
The miners for the past week have been blocking a Blackjewel train car filled with coal, demanding weeks of backpay from the company, according to the Courier Journal.
Dozens of miners are traveling to a federal bankruptcy court hearing Monday in Charleston, West Virginia, where a judge will decide whether to approve the sale of Blackjewel’s assets, the newspaper reported.
The sudden collapse of Blackjewel, the nation’s sixth largest coal mining company, affected about 1,700 employees across Kentucky, Wyoming, Virginia, and West Virginia.
The mine closures came without warning, leading to bounced paychecks for miners.
Democrats pitch plans to help coal workers: Democrats running for president expressed solidarity with the miners, saying the mine closures show the importance of helping fossil-fuel-dependent communities as they transition to cleaner sources of energy.
“As we transition to a clean energy system we cannot abandon communities that have been dependent on coal and other fossil fuels,” said Bernie Sanders in a Twitter post Friday. “I stand in solidarity with the Blackjewel miners. I say to Blackjewel: Pay your workers now.”
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also criticized Blackjewel, calling the company’s treatment of miners “shameful and outrageous,” and urging for it to “be held accountable for horrific management.”

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

Epstein’s Weird Eugenics Pursuit

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual - the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last week, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist - and now accused sex trafficker - is also a “transhumanist,” who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named “Zorro.”
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: “So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?”
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an “intellectual imposter.” Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been “voted off the island” and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean - which he dubs “Little St. Jeff’s” - is of renewed interest thanks to a recent NBC News report. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell - with further punishment perhaps to come - and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration, his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

For elite D.C. school, slaves were a business

Texto completo: Nuns' deals helped build Georgetown Visitation
The cash-strapped nuns were desperate to sell their slaves.
It was the 1820s, and debt was piling up for Mother Agnes Brent, superior of the Georgetown Visitation Convent in Washington. The convent had broken ground on a new chapel, with stunningly poor timing - a few months after the country slumped into an economic collapse spurred by the Panic of 1819.
To fully fund the chapel's construction, Brent needed money. Fast. Then came an unexpected boon: Relatives of two sisters had four spare slaves, two adults and two children, and offered them as a "gift" to Georgetown Visitation.
Still, Brent wanted to know: Did the mother have to come along with the children? And if she did, would the relatives please pay for her costlier room and board until she was sold?
"If they are so young that they cannot be separated from the mother & the mother be given also, then we would have to request you to get a place for them, free of expense," Brent wrote in a letter.
Missives like these, documented in a report compiled by a school archivist and historian, have shattered the long-cherished image of the three nuns who founded Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in 1799. The research has plunged the prestigious D.C. private high school, one of the oldest Roman Catholic girls educational institutions in the nation, into a year-long reckoning with a past that was far more entangled with the nation's slave trade than students and staff had ever suspected.
It was common knowledge that the founding nuns owned slaves, but school lore has held that the sisters allowed enslaved children to attend Saturday school and defied the law by teaching them how to read. The 65-page report, which the school has made available online, details the businesslike efficiency with which the nuns sold scores of enslaved people to pay off debts and fund new buildings.
Georgetown Visitation sisters owned at least 107 enslaved people, including men, women and children, from a year after its founding until 1862, when the federal government made slavery illegal in the District, the report found.
"It's hard history to read, and that's the reality of it," said Caroline Handorf, the director of communications for Georgetown Visitation. "But you can't move forward unless you understand where you're coming from."
Handorf said the report, inspired in part by a similar effort at Georgetown University to come to terms with its slaveholding past, has prompted "really powerful and difficult conversations" on campus. The school held several discussions for students, faculty members, staff and alumnae after the report's release, as well as two prayer services honoring the enslaved people. It also incorporated the report into the curriculum of AP U.S. history classes.
Ne'Miya McKnight, 16, a rising junior at Georgetown Visitation, said the school buzzed about the news for a week or so after the report's release, but she thought that white students were more shocked than nonwhite students. McKnight, who is African American, said she and her friends, many of whom are black, "were not that struck" by the fact that her school was built through slave labor.
"Slaves built a lot of D.C. - all over the U.S., but D.C. especially," she said. "We were glad, though, that Visitation was focusing on this history of having enslaved people on campus - not tapping into that energy, exactly, but just acknowledging it."
Susan Nalezyty, a Georgetown University historian who serves as school archivist, said she found no evidence that the sisters at Visitation had ever held school for their slaves or taught them to read. Nalezyty, who was not available for an interview, wrote that the convent was instead "deeply typical of its time and place," meaning the sisters bought and sold human beings with impunity.
Previous histories of the school did not include the exact number of enslaved people the sisters owned or the fact that the nuns made a profit by selling human beings.
"Georgetown Visitation subsidized its mission by the forced labor and the sale of enslaved people," the report concludes. " . . . This new research enriches Visitation's already-known history and corrects long-held traditions that were not based on primary sources."
News of the research and its findings was published Friday by New York University professor Rachel Swarns in an opinion piece for the New York Times. The Catholic Standard ran a story about the report in November.
Joseph Mannard, an Indiana University of Pennsylvania professor who has written about American nuns' ties to slavery, said many historians of Catholicism would be unsurprised by slaveholding nuns.
The earliest convents in America were in the South, he said, and nuns spread across the continent from there. Sisters were steeped in - and largely accepted - Southern culture, practices and beliefs, including chattel slavery, according to Mannard. What happened at Georgetown Visitation was the norm.
"The nuns were slaveholders in much the same way other slaveholders were, and they didn't feel guilt, I don't think," Mannard said. "I'm not even sure they thought a lot about it."
According to Nalezyty's research, Georgetown Visitation nuns thought about their slaves when they feared for the convent's bottom line. Though the nuns occasionally took steps to keep families together, the documents otherwise reveal scant concern for the human beings whose sale often kept the convent afloat.
The number of enslaved people at Georgetown Visitation varied from year to year, dipping as low as three in 1840 and as high as 17 a decade later. Between 1819 and 1827, four new convent and school buildings sprung up in what the report calls an "extraordinary" expansion unprecedented in Visitation history - and about 25 slaves were sold to fund them. While remaining on campus, slaves lived "next to the chicken coop and stables," according to the report; today, the site is a parking lot.
The nuns maneuvered fiercely to receive full payment for every enslaved person they sold. At one point, the sisters filed at least six separate lawsuits at the same time in a bid to recoup tardy fees.
Another time, a Visitation sister complained that the 10 percent commission fee for a Maryland slave seller they had hired was "by far too much." The seller responded by arguing that the larger fee allowed him to protect slaves by waiting to find a buyer whose morals he could stomach.
"As for other people offering to do it for 5 or less . . . I could do it too had I no conscience," he said. "The extra trouble I take in selling your negroes [is] worth the 10 per cent."
The public is just now learning about nuns' slaveholding practices because of a recently heightened national focus on race, Mannard said.
Anthony Bogues, a professor at Brown University who studies the history and consequences of slavery, said American society is caught between countervailing forces: an increase in overt racism, including recent racist tweets from President Trump, on the one side, and greater efforts to come to terms with the nation's history of racism and legacy of slavery on the other.
"I think we are at a moment that's really contradictory," Bogues said. "First, there's the main discourse coming from government officials, which is rooted in anti-black racism. Then you have these institutions, like Georgetown University, that are trying to understand their difficult past."
Georgetown Visitation wanted to join what many see as a national trend of introspection, according to Handorf.
"We as a nation were doing that, were grappling with this history, and we as a school, as a monastery, decided we need to look into our own history as well," Handorf said.
McKnight does not need to look far.
She thinks about the report, which came out when she was a freshman, almost every day at school, she said. It rises to mind when she observes a sea of white faces in class or when she glances at old photos of mostly white graduating students.
Sometimes, McKnight's friends are upset by the fact that, "if we lived during that time, instead of being friends with the nuns, we'd be working for them," she said.
McKnight, though, focuses on feeling proud that her ancestors' hands built Georgetown Visitation.
"Because, if you look at it, what's better: you being the only black girl in that classroom?" she asked. "Or there being no black girls in that classroom?"

Texto completo: Nuns' deals helped build Georgetown Visitation
The cash-strapped nuns were desperate to sell their slaves.
It was the 1820s, and debt was piling up for Mother Agnes Brent, superior of the Georgetown Visitation Convent in Washington. The convent had broken ground on a new chapel, with stunningly poor timing - a few months after the country slumped into an economic collapse spurred by the Panic of 1819.
To fully fund the chapel's construction, Brent needed money. Fast. Then came an unexpected boon: Relatives of two sisters had four spare slaves, two adults and two children, and offered them as a "gift" to Georgetown Visitation.
Still, Brent wanted to know: Did the mother have to come along with the children? And if she did, would the relatives please pay for her costlier room and board until she was sold?
"If they are so young that they cannot be separated from the mother & the mother be given also, then we would have to request you to get a place for them, free of expense," Brent wrote in a letter.
Missives like these, documented in a report compiled by a school archivist and historian, have shattered the long-cherished image of the three nuns who founded Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in 1799. The research has plunged the prestigious D.C. private high school, one of the oldest Roman Catholic girls educational institutions in the nation, into a year-long reckoning with a past that was far more entangled with the nation's slave trade than students and staff had ever suspected.
It was common knowledge that the founding nuns owned slaves, but school lore has held that the sisters allowed enslaved children to attend Saturday school and defied the law by teaching them how to read. The 65-page report, which the school has made available online, details the businesslike efficiency with which the nuns sold scores of enslaved people to pay off debts and fund new buildings.
Georgetown Visitation sisters owned at least 107 enslaved people, including men, women and children, from a year after its founding until 1862, when the federal government made slavery illegal in the District, the report found.
"It's hard history to read, and that's the reality of it," said Caroline Handorf, the director of communications for Georgetown Visitation. "But you can't move forward unless you understand where you're coming from."
Handorf said the report, inspired in part by a similar effort at Georgetown University to come to terms with its slaveholding past, has prompted "really powerful and difficult conversations" on campus. The school held several discussions for students, faculty members, staff and alumnae after the report's release, as well as two prayer services honoring the enslaved people. It also incorporated the report into the curriculum of AP U.S. history classes.
Ne'Miya McKnight, 16, a rising junior at Georgetown Visitation, said the school buzzed about the news for a week or so after the report's release, but she thought that white students were more shocked than nonwhite students. McKnight, who is African American, said she and her friends, many of whom are black, "were not that struck" by the fact that her school was built through slave labor.
"Slaves built a lot of D.C. - all over the U.S., but D.C. especially," she said. "We were glad, though, that Visitation was focusing on this history of having enslaved people on campus - not tapping into that energy, exactly, but just acknowledging it."
Susan Nalezyty, a Georgetown University historian who serves as school archivist, said she found no evidence that the sisters at Visitation had ever held school for their slaves or taught them to read. Nalezyty, who was not available for an interview, wrote that the convent was instead "deeply typical of its time and place," meaning the sisters bought and sold human beings with impunity.
Previous histories of the school did not include the exact number of enslaved people the sisters owned or the fact that the nuns made a profit by selling human beings.
"Georgetown Visitation subsidized its mission by the forced labor and the sale of enslaved people," the report concludes. " . . . This new research enriches Visitation's already-known history and corrects long-held traditions that were not based on primary sources."
News of the research and its findings was published Friday by New York University professor Rachel Swarns in an opinion piece for the New York Times. The Catholic Standard ran a story about the report in November.
Joseph Mannard, an Indiana University of Pennsylvania professor who has written about American nuns' ties to slavery, said many historians of Catholicism would be unsurprised by slaveholding nuns.
The earliest convents in America were in the South, he said, and nuns spread across the continent from there. Sisters were steeped in - and largely accepted - Southern culture, practices and beliefs, including chattel slavery, according to Mannard. What happened at Georgetown Visitation was the norm.
"The nuns were slaveholders in much the same way other slaveholders were, and they didn't feel guilt, I don't think," Mannard said. "I'm not even sure they thought a lot about it."
According to Nalezyty's research, Georgetown Visitation nuns thought about their slaves when they feared for the convent's bottom line. Though the nuns occasionally took steps to keep families together, the documents otherwise reveal scant concern for the human beings whose sale often kept the convent afloat.
The number of enslaved people at Georgetown Visitation varied from year to year, dipping as low as three in 1840 and as high as 17 a decade later. Between 1819 and 1827, four new convent and school buildings sprung up in what the report calls an "extraordinary" expansion unprecedented in Visitation history - and about 25 slaves were sold to fund them. While remaining on campus, slaves lived "next to the chicken coop and stables," according to the report; today, the site is a parking lot.
The nuns maneuvered fiercely to receive full payment for every enslaved person they sold. At one point, the sisters filed at least six separate lawsuits at the same time in a bid to recoup tardy fees.
Another time, a Visitation sister complained that the 10 percent commission fee for a Maryland slave seller they had hired was "by far too much." The seller responded by arguing that the larger fee allowed him to protect slaves by waiting to find a buyer whose morals he could stomach.
"As for other people offering to do it for 5 or less . . . I could do it too had I no conscience," he said. "The extra trouble I take in selling your negroes [is] worth the 10 per cent."
The public is just now learning about nuns' slaveholding practices because of a recently heightened national focus on race, Mannard said.
Anthony Bogues, a professor at Brown University who studies the history and consequences of slavery, said American society is caught between countervailing forces: an increase in overt racism, including recent racist tweets from President Trump, on the one side, and greater efforts to come to terms with the nation's history of racism and legacy of slavery on the other.
"I think we are at a moment that's really contradictory," Bogues said. "First, there's the main discourse coming from government officials, which is rooted in anti-black racism. Then you have these institutions, like Georgetown University, that are trying to understand their difficult past."
Georgetown Visitation wanted to join what many see as a national trend of introspection, according to Handorf.
"We as a nation were doing that, were grappling with this history, and we as a school, as a monastery, decided we need to look into our own history as well," Handorf said.
McKnight does not need to look far.
She thinks about the report, which came out when she was a freshman, almost every day at school, she said. It rises to mind when she observes a sea of white faces in class or when she glances at old photos of mostly white graduating students.
Sometimes, McKnight's friends are upset by the fact that, "if we lived during that time, instead of being friends with the nuns, we'd be working for them," she said.
McKnight, though, focuses on feeling proud that her ancestors' hands built Georgetown Visitation.
"Because, if you look at it, what's better: you being the only black girl in that classroom?" she asked. "Or there being no black girls in that classroom?"

Even kids, 11, in NYPD photo files

Texto completo: Mug shots of kids as young as 11 are now part of the NYPD's facial recognition database, a disclosure that raised concerns that police are enacting policy without transparency and using a technology that has been called into question in other cities.
The NYPD for about four years has used facial recognition technology to link juvenile mug shots to images at crime scenes, according to a report by the New York Times. Most of the photos are of teens 13 to 16 years old, but kids as young as 11 are part of the database. New York state allows mug shots of suspects who are that young and have been charged with the most serious felonies.
The NYPD says it has in place careful guidelines for using facial recognition, and a "hit" off a database search is just a lead and does not automatically trigger that person's arrest.
"No one has ever been arrested based solely on a positive facial recognition match," said Assistant Commissioner Devora Kaye, an NYPD spokeswoman. "It is merely a lead, not probable cause. We are comfortable with this technology because it has proven to be a valuable investigative method."
Police also said a kid mug shot is kept only if the suspect is classified a juvenile delinquent and the case ends with a felony conviction.
But the use of facial recognition by police departments is a controversial topic that has raised concerns about government abuse, and some studies have shown that the algorithms used in the technology struggle to recognize the faces of people with darker skin. San Francisco and Oakland are among several U.S. cities that have banned it.
City Councilman Donovan Richards (D-Queens), who heads the Public Safety Committee, said technology is an important asset in a city long-considered the top terror target in the world. But using it on kids, he said, is not only "very troubling," it could hurt the department's signature initiative - improving community relations as it tries to drive crime down further.

Texto completo: Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator struggling to gain footing in the 24-person Democratic presidential field, scored what most candidates dream of in a crowded, nationally televised debate: a viral soundbite.
During Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate, CNN's Dana Bash asked Gillibrand about her support for Green New Deal legislation and whether its job-security promises are realistic.
But first, Gillibrand shoehorned in a laugh line that served as a dig at President Donald Trump.
"So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said.
The partisan crowd at Detroit's Fox Theatre erupted in laughter and applause. Gillibrand began trending on Twitter, where thousands of people tweeted the line. Outlets like The New York Times and Marie Claire suggested it was the quote of the night.
Gillibrand had been using the line for weeks For those closely following Gillibrand's campaign, the line wasn't a surprise.
Gillibrand had been using the Clorox quote on the campaign trail for weeks. And it's easy to understand why: It's been a reliable hit among her supporters and those who come out to hear her speak.
Take her talk at the National Urban League Conference in Indianapolis last Friday, when a moderator asked how she would stop the "antics" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"On the first day that I become president, after I Clorox the Oval Office" —the crowd guffawed and the moderator chuckled — "which as a mother, I would do," Gillibrand said, "the second thing I will do is restore our moral leadership on the world stage."
In a small gathering in New Hampshire early last month, a voter asked Gillibrand how she would repair the United States' reputation in the eyes of world leaders.
"So, after I Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand started in response, according to a video from New York Now, a weekly television show.
Again, it got big laughs.
At a Mic town hall in Manhattan on July 22, Gillibrand worked in her reliable line after a question on the Green New Deal, much like she did during the debate.
That time, it only got a few chuckles.
Roots of Clorox line date back months Gillibrand's Clorox line has roots going back at least to February, about a month after she launched an exploratory committee for a presidential run.
At a small gathering Feb. 17 in Keene, New Hampshire, an attendee asked Gillibrand what her first act in the Oval Office would be "after fumigating the White House, of course."
The crowd laughed at the woman's joke before Gillibrand responded, according to a video posted by The Hill. "Yeah, I was thinking Clorox wipes myself," Gillibrand said to laughs. "I'm a mother. They clean all the handles."
Spokespeople for The Clorox Co. did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday morning.

THE NATION; Justice Dept. will not prosecute Comey; Inspector general had referred the potential mishandling of memos to U.S. prosecutors.

Texto completo: The Justice Department has declined to prosecute former FBI Director James B. Comey for mishandling confidential memos he wrote documenting his interactions with President Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Prosecutors were acting on a referral from the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, whose office has been investigating the genesis of the federal inquiry into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. The disclosure of Comey's memos after he was fired in May 2017 spurred then-Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein to appoint Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.
Horowitz looked at allegations that Comey had mishandled classified information when he showed a copy of a memo to a longtime friend, Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor.

Prosecutors determined that the allegations were too weak to take to court, according to the person familiar with the decision.
One question concerned whether Comey was aware that some sentences in the memos included classified material. Security officials determined that two of the memos had the lowest level of classified material in them, but the determination to designate them as "confidential" came only after Comey had disclosed their contents. Comey testified before Congress that he wrote the memos in a way to ensure they did not contain classified information.
Comey wrote seven memos about his interactions with Trump. They started with his briefing of the president-elect at Trump Tower on Jan. 6, 2017, about the contents of a controversial and salacious dossier by a former British spy about Russia's meddling in the election and its dealings with the business mogul.
The former FBI director said he wrote the memos after interactions with Trump because he knew he "would need a record of what had happened, not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI."
"It was a combination of circumstances, subject matter and the particular person," Comey told Congress in June 2017.
Comey testified he kept the memos in a safe at his home and showed one to Richman so he could describe its contents to a New York Times reporter. The resulting article documented how Comey believed that Trump had tried to improperly pressure him in the Oval Office to drop an investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn.
"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go," Trump told Comey, according to the memo.
"I thought [the disclosure of the memo and its contents] might prompt the appointment of a special counsel," Comey testified.
Richman, who represents Comey, declined to comment on the decision not to prosecute the former FBI chief. "We strongly suggest you wait for the [inspector general's] final report," Richman wrote in an email.
Trump has denied he pressured Comey to go easy on Flynn, who later pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents and cooperated with Mueller's investigation. Trump has repeatedly blasted Comey and other FBI officials for being out to get him and undermine his presidency.
The president has also pushed the Justice Department to investigate agents and prosecutors who led the initial investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin to tilt the election.
In addition to Horowitz's investigation, Atty. Gen. William Barr has launched an internal review of how the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence community handled the Russia inquiry.
Mueller's team concluded that Russia had sought to interfere in the election in Trump's favor but did not establish a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow. It found numerous instances in which Trump sought to interfere in the special counsel's probe. Barr ultimately cleared Trump of obstructing justice, however, saying the president's actions had been justified by his frustrations.
Horowitz, the Justice Department's top internal watchdog, is expected to issue his findings on how the FBI and Justice Department handled the Russia investigation in coming months.

Texto completo: Ready, set, fest! Today we announced the program and speakers for the 2019 Texas Tribune Festival — Sept. 26-28 in downtown Austin. It’s our ninth annual ideas weekend, our biggest by a mile and absolutely our most ambitious yet.
How big? We have more than 420 participants in panel discussions and one-on-one interviews. (A taste: Ted Cruz, Julián Castro, Amy Klobuchar, Susan Rice, Michael Beschloss, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Chip Roy, Cecile Richards, William McRaven, Betsy Price, Piper Kerman, Anthony Scaramucci, Nate Silver, George Will, Wendy Davis, Will Hurd, Sylvia Garcia, Mike Morath, Samantha Power and George P. Bush.) We have more than 120 hourlong sessions across a mix of indoor and outdoor venues over three carefully and enthusiastically curated days. On both counts, these are massive increases over last year, which had been our biggest fest year to date.
How ambitious? Programing that runs the gamut from education to health care, immigration to criminal justice, the economy to the environment, energy to transportation. A look back at the 86th Texas Legislature. A look ahead to the 2020 election cycle, including and especially the presidential campaign. An entire swath of the schedule devoted to the future of rural Texas and another devoted to the future of urban Texas. Discussions of national and global importance on everything from homeland security and the T-boning of technology and democracy to the role, responsibility and sustainability of the press. Podcasts — lots and lots of podcasts — recorded before what we know will be rapt audiences.
And — once again, and with even more sweep and gusto than ever before — an array of media, academic and nonprofit partnerships that resulted in truly transformational programming. Among our collaborators this year: The New York Times, The Washington Post, TIME, Lawfare, Chalkbeat, the Urban Lab at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. We are particularly excited to welcome our dear old friends at POLITICO, the University of Texas, Texas 2036 and Texas Monthly to Congress Avenue for our free Open Congress activation. Yes, free. You won’t have to pay a penny to see the game-changing conversations and compelling personalities from the worlds of politics and policy inside their branded tents.
Of course, we’d rather you pay! By registering for the Tribune Festival, you support The Texas Tribune’s public service mission: to provide the kind of robust reporting, data and events that make Texas better by making Texans more informed and more engaged. We’ve been at this for going on 10 years now. We know that events like the Tribune Festival are a big part of our ability to bring millions of our neighbors into a persistent conversation about our shared priorities, and we can’t do it without you.
To sign up — and to see all the amazing things we have planned — go to festival.texastribune.org. Can’t wait to see you in a few weeks.

Epstein wanted to seed humanity with his genes

Resumen: Ninguno disponible.

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein, the jet-setting financier and accused child sex trafficker, used his wealth to woo scientists and promote fringe pseudoscience.
That included dabbling in eugenics, including a proposal to impregnate twenty women at a time at his 33,000-square-foot New Mexico ranch to "seed" humanity with his DNA, according to a report from the New York Times.

For years, Epstein openly discussed his idea to impregnate women with his sperm to father dozens of children and pushed other ideas linked to eugenics, including the perfection of the human genome and the creation of superior humans.

Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard professor who defended Epstein and helped him secure a sweetheart plea deal in 2008, said that he was disturbed by Epstein’s interest in eugenics — a belief strongly associated with Nazi Germany — but continued to associate with Epstein. The bizarre businessman and convicted sex offender worked hard to associate himself with Harvard University, and he set up conferences and lunches and coffees at the university where many of these fringe ideas were discussed. At one such event, Epstein criticized endeavors to solve problems like poverty and starvation because he thought that would result in more impoverished children being born and would risk overpopulation.
Epstein used his massive wealth to make millions in donations to scientific charities and foundations and to host dinners and conferences with scientists at his homes and islands, and he managed to make inroads with a multitude of top scientists like theoretical physicist and author Stephen Hawking, evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, Nobel Prize award-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, molecular geneticist George Church, and more to discuss and pitch his half-baked ideas. One of the scientific outings put together by Epstein even included a trip on a chartered submarine.
Epstein, currently in a New York City jail after being denied bail while awaiting trial after a judge determined him to be a danger and a flight risk, was long fascinated with transhumanism, a fringe movement which believes that human evolution beyond its current physical and mental limitations can and should be spurred on through genetic engineering, robotics, technology, and artificial intelligence. Epstein sought to extend his own life and ensure the survival of his DNA in the future, showing an interest in cryonics, the unproven pseudoscientific idea where bodies would be frozen and then somehow revived. Epstein told people that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen.
Epstein’s apparent dabbling in pseudoscience and eugenics is just one more example in a laundry list of strange behavior from the accused sexual predator. Epstein, who used his fleet of planes to travel the globe with celebrities and politicians such as former President Bill Clinton over the years, used to brag to friends in the 1980s that he was an international bounty hunter working for the government or foreign dictators. And Epstein has claimed that he only took on billionaire clients, although only one — Victoria’s Secret founder Les Wexner — is known to actually exist. Epstein's friendships and connections also include President Trump — though the president insists they haven't spoken for over fifteen years — as well as the U.K.'s Prince Andrew and Israeli prime minister candidate Ehud Barak.

The 14-page indictment against Epstein unsealed last month alleges that Epstein “sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations” between 2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Epstein also has homes in the U.S. Virgin Islands and an apartment in Paris.

Prosecutors claim that Epstein enticed and recruited minor girls to engage in sex acts with him andwould then give the victims hundreds of dollars as payment. Some of the victims were as young as 14 at the time the alleged crimes occurred.
His home in New York City, reportedly filled with nude and other disturbing artwork, was raided by law enforcement following his arrest, and investigators found nude photographs of underage girls, thousands of dollars in cash, dozens of loose diamonds, and a foreign passport from the 1980s with Epstein’s picture and a false name.
The judge presiding over the case said Wednesday that Epstein’s trial likely won’t begin until June 2020 at the earliest.

Joe Biden is hiding, and it's working

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden’s current strategy to win the Democratic presidential nomination is obvious. Even as every newspaper columnist and TV talking head writhes in agony about how much “more” they want to see from him, Biden certainly knows that doesn't need them. He doesn't need the highly anticipated endorsement from Frank Bruni of the New York Times. He needs the support of Democratic primary voters.
But after Wednesday’s debate, Bruni complained that Biden “wasn’t the old Biden” that he hoped to see. “I so hoped and I so want to say otherwise, because I believe him to be a decent man,” wrote Bruni. “But there’s that way in which he trails off at the end of a sentence or an argument, all the little hiccups en route, the messy seams connecting one thought to the next, the demeanor that falls into a maddening gray area between engaged and fully animated.”
This is that thing where media pundits mistake their own needs and desires for what voters want, which are, more often than not, not the same things. As of Thursday morning, Biden is still polling nationally 15 points ahead of his nearest rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In Iowa, Biden is 8 points ahead. In New Hampshire, he’s 6 points ahead.
When he’s sitting on that kind of lead, he has absolutely no incentive to do a little song and dance for the media. And there is no upside to getting in a pissing match with any one of his Democratic opponents. To do that would only serve to elevate their status and earn them more attention. Why would Biden throw them that lifeline when he can simply watch them drown?
Biden’s strategy is working. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be the leading candidate. I’m tempted to say that the strategy won’t work throughout the entire primary, because you can only hide for so long, but when you look at the rest of the Democratic field, I’m guessing Biden feels pretty safe.
Sanders is about to leave the ground with how hard his arms are flapping. California Sen. Kamala Harris is getting it from both sides about her record as a law enforcer, if you can believe it. And the media have finally come to terms with the fact that Beto O’Rourke is a bore with no political talent or credible message.
Who does that leave on stage? The Whoville-esque mayor from South Bend, Indiana who can’t stop apologizing to black people, a bald former Maryland House member, and that psychic lady.
Biden, meanwhile, is saying very little. And give him this much: Most of it isn’t off-putting to Midwest voters or terrifying to small children.
Liberals in the media want a show from Biden, but at least for now, he’s doing better without it.

Texto completo: Los fiscales no han decidido, de momento, su próximo paso en el caso penal contra Juan Rodríguez, padre ex militar que encontró muertos a sus gemelos tras supuestamente dejarlos olvidados por ocho horas en su auto al irse a trabajar en un hospital en El Bronx (NYC), el viernes 26 de julio.
“Estamos hablando con la oficina del fiscal de distrito para transmitirles lo que creo que saben y entienden. Que fue una tragedia horrible y terrible “, dijo el abogado de Rodríguez, Joey Jackson.
Rodríguez compareció hoy en el tribunal penal de El Bronx para una breve audiencia en la que los fiscales le dijeron al juez que “no se ha tomado ninguna acción del gran jurado” en este momento, informó a New York Post la portavoz de la Fiscalía del Distrito, Patrice O’Shaughnessy.
“Todavía estamos investigando”, dijo.
Rodríguez, que está en libertad bajo fianza, sigue acusado de dos cargos de homicidio involuntario y dos cargos de homicidio por negligencia criminal en las muertes del 26 de julio de sus gemelos Luna y Phoenix de un año de edad.
Si se presenta el caso, un gran jurado finalmente podría decidir acusar al veterano de la guerra de Irak.
Su próxima cita en la corte es el 27 de agosto. Su esposa, Marissa A. Rodríguez, ha estado a su lado, afirmando que fue un “accidente” horrible.
“Mi cliente está desconsolado”, dijo Jackson. “Ciertamente comprende la gravedad de lo que ocurrió. Su familia comprende la gravedad de lo que ocurrió. Son fuertes, resistentes y superarán este momento difícil”.
Rodríguez (39) es un Trabajador Social Clínico con licencia y también un veterano del ejército que sirvió en Irak. En el hospital “James J. Peters VA” en Kingsbridge asiste a otros ex combatientes sin hogar y enfermos.
“¡Mis bebés están muertos! ¡Maté a mis bebés!”, gritó al descubrirlos muertos y con espuma en la boca en su automóvil .
Quedó en libertad tras pagar una fianza de $100 mil dólares, en un caso que ha impactado al país, pero que no es una excepción.
Médicos y autoridades han recordado que desde 1998 alrededor de 440 menores en todo el país han muerto de golpes de calor después de ser olvidados en automóviles, generalmente no por falta de amor, sino por cómo funciona la memoria humana, según el doctor David Diamond, profesor de psicología en Florida a quien Rodríguez ha consultado tratando de explicar lo sucedido, según The New York Times.
No criminal case at this time against Juan Rodriguez, the father involved in twins' hot car death in the Bronx. He'll be back in court at the end of the month. https://t.co/YMAXUGIyQA

The author, known for his role as Kurt Hummel in the Fox musical show "Glee," has captured a huge fan following from his best-selling middle-grade series. "A Tale of Magic" will be a sequel to that series.
"A Tale of Magic" (Little, Brown and Co., 496 pp.), out Oct. 1, is special for a variety of reasons.
The tale follows 14-year-old Brystal Evergreen, as she tries to survive the oppressive Southern Kingdom where it is illegal for women to read books. While working as a maid at her local library and having to sneak out titles, she discovers a secret section with a book about magic, which is also outlawed throughout the world, leading her down a complicated path.
The book, which tackles powerful issues, was more difficult to write than Colfer imagined.
"At its core, 'Tale of Magic' is a story about overcoming prejudice and oppression and more than anything I hope it inspires and encourages anyone out there who is fighting their own battles of injustice or inequality," he told USA TODAY.
"When I first started, I was not expecting it to be as difficult as it was, but the world changed so significantly since I agreed to do it, to when I started writing it… I knew I had to tell a story that I thought would help kids and families out there who are having a difficult time with the times we live in," he continued.
Colfer is embarking on a tour for the book, he shared exclusively with USA TODAY. But unlike Colfer's previous book tours for "Stories," which transformed into auditorium-sized events with costume contests, readings and games, the format for his new tale will be much more traditional, beginning with the tour's first stop in New York City on the day of the book's release.
"Since this is a brand-new series I'm going to be doing a traditional book signing this time around," Colfer revealed.
"As soon as the readers are familiar with the new story, the new characters, we'll go back to the town hall-style because it was a big hit with the kids – and their parents because they didn't have to wait in a line with their kids," he laughed.
What the New York Times bestselling author is most looking forward to, however, is the fan reaction to the meaningful story line behind the book.
"One of the biggest motivations for this book was actually for parents and teachers, and for all the parents and teachers out there who are having a difficult time talking to their children about the troubling things they see on the news every day," he said. "I really hope that 'A Tale of Magic' acts as a point of reference to make those conversations a lot easier."
Colfer explained that writing has always been a therapeutic activity for him, and helped him get through some of his own toughest times.
"As a kid, I had a sister with special needs, which was very difficult for my family, so whenever times got tough I would just whip out my computer or a pad of paper. …
That tool came in later when I grew up as a closeted gay kid in a public high school, and also being a gay teenager on public television," he said.
As a vocal member of the LGBTQ community, the author shared he has received appreciation from LGBTQ fans who connected with his books.
"My books are sold in places and do very well in places where LGBT people are discriminated against quite brutally and I do hear from those kids a lot," Colfer said. "If you look at my Twitter you might find some pictures of LGBT kids holding my books up by the Kremlin and other landmarks. That means a lot to me."
Colfer even admitted to having a whole room in his house dedicated to letters, fan art and fan creations, adding "that's my favorite part because I get to see my characters through someone else's eyes."
The author added that although "A Tale of Magic" acts as a prequel, it is a "completely independent story, and you don't need to read 'Land of Stories' to enjoy it."
Fans might want to get reading soon because Colfer announced his next literary focus: writing the sequel.

Untangling the Internet the Old-Fashioned Way

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? John Herrman, a reporter for the Styles desk who covers the internet, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools for doing your work?
I've never really taken an inventory like this. It's kind of depressing!
I'm looking back at a decade of doomed attempts to figure out a new work flow, to assemble just the right set of tools or to conjure some sort of productivity spirit out of the App Store, somehow -- and not much stuck.
I'm right back where I was in 2009: typing on a few-years-old MacBook, stressed out listening to my iPhone buzz away on my desk, typing into Gmail and a work chat window, making any remotely important calls on landlines and recording people with a little voice recorder. I guess I use my smartphone more? I suppose this makes some sense. We expect to be able to borrow the tech industry's latest tools to monitor and investigate the tech industry. I don't think it's a coincidence that they're not especially useful for this particular purpose!
There's one tool I added that I haven't given up on, although using it can feel a bit like giving up: Simplenote. It's a notes app that is as close to a searchable pile of paper as you can get. You make a new note, type into it, and then you make another new note, and you type into that. You just do that forever until you have thousands of notes that you can sort in a few ways, but that aren't really organized in any meaningful sense of the word.
I'm sure there are people who tag their Simplenotes, or otherwise think of them in some sort of structured way, but I just add them to the heap and then search for names or words and see what comes up. It has turned out to be a really nice way to annotate the frequently, and I think intentionally, disorienting experience of being online. So I like Simplenote.
I appreciate Google Calendar for related reasons. It's one of the many clocks missing from the casino wall.
As someone who lives and breathes this stuff, which tech trends do you love and which do you hate?
I'm trying and failing to "live and breathe this stuff" a bit less lately, and I don't appreciate what seems to happen when I try.
Each time I step even an inch away from a service -- let's say not logging in to Facebook or Twitter for a while -- I get this little reminder of what I actually mean to them. There's a flood of messages, of fresh notifications, of humanoid emails with subject lines like "We miss you" or sort of unearned claims that my friends miss me, or whatever. They almost instantly abuse whatever privileges you had given them to contact you, because why wouldn't they?
This is new territory for companies that are used to always growing. It doesn't bode so well for what might happen if or when any of them end up in real decline.
So what about a tech trend that you think is good?
The best tech trend right now, broadly speaking, is public hearings about Big Tech.
On the surface, these are often vexing spectacles. I'll grant that it's frustrating to watch questioners seem to fumble with the details, or even basics, of tech issues, but it's also good way to learn what lawmakers believe the underlying issues actually are. There are genuinely different approaches on display, and they hinge less on granular detail than on ideology. For example, some liberals tend to believe that platforms can ultimately be adjusted and fixed. Leftists may suggest they're inherently problematic, and should reined in. Some on the right seem to think that a better Big Tech is simply a cowed Big Tech that has been made very aware of its particular grievances. Subject expertise can, and will, be adapted to these very different ends.
While it's funny and galling that Congressman Morsecode accidentally called it "The Twitters," can you really say you understand the first thing about what Twitter's working definition of harassment is? What gets you barred there? Sometimes the dumbest-sounding questions actually are the best ones, particularly when you're dealing with companies that need us to accept information asymmetry as a business model.
You often write about issues that technology has wrought. What do you think are some of the biggest tech problems, and how do you deal with them personally?
There isn't a single such issue that doesn't implicate advertising in some way, and advertising is so deeply intertwined with the web and the rest of the consumer internet that it's quite difficult, often by design, to conceive of a world in which it's less important.
For example, I won't tell everyone to block ads. It's complicated, especially from these pages! But that's what I do, in as many ways as possible. I exclude sites from my ad blockers as I deem necessary. This "whitelist" is pretty substantial, and mostly includes other news organizations. It's an imperfect solution. I just don't think exposure to advertising is a healthy default for any environment where we spend a lot of time.
Which tech platforms do you think wield the most power, and what should people do to ensure their data and overall lives are not beholden to Big Tech?
Amazon could really hold the world hostage on a moment's notice, but I suppose Google could, too.
I don't think there's a data-hygienic way to use any of the ad-supported platforms. That's part of the deal, and I think most suggestions otherwise are either mistaken or deliberate diversions and a waste of time.
Facebook isn't free; loss of privacy is just one of the costs. Uber is convenient for riders because of what it asks of drivers, of cities and of public roads. It's not so hard to understand the benefits and costs of older technologies this way -- cars poison the air, newspapers pulp trees -- and it only benefits any moment's "big tech" to exempt it from such interpretations.
Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?
Mubi! It's a streaming app that hosts 30 films at a time -- a new one shows up every day, and the oldest one leaves. It's like having a really good independent or repertory movie theater in your house, or on your phone. (You can also download movies for flights, or for when you're keeping your phone offline.) You'll probably treat it as if it were a real-life small movie theater, and not use it as much as you wish you would, but you'll rarely regret it when you do. And it's $ 11 a month.
If you could tell people to do one thing today with their personal tech to improve their lives, what would it be?
Get a $ 20 shower radio, AM/FM. Ours looks like a fish and I use it almost every day, usually for news, sometimes for music. If you're a morning shower person, don't check your phone before you check your fish. If evening, no phones after.
A fully loaded smartphone is a perfectly greedy device; it has no respect for your time. This radio worked for me to get away from that.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Visiting a New England Seaside Village in the Bronx

The Game Plan
Maine is far away. Conveniently, the Bronx is closer.
On City Island, a 1.5-mile-long seaport community floating just off Pelham Bay Park, boats abound, lobster rolls make most menus, and small-town charm wins out. It's the type of impossibly quaint seaside scene you might expect to find in New England, only within New York City limits.
While there are plenty of aquatic activities to anchor a trip to City Island -- fishing, scuba diving and cruises, to name a few -- we recommend spending a day as a land lubber, wandering the island and getting to know its past, local treasures and a few of the characters who call it home.
Your visit, even one on land, should begin nautically, at the City Island Nautical Museum. Run by volunteers and housed in a landmark school building, this museum uses photos, models, pieces of boats and voice-over from a docent to demonstrate how the island's yacht- and boat-building industries evolved over the years, at times producing U.S. military vessels for the world wars and later crafting champion racing sloops for the America's Cups.
While boats are everywhere on the island -- seriously, they appear on local menus, in architecture and off practically every inch of coastline -- shipbuilding isn't the only type of skilled handiwork that happens here. Of City Island's roughly 4,500 residents, over 100 are artists and craftsmen, and a cluster of galleries populate the midsection of City Island Avenue.
At Focal Point Gallery, Ron Terner, a resident of 45 years, connects the community through art, showing works by locals, gathered via monthly open calls. He's also made a project of memorializing deceased City Islanders; his portraits of the community are plastered on a wall outside a marina across from JJ Burck Hardware on City Island Avenue.
Down the block, Janos and Theresa is staffed during the summer by the self-proclaimed "Bard of City Island," David Ellis, who paints haikus inspired by the landscape onto driftwood collected from the beach. Look for his poetry books, illustrated by his 8-year-old son, Gabriel, at the gallery.
Surveying the views on City Island, it's easy to see where the artists derive their inspiration. At the Harlem Yacht Club, where you can carry a drink or snack to an Adirondack chair on the dock, moored boats stretch west toward Pelham Bay Park through a shimmering Long Island Sound. From a bench at Belden Point, a pocket park at the island's southern tip, wide expanses of sea are on display under a distant suggestion of Queens. And in the Pelham Cemetery on the island's east side, Pells and other notable New Yorkers rest beneath a panorama of Hart Island.
Striking views aren't only found looking to sea, though. Keep your eyes peeled on land for interesting architecture, including the Samuel Pell House on City Island Avenue, a well-preserved example of the frame houses that dotted 19th-century New York City; the William H. Schofield House, at 65 Schofield Street, which dates back to the 1860s; and, from "The Royal Tenenbaums," the family's turreted summer home at 21 Tier Street. Also worth scoping: the waterfront mansions on King Avenue, the sweet bungalows on Minnieford Avenue and the historic cottages on Belden and Horton Streets.
But wherever you find yourself on the island, shed your city armor. It's a small town in our big city, and here's a surprise: The locals are friendly.
Pro tip: Clipper Coffee on City Island Avenue sells used books in the back for under $ 4; buy a title, and bring it to read in one of those Adirondack chairs.
Get directions to City Island.
Where to eat
Sammy's Fish Box on the southern end of the island leans heavily into nautical kitsch. Our advice: Embrace the theme, and come hungry. Order a lobster roll the length and girth of a weightlifter's forearm, or, better yet, one of the mixed shellfish platters for two that could, in reality, feed a family. This is quantity over quality, but sometimes there's a hole in your heart that only fried jumbo shrimp and onion rings can fill; Sammy's is here for you during those times.
Augies Deli is the place to go if you're seeking a quick sandwich. The shrimp parm hero is plentiful enough to split, or go off-menu for a simple, but well-constructed deli sandwich.
See the restaurants on our Google Map.
Where to get dessert or drinks
Lickety Split sits, pulled back from the street, inside an adorable colonial cottage, and nowhere in New York captures the scoop shop vibe of Jersey Shore and New England ice cream parlors quite like it. With its goofy stuffed cows for décor and sweaty teenage employees frantically scooping to keep up with the summer crowd, this ice cream shop is a hell of a nostalgia trip, and it sells a solid sundae to boot.
Tony's Pier can remedy any lingering hunger pangs you might have, but the No. 1 reason to visit this indoor/outdoor cafeteria is for an impressive view of the boats and bridges along the bay. (The No. 2 reason: its frozen drinks, which include a slushy blueberry situation dyed a shade of electric blue found nowhere in nature.) This blue beverage and some fries and a flock of hungry sea gulls overhead is what summer is all about.
See the establishments on our Google Map.
3 Quick Things
Something free or cheap
New York has 53 outdoor public pools, but have you ever visited The Floating Pool Lady? This pool is on a repurposed barge docked off Barretto Point Park in Hunts Point, with a view of North Brother Island. Self-billed as "New York City's Free Infinity Pool," it presents a rare opportunity to swim in the water, on the water. Check here for pool hours.
Something for the weeknight
Does summer have you in a dancing mood? Head to Pier 45 in Hudson River Park for Sunset Salsa. At 6:30 p.m. every Tuesday through August 27, the instructor Talia Castro-Pozo leads a free, hourlong beginner lesson, followed by open dance from 7:30 to 9 p.m. Bring a friend or a date, or just look on gleefully from the sidelines; salsa is almost as much fun to watch as it is to dance.
Something from a reader
Spend an afternoon -- O.K., and some cash -- in the Flatiron district. Christina K., a Summer reader, student at The School of The New York Times and a "thrift-shopping junkie," recommends grabbing a friend and heading to the local Goodwill store for a good rummage. After finding some quality pieces, "bask in the sun and admire your secondhand finds" at Madison Square Park and recharge with a burger and a shake from Shake Shack. "There may be a line when you go, but it's worth it," Christina writes.

Texto completo: I'll say this -- and it's not much -- about President Donald Trump's incendiary tweet attacks at Rep. Elijah Cummings and the city of Baltimore: At least, for a change, he's laid off my beloved Chicago.
The Republican president has treated Chicago, hometown of his predecessor President Barack Obama, as his favorite symbol of "American carnage," although he displays virtually no real knowledge of the real city.
I therefore braced myself for another Chicago hit after Trump made headlines over the weekend with a tweet that called Cummings' Baltimore district "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess." He said that "no human being would want to live there." He later called Cummings, who is black, a "racist."
I braced myself because Trump's tweet was based on a Fox News report on Baltimore's rat problem. The report cited a list put out by the pest control company Orkin on the cities with the highest number of residential and commercial rodent treatments in 2018.
Baltimore actually ranked ninth on the list. At the top, unfortunately, was my beloved Chicago, although I don't expect Chicagoans to pour into the streets to chant "We're No. 1" about this list.
Nevertheless, Chicago is dealing with this problem just as Los Angeles and New York, respectively second and third on the list, are doing. Bashing Democrat-run cities has become a long-running trope among some Republicans, even though 10 of the nation's 12 poorest states in the union (Alabama, South Carolina, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, Idaho, Florida and Mississippi), according to U.S. census data and the National Conference of State Legislatures, have Republican governors and legislatures in which the Grand Old Party has majorities in both houses.
Media that want to offer a little balance have noted that Baltimore's rats sometimes have been encouraged by New Yorkers, such as Jared Kushner, a New York real estate magnate and Trump's son-in-law. A 2017 investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times called "The Beleaguered Tenants of Kushnerville" reports conditions that led to lawsuits and 200 fines in 9,000 apartments owned by Kushner's company.
But, let's face it. Trump's attacks have virtually nothing to do with his concern for living conditions in Baltimore compared with what they have to do with punishing Cummings. As chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, he pressed a tough case against Trump's border policy last week and also is conducting multiple investigations of the president.
And attacking Cummings also provides red meat for Trump's base during his never-ending reelection campaign.
As Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot suggested when asked by reporters whether Trump was racist: Don't overthink it.
"Racism is a part of who he is. It is a part of his strategy," Lightfoot said Monday.
But everyone also should avoid being distracted by the race question from "what people actually care about and what they need," she said. "What they need is leadership."
Indeed, actions speak louder than labels. Office-seekers in our democracy have a choice. They can try to win by dividing people along lines of race and other differences or they can act to bring people together by emphasizing what we share in common.
Trump made his choice quite clear when he first announced his 2016 presidential campaign by attacking Mexican immigrants as "bringing drugs," "bringing crime, "they're rapists," as well as some who "I assume are good people."
More recently he has made public enemies out of "the squad," a quartet of freshmen House Democrats and women of color whom Trump has told on Twitter to "go back" to where they came from instead of criticizing his administration. All four of the women -- Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- are U.S. citizens, and only Omar was born outside the U.S.
Trump's telling Cummings to go take care of his district and stop investigating his affairs strikes the ear much like the "Send her back," chant that Trump's last rally crowd, in Greenville, N.C., employed. Both are just another version of the old and shameful message that too many members of minority groups still hear, "Go back where you came from."
Can Trump's version of white identity politics win in 2020? That's up to us voters.

Texto completo: The men in Orkideh Torabi's pictures at Richard Heller Gallery don't really know what they're doing.
That's not unusual: Some men have gotten so used to pretending to be experts, they've also gotten used to thinking they're more capable and intelligent than those around them, including women and children.
What's striking about the Chicago-based female artist's cartoon dudes is that they're just trying to have a good time -- and failing, miserably.

Whether picnicking, sunbathing or kicking back with a drink, Torabi's guys look lost. It's as if each knows what he's supposed to be doing but is too insecure, uncomfortable and self-conscious to lose himself in life's little pleasures. Even petting a dog or stopping to smell the flowers seems to test the skills of Torabi's inexperienced simpletons.
Post-Impressionism comes to mind, particularly Georges Seurat's great painting of 19th century Parisians figuring out what to do on Sundays when, thanks to the Industrial Revolution, they didn't have work and were expected to enjoy themselves.
Like the middle-class citizens in Seurat's "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte" (1884-86), which hangs at the Art Institute of Chicago, the lumpen lads in Torabi's exhibition "Give Them All They Want" are gauche, even loutish. But they're also sympathetic and vulnerable -- not quite endearing but far from despicable. They are pawns in a game they don't even know they're being played in.
Torabi's works are similarly complex. Although each is as visually potent as an oil on canvas, it's actually a silk-screened image, made with fabric dye and stretched cotton. In terms of materials and process, Torabi's pictures are monoprints. They're also paintings in drag, especially in their capacity to complicate us/them divisions and either/or oppositions.
In her hands, stilted pleasures -- and male indulgence -- are a sign of the times. What is more important, they're a sign that the times are changing.

Back to the predigital world
Long before cell towers started sprouting up everywhere, the federal government commissioned telecommunication companies to build five massive fields of shortwave radio antennae. The structures, which reached up to 450 feet, were located in out-of-the-way places in California, Ohio and North Carolina. Each was designed to bounce radio waves off the ionosphere, allowing federally produced programming to be transmitted all over the globe.
The U.S.' international broadcaster, Voice of America was born during WWII and expanded during the Cold War. As technology advanced, its programs migrated to TV and digital platforms. Today it's part of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, providing news and information in 50 languages to a weekly audience of 275 million.
Its early years are traced in a fascinating exhibition at the Center for Land Use Interpretation. "Voice of America: The Long Reach of Shortwave" takes visitors back to the predigital world, before our leaders began tweeting their policy decisions. Back then, audiences were addressed more formally, via carefully scripted programming.
Rather than focusing on content -- and the charged, often contentious relationship between information and propaganda -- the exhibition examines the infrastructure of shortwave radio transmissions. Of course, that structure comes with assumptions about the role of government -- and a free press -- in a democracy. As is the case with exhibitions at CLUI, visitors are not told what to think, feel or believe about such important subjects; we are free to come to our own conclusions.
The antennae are the stars of the show. They appear in photographs, in videos and on touch-screen monitors. Arranged in grids, arcs and asymmetrical arrays, they resemble high-tech fishing nets, impossibly spindly bridges, supersized spirit catchers and otherworldly telephone poles. Sculpturally impressive, they make Land Art look fussy, precious and small.
All but one of the five transmission stations have been abandoned. The most haunting component of the exhibition is a three-minute video documenting the destruction of the antennae. In sequence after sequence, little puffs of smoke appear before the towering antennae yield to the tug of gravity and topple in seemingly slow motion. It's a sad ballet that marks the end of an era.
A pair of touch-screen slideshows also is bittersweet. It takes visitors on a virtual tour of Transmission Station B (the only one still functioning) and Transmission Station A (its twin). Both are near Greenville, N.C. To see the up-and-running station alongside its vandalized, disused doppelganger is to glimpse a living world next to a dying one.
Both are ours.

Dilexi Gallery, raw and radical
Retrospective exhibitions typically trace the career of an individual artist, but the format applies equally well to the lifespan of a gallery, as evidenced by "Dilexi Gallery: Disparate Ontologies" at the Landing.
Organized by independent curator Laura Whitcomb, the show is part of a six-venue program examining the evolution and character of Dilexi, which operated in San Francisco from 1958 to 1969 as well as in L.A. briefly in the early '60s. The Landing's show, like the project as a whole (a comprehensive catalog is forthcoming), is a vibrant lesson in art history-cum-astronomy, a tale of radiant bodies, constellations and orbits.
The first revelatory big bang came in 1950, when music student Jim Newman met fellow Stanford freshman Walter Hopps. Hopps launched the legendary Ferus Gallery in L.A. in 1957, and the next year Newman (with poet-artist-activist Bob Alexander) opened Dilexi above a jazz club. Newman was drawn to artists -- largely Californians -- whom he perceived as radical in intent and bold with materials. A New York Times critic called the gallery "a springboard for the hairy avant-garde."
The retrospective's venues include some overlaps. Parker Gallery has "Seeking the Unknown," featuring Jess, Roy De Forest, Wally Hedrick, Jeremy Anderson and Alfred Jensen; Parrasch Heijnen's "Totems and Phenomenology" showcases Tony DeLap, Charles Ross, Deborah Remington, Arlo Acton and Richard Van Buren. Both run through Aug. 10. Marc Selwyn Fine Art pairs Jay DeFeo and Craig Kauffman through Sept. 14.
The Landing's spread is diverse and richly textured, largely oriented toward raw interiority, with nods to social critique and the surreal. "March or Die," H.C. Westermann's 1966 sculpture in wood, leather, metal and ink, is a beauty, tight and tough. Joe Goode's now-classic milk bottle paintings were first shown at Dilexi's L.A. outpost; "Bo" (1962), here, is a stellar example of the series. Leslie Kerr's painting, "Ouch" (1964), is a tidy piece of pop abstraction. If one work could emblematize the whole Dilexi enterprise, it might be Harry Kramer's motorized sculpture, "Lindwurm 2" (1964). A biomorphic tubular loop made of a delicately gridded wire skin, the piece is the work of an ingenious hand but feels also like the embodiment of something deeper, more broadly fundamental to being. Inside the exoskeleton, a dozen wheels turn with a gentle, musical ticking. A harmonious marriage of the organic and mechanical, the entrancing device functions like a kind of clockwork, at once earthly and celestial.
When Newman closed the gallery, he established the Dilexi Foundation, aiming to narrow the gap between art and life. He created a series on PBS station KQED, broadcasting artists' film projects; five of them screen in the gallery.
However counterculture his artists, Newman wanted to make a place for them front and center. He proclaimed, upon announcing the foundation: "The art world has become small and irrelevant against the general conditions of things in the world. Art ... should be in the way, not hidden." Amen.

CANCELING QUENTIN TARANTINO? THOUGH PROBLEMATIC, THE FAMED AUTEUR REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL AMERICAN FILMMAKER

Texto completo: A writer for the Guardian suggests we cancel Quentin Tarantino because his films "have reveled in extreme violence toward women." Debatable, but this is quite a paragraph:
...
In Tarantino's debut directorial feature, "Reservoir Dogs," the only female characters in the credits are "Shot Woman" and "Shocked Woman." "Pulp Fiction," his second film, features female characters more prominently, but a trend of reveling in the abuse of women began to emerge. One of "Pulp Fiction's" most famous scenes involves Uma Thurman's character getting stabbed in the heart with a shot of adrenaline to resuscitate her after a drug overdose. (Though it's fair to say male characters were also subjected to extreme violence.)
...
Well, every important character in "Reservoir Dogs" suffers extreme violence and they're all men. Is the problem that there are not enough women getting aggressed in the film? No fair leaving women out of the ear-removal party, Q.T.!
As writer Roy Chacko seems to know but doesn't quite concede, the vast majority of the violence in Tarantino films is directed at men. True, the Bride played by Ms. Thurman in the "Kill Bill" movies suffers horribly, but this is in the service of her being justified in meting out lots of violence toward her antagonists (some male, some female). Violence is Mr. Tarantino's idiom.
Mr. Chocko doesn't mention it, but the climactic scene of Mr. Tarantino's latest, "Once Upon a Time.in Hollywood," has a scene depicting violence against a woman that goes on a bit too long. And when I say "a bit too long," I mean it's grotesque. There's also a running joke about how Brad Pitt's character killed his wife and got away with it. Mr. Tarantino finds this detail hilarious; I don't see the humor. The beatings given to Jennifer Jason Leigh's character in "The Hateful Eight" are likewise gruesome and gratuitous. Extreme, cartoonish gore can be funny, but it's a lot less funny when a woman is the target. Women are naturally more vulnerable, and this alters our emotional reaction.
What about the violence directed by Mr. Tarantino at women during the making of his films, though? Mr. Tarantino admits spitting on Ms. Thurman during "Kill Bill" filming (because her character was being spit on and he didn't trust an actor to nail it in a single take) and also told her to drive a car she wasn't prepared to drive, which resulted in a crash. Mr. Tarantino says she was a shaky driver but didn't consider the task particularly complicated. He does regret this last, though, and gave The New York Times footage from "Kill Bill" for a story as a mea culpa.
At the New York Post, my longtime colleague Sara Stewart says "Tarantino's Exploitation Has No Place in Hollywood Anymore." Why, she asks, does the female lead of his new picture, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, get almost nothing to say?
"I just reject your hypothesis," Mr. Tarantino said to a reporter who asked a question along these lines.
"That's interesting," Ms. Stewart responds, "because I reject some of Tarantino's hypotheses, including the one about [Tate's husband Roman] Polanski's innocence regarding the sexual assault of a 13-year-old. ('Look. She was down with it . He didn't rape a 13-year-old, it was statutory rape, all right? . She wanted to have it,' Mr. Tarantino said in a 2003 interview with Howard Stern.)" Mr. Tarantino later apologized for saying this. She continues:
...
In a world where we have an increasing number of heroic females - especially in films written and directed by actual women - it may be game over for male auteurs who create supposedly strong women on-camera and denigrate them from behind it. In 2019, we don't need that type of guy anymore, especially one who thinks silencing Sharon Tate for most of his film is somehow a fitting homage.
...
I would disagree that we "don't need" Mr. Tarantino, one of our most interesting filmmakers.
The New Yorker's Richard Brody dings the new film for a different reason: It's too white. The movie "celebrates white-male stardom (and behind-the-scenes command) at the expense of everyone else."
Mr. Brody points out that a movie villain played by Leonardo DiCaprio's actor character refers to a Mexican as a "beaner," but then again, villains do tend to say mean things.
There's also another slur in the movie that bothers Mr. Brody: "There's no slur delivered more bitterly by Cliff and Rick than 'hippie,' and their narrow but intense experiences in the course of the film are set up to bear out the absolute aptness of their hostility." I guess the use of this epithet might cause me sorrow if I had once been a hippie. But then again, the hippies in question are . the Manson Family.

ICE arma “redada silenciosa” a más de 3,000 empresas

Texto completo: La semana pasada, 3,282 empresas de todo el país recibieron “Avisos de inspección (NOI)” de la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ), según el director interino, Matthew Albence .
El funcionario había adelantado a The New York Times que había investigaciones a ese número de empresas, pero no dio detalles.
Expertos de la firma Leech Tishman Fuscaldo & Lampl LLC indicaron que ICE envió “silenciosamente NOI” a las empresas, lo cual llamaron una “redada silenciosa” contra los empleadores.
“Las industrias que se vieron afectadas la semana pasada incluyeron restaurantes, procesamiento de alimentos, fabricación de alta tecnología y agricultura” , indicaron los expertos en un artículo en el sitio especializado en temas jurídicos lexology.com.
“La emisión de NOI no es sorprendente, dado que ICE ha aumentado hasta en cinco veces el número de las auditorías I-9 en el año fiscal 2018, y la reciente emisión de cartas de ‘no coincidencia’ de la Administración del Seguro Social esta primavera”, apunta el texto.
Los expertos brindan algunos consejos a los empresarios para mantener en orden su documentación, ya que los agentes se enfocan en buscar cualquier omisión que haga sospechar la contratación de inmigrantes indocumentados .
“Si una empresa ha recibido un NOI de ICE, solo tiene tres días hábiles para responder. Las multas por infracciones de la I-9 pueden oscilar entre $548 y $4,384 por delito para los infractores por primera vez”, advirtieron. “Las sanciones penales también pueden aplicarse a los dueños de negocios que a sabiendas emplean a trabajadores no autorizados” .
Los especialistas indican que estas revisiones se han vuelto más comunes y pueden tener consecuencias, ya que incluso los trabajadores con Autorización de Empleo pueden decidir renunciar ante el escrutinio.
“Responder a ICE le quita tiempo y recursos al negocio”, indican. “Las multas y cualquier noticia pública relacionada con la auditoría pueden dañar la reputación de la empresa. Es imperativo trabajar con un abogado experimentado en cumplimiento de I-9 y tener uno de guardia para que pueda estar preparado”.
El reporte no especifica las entidades donde se realizan las indagatorias, pero si un inmigrante es descubierto laborando con documentos falsos o robados será perseguido penalmente por fraude .

Texto completo: Republican Sen. Rand Paul is offering to buy Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar a plane ticket to visit her home country of Somalia to learn to be more grateful for living in the United States.
Omar is one of four congresswomen — known as "The Squad" — who President Donald Trump told to "go back" to their ancestors' countries instead of criticizing U.S. policies.
A few days later, Trump held a campaign rally in North Carolina where the crowd chanted "send her back" when the president spoke of Omar, a Somalian refugee who came to the U.S. as a child.
Trump condemned the chant when later asked by reporters but then called those who attended the rally "patriots" in subsequent comments.
"I'm not saying we forcibly send her anywhere," Paul said in an interview last week with Breitbart News, a conservative-leaning outlet. "I'm willing to contribute to buy her a ticket to go visit Somalia. I think she can look and maybe learn a little bit about the disaster that is Somalia."
The Kentucky Republican then criticized the East African country for having "no capitalism" or "God-given rights" under a constitution. He said Omar "might come back and appreciate America more" after visiting Somalia.
An Omar spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. But her campaign account did retweet messages criticizing Paul, including comedian Tom Arnold who made fun of the senator being assaulted by his neighbor in 2017.
Paul's comments did draw a rebuke from a member of Kentucky's federal delegation, Rep. John Yarmuth, who defended his Democratic colleague on Monday.
"Continued efforts to paint Congresswoman Ilhan Omar as anything less than a proud American are offensive to say the least," Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee, told the Courier Journal. "It's safe to say that Ilhan understands Somalia a lot better than Rand, and he'd be better suited just keeping quiet than making foolish and condescending remarks like this one."
Omar, who emigrated to the U.S. in 1992, said in a recent op-ed to the New York Times that the "send her back" chant "will be a defining moment in American history." She added that this marks a "fight for the soul of our nation."
"Throughout history, demagogues have used state power to target minority communities and political enemies, often culminating in state violence," Omar said in the op-ed. "Today, we face that threat in our own country, where the president of the United States is using the influence of our highest office to mount racist attacks on communities across the land."
Paul, who ran against Trump for president in 2016, has defended the president against charges of racism in the past.
A year ago, when Trump reportedly referred to African nations as "s---hole countries" Kentucky's junior senator said the comments weren't constructive, but that it was "unfair" to label the president a racist.
Paul has a budding relationship with the president and was recently tapped to help with negotiations with Iran. He has defended Trump over the tweets aimed at the congresswomen, which include Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
The senator told Breitbart that in the city of Bowling Green, where he lives, there are many immigrants and refugees who are great citizens, but that those people are thankful to be in America.
"Then I hear Rep. Omar say, 'Oh, America is a terrible place, there is no justice here,'" Paul said. "Well, she came here and we fed her, we clothed her, she got welfare, she got school, she got healthcare, and then, lo and behold, she has the honor of actually winning a seat in Congress, and she says we're a terrible country? I think that's about as ungrateful as you can get."
Sergio Gor, a spokesman in the senator's office, declined to comment for this story.
Some of Paul's supporters contacted the Courier Journal to cheer the senator's remarks aimed at Omar. One reader, identified as Dave Stark, said if the congresswoman or anyone, "doesn't like living in the U.S." they should leave the country.
"Nobody needs you here," he said.
Another Paul supporter, Joe Cavagnaro, said in an email that Omar is a "socialist bigmouth" who is dangerously out of touch with the rest of the country.
"She really should go back to her s---hole country of origin," he said. "Not a comment as to her race but rather her politics. The Squad is out of touch with mainstream America and needs to be voted out of office ASAP. You must get rid of the cancer before it spreads too far!!"
But Paul was also condemned for the comments by several others, mostly on Twitter.
Democratic strategist Dante Atkins said Paul, who is a libertarian-leaning senator,
"would love Somalia."
"No central government, total lack of regulatory infrastructure, and an unlimited right to keep and bear arms," Atkins tweeted. "He should check it out. Libertarian paradise."

Uber Cuts 400 From Marketing as Profitability Doubts Persist After a Weak I.P.O.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber said it laid off a third of its marketing team on Monday, or about 400 people, as the ride-hailing company tries to cut costs and streamline its operations after its initial public offering in May.
The cuts, which were also announced internally on Monday, are taking place in multiple Uber offices around the world, the company said. The marketing team had more than 1,200 people before the layoffs. Uber employs almost 25,000 people globally, nearly half of whom are based in the United States, according to recent regulatory filings.
Uber declined to comment further.
The layoffs are the latest shake-up at Uber since it went public two months ago. During its journey to the public markets, the company, which is unprofitable, faced numerous questions from Wall Street about whether it could make money. Ride-hailing is an expensive business, with providers often spending huge sums to recruit drivers and subsidize trips. Those doubts ultimately took a toll on Uber's I.P.O., with the company's stock falling 7.6 percent on its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Since then, Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, has moved to make changes at the company. In June, he pushed out two members of his executive team: Barney Harford, the chief operating officer, and Rebecca Messina, the chief marketing officer. Ms. Messina's role was eliminated, and the marketing team was reorganized under Uber's communications lead, Jill Hazelbaker.
In addition, Uber's board has been undergoing turnover. Ryan Graves, Uber's first employee and a director, stepped down from the board in May. Last week, two more board members -- Arianna Huffington, the founder of Thrive Global, and Matt Cohler, a venture capitalist at Benchmark -- stepped down from their positions. Both Ms. Huffington and Mr. Cohler had been heavily involved in the departure of Mr. Khosrowshahi's predecessor, Travis Kalanick, from Uber in 2017.
In a statement last week, Ms. Huffington said she had stepped down to focus on the growth of her own company. Mr. Cohler said in a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he was "thrilled with the company's position." Uber has not announced their replacements.
The company faces another test on Aug. 8, when it is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings. When Uber reported its first-quarter results, it posted its slowest growth in years and a loss of more than $ 1 billion.
Wall Street analysts project that Uber will report a loss of $ 2.09 a share next week on revenue of $ 3.3 billion, according to FactSet.
In an email on Monday to Uber's marketing staff, which was reviewed by The New York Times, Ms. Hazelbaker said the 400 layoffs were taking place because the team had grown bloated and decision-making was unclear. The marketing team's organizational charts ran to more than 388 pages, she said.
Ms. Hazelbaker added that she planned to consolidate Uber's regional marketing teams around the world, including in the United States and Canada, Latin America and the Middle East. The marketing team oversees ride promotions, advertising campaigns and social media.
"These changes are incredibly difficult to make because they have a huge impact on people's lives," Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to Uber employees. "Many of our teams are too big, which creates overlapping work, makes for unclear decision owners and can lead to mediocre results. As a company, we can do more to keep the bar high, and expect more of ourselves and each other. So, put simply, we need to get our edge back."

MONDAY BUSINESS; THE AGENDA: PERSONAL FINANCE; Pacific Life loses gamble on millennials; Firm will shut down costly online venture after failing to lure young and socially conscious investors.

Texto completo: In 2017, Pacific Life Insurance Co. introduced a socially conscious, online investing platform tailored to thirtysomethings eager to use their assets to make the world a better place. Those investors proved more expensive and rare than the company thought, and less than two years later, the venture is returning their money and shutting down.
The company, called Swell Investing, tweeted last week that it will close Aug. 30. In surveys, people in their 20s and 30s say they're eager to invest in line with their values, but the short life of Swell suggests that the financial services industry has been wrong about how ready they are to do so.
"When we first set out to build Swell, our goal was to ensure that every dollar invested created a better world," Dave Fanger, the former Pacific Life executive who founded Swell and was its chief executive, said in a statement. It didn't address the company's demise, but said the team would "collectively continue in some form on this mission."

The target customer was between 25 and 44 years old, loved to watch financial news start-up Cheddar, read the New York Times, travel and wear Patagonia, Fanger said in 2017. Based in Santa Monica, the Swell team built managed accounts focused on green technology, disease eradication, healthy living, clean water and zero waste, and emphasized investors' abilities to vote their proxies on issues they cared about.
But those customers didn't materialize. Swell initially focused on pricey marketing to get the word out to retail investors, and though those costs fell as it launched an app and got more well known, it made it tough to grow. Swell's customer acquisition costs in the first year were as much as $350 per person, though they fell to about $150 this year, a spokeswoman said.
The average millennial has a net worth of just $8,000, a Deloitte study found in May. The cohort is heavier on debt than other generations and most of their assets are held in 401(k)s, IRAs and real estate. Some of Swell's biggest accounts were IRA rollovers, but most accounts were small, said a former employee who asked not to be named to protect future job opportunities.
When the company announced it was closing, the spokeswoman said it had $35 million in assets under management and 15,000 clients -- or a per-client account average of just $2,333. Swell's annual management fee was 75 basis points, or 0.75%, netting less than $20 per account on average.
At the same time, Swell's focus on sustainable-impact investments meant portfolios full of newer midsized companies, many of which were exceptionally volatile for small retail investors, the former employee said. While too low to cover its costs, Swell's fee was high relative to other online options. Some robo advisors charge no annual fees. And giants such as BlackRock Inc. and the Vanguard Group that have attracted billions in sustainable-impact assets, cut prices sharply on new socially conscious exchange-traded funds.
"Although we believe in the value of sustainable-impact investing, the Swell model is not a long-term fit for our core business strategy," Pacific Life said in a statement. Client accounts will be closed and the assets returned, with management fees waived for August.
Swell may just have been too early. Millennials and Gen-Xers are expected to inherit $30 trillion of wealth in a massive generational transfer over the next 30 years. Swell's collapse makes clear that just hasn't started yet.

U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe to replace Dan Coats as national intelligence director

Texto completo: I am deeply grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to lead our Nation’s intelligence community and work on behalf of all the public servants who are tirelessly devoted to defending the security and safety of the United States.
— John Ratcliffe (@RepRatcliffe) July 29, 2019
*Editor's note: This story has been updated.
President Donald Trump said he will nominate U.S. Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Heath Republican, to replace Dan Coats as director of national intelligence.
....be leaving office on August 15th. I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our Country. The Acting Director will be named shortly.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2019
Axios broke the news, citing sources who said Trump was thrilled by Ratcliffe's admonishment of former special counsel Robert Mueller in last week's House Judiciary Committee hearing.
"The special counsel's job — nowhere does it say that you were to conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or that the special counsel report should determine whether or not to exonerate him," Ratcliffe said to Mueller during that hearing. He argued that Mueller went beyond his bounds by making clear the investigation didn't exonerate the president.
Ratcliffe, a former federal prosecutor first elected in 2014, was mayor of Heath before successfully challenging the late Ralph Hall, R-Rockwall, then the dean of the Texas delegation. This isn’t the first time Ratcliffe has been said to be under consideration for a position in this administration. In November, he was on a short list of possible replacements for fired U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
He is also a member of the House Intelligence Committee.
I am deeply grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to lead our Nation’s intelligence community and work on behalf of all the public servants who are tirelessly devoted to defending the security and safety of the United States.
— John Ratcliffe (@RepRatcliffe) July 29, 2019
Axios was followed by several other outlets, including The New York Times, in reporting that Coats is expected to step down soon. Coats has spent his tenure in the administration at odds with the president. The president's tweet followed that wave of reports.
Assuming Ratcliffe passes Senate confirmation, a special election will take place to succeed him in Congress. His 4th District stretches from the Dallas suburbs east to Texarkana. It is almost certain to stay in the Republican column.

Midlife loss takes shape in 'Late Migrations'

Texto completo: Disturbing images pop up with spooky regularity in "Late Migrations," Nashville author Margaret Renkl's collection of linked essays about family and nature. In one, a rat snake "slowly, almost mechanically," swallows a nest of newborn rabbits, one by one. Elsewhere, a fanatically territorial Carolina wren, beloved for its gorgeous waterfall-like song, pierces the eggs of other birds in nearby nests to kill their young. In yet another, Renkl lies in a bed next to her beloved father as he dies of cancer, watching him take one ragged, long breath after another, willing him to end the agony, to die, please die.
And yet "Late Migrations" is a lovely book, made up of short essays that alternate unexpected observations about nature with brief but telling stories about Renkl's great-grandparents, grandparents and parents. Her elders created a tight braid of family in which she grew up somewhat confined, but also protected and loved. Her heritage is that of the American South - Alabama and Tennessee - and the backyard nature dramas she witnesses are different from those readers might see in the North.
Loss and grief are the core subjects for Renkl, a New York Times opinion writer. She mourns after miscarriages for ghost children, for a cedar waxwing that dies after hitting a shiny window, for a kind mother-in-law savaged by Parkinson's disease, for landscapes and creatures snuffed out by invasive fauna and flora, for her father, for whom the latest advances in medicine do nothing to stop the invasion of metastatic cancer.
Most prominently, she mourns for her mother, a complicated figure who during her childhood was wracked with depression that led to Renkl's most frequent memory, of her being driven away toward medical care in unending tears. As an older woman, her mother is healthier but often cranky, a hoarder who lives across the street and creates complications and irritations that are swept away by her sudden death, when Renkl realizes how much she loved her.
The juxtaposition of family histories with observations from the natural world seems designed to remind us how biological we are, and how much our days and fates are shaped by forces beyond our control. It's an effective construct, and the sparse simplicity with which Renkl records her observations and emotions belies the profound truths she is presenting.
"Late Migrations" will be treasured most by middle-age readers who are losing, or have lost, beloved parents; who are looking back across their own lives and their family circles being broken by death; and who are pondering how the past shaped the people they are today.

Texto completo: For people to die young, in their prime, before their time, can seem like an offense against nature. In Japan during World War II, on the eve of their fatal flights, kamikaze pilots often wrote letters apologizing to their parents for causing them grief with their premature deaths.
Young men fight in wars, and they die. But when we hear about a young man or woman passing away just as he or she is beginning to fulfill the promise of youth, it can feel profoundly wrong. Sometimes we glorify or romanticize them, perhaps to fend off our own sense of mortality.
William D. Cohan's "Four Friends: Promising Lives Cut Short" is an engaging, unsettling book. His story of the untimely, violent departures of four of his schoolmates may make the reader feel angry at the sheer waste and carelessness of their deaths. It is also an intensely humane work by a skillful writer of nonfiction narrative who knows how to make you forgive even as he damns. That one of his subjects is John F. Kennedy Jr. adds to the drama, though all of his characters are sympathetic, even if you want to smack their pretty heads.
A longtime Vanity Fair writer, Cohan does a bit of huffing and puffing to set the scene. Like his subjects, he attended Phillips Academy, the Massachusetts boarding school called Andover by its graduates. "People emerged from Andover thinking they could do, or be, anything they wanted," Cohan writes in his prologue. "That idea that we really were la crème de la crème de la jeunesse américaine , as we were told regularly, that we were some kind of young, invincible Delta Force, was intoxicating." I graduated from Andover eight years before Cohan, and the school was and is demanding, but Delta Force it was not. Still, there is no doubt that many students felt high expectations and pressure to perform, sometimes from their parents, sometimes from the school. In the mid-'60s, students tried to compensate with a thick veneer of cynicism and sarcasm. In Cohan's more liberal era of the mid-'70s, when the drinking age dropped to 18 and drugs arrived on campuses everywhere, the preferred buffers were pot and alcohol.
As teenage schoolboys, three of Cohan's four heroes seem to have been as intent on getting high as on getting into Harvard, none more so than JFK Jr. "John always liked to push the disciplinary envelope at Andover, if in a charming way," Cohan writes. "He didn't intentionally flaunt the rules as much as sort of pretend they never really existed in the first place, since it was pretty clear from his own experiences in life that the rules of the road would never apply to him anyway."
Death on the cusp of middle age is the fate of all of Cohan's characters. The most shockingly inexplicable is that of Jack Berman, the studious, abstemious son of Holocaust survivors who fulfills his parents' dreams by becoming a successful lawyer - and, at age 36, is gunned down by a madman who hates lawyers.
The other three characters contribute significantly to their own demise. Will Daniel is a grandson of President Harry Truman and a son of Clifton Daniel, the managing editor of the New York Times. At Andover, he hangs out with the stoners, but he still gets into Yale. Perpetually adrift, he is at once prone to angry outbursts and gently caring for mentally ill people and AIDS sufferers at homeless shelters in New York. Drunk late one night, he steps in front of a fast-moving cab, probably accidentally, though maybe not.
Brilliant as well as entitled, Harry Bull floats through Andover in a haze of pot and drops out of Yale after a semester. But he straightens up, goes into the family business, and is happily married with two little girls and an infant son. One warm summer afternoon, he takes his daughters, ages 7 and 5, sailing. The small sailboat is found, empty and drifting, the next day. There is no evidence of foul play. It may be that Harry, an excellent swimmer and sailor who liked to jump in Lake Michigan on hot, calm days, went swimming with his girls (no life jackets) and the outboard engine somehow engaged or a puff of wind carried the boat away.
JFK Jr.'s death was even more reckless. "Enabled" does not begin to describe his charmed, doomed existence. At Andover, a school normally unforgiving of failure, he is repeatedly pardoned for academic disaster. At Brown, Kennedy had the "bad habits of borrowing money and of losing his wallet, which occasionally had some borrowed money in it," writes Cohan.
Kennedy's friends at Brown recalled how people threw themselves at their famous classmate, physically and emotionally. One of them, John Perry Barlow, recalled that "people would come up to him, and you could see them just shedding IQ points as they approached. I mean, the closer they got, the dumber they were."
Kennedy both courted attention, lounging about public places bare-chested, and hated it. "THE HUNK FLUNKS . . . AGAIN," jeered the New York Daily News the second time he flunked his bar exam. John's favorite drug, among many sampled, was his own adrenalin. He had various near-death experiences paddling kayaks in dangerous waters and piloting a kind of flying parachute called the Dream Machine, which he crashed, breaking his leg.
His marriage to Carolyn Bessette and his political/celebrity magazine, George, were both failing when, unqualified for flying by instrument, he took off with his wife and her sister into the thick haze that July night 20 years ago. At the time, he was seriously thinking of running for governor of New York. After all, who was to tell him no?
Evan Thomas is the author of "Robert Kennedy: His Life" and "First: Sandra Day O'Connor."

Help us save the stories of WWII soldiers while we can | Vince Bzdek

Texto completo: Watt Hill doesn’t think he has much of a story to tell about World War II.
“I went to Europe as a P-38 pilot. I was only in the service a year and a half during the war. I don’t think I earned glory or fame or anything like that,” he adds. “And I’m getting kind of rickety now.”
“I didn’t really fight a war until 25 years later when I went to Vietnam and flew A-37s close air support for 194 missions. That was my real combat, and I don’t think anybody really gives a damn about Vietnam.”

Nonetheless, Hill agreed to sit and talk to a Gazette reporter and tell his story because he doesn’t want people to forget World War II.
We at the Gazette are hoping to collect many such stories from World War II veterans here in town. We plan to create an online repository of their oral histories, and share them periodically in the march up to the 75th anniversary of VE Day next spring.
But gathering those stories can be hard. One reason is the shared humility of soldiers like Hill; they are not inclined to toot their own horns much, because so many of them gave so much. Sixteen million to be exact.
Collecting their stories is also challenging because many of the denizens of the Greatest Generation never talked about their experience. My grandfather was one of them. A lawyer who entered the army as an enlisted man, and never wanted to be an officer, he worked for the Army for 25 years, serving in Germany, Calif., and Alaska before circling back to Colorado Springs because of a fondness for his time at Camp Carson. But we never heard much about what he did or how he fought. He was more interested in putting the war behind him than reliving it for his grandkids. Eventually, I’m afraid, we learned not to ask.
Another reason it’s hard — and important — to gather these stories is that, alas, the keepers of such stories are fast disappearing from our midst.
According to Department of Veterans Affairs, fewer than 3% of the 16 million American veterans of the war are alive, and all are in their 90s or beyond.
About 350 WWII vets a day are dying across the country. Arlington Cemetery holds 28 funerals a day. In 2018, Colorado had 7,598 WWII veterans left.
Filmmaker Ken Burns put it this way recently: Every time a World War II veteran dies, it’s like a library burning down.
And some of the vets are worried that memories of the war — its meaning, its lessons, its terrors, its triumphs — are fading fast as its soldiers disappear. A teacher who brought her class to the National Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs recently asked one of the docents there what W-W-I-I stood for. The docent said he patiently explained that those weren’t “I’s,” but rather Roman numerals representing the number 2, for second world war.
So we need your help. We need to make sure these soldiers’ stories from the most impactful event of the 20th century, the event that liberated the world and turned America into a superpower and global beacon of democracy, is preserved and taught and shared. It might just be our greatest story.
Thousands of families of WWII veterans are starting to realize what might be lost. They have been reaching out to the WWII Museum in New Orleans to try to piece together stories of the fathers and grandfathers who never spoke of the war after coming home. Before it is too late.
Dave Philips, a former reporter at The Gazette who now writes for the New York Times, reported recently that the children and grandchildren of soldiers have been clamoring for their stories, “especially as the 75th anniversaries of the D-Day invasion and the other triumphs of the war’s final years have neared.”
“We have people calling every day to try to find out about their fathers,” Tanja Spitzer, a researcher at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, told Philips. “They regret that they didn’t do anything when their parents were alive. We get a lot of apologizing about it. For them, it is very emotional.”
Honoring those veterans’ sacrifice before they pass from the scene is at the forefront of everything they do at the National WWII Museum, including a $400 million capital campaign to create a lasting tribute to the war generation.
“There’s no time to lose,” said Gordon H. “Nick” Mueller, president and CEO emeritus of the museum. “We want to be able to finish and dedicate our expansion while we still have members of the Greatest Generation to thank for their sacrifice and service to the nation and to show the world what they mean to the principle of freedom.”
Spitzer told Philips the National Archives and Records Administration keeps billions of pages of personnel files for World War II vets in a climate-controlled facility in St. Louis.
Watt Hill’s files are in there.
“I was a California boy,” Hill told me. “And I went off to the World War II right out of high school, and I got divorced from real society.
“Thirty-one years in the Air Force, it’s a different life. Trust me. It’s a different world.”
I asked Watt if the experience was foundational for him, the way it was for so many GIs, the superstructure on which he built the rest of his life.
His answer is a reminder of the greatest thing about the greatest generation, the thing many of us descendants of those vets are still benefiting and learning from, in addition to the freedom they secured.
“I’ve got greater fame than being a World War II vet I think because I married a British girl right after the war. I was 21 years old when I got married. She was 17, and we’ve been married for 73 years. For me, that’s not only the better part of the story, it’s a better part of life.”

Texto completo: "Repulsive though he is, nominee Trump's character defects aren't what makes him a threat. What does sicken and alarm, and what ought to concentrate African American minds, is the thought of Trump with the powers of the presidency in his hands."
Those words of desperation appeared in a column I wrote a few weeks before the polls opened in November 2016. I repeat them today in quiet despair. We seem, once again, to be concentrating on the wrong things.
Three years ago, too few African Americans - no, make that too few Americans - in states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin gave serious thought to what turned out to be one of the most consequential presidential elections in modern history. They apathetically stayed at home, thus helping to hand the White House to a man whose monumental defects were staring them in the face - a danger they either refused or were too blind to see.
Unless Democrats wake up and change the trajectory they are on, history could repeat itself next year.
Since President Trump assumed office on Jan. 20, 2017, some of our worst fears have come to pass. Gone is the need to speculate about the powers of the presidency in his hands.
Dire predictions of Trump's Supreme Court justices and his federal bench appointees have become a frightening reality. He has reshaped the courts, pointing the federal judiciary in a rightward direction that will take at least a generation to change.
True to his words, Trump has led an administration that has landed body blows to voting rights, consumer and reproductive rights and environmental protections. He has changed the political landscape, reducing members of Congress to sniveling supplicants. Legislative demands are ignored with impunity. He thumbs his nose at subpoenas, and laughs off senior congressional leadership.
Under Trump, rights and privileges of citizenship are reserved for his "Make America Great Again" crowd. All others must wait for their number to get called.
And he's turned the lights back on in the federal death chamber.
But, as in 2016, Trump's ineptitude, bullying and demagoguery seem not enough to take attention off ourselves.
Respected New York Times political columnist Thomas B. Edsall, whom I've known since the '70s when he was with the Baltimore Sun and I was a legislative aide to Sen. Charles McC. Mathias Jr. (R-Md.), has written an incisive piece about the Democrat Party's inner turmoil. It paints a convincing portrait of a party electorate pulling itself apart over political agendas having less to do with defeating Trump and more with scoring ideological victories among themselves.
Even as Trump's Justice Department is arguing in favor of a Texas judge's decision to invalidate the Affordable Care Act - which has extended health coverage to millions of low-income people - Democratic presidential candidates are at each other's throats over whether all private health insurance should be eliminated or be allowed to compete with federal programs.
Fat chance that a Medicare-for-all proposal will help drive Trump from office. But that idea means all the world to progressives who want their health-care vision to prevail, and nothing less. And, I venture, the candidate they support, and nobody else.
While Trump moves to end asylum protection for migrants fleeing persecution and torture, Democratic presidential hopefuls are going back and forth over whether unauthorized border crossings should be a civil or criminal offense.
Meanwhile, voices for job creation, tightening stitches in the safety net, sticking to bread-and- butter issues and making Trump's first term his last are drowned by the sounds of wannabe political celebrities and rookie gurus tooting their own horns. Edsall quotes Democratic strategist Paul Begala as saying Democratic candidates and their staffs are "turning the nomination contest into 'some kind of purity game to see who can be the most leftist.' "
We saw this game get played out between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary. Progressive purity vs. political pragmatism. How did that turn out?
But it is the same direction in which the Democratic Party is headed today - resuming a war that pits the left-leaning faction against ideological moderates.
The polarizing Clinton-Sanders contest gave the spectacularly unqualified candidate Trump much to work with.
The current crop of Democratic candidates appears to be geared up to give the lying, racist and Constitution-offending President Trump more of the same.
All of which leads me to approach next week's Detroit Democratic presidential debates in despair.

Texto completo: With barely three weeks to go until its scheduled Aug. 16 opening day, Woodstock 50 might find a new home in Columbia.
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said during a news conference early Thursday night that the county government is "in talks with the promoter [of the music festival] and Merriweather [Post Pavilion]" to host the anniversary event at the famed amphitheater this summer.
The facility has a history of hosting multi-act concerts such as Capital Jazz Fest and Virgin Festival, Ball said.
"This is a place where we're known for our music festivals," he said. "We're a place that celebrates arts and culture."
Ball also referenced the history of the festival, which originally took place in 1969 against the backdrop of the hippie movement and flourishing counterculture. It turned musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Sly and the Family Stone - both of whom played there - into international stars.
Despite its own problems, including muddy festival grounds and two deaths, Woodstock remains a strong symbol of that generation and introduced many of its performers, including 2019 returnee Carlos Santana, to a bigger audience. It is the third major anniversary festival, after editions in 1994 and 1999 - the latter of which devolved into chaotic violence and property damage.
News of the move, which Bloomberg Businessweek first reported Thursday, came nearly 7 ½ months after Michael Lang, who co-founded the original Woodstock festival in 1969, first announced the 50th anniversary event. Since then, Lang and his collaborators encountered numerous hurdles while unsuccessfully trying to secure a site near the original location in upstate New York. To this day, the Woodstock 50 website does not allow people to purchase tickets.
Festival producers additionally confirmed to The New York Times on Thursday that Woodstock 50 officially moved to Merriweather Post Pavilion. The venue has yet to list the festival on its website and instead lists a Smashing Pumpkins concert Aug. 17.
Scott Peterson, a spokesperson for Ball, deferred comment on the particulars of the concert, including whether the move would affect artists' contracts to perform, to festival authorities and the venue. Neither concert organizers nor representatives for Merriweather Post Pavilion or booked artists The Killers and Soccer Mommy returned requests for comment from The Sun. Other booked acts include Jay-Z, Chance the Rapper, Miley Cyrus and Halsey.
Woodstock 50 coincides with a separate commemoration of the 50th anniversary in Bethel, N.Y., where the original festival took place. Baltimore-based artist Dr. Bob Hieronimous, who painted the iconic Light VW Bus, will recreate his iconic journey from Baltimore to Bethel this summer. Those who can't make it to Columbia or Bethel can visit the American Visionary Art Museum on Aug. 12 for a kickoff event with the original bus. The celebration in New York state takes place Aug. 16

Texto completo: Aaron Hull, the chief Border Patrol agent in the El Paso Sector, is heading to Detroit on Monday to serve as the interim chief on a temporary duty assignment, according to a CBP spokesman.
The reason for assignment was not clear.
"Multiple members of the Border Patrol's senior leadership team are currently rotating on TDY assignments in both headquarters roles and senior field positions nationwide," the CBP spokesman said.
The El Paso Sector has seen its share of controversy, with accusations that migrant children in the Clint, Texas, facility were being neglected, kept in jail-like holding facilities and suffering from outbreaks of diseases such as scabies and chickenpox.
The El Paso Sector includes El Paso and Hudspeth counties in West Texas and all of New Mexico.
Earlier this month, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus toured facilities in Clint and El Paso. Elected officials claimed women in the facility made accusations of "psychological torture," with one migrant woman telling lawmakers she had been told to drink from the toilet.
After the El Paso Times and New York Times published an article stating leadership knew for months that some children in the Clint station had no beds to sleep on, sometimes went hungry and had no way to clean themselves, Hull disputed the claims on CNN.
"I would dispute that the conditions are so bad as have been reported," Hull said during the interview. "I can't understand why some people would be making some of the allegations that they're making."
U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, who was among the politicians who toured the Clint and El Paso centers, has been vocal in her disapproval of conditions at the facilities. The freshman congresswoman testified July 12 before the House Oversight Committee alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York; Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, on what she saw in the facilities.
"We've seen severe overcrowding in Border Patrol processing centers that is so inhumane, that the DHS Office of the Inspector General described it as 'dangerous' because it represents 'an immediate risk' to agents and migrants alike," she said in testimony. The El Paso Times reached out to Escobar, but was told by a spokeswoman that she would not be commenting.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE BOYS Stream on Amazon. A trailer for this streaming series adaptation of comic books by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson features eye gouging, machine guns, lots of swearing and what appears to be a baby that fires lasers from its face. And that trailer is only about two minutes long. The thrust of the series -- whose showrunner is the "Supernatural" creator Eric Kripke -- is something like a dirty, topsy-turvy take on "The Avengers," set in a world where badly behaving celebrity superheroes abuse their powers. Karl Urban plays Billy Butcher, the leader of a squad assembled to keep the superheroes' misbehavior in check. That turns out to be a bit like employing hyenas to babysit coyotes.
PASSING: A FAMILY IN BLACK AND WHITE Stream on Topic. The comedian Robin Cloud hosts this series of documentary shorts. In the beginning, Cloud announces her intent to reconnect with relatives whose parents cut ties with the family, relocating from Harlem to the Midwest and trying, in their new life, to pass for white. When a reunion does happen, it brings with it conversations that touch on complicated questions about identity.
DUMBO (2019) Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. We've already gotten two more big Disney family movie reboots since this story of an outcast elephant was reimagined by Tim Burton (and mounds of computer processing power) earlier this year. Those who haven't kept up can rent it to see a struggling circus owner played by Danny DeVito get swindled by a no-good entrepreneur (Michael Keaton) with a truly villainous haircut. The bad guy gets his comeuppance thanks in part to an honest elephant handler played by Colin Farrell. "Ho-hum until it takes a turn toward the fascinatingly weird, the movie is a welcome declaration of artistic independence for Burton, who often strains against aesthetic and industrial restrictions," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "Watching him cut loose (more recklessly than his flying baby elephant) is by far the most unexpected pleasure of this movie, which dusts off the 1941 animated charmer with exhilaratingly demented spirit."
SUGAR RUSH Stream on Netflix. For a streamable baking competition with less politeness than the Great British Baking Show but just as much sugar, see this series, which pits teams against each other in baking battles. The second season debuts Friday.
What's on TV
MACHETE (2010) 8:15 p.m. on HBO. Born from a spoof trailer seen in Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's "Grindhouse," this gory, starry romp with B movie aspirations centers on a drug cartel enforcer played by Danny Trejo. The cast includes Steven Seagal as a villainous drug kingpin, Robert De Niro as a Texas State Senator, Jessica Alba as a double-crossing immigration officer and Michelle Rodriguez as a heroic taco stand operator. It's the type of tongue-in-cheek movie where you fear that someone's tongue may actually get carved out through their cheek.

In Mueller's Skepticism, Trump's Written Answers Stoke Impeachment Talk

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In late summer 2016, after WikiLeaks had published its first tranche of stolen Democratic emails, Donald J. Trump received a phone call while riding to La Guardia Airport and then told an aide that more damaging releases were coming.
But Mr. Trump denied to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that he knew in advance about the timing of the release of hacked emails or their contents, contradicting the recollections of the adviser sharing the car ride, Rick Gates.
Now Mr. Trump's answers, submitted in writing and under oath, are receiving new scrutiny after Mr. Mueller agreed in his closely watched congressional testimony this week that some of the president's responses were untruthful.
Mr. Trump's answers are becoming additional fodder for the internal debate among House Democrats about whether to open an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, congressional aides said.
Notably, one of the two articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton accused him of lying under oath. That concerned a far different matter: whether he had an affair with an intern, not whether he knew about and made plans to use forthcoming illegal foreign assistance to help win an election.
The credibility of Mr. Trump's written answers, which were released in an appendix to the Mueller report, has received relatively less attention than his attempts to impede the Russia investigation. The report did not contain a section analyzing whether the answers met the criteria for perjury, unlike its treatment of his actions that raised concerns about obstruction of justice.
But toward the end of Mr. Mueller's nearly seven-hour appearance on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, a freshman Democrat from Florida, Representative Val B. Demings, brought up Mr. Trump's written responses and asked whether "his answers showed that he wasn't always being truthful."
Rather than demurring as he had to similar questions, Mr. Mueller instead appeared to confirm her assessment, responding, "I would say generally."
Ms. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, then suggested that Mr. Trump was getting away with lying under oath. She added, "As a former law enforcement officer of almost 30 years, I find that a disgrace to our criminal justice system."
Ms. Demings raised her question in the context of Mr. Trump's claim to know nothing during the campaign about what WikiLeaks had or was planning to publish. Little is publicly known about the Trump campaign's actions related to WikiLeaks because that portion of the Mueller report was heavily redacted. The justification for the censorship is that the information relates to a current matter, presumably the indictment of Mr. Trump's longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr.
When Mr. Trump turned in his written answers to Mr. Mueller's investigators in November, he said that he did not recall being aware during the campaign of any direct or indirect communications between Mr. Stone and anyone he understood to be a representative of WikiLeaks. The president also denied knowing whether anyone associated with his campaign, including Mr. Stone, had direct or indirect contact with WikiLeaks about the hacked emails.
But in Mr. Stone's indictment two months later, Mr. Mueller's office revealed a link between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks' parallel efforts to damage the Hillary Clinton campaign using material stolen from Russians. After WikiLeaks had published its first tranche of stolen emails, "a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information" WikiLeaks had about the Clinton campaign, the indictment said.
The indictment also said that Mr. Stone later told the Trump campaign "about potential future releases of damaging material" by WikiLeaks. "A load every week going forward," Mr. Stone wrote to Stephen K. Bannon, the campaign chairman, in early October 2016, according to emails previously obtained by The New York Times. WikiLeaks began releasing more emails days later.
Mr. Stone also told Mr. Trump over the phone that WikiLeaks was about to publish a huge trove of email that would damage the Clinton campaign, according to congressional testimony in February by Mr. Trump's former lawyer Michael D. Cohen, who also pleaded guilty, including about making false statements, and cooperated with investigators. Mr. Cohen said he witnessed the phone call. Mr. Stone has said Mr. Cohen lied to Congress about it.
House Democrats have been divided about whether to open an impeachment inquiry. Looming over their debate has been recognition of a political reality: While they could impeach Mr. Trump, leaving a historical black mark on his record, it is very unlikely that the Republican-controlled Senate would remove him.
Against that backdrop, Mr. Mueller's answer to Ms. Demings -- a rare moment in which he went beyond his report -- has added to other potential episodes Democrats are weighing as potential issues to focus on in such an inquiry.
Trying to Fire Mueller
Many of Mr. Trump's actions that Democrats are scrutinizing fall into a category of obstruction of justice. Both presidents subjected to impeachment proceedings in the modern era, Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Clinton, were accused of obstruction.
For example, in June 2017, after learning from news reports that the special counsel was investigating him for possible obstruction of justice, Mr. Trump ordered his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, to tell the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to oust Mr. Mueller for purported conflicts of interest. Mr. McGahn refused and prepared to resign before the president backed down.
The Mueller report suggested that this episode met the criteria for attempted obstruction, citing evidence that Mr. Trump "knew he should not have made those calls" to Mr. McGahn. The firing attempt "had the potential to delay further action in the investigation, chill the actions of any replacement special counsel or otherwise impede the investigation," investigators wrote.
Trying to Gut the Mueller Investigation
Also in June 2017, Mr. Trump twice asked his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to relay a surreptitious order to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Sessions to intervene and stop Mr. Mueller's investigation. Mr. Lewandowski did not deliver either message.
The Mueller report suggested that Mr. Trump's requests met the criteria for attempted obstruction, citing "substantial evidence" that he was trying "to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the president's and his campaign's conduct."
Bullying McGahn to Falsify Evidence
In January 2018, after Mr. Trump's previous attempt to have Mr. Mueller fired came to light in news reports, Mr. Trump pushed Mr. McGahn to write an internal White House memo denying the reports and threatened to fire him if he did not comply, the report said. Mr. McGahn -- who was talking to Mr. Mueller's investigators about Mr. Trump's conduct -- refused, saying the news reports were accurate. The president backed down.
The Mueller report suggests that Mr. Trump was trying to obstruct the investigation by getting Mr. McGahn to create a document that would either constrain him from testifying truthfully, or damage his credibility as a witness if he testified in accordance with his memory but in conflict with the memo.
Encouraging Manafort Not to Cooperate
After Mr. Mueller indicted Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump dangled the possibility of pardoning him while praising him for not "flipping." Though Mr. Manafort eventually pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate, prosecutors said he continued to lie. The Mueller report suggests this met the criteria for obstruction, too.
Conspiring to Violate Campaign Finance Laws
Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign-finance laws by arranging hush payments before the election to a pornographic film actress and a Playboy model who said they had extramarital affairs with Mr. Trump. The payments were intended to influence the election, exceeded donation limits and were not reported as campaign expenditures, prosecutors said.
Mr. Cohen has testified, and prosecutors have agreed, that he was acting at Mr. Trump's direction. But Mr. Trump, who has denied that the payments were campaign-related, is protected from being charged as a co-conspirator because the Justice Department says sitting presidents are temporarily immune.
Stonewalling Congressional Subpoenas
One other category of potential obstruction falls outside the Mueller report: Mr. Trump's avowed strategy of systematically fighting "all" subpoenas from Congress after Democrats won control of the House. His administration has denied that Congress has legitimate authority to seek information aimed at uncovering potential wrongdoing.
It is routine for presidents to sometimes resist a subpoena by asserting executive privilege and then litigate the matter in court. Still, there is precedent for Congress to decide that, at some point, stonewalling goes too far: The third article of impeachment the Judiciary Committee approved in 1974 against Nixon accused him of unlawfully defying its subpoenas.

Texto completo: The Santa Fe Opera's artistic director, Alexander Neef, has been named general director of the renowned Paris Opera, starting in late 2021.
He will stay on at the Santa Fe Opera at least through the summer 2021 season, spokeswoman Sullivan Peraino said.
In a statement issued late Wednesday on Neef's selection to lead one of the world's largest opera houses, Santa Fe Opera board President Susan Marineau lauded Neef and said, "This will create an unparalleled opportunity for collaboration between Santa Fe and Paris."
Neef reportedly plans to leave the Toronto-based Canadian Opera Co., where he has been general director since 2008. His responsibilities in Santa Fe and in Toronto did not overlap because the operations hold their seasons at different times of year.
He joined the Santa Fe Opera as artistic director-designate in February 2018, after new General Director Robert K. Meya restructured the organization's senior leadership, adding both an artistic director and a music director -- a post filled by Harry Bicket. Neef became artistic director in October.
Neither Neef nor Meya returned requests for comment Wednesday.
In its news release, the opera said Neef has helped Meya and Bicket create plans through the 2022 season so far, and by the time he takes on his new position in Paris, he will have helped develop artistic programming through 2025.
"I am thrilled to have planned five seasons with Alexander," Meya said in the release, "and I look forward to our continued collaboration once he takes the helm at Paris National Opera. His selection is a great compliment to the Santa Fe Opera and further extends our global recognition as one of the world's leading opera festivals."
Neef had a prior stint at the Paris Opera from 2004-08 as casting director under Gerard Mortier, who was general director at that time and had been a mentor to Neef at a German art and music festival.
"It's a pretty emotional day, obviously," Neef told the New York Times on Wednesday. "It's a big honor and a big responsibility. ... What I really look forward to is reconnecting with the people [in Paris]."
France 24, an English-language news website, reported that French President Emmanuel Macron was personally involved in Neef's selection.
Neef told the New York Times that Macron had interviewed him for
45 minutes.
In the Santa Fe Opera's news release, Neef touted the organization.
"The Santa Fe Opera has provided such a great opportunity to be involved in opera in this very unique and special setting," Neef said. "As the premiere opera festival in North America, it has afforded me a set of experiences I would not have been able to obtain elsewhere."
Born and raised in Germany, Neef graduated from the University of Tübingen, where he studied Latin and history, and began his career in opera working as artistic administrator for Mortier at the Ruhrtriennale, a two-month arts and music festival in the Ruhr area of Germany. Neef later followed Mortier to the Paris Opera.
Mortier was preparing to assume the direction of the New York City Opera in late 2008 but unexpectedly withdrew his candidacy. Neef had been set to follow him, but he was invited instead to head the Canadian Opera Co. and accepted that post.

Texto completo: Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., should send a letter to Fox News saying the following: Do more investigative journalism. Break more news.
That is the most logical recourse in light of her questioning Wednesday of former special counsel Robert Mueller. True to both his own preference and Justice Department instructions, Mueller - at least in his testimony Wednesday morning before the House Judiciary Committee - stuck closely to the text of his two-volume report, which was released in April in redacted form. "I direct you to the report" was Mueller's mantra for these proceedings.
But the report is the problem, Lesko suggested in her five allotted minutes of questioning:
LESKO: Mr. Mueller, rather than purely relying on the evidence provided by witnesses and documents, I think you relied a lot on media. I'd like to know how many times you cited the Washington Post in your report.
MUELLER: How many times I what?
LESKO: Cited the Washington Post in your report.
MUELLER: I do not have knowledge of that figure . . . . I don't have knowledge of that figure.
LESKO: I counted about 60 times. How many times did you cite the New York Times?
MUELLER: Again, I have no idea.
LESKO: I counted about 75 times. How many times did you cite Fox News?
MUELLER: As with the other two, I have no idea.
LESKO: About 25 times. I've got to say, it looks like Volume II is mostly regurgitated press stories. Honestly, there's almost nothing in Volume II that I couldn't already hear or know simply by having a $50 cable news subscription. However, your investigation cost the American taxpayers $25 million.
Mr. Mueller, you cited media reports nearly 200 times in your report, then in a footnote, a small footnote, No. 7, page 15 of Vol 11, you wrote, I quote: "This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information contained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump's response to those stories in context." Since nobody but lawyers reads footnotes, are you concerned that the American public took the embedded news stories at face value?
At that point, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., cut off the questioning, insisting that the hearing was running short on time.
Lesko was wrong: The Post's nonlawyer Erik Wemple Blog read that footnote and addressed it in a two-part evaluation of the Mueller report's implications for the media, on May 13 and 14. It's true: Fox News was cited far less than either the New York Times or The Post. I wrote:
"The Mueller report credits not a single piece of investigative work among the 16 Fox News and Fox Business Network pieces cited in the report's footnotes. Many of the hits are interviews conducted by the hosts of "Fox & Friends" and by Sean Hannity, perhaps the country's foremost cheerleader for Trump. Several others stem from interviews with Trump and then-incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus by Chris Wallace, the no-nonsense host of 'Fox News Sunday,' during the presidential transition."
Underlying Lesko's line of questioning is the idea that, somehow, an investigative document should cite Fox News in equal proportion to The Post and/or the New York Times. But the problem with any such premise is that Fox News doesn't do investigative journalism in the manner of major U.S. newspapers. It reads the news broken by other outlets, then feasts on it. (Worth noting: The report made clear that other TV networks besides Fox didn't measure up to newspapers' investigative outputs either.)
And as for the footnote language cited by Lesko: Volume II is indeed a tour through Trump's various freak-outs as the Mueller team went about its work. For instance: In June 2017, The Post reported that Mueller and his team were looking into whether Trump had obstructed justice. A heading on the Mueller report itself makes clear why this report was germane to the investigation: "The Press Reports that the President is Being Investigated for Obstruction of Justice and the President Directs the White House Counsel to Have the Special Counsel Removed."
See how that works, Rep. Lesko? News organizations didn't sit around waiting for Mueller to finish his business. They conducted a parallel investigation into Trump's actions, an investigation that had already surfaced many, though not all, of the revelations in the Mueller report.
The role of Fox News was primarily to toss cold water on the significance of other outlets' scoops. Such is not the sort of work that earns citations in a special counsel's report.

Texto completo: The NBA, according to a report in the New York Times, has begun an investigation into how teams handled free agency this summer, focusing on whether improper inducements were offered to players to circumvent the salary cap, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation.
The issue was raised by multiple team owners at a meeting of the league's board of governors this month in Las Vegas, according to the person, who requested anonymity because of a lack of authorization to speak publicly on the subject.
ESPN first reported on the existence of the investigation.
There were also multiple reports this month suggesting that Kawhi Leonard's representatives, in arranging his blockbuster move from the Toronto Raptors to the Los Angeles Clippers, had asked for perks that would violate the league's collective bargaining agreement.
ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, citing "people in NBA circles," said on the air that Leonard's uncle Dennis Robertson (known in NBA circles as "Uncle Dennis") had asked other teams for houses, planes and guaranteed sponsorship money. Smith added, "I have no idea whether this is true or not."
In another report, The Sports Network in Canada said Robertson had asked for "things players don't generally ask for in standard contract negotiations," without specifying what those things might be.
SWIMMING
MORE PODIUM DRAMA » There was more podium drama at the world swimming championships on Tuesday (South Korea time) as British bronze medallist Duncan Scott refused to shake hands with Sun Yang after the Chinese swimmer's victory in the 200 meters freestyle in Gwangju, South Korea.
Sun, who is swimming under a cloud in Gwangju with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) set to hear a doping case against him in September, came home second in the 200 but got the win when Lithuanian Danas Rapsys was disqualified for a false start.
At the medal ceremony, Scott shook hands with fellow bronze medallist Martin Malyutin of Russia, who finished with the same time as the Briton, but then completely cold shouldered Sun, refusing to make eye contact and not offering a handshake.
Sun was livid, yelling and gesturing at the 22-year-old Scott, and later confronting him as the medallists walked off the podium towards the stairs leading to the pool deck.
"You loser, I'm winning, yes," he spat at Scott, who ignored the taunt and kept walking with his hands behind his back.
The incident comes after Australian Mack Horton refused to share the podium with Sun after the Chinese swimmer won the 400 freestyle on Sunday.
 Olympic and defending world champion Ryan Murphy was upset in the men's 100 backstroke at the world championships in Gwangju, South Korea. Xu Jiayu of China won in 52.43 seconds. Evgeny Rylov of Russia took silver and Mitch Larkin of Australia got bronze.
Murphy, who was under his own world-record pace at the turn, faded to fourth. Fellow American Matt Grevers was fifth.
 In the women's 100 back, Kylie Masse of Canada won in 58.60. Kathleen Baker of the U.S., the world record holder, tied for sixth after being tied for the lead at the turn.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL
SAN JOSE STATE PICKED LAST IN MOUNTAIN WEST >> The 2019 Mountain West Conference football standings could look an awful lot like last last season including another last-place finish for San Jose State according to the preseason media poll announced on Tuesday in Las Vegas.
The poll projects Fresno State and Boise State to defend their division titles as well as repeat last-place finishes for the Spartans and New Mexico. In all, eight of the 12 MW teams are predicted to finish where they did in 2018.
San Jose State is coming off a 1-11 season that saw the Spartans go 1-7 in conference play and end the year on a four-game losing streak.
SOCCER
PULISIC MAKES FIRST START WITH CHELSEA >> American midfielder Christian Pulisic made his first start for Chelsea in a 2-1 exhibition loss to Barcelona at Saitama, Japan. Pulisic, 20-year-old from Hershey, Pennsylvania, played on the left flank. He was replaced by Olivier Giroud in the 60th minute. Pulisic was acquired by Chelsea in January from Borussia Dortmund for a $73 million transfer fee.
MESSI BANNED ONE GAME FOR COPA AMERICA RED CARD >> Argentina captain Lionel Messi has been banned for one game and fined $1,500 after being sent off against Chile in the Copa America third-place playoff and leveling accusations of "corruption" at South American soccer chiefs. The ban is expected to be served in Argentina's first qualifier for the 2022 World Cup.
GOLF
LOWRY BOWS OUT OF WGC-FEDEX ST. JUDE INVITATIONAL >> Shane Lowry, coming off his first major victory at the Open Championship, withdrew Tuesday from this week's World Golf Championships-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in Memphis, Tennessee. Tiger Woods, Rickie Fowler and Francesco Molinari are among those not competing this week.
BAY AREA PLAYERS REACH MATCH PLAY AT U.S. GIRLS JUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIPS >> Sabrina Iqbal (142) of San Jose, Gia Feliciano (147) of Concord and Madelyn Gamble (149) of Pleasant Hill advanced through stroke play in the U.S. Girls Junior Championship at SentryWorld GC in Stevens Points, Wisconsin. The three will start the match play portion today.
OLYMPIC SPORTS
WHITE PUSHES FORWARD ON OLYMPIC SKATEBOARDING TRACK >> Shaun White is pressing forward with plans to shoot for the Summer Olympics in skateboarding. White said on NBC's "Today" show that he'll compete at world championships in September "and see what happens" before deciding whether to try to earn a spot on the U.S. team for skateboarding's Olympic debut next summer in Tokyo.
BOXING
FIGHTER DIES AFTER SUFFERING INJURIES IN BOUT >> Boxer Maxim Dadashev died, two days after suffering a brain injury in a fight in Maryland. He was 28. The Russian Boxing Federation said Dadashev suffered a brain swelling in Friday's light-welterweight fight with Subriel Matias at the Theater at MGM National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Maryland. He underwent surgery but his heart stopped Tuesday, the federation said.
Dadashev was hospitalized at UM Prince George's Hospital Center shortly after the fight, which was stopped by his corner following the 11th round after Dadashev took numerous shots to the head.
COLLEGE BASKETBALL
NCAA PUNISHES DEPAUL >> The NCAA suspended DePaul men's basketball coach Dave Leitao for the first three games of the regular season Tuesday, saying he should have done more to prevent recruiting violations by his staff. The NCAA also put the Big East program on three years of probation, issued a $5,000 fine and said an undetermined number of games will be vacated because DePaul put an ineligible player on the floor.
BYU'S EMERY DROPS BASKETBALL >> Guard Nick Emery, who accepted $12,000 in impermissible benefits leading to BYU being placed on probation, announced that he is retiring from the sport. He sat out the 2017-18 season for what he described as "personal reasons." Meanwhile, the NCAA Committee on Infractions was investigating BYU and found that boosters provided Emery with $12,000 in vacations, cash, meals, golf and use of vehicles.
Last November, the NCAA placed BYU on probation for two years and forced the school to vacate 47 victories from Emery's first two seasons in the program.
NHL
MAPLE LEAFS ACQUIRE CLARKSON >> The Toronto Maple Leafs traded for the contract of one of their former players, right wing David Clarkson, in a deal that sent backup goaltender Garret Sparks to the Vegas Golden Knights.
PREDATORS SIGN SISSONS TO 7-YEAR DEAL » The Nashville Predators signed forward Colton Sissons to a seven-year, $20 million contract. The Predators avoided arbitration and locked up the 25-year-old through 2025-26.

Estos pandilleros le sacaron el corazón a un migrante con un machete

Texto completo: La ciudad de Los Ángeles no había visto tal brutalidad en décadas: asesinatos con machetes, bates de béisbol, cuchillos, tubos de metal; pandilleros que torturan a sus víctimas hasta la muerte y luego les sacan el corazón.
El fiscal del gobierno federal asignado al distrito centro de California, Nick Hanah, reveló el pasado 16 de julio los atroces crímenes de la Clica Fulton, la fracción más violenta y numerosa de la pandilla MS-13, también conocida como la Mara Salvatrucha.
La acusación contra 22 miembros de la Clica Fulton enlista crímenes que van desde el vandalismo, el tráfico de drogas y la extorsión hasta el asesinato de siete personas, seis de los cuales eran inmigrantes. Todos han sido detenidos y se encuentran bajo custodia, reportó el diario The New York Times.
Las detenciones han sido resultado de más de un año de investigaciones que involucraron a agencias federales, estatales y locales.
“Ya hemos sacado de las calles a casi dos docenas de personas asociadas con el brazo más violento de la MS-13 en Los Ángeles, donde se cree que la pandilla asesinó a 24 personas en los últimos dos años”, dijo Hanah en un comunicado de prensa.
Al jurado, sin embargo, sólo se le presentaron los casos de siete víctimas de homicidio, reportó el diario citado.
Los pandilleros llevaban a sus víctimas al Bosque Nacional de Los Ángeles. En una ocasión, secuestraron a un miembro de otra pandilla y lo ahogaron, posteriormente lo llevaron al bosque y allí lo descuartizaron, le arrancaron el corazón con un machete y arrojaron sus restos a un barranco. Su crimen había sido rayar una pinta o grafiti de la Clica Fulton.
Para entrar a la pandilla, los posibles nuevos reclutas tenían que probar su valor asesinando a un enemigo o adversario de la MS-13.
Aunque esto podía variar desde un miembro de otra pandilla hasta un indigente con la mala suerte de cruzarse en su camino, como sucedió con un hombre sin hogar que vivía en un parque “controlado por la pandilla”, dijo Hanah.
La mayoría, 19 de los 22, son inmigrantes indocumentados de entre 19 y 24 años y no tiene más de cinco años que llegaron al país. Recientemente, dijo el fiscal Hanah, la pandilla aumentó sus filas y su actividad criminal “con el flujo de jóvenes migrantes provenientes de Centroamérica”, reportó la cadena británica BBC Mundo.
“La mayor tragedia en estos casos es que estos jóvenes víctimas probablemente dejaron sus países de origen con la esperanza de que en los Estados Unidos encontrarían seguridad y prosperidad”, dijo la Fiscal del Distrito del Condado de Los Ángeles, Jackie Lacey.
“En cambio, estas víctimas tuvieron la desgracia de cruzar caminos con pandilleros violentos que se aprovecharon de las vulnerabilidades de su experiencia de inmigrante”.
Pero, a pesar del recrudecimiento de la violencia de pandillas como la Clica Fulton, en general, hay menos homicidios hoy Lós Ángeles que en la década de los años 90, cuando las pandillas dominaban , señaló a BBC Thom Mrozek, portavoz del Fiscal General del Departamento de Justicia para el distrito centro de California.

Gavels Drop And Questions Start Coming

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- After two years of silence and one brief public statement, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will finally sit for prolonged questioning at two House hearings on Wednesday. Though he has expressed reluctance about testifying and has vowed to discuss only the contents of his 448-page investigation report, his appearances are nonetheless highly anticipated. Members of Congress will be trying to find ways to highlight the report's findings or undermine them.
The Basics
When: The House Judiciary Committee hearing starts at 8:30 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday and is expected to last about three hours, followed by a short break and the House Intelligence Committee hearing at noon for about two hours.
Where: Capitol Hill
Who: The Democratic chairmen of the two committees, Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Adam B. Schiff of California, will set the tone and lead the questioning for both sessions. But Republicans are preparing to try to counter them, led by Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia and Devin Nunes of California, with an assist from Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the most vocal critics of the Russia investigation.
How to watch: The New York Times will stream Mr. Mueller's testimony, and our reporters will provide live context and analysis.
What They'll Talk About
■ Obstruction. Much of the discussion at the first hearing, in the Judiciary Committee, is expected to revolve around the second volume of Mr. Mueller's report, an exhaustive account of the president's attempts to impede investigators. Mr. Mueller and his team did not decide whether Mr. Trump's efforts amounted to criminal obstruction of justice but also declined to exonerate him.
■ Collusion. The Intelligence Committee will focus on the first volume of the report, which described Russia's 2016 election interference. Investigators found repeated contacts between Russian intermediaries and the Trump campaign, whose advisers welcomed the help and expected to benefit from it, but not sufficient evidence to prove a conspiracy.
■ Mr. Mueller is expected to hew closely to his report, though lawmakers do not intend to make his testimony that easy for him. In May, during his only public appearance as special counsel, Mr. Mueller framed that document as his testimony to Congress and said he hoped that he would not have to testify.
■ The Democrats want Mr. Mueller to bring to life the most serious acts of possible obstruction in the report. They believe that many Americans lack a full understanding of Mr. Trump's efforts to impede the inquiry and that Mr. Mueller's recounting of it will leave an impression on voters. They may also try to push the taciturn Mr. Mueller to more clearly state whether Mr. Trump could have been charged with obstruction if not for Justice Department guidelines that say a sitting president cannot be prosecuted.
■ The Republicans want to focus on parts of the report they view as beneficial to the president: namely Mr. Mueller's decision not to charge anyone with conspiracy. But they have a litany of other questions about the investigation itself, beginning with its length. Republicans disagree about how hard to go after Mr. Mueller, but intend to ask about potential anti-Trump bias in the F.B.I. and among prosecutors on his team, many of whom have worked for or donated to Democratic causes, and some of the questions could get combative.
What Success Looks Like For ...
Democrats
Their chief accomplishment would be getting Mr. Mueller to say that the president would have been charged with a crime if not for the Justice Department guidelines. But they also hope that he gives tacit or explicit endorsement of an impeachment investigation by Congress. Both are unlikely. More realistically, Democrats want average Americans watching at home to come away outraged by the president's behavior.
Republicans
The status quo. Republicans believe that if Mr. Mueller simply reiterates his report and keeps from helping Democrats, they have succeeded. They also hope to sow doubt about the fairness of Mr. Mueller's investigation itself.
Mr. Mueller
Be boring, very boring. Mr. Mueller wants to avoid entanglement in the political fray and leave with his reputation for independence unblemished.
Until then
■ Here are 19 questions we have for Mr. Mueller.
■ Familiarize yourself with some of the names that will almost surely be tossed around.
■ Or dive into the full 448-page report. We made it searchable.
■ Mr. Trump and 18 of his associates had at least 140 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, during the 2016 campaign and presidential transition.
■ Lastly, the president's efforts exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice. A New York Times examination revealed the extent of a sustained, secretive assault by Mr. Trump on the machinery of federal law enforcement.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: A Louisiana policeman who suggested on Face-book that high-profile U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez needed to be shot was fired on Monday, along with a second officer who "liked" his post.
Officers Charles Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the Gretna Police Department who made the social media comment on Thursday, and Angelo Varisco, who "liked" it, were terminated following a swift internal investigation, Chief Arthur Lawson told a news conference.
"This incident we feel has been an embarrassment to our department. These officers acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted a sitting U.S. congresswoman," Lawson said.
He said an internal investigation had found that both men were in violation of the police department's social media policy, on which they had been trained. The department would consider further instruction on the issue for the rest of its employees, Lawson said.
The incident came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump touched off a furor by tweeting that Ocasio-Cortez and three of her colleagues in Congress, all women of color, should "go back" where they came from if they were unhappy in the United States.
Three of the lawmakers - Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan - were born in the United States. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota came as a refugee from Somalia and is a naturalized citizen.
Rispoli, who was responding to post about Ocasio-Cortez by the satirical news website tatersgonnatate.com that suggested the Democratic lawmaker thought U.S. troops were overpaid, wrote: "She needs a round - and I don't mean the kind she used to serve."
Ocasio-Cortez worked as a waitress and bartender in New York City before stunning the political establishment by beating 10-term incumbent Democrat Joe Crowley in the party's primary for his seat in the 14th congressional district covering Queens and the Bronx.
Lawson said at the news conference that the police department in Gretna, a city of some 18,000 people just across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, had been inundated with calls and messages over the incendiary Facebook post.
Gretna Mayor Wayne Rau told the New York Times he was "appalled" by the post, which he said did not represent the city or police department.
Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated Republican Anthony Pappas to be become at 29 the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, has since become one of the highest-profile left-wing Democrats in Washington and a lightning-rod for criticism from conservatives.
The congresswoman, who is typically active on social media, did not appear to respond to Rispoli's post or his termination on Monday. Representatives for Ocasio-Cortez at her offices in Washington and New York could not be reached for comment.

Robyn reveals how fans influenced her performance ahead of upcoming Forum concert: ‘I made the song, but they gave it the meaning’

Texto completo: Robyn took eight years to record her most recent album “Honey,” but when she called from Brussels last month on a European tour that all seemed like ancient history to the Swedish dance pop star. She returns to Southern California for her third date here this year on July 27.
“I feel like I have talked about it enough,” she says of the circumstances — the death of a close friend, a romantic partnership on the rocks — that led to the break from her acclaimed album “Body Talk” in 2010 and the follow-up that landed in October. “But I will say some things about it.
“It was a very particular time of my life, which I’m really thankful for,” Robyn says. “I was also in a privileged situation where I could take time off — a lot of people can’t do that. I really had the means and the space to explore things, and get to know myself better, which is such a luxury and something I really don’t regret at all.”
Her show at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, July 27 follows a pair of shows at the Palladium in Los Angeles in February where fans heard many of the songs on “Honey” live for the first time. It was clear then as it was on the record that with “Honey” she had taken the difficulties with which she’d wrestled and used that make music that over its dance beats and rhythms offered comfort, hope and joy.
“I think in order to talk about the things that are difficult, sadness and pain and stuff, sometimes you do it from a really unconscious place, but for me it was important to know what it was I wanted to talk about,” she says. “I wanted it to have that depth because I think it’s like the thing you can do as an artist for the people that listen to your music.
“You can make discoveries about yourself, and then you can present them to people in a way where they can explore things that they might recognize they felt before, or things that they haven’t felt before but when you describe it to them they know.”
We should note that Robyn’s music isn’t sad or bittersweet so much as cathartic. Singer Sam Smith, who works a similar vein in the pop mines, told the New York Times in a story about Robyn last year that what makes her brilliant is her “mixture of sadness and euphoria,” two sides of life that Robyn says are essential to each other.
“It’s just how I experience life,” she says. “For me, it’s not a constant. It’s kind of like I think melancholy, and also happiness or sadness or whatever, they don’t feel as good if the other thing isn’t there.
“Only sadness, it can be really, really painful,” Robyn says. “Only happiness can be really weird as well. There’s always the other side and I think those are the most interesting moments, when you can feel both of those things together.”
On “Honey,” though, she consciously moved in a lighter direction, she says.
“I think there’s another space which I’m exploring now, and I think a little bit more on this record, which is not as dramatic,” Robyn says. “I may have people thinking I’m not doing well” — she laughs — “but for me it'[s important to find something that’s less dramatic, that’s more about fun.
“Not fun like no problems, but like playfulness, like a sense of relaxation,” she says. “Which I think (the title song) ‘Honey’ is about and other things on this album as well.”
The Forum show will be similar to the Palladium dates, though the set has changed in the five months since then.
“When we played the Palladium, we were still adding and changing things, so it will be different,” Robyn says. “A lot is similar but we’ve played so many shows since then, so to me the show has matured.”
One constant highlight is how she and her band include the crowd in the performance of “Dancing On My Own,” a song from the “Body Talk” album on which the band drops out for the chorus to let the crowd sing, a truly chills-inducing moment in her show. That song, in which its protagonist is in the club watch an ex-lover dance with another, has been taken over by her fans in ways she says she never imagined.
“I really didn’t know or understand what ‘Dancing On My Own’ has meant to my fans,” she says. “But I understand from people telling me. So whether it’s me watching, like, people dance in a subway or Instagram about a night out listening to my music, those are things I see, and then, of course, I feel the response from the audience when I’m touring.”
On the “Body Talk” tour there were moments where the audience sang so loudly she could hardly hear herself, so sometimes Robyn and the band simply stopped playing for a few bars. For this tour, they decided to make it a feature of the song.
“It’s like they’re singing the song back to us, which is also a way of acknowledging them, and what they have done with the song in their lives,” she says. “(It’s) what happens when I’m not there. What happens when they’re in a karaoke bar or with friends, or they’re listening to the song at home.
“That’s something that I never get to see,” Robyn says. “It’s like a moment to share that. I made the song, but they gave it the meaning or whatever it has in their life.”

Texto completo: Melania y Donald Trump anunciaron el lunes que celebrarán su segunda Cena de Estado en septiembre, celebrando su tercer año en la Casa Blanca. Para ese momento, los Obama ya habían celebrado cinco .
La primera dama Melania Trump, a última hora de la tarde del lunes, no había tuiteado sobre el evento, pero el anuncio de la Casa Blanca decía: “El Presidente y la Primera Dama darán la bienvenida al Primer Ministro de Australia y a la señora Morrison a la Casa Blanca el 20 de septiembre de 2019 para una visita oficial, que incluirá una cena de estado”.
Se espera que Melania Trump, quien recibió algunas críticas sobre cómo planeó la primera Cena de Eestado para el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron , y su esposa, siga la tradición y se haga cargo de la segunda cena de estado también.
“La Primera Dama y su personal son responsables de la elaborada planificación de la ceremonia de la cena estatal” , afirma un artículo de la Asociación Histórica de la Casa Blanca. “Estas cenas formales implican la creación de invitaciones y listas de invitados, menús, flores, mesas, asientos y entretenimiento para la noche. La Primera Dama trabaja estrechamente con su secretaria social, el personal de la residencia ejecutiva y el Departamento de Estado para coordinar cada detalle. de este evento muy especial”.
“La visita celebrará la estrecha amistad y la historia compartida de nuestros dos países y reafirmará nuestra visión común para la paz mundial, la seguridad y la prosperidad”, indica la publicación de la Casa Blanca.
Melania Trump fue criticada en abril de 2018 por la corta lista de invitados de la primera Cena de Estado, que no incluía miembros demócratas del Congreso.
La entonces vocera de la primera dama, Stephanie Grisham, desmintió las posibles dudas sobre el éxito de Melania Trump en la planificación del evento.
“Probablemente no vamos a obtener el crédito que merecemos, pero sé que este equipo es excelente y ella sabe que este equipo es excelente”, dijo Grisham a The New York Times. “No hemos fallado, y ella no ha fallado”.

WVW School Lunch Controversy Still Making National News

Texto completo: Luzerne County remained in the national spotlight on Monday, unable to shake the negative attention generated by Wyoming Valley West’s recent threat to send children to foster over unpaid school lunch debt.
The cable news channel CNN aired a segment about the controversy in which Luzerne County Manager David Pedri vowed Children and Youth officials will never strip parents of their children over school lunch debts.
“This is not something we do. The foster care system should be used as a shield to protect children, not as a sword. Foster care should never be used as a weapon,” Pedri told CNN.
In recent days, the controversy has been covered by some of the nation’s most prominent media outlets, such as the NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News on television and the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers.
Presidential candidate Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders even weighed in on Twitter.
“School lunch debt should not exist in the wealthiest country in the history of the world,” Sanders wrote. “When we are in the White House, we are going to provide year-round, free universal school meals.”

Overhaul justice system that failed Garner

Texto completo: We all watched while Eric Garner desperately pleaded with New York Police Department's Dan Pantaleo to stop choking him. Garner called out 11 times "I can't breathe," each cry with an intensity that made it not just difficult to witness but maddening. I yelled at the TV screen, shouting at the officers to let him go — trying to avoid seeing the inevitable. Garner died because law enforcement refused to see him as a human being who deserved a life. Refused to see him as a father. A husband. A son. A friend. A human being.
On July 16, the world learned that the officer, Pantaleo, would not face any federal charges in connection with the 2014 killing of Garner, and will likely be able to continue his career in the NYPD. Our justice system is still refusing to see Garner's life as one that was worth saving.
People and organizations stepped up to fight for Garner and his family. His daughter, Erica Garner, championed the crusade — #JusticeForEricGarner. She pushed a generation of us to show up for our loved ones. She endorsed Bernie Sanders, who eventually became a very outspoken supporter of the movement during the 2016 election cycle. She was even featured in one of his campaign videos.
She participated in Black Lives Matter protests, she led them, and she supported them. She promised she would fight for her father until he received justice or until she was in her grave. We all admired Erica. Many of us who didn't know her father built a relationship with him through her work. When she passed away after a heart attack in 2017, we were all devastated. How could this powerful young woman who had been fighting for her father die so damn young? We knew her work would continue through so many people and organizations, and many of us hoped that Erica's fight and her death would not be in vain.
The news that Pantaleo would not be charged, while disturbing, is not surprising. We have seen time and time again that no matter how heinous the crime against black communities by law enforcement, the lack of accountability is steadfast. But the system was never meant to protect us, and while we should continue to make demands of district attorneys and the Department of Justice, we should also aim to overhaul and rebuild our justice system into one that no longer relies on a bloated police state that targets the black community.
An overhaul would allow us to imagine a world where Garner wouldn't have to sell "illegal cigarettes" to make ends meet. We could build a system in which Erica Garner wouldn't have to fight for her father's legacy and then die too young. All of our community needs would be met, and we would no longer be policed for being poor.
Working toward the overhaul of our current system should remind us that we all deserve to breathe. Eric Garner deserved to breathe. And we will continue to fight for his legacy and for his daughter's — legacies that centered on struggle and hope and justice.

Texto completo: Paul Krassner, the satirist, writer and American counterculture icon, died Sunday at his home in Desert Hot Springs. He had recently transitioned to hospice after an illness.
His daughter, Holly Krassner Dawson, confirmed the news to the Associated Press. He is survived by his daughter and his wife, Nancy Cain.
Krassner, who was 87, was described by Harry Shearer, a voice actor on "The Simpsons," in an introduction to Krassner's book as "a unique character on the American cultural landscape."
"A self-described 'investigative satirist,' he straddles the lines between politics, culture, pornography and drugs — in other words, the land where all of us, were we really honest with ourselves, would choose to dwell," Shearer wrote.
Krassner satirized and fought for many of the same trends that have popped up again in today's culture, ranging from abortion access to recreational drug use.
He was on the front-lines of the 1960s counterculture, helping to tie together the young, loose-knit prankster group named the Yippies or the Youth International Party in 1967. The group gained notoriety briefly for stunts like running a pig for president and throwing dollar bills onto the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
In 2003 — the start of the Iraq War — Krassner began speaking to college audiences along with other surviving Yippies. He told the New York Times: "This is the antiwar equivalent of a veterans' group. It's strange to be 70 and still identifying with a youth movement. But I'd rather identify with evolution than stagnation."
By the end of the 1960s, while others softened their political fronts, Krassner moved forward becoming a public speaker, journalist, stand-up comedian and author of nearly a dozen books.
Much of his work was rooted in his advocacy of unmitigated free speech, recreational drug use and personal pornography.
Krassner told the Associated Press in 2013 that he was just a guy who enjoyed making people laugh while bringing a "political activist's conscience to the effort."
In that interview, he noted that in the early 1960s, when abortion was illegal in almost every state, he ran an underground abortion referral service for women.
"That really was a turning point in my life because I had morphed from a satirist into an activist," he said.
In a 2012 article titled "Abortion," Krassner wrote that he was experiencing déjà vu in terms of the cultural state of abortions as a dozen states passed restrictions on abortions the year prior, sparking a new debate on the issue. Decades prior, Krassner wrote about abortion in 1962 in his satirical publication "The Realist" when abortion was illegal in nearly every state. He published an anonymous interview with Dr. Robert Spencer, an abortionist who was known as 'The Saint' at that time.
"After my interview with Dr. Spencer was published, I began to get phone calls from scared female voices," Krassner recalled in his 2012 article. "They were all in desperate search of a safe abortionist. It was preposterous that they should have to seek out the editor of a satirical magazine, but their quest so far had been futile, and they simply didn't know where else to turn. With Dr. Spencer's permission, I referred them to him."
His satirical journalism-turned-activism didn't stop there. And when Life magazine published a profile of Krassner in 1968, it prompted an FBI agent to submit a letter to the editor that was never published. Krassner found that letter years later when he obtained his FBI file under a Freedom of Information Act request.
The letter said: "To classify Krassner as some sort of 'social revel' is for too cute. He's a nut, a raving, unconfined nut. As for any possible intellectual rewards to be gleaned from The Realist — much better prose may be found on lavatory walls."
Krasser was entertained by the description and used it to name his autobiography: "Confessions of a Raving Unconfined Nut." His most recent book, "Who's to Say What's Obscene?" was published in 2009.
In the New York Times' obituary on Krassner, he is described as helping to "propogate a certain absurdist sensibility that encouraged people like the cartoonists R. Crumb and Art Spiegelman and the comedian George Carlin to be more daring in mocking the insanities and hypocrisies of war, politics and much of modern life."
But Krassner never intended to become the satirical journalist. He wanted to be a musician. He was a child prodigy on the violin and performed at Carnegie Hall at the age of six. He studied journalism at New York's Baruch College, then went to work for Mad Magazine, whose target audience were teens. In 1958, he founded The Realist, a satirical magazine for adults. He continued to publish it on and off until the 1980s.
For a short time in the 1950s, he appeared on the stand-up comedy circuit. That is when he met his mentor Lenny Bruce, whom the Associated Press described as "The legendary outlaw comic who pushed free speech to its limits with routines filled with obscenities and sexual innuendo that sometimes landed him in jail."
Krassner also was the publisher behind the poster showing Disney cartoon characters engaging in sex acts to honor the death of Walt Disney in 1966.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Tech fans of a certain age will remember the letters RCA and how dominant the company once was.
RCA, originally known as the Radio Corp. of America, was the firm that 100 years ago helped give birth to radio, and later paved the way for television, broadcasting, and recorded music. Back in the day it also popularized VCRs.
And while today RCA is a shell of its former self, alive only as a trademark that's available for licensing, it's good to remember that "the technology invented back then still exists today," says Tim Sarnoff. He's the grandson of the founder, David Sarnoff, a Russian immigrant who came to America in 1900 and changed our communication methods forever.

Today we live in a different world from David Sarnoff's era where television is all about on-demand programming, via streaming or time-shifted viewing.
Tom Sarnoff, David's 92 year-old son, says David would "be impressed," with the changes, "How the world is now all together was his dream. He wanted to connect everyone, particularly on the news and information side. "
Tom tells of how news was delivered during David's childhood. Either by newspapers, or by walking to the nearby town to spread the word. "So by the time you got there, the news was a day old. " Radio, he adds, "brought the world to everyone's living room. "
GE went on to sell off the various divisions, including RCA Records, which had been home to Elvis Presley, David Bowie and the Jefferson Airplane, as well as TV and radio manufacturing.
RCA Records today is currently owned by Sony, and features such artists as Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys. NBC is today owned by the Comcast Corporation, home to the largest cable TV operation, Universal Studios and the theme park.
Unlike the internet millionaires of today, the Sarnoff family "lived comfortably, but we weren't billionaires," says Tim Sarnoff. "We didn't lack for anything. "
According to a 1971 New York Times obit, David Sarnoff was paid a $200,000 a year salary during his reign, and was a large stockholder. , He apparently didn't have enough stock to endow his heirs with internet like multi millions.
Today, many people don't realize how important RCA was to the music we listen to, TV shows we watch and radio stations we call into.
"It's kind of depressing," admits Tom. "When I was growing up, RCA dominated TV and radio. Everybody knew what RCA was. Today you'd find very few people who knew what RCA was. "

Strip mining planned next to Okefenokee

Texto completo: An Alabama company is planning to strip mine for titanium and other heavy minerals in an area of Charlton County, Ga., bordering the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, an idea that the DuPont Co. abandoned in the late 1990s after government and public outcry against it.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers posted a joint public notice with the state of Georgia on July 12 indicating it had received a Clean Water Act permit application from Birmingham, Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals. The corps is asking for public comments on the permit.
In the application, the company indicated it plans to extract "high quality heavy mineral reserves" for "export by truck, rail and eventual barge to national and international customers."
"Mineral sand-derived products, particularly those containing titanium dioxide and zirconium, are in
high demand worldwide in the pigment, aerospace, medical, foundry, and other industrial products," the document states. "Elemental components, chiefly titanium, are used as the white pigments. Titanium dioxide is nontoxic and has replaced lead as the predominant pigment in paints and coatings."
Twin Pines is proposing to operate its mining facility in stages on about 19 square miles along a ridge of land bordering the refuge, digging to variable depths that will average 50 feet below the land surface on two of the three tracts and 25 feet below the surface on the third. The company is proposing to backfill and grade the mined land within about 30 days after excavation with replanting during the appropriate planting season.
Impact to ecosystem
The first phase of the project will bring permanent impacts to 65 acres of wetlands and nearly a mile of tributaries, the company predicted. Gopher tortoises, a threatened species that is considered a "keystone" species on which other animals depend, will be impacted by construction of facilities and mining activities.
The 635-square-mile Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest blackwater swamp in North America, drew more than 600,000 visitors from the U.S. and 40 other countries over the last year and a half, said Susie Heisey, the supervisory refuge ranger. They experienced what National Geographic named one of the 100 most beautiful places on the planet.
"One of the coolest things about the Okefenokee is that it's basically an intact ecosystem," said refuge manager Michael Lusk, noting that the Everglades, while larger, had been ditched and drained. And though there once was logging in some parts of the Okefenokee, the swamp has been protected for more than 80 years. "What we have now is a large intact, functioning ecosystem and that is so rare, especially in the eastern U.S."
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, which operates the refuge, will prepare formal comments on the permit application, Lusk said. Concerns will focus on the effects of a strip mining operation on the area's hydrology, the underground movement of water.
DuPont abandoned mining proposal
"We'll have similar concerns as when the DuPont mining proposal was made," Lusk said.
That proposal resulted in no mining and an eventual expansion of the refuge.
In the spring of 1997, then-Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt opposed the strip mining in advance of hearing DuPont's arguments for it.
''You can study this, you can write all the documents in the world,'' Babbitt was quoted in the New York Times, ''but they are not going to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there will be no impact.''
Later that year the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service pulled out of discussions over the mining, saying compromise was not possible, the Savannah Morning News reported. DuPont eventually agreed to abandon its plans to mine titanium and in 2003 the company donated all 16,000 acres to the Conservation Fund, which in 2005 transferred nearly 7,000 acres to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an addition to Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
The Georgia Conservancy has been following plans to mine near the Okefenokee and will request a public hearing from the corps, coastal director Charles McMillan III said. The conservation group has two major concerns.
First there's the potential harm to the Okefenokee, especially if the underground flow of water is altered. McMillan, who founded a civil and environmental engineering firm before joining the Georgia Conservancy, pointed back to the former Interior secretary's remarks two decades ago.
"Babbitt mentioned concerns about the hydrology," he said. "That's pretty chilling, isn't it?"
Then there's the land to be mined, which is located on Trail Ridge. It's an ancient beach that runs from the Altamaha River 130 miles south to the Santa Fe River in Florida and a valuable habitat itself.
"Trail Ridge is an important component of the State Wildlife Action Plan," he said. "It has critically important species."
Like the gopher tortoise. McMillan is concerned that even if individual tortoises were rounded up and conserved, altering Trail Ridge will isolate groups of them, leaving them less genetically diverse.
"There needs to be on-site mitigation so you can leave them there afterward," he said.
Asked for comment on the application, a lobbyist for Twin Pines Minerals, Steve Allen of Joe Tanner & Associates, responded with a written fact sheet that reiterated much of the material in the application. It added an anticipated start date for mining activities, however, of January 2020.
It is anticipated that the proposed facility will have an operational life of eight years, the fact sheet stated. It also changed the estimate of workers from the "full-time employment of approximately 150-200 workers from the local area" listed in the application to "this activity will result in the full-time employment of approximately 300 workers."

Texto completo: What's on TV
BIG LITTLE LIES 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. The Monterey Five have been on a loop this season of "he slipped," guilt, infidelity and a smattering of viciousness from Mary Louise (Meryl Streep), the shadowy mother-in-law of Celeste (Nicole Kidman). "'Big Little Lies' is evolving into 'Big Little Truths,' and it's unclear whether that will sustain a long-running story or just a well-made curtain call," James Poniewozik wrote in his New York Times review. How (or if) the show will come to an end -- and whether the five women will finally snap -- will come to light in the Season 2 finale. After a brutal beginning to a trial for the custody of Max (Nicholas Crovetti) and Josh (Cameron Crovetti), Celeste's children, Celeste will attempt to turn the tables on the woman determined to destroy the lives of the Monterey Five. Despite an already large pile of secrets stacked against the women, a new revelation at the trial just may overshadow them all.
GORDON RAMSAY: UNCHARTED 10 p.m. on National Geographic Channel. Gordon Ramsay has added another reality show to his repertoire, though this one takes the famous chef outside of a restaurant kitchen. In "Uncharted," Chef Ramsay will travel the world to discover local cuisine, and who is making it best. For those who may be worried it sounds similar to Anthony Bourdain's beloved travel food show, it diverges thanks to one of Chef Ramsay's signature features in his shows: competition. He plans to test the technique of each local chef he encounters with a comparison of his newfound culinary skills from the region. The competition plays out first in Peru.
BURDEN OF TRUTH 9 p.m. on The CW. After Joanna Chang (Kristin Kreuk) won a dramatic trial in the first season seeking justice for five girls whose exposure to a toxic dump made them sick, she took a role as a corporate lawyer for a large firm in Winnipeg, Canada, hoping for a fresh start. But that is far from what she got. Instead, a new client sends her into a shadowy criminal underground, where she faces murder, becomes the target of a killer and winds up with a case that is nearly impossible to defend. In the Season 2 finale, Joanna risks everything to win her trial by putting an unexpected witness on the stand.
What's Streaming
TYPEWRITER Stream on Netflix. When three children in the Goa state of India begin a search for adventure, they find much more than they were looking for: a sprawling old mansion, a haunted typewriter -- and a murderous ghost. Created by Sujoy Ghosh, an Indian film writer and director, the show follows Jenny Fernandes (Palomi Ghosh), a young woman who decides to move back in to her childhood home, Bardez Villa, despite the tragedy she experienced there years ago. The past she buried begins to resurface once she discovers a typewriter housed in the villa, which turns out to be a sinister -- and deadly -- device.

Texto completo: TOKYO -- Moments after a lighter was put to a pool of gas at a renowned anime studio in Kyoto, Japan, igniting an explosive fire that killed 34 people, Shinji Aoba tried to run away from the scene.
Mr. Aoba, who has been named a suspect in the alleged arson, did not get far, as he was badly burned himself. Chased down by studio workers, he fell to the ground, and several witnesses captured the scene on their cellphones. The police swarmed around him as he lay on his back on the street, his knees bent.
"I did it because they stole my novel," he said, according to police officials cited by NHK, the public broadcaster. According to a bystander quoted by NHK, Mr. Aoba warned police officers not to touch him when they asked if he could stand.
"They plagiarized my work," he said. "Call the president. I have something to tell him."
The picture emerging of Mr. Aoba was of an unstable 41-year-old with a troubled past. Police sources cited by NHK said he had served prison time for robbery and was being treated for an unspecified mental illness. Mr. Aoba has not yet been officially arrested because police officials said his medical needs are too critical.
On Saturday, Mr. Aoba was transferred from a hospital in Kyoto to a university-based center in Osaka that has a specialized burn unit. Video footage on NHK showed him on a stretcher, both legs swathed in white bandages, before hospital workers covered him with a pale blue sheet as they loaded him onto a helicopter.
The nation was shocked by the blaze at the studio, Kyoto Animation, which appeared to be the worst mass killing in Japan in decades. The victims have not yet been identified publicly; according to the Kyoto Police, some of the bodies are burned so badly that they are difficult to identify.
With the police and the public searching for explanations of the devastating crime, experts said they feared the tragedy could lead to the stigmatization of people with mental illness, particularly as it comes less than two months after a man who lived as an extreme recluse stabbed 17 schoolgirls and two adults at a bus stop in a Tokyo suburb.
There was no indication that Mr. Aoba also suffered from the same psychiatric condition -- known in Japan as hikikomori -- but reports that he had been treated for mental illness concerned many experts.
"I am very worried that just after this kind of incident many people will fear people with psychiatric illness," said Dr. Takahiro A. Kato, a psychiatrist at Kyushu University. "We should remember that the majority of mentally ill people have no such risk" of committing violence.
According to sources involved in the police investigation that were cited in several news outlets, Mr. Aoba was arrested in 2012 on a charge of robbing a convenience store in Ibaraki, northeast of Tokyo.
A report in the newsmagazine Weekly Bunshun said Mr. Aoba had turned himself in to the police, naming a member of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult that carried out a 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway that killed 13 people, and saying he did not think he would be able to evade law enforcement.
Mr. Aoba was convicted of robbery and possession of a weapon, as he had been carrying a knife, and served more than three years in prison. After his release in 2016, he spent some time in a subsidized dormitory for former prisoners, where he could live rent free and eat meals.
According to reports from Bunshun and other Japanese outlets, Mr. Aoba eventually moved to his own apartment on a quiet street in Saitama, a suburban area north of Tokyo, although police sources said it was not clear whether he currently held a job.
Takayuki Harada, a professor of psychology at Tsukuba University, said that a previous criminal record and joblessness were higher risk factors for future criminal activity than a psychiatric condition.
A neighbor in Mr. Aoba's building told The Jiji Press that Mr. Aoba had banged on his door this month and rattled the doorknob. When the neighbor answered the door, he told Jiji, Mr. Aoba grabbed him by his chest and hair and shouted: "I will kill you. I have nothing to lose." According to Bunshun, the neighbor reported the confrontation to the police.
Nobody answered the door on Saturday at any of the units in the two-story apartment complex, which is less than a mile from the nearest train station.
An apartment manager refused to speak to a New York Times reporter, saying that she would not comment unless Mr. Aoba was arrested, referring queries to the local press club. A 37-year-old woman who lives across the street but declined to give her name said she sometimes saw Mr. Aoba passing on the street. She said she had seen the police and ambulances come to the building to check on Mr. Aoba's apartment after neighbors complained of noise.
Hideaki Hatta, who founded Kyoto Animation with his wife, Yoko Hatta, in 1981, told the Mainichi Shimbun that the company had received a number of death threats in the past two years, although he said Mr. Aoba's name did not appear in any of the threatening emails.
Mr. Hatta said that he had no idea what Mr. Aoba was talking about when he claimed that Kyoto Animation "stole my novel." Mr. Hatta said Mr. Aoba had never submitted a manuscript to the company's novel contest.
Crime is very low in Japan, but there are periodic spasms of random and extreme violence.
"I think the general physical safety that is so noteworthy about Japan heightens the contrast when those things do occur," said Colin P.A. Jones, a professor at Doshisha Law School in Kyoto.
"Mentally unstable people doing unspeakably violent things happen in the United States and other places," he said, adding, "I don't know if you can draw conclusions other than that the contrast is greater" in Japan.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Sorry, Abe.
I can't come down to your memorial on a sultry night for my usual midsummer outing of mindful meditation and astral projection.
The time is out of joint, as Hamlet said. And it is too discombobulating to spend precious hours with Honest Abe in the specious era of Dishonest Don.
How do you commune with a Republican president known for his spiritual stability in a constitutional crisis when a mere mile away sits a Republican president known for his amoral instability in a constitutional crisis?
How do you commune with the man who sacrificed his life to bring the races together when nearby dwells the man who is soiling his life -- and ours -- driving the races apart?
I love all the luminous white marble monuments and the landmarks in my hometown, the permanent Oz within our transient capital. I still shiver when I think that the 9/11 terrorists might have destroyed any one of them.
But my favorite has always been the Lincoln Memorial, because on its north chamber is engraved the brief, inexpressibly beautiful Second Inaugural Address -- the most poetic expression of what the American soul should be.
Lincoln tried to knit his unraveled country, knowing his side was right, yet accepting those on the other side as God's children: "With malice toward none; with charity for all."
"Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other," Lincoln said. "It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged."
It is a travesty that Donald Trump, 154 years after Lincoln tried to bind the wounds of the nation on race to keep the dream of America viable, is pouring salt into those wounds to keep himself viable.
Lincoln tried to wrestle down a clash of civilizations. Trump is ginning one up to get re-elected.
He doesn't worry about inciting violence against those he slimes. When I asked him about that in 2016, he said that he thought the rabid mood and physical altercations at his rallies added an air of excitement, and that his political journey into the heart of darkness is what got him to No. 1, so why wouldn't he continue on it?
The president who hates flies is like flypaper. No matter how you come at him, buzzing past his outrages and lies like the Republicans or landing hard on them like the Democrats, you get stuck.
Both parties end up caught and struggling in the sticky mess.
Nancy Pelosi was trying to keep the Democrats in the center-left lane, where their best chance of beating Trump lies. But with his vile "go back" rant against four American Democratic congresswomen, the president -- at least for now -- achieved his stated aim of "marrying" the speaker to the far-left squad.
Given some of the hyper-liberal ideas tossed out by the Democrats in the first round of debates, Pelosi will have to work harder than ever to keep her party's image where it needs to be with the real base, as opposed to the Twitter base.
The Republicans typically prefer a more subtle racism to rev up the base. In the past, they have handed the racist ploys off to hidden allies, then denied knowledge of Willie Hortonesque efforts to rouse hate. It's ugly and disorienting -- even to many Republicans -- to see the toads jumping directly from the mouth of a president.
But as the boorish Trump has told reporters, "I don't really care about offending people."
He doesn't rely on division only for elections, like his predecessors; he uses it to govern. And while that is a tad embarrassing for Republicans, they know from half a century of experience that it works to stir up racial animus and label foes wild-eyed socialists and commies.
Mitch McConnell admitted this on Thursday when he told Fox Business that "the president is on to something" with his fragging, though he denied Trump was a racist.
While it is awful to contemplate, this trade-off of our national ideals for strong stock returns and more millions for billionaires could be working.
As The Times's Nate Cohn wrote on Friday, Trump's Electoral College edge could grow in 2020 because "a strategy rooted in racial polarization could at once energize parts of the president's base and rebuild support among wavering white working-class voters."
After pretending fleetingly that he had been unhappy that some in the crowd at his North Carolina rally chanted "Send her back" about Representative Ilhan Omar, the president returned to his natural habitat of hate. On Friday, he resumed attacking the squad as "terrible" and a "disgrace," praising himself because he said he could have filled the North Carolina stadium 10 times and calling the rallygoers "incredible patriots."
As with Charlottesville, he will never disavow his people. He loves even the hardest of his hard-core base because they boost his crowd size, his electoral count and his ego.
We're all stuck on the flypaper. Democrats need to up their game to avoid the traps Trump is constantly setting for them.
Abraham Lincoln led us through a tragedy. Donald Trump is one. With malice toward all; with charity for none.

Racist to the bone; consider the mandible

Información de publicación: Bismarck Tribune ; Bismarck, ND [Bismarck, ND]. 21 July 2019: 6.

Texto completo: After instructing four women of color in the House of Representatives to "go back" where they came from, President Donald Trump now claims, "I don't have a Racist bone in my body!"
That appears incorrect. I have identified the following racist bones in Trump's body:
Phalanges and metacarpals: These are bones of the fingers and hands that Trump has used to tweet tirades against black and brown people and to retweet Nazi sympathizers, including, twice, an account called @WhiteGenocideTM with a photo of the founder of the American Nazi Party.
Mandible and maxilla: These are the jawbones that Trump has used to denounce Mexican immigrants as "criminals, drug dealers, rapists," not to mention to refuse to criticize the Ku Klux Klan.
Femurs, fibulas, tibias, metatarsals: These foot and leg bones carried Trump into his casinos, where black staff members would be rushed off the floor so he couldn't see them, according to a former employee, Kip Brown.
Virtually every remaining bone was implicated in Trump's early refusal to rent apartments in his buildings to blacks, leading the Nixon administration Justice Department (not exactly a pillar of liberalism) to sue him for housing discrimination in the 1970s. A former building superintendent working for Trump explained that any rent application from a black person was coded "C," for "colored," apparently so that the office would know to reject it.
"Racist" is an explosive term that should never be lightly flung as an epithet, and it is more likely to end a conversation than clarify it. For a single tweet or action there is a possibility of misunderstanding or ambiguity.
Yet for more than 45 years, since that housing discrimination, Trump has engaged in a consistent pattern of racist behavior and speech. His latest controversial tweets are not an aberration but a culmination. This isn't a matter of a single tweet; it's a lifetime with a narrative arc of bigotry.
America's history is a tapestry of innumerable threads, many of them triumphant and inspiring that we should be deeply proud of, but Trump goes out of his way to weave together two of the most shameful strands.
One is the racism and nativism that go back to the 18th century, to the Philadelphia speaker who in 1844 denounced Irish immigrants as "scum unloaded on American wharves" and helped provoke anti-Catholic riots, to the waves of hysteria against African Americans, Italians, Chinese, Jews, Japanese Americans, Latinos and other immigrants. There is another strain of American hospitality highlighted by the Statue of Liberty and the admission of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese refugees beginning in the 1970s, but the nativism is real - it's why Trump's family, alarmed by anti-German bigotry, pretended to be Swedish.
The other thread that Trump pulls is more political: what we now call McCarthyism, although it, too, goes back to our nation's earliest days. It vilifies opponents as enemies of the state.
More than two centuries ago, opponents of Thomas Jefferson warned that he was a Jacobin who if elected would unleash a French-style reign of terror upon America. As one commentator put it, "The Bible would be cast into a bonfire, our holy worship changed into a dance of Jacobin phrensy, our wives and daughters dishonored." Sen. Joseph McCarthy updated that in the 20th century with reckless accusations that leftists were communists - and now Trump picks up that mantle by suggesting that his four progressive targets in Congress "might be" communists, not to mention that they "hate our Country" and are "pro Al-Qaeda."
I'm not sure whether this new McCarthyism is instinctive and unthinking, or these bilious rants represent a shrewd effort to manipulate voters into seeing the 2020 presidential campaign through the prism not of issues but of racial identity, in hopes of winning Trump an edge with white voters.
I do know that Trump has taken two of the most ignominious threads in American history - nativism and McCarthyism - and woven them together in an outburst that is an affront to democratic norms.
If anyone doubts that Trump's statements were despicable, note that the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission specifically bars employers from using "ethnic epithets, such as making fun of a person's foreign accent or comments like, Go back to where you came from.'"
Frankly, I'm even more troubled by Trump's policies than by his tweets, and I wish the reaction to Trump focused more on practical initiatives to reduce child poverty, treat drug addiction or end mass incarceration. But the question put to Congress this week was a resolution properly condemning the presidential tirade. It was grotesque to see Republicans who had been mute at presidential bigotry suddenly protest that the backers of the resolution violated rules of decorum.
Really? We're left again with the question: How can members of the party of Lincoln today protest the label of racism, but not the racism itself - in a man who for 45 years has shown himself to be a racist from his mandible to his metatarsals?

Eric Garner didn't get justice in our system. Let's build one in which others do

Texto completo: We all watched while Eric Garner desperately pleaded with New York Police Department’s Dan Pantaleo to stop choking him. Garner called out 11 times "I can't breathe," each cry with an intensity that made it not just difficult to witness but maddening. I yelled at the TV screen, shouting at the officers to let him go — trying to avoid seeing the inevitable. Garner died because law enforcement refused to see him as a human being who deserved a life. Refused to see him as a father. A husband. A son. A friend. A human being.
On July 16, the world learned that the officer, Pantaleo, would not face any federal charges in connection with the 2014 killing of Garner, and will likely be able to continue his career in the NYPD. Our justice system is still refusing to see Garner's life as one that was worth saving.
People and organizations stepped up to fight for Garner and his family. His daughter, Erica Garner, championed the crusade — #JusticeForEricGarner. She pushed a generation of us to show up for our loved ones. She endorsed Bernie Sanders, who eventually became a very outspoken supporter of the movement during the 2016 election cycle. She was even featured in one of his campaign videos.
She participated in Black Lives Matter protests, she led them, and she supported them. She promised she would fight for her father until he received justice or until she was in her grave. We all admired Erica. Many of us who didn’t know her father built a relationship with him through her work. When she passed away after a heart attack in 2017, we were all devastated. How could this powerful young woman who had been fighting for her father die so damn young? We knew her work would continue through so many people and organizations, and many of us hoped that Erica’s fight and her death would not be in vain.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
More: Des Moines council must reject toothless, embarrassing racial profiling policy
An overhaul would allow us to imagine a world where Garner wouldn't have to sell "illegal cigarettes" to make ends meet. We could build a system in which Erica Garner wouldn't have to fight for her father's legacy and then die too young. All of our community needs would be met, and we would no longer be policed for being poor.
Working toward the overhaul of our current system should remind us that we all deserve to breathe. Eric Garner deserved to breathe. And we will continue to fight for his legacy and for his daughter's — legacies that centered on struggle and hope and justice.

Hughes deserves Hall call [Corrected 07/20/2019]

Texto completo: Cubs radio announcer Pat Hughes deserves to receive the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award, the sport's highest honor for a broadcaster, when it's handed out at this time next year.
Certainly, no one is better than Hughes, a distinction that might even be enough to snag it for him. You never know.
The man is a consummate professional who has studied and honed his craft through good seasons and bad with the Twins, the Brewers and, since 1996, the Cubs.
Would-be announcers would do well to study the precision with which Hughes reports the game while conveying drama through the tone, pace and volume of his delivery without it ever becoming overwrought, enabling listeners to "see" the action. He's not flashy, but it's a high-def call.
"Future Hall of Famer" is practically part of his name.
But the Hall of Fame is, well, the Hall of Fame.
The overt goal is to honor the game's all-time greats and bring tourists to Cooperstown, N.Y., but it seems the unofficial mission is to foment and fuel arguments.
So hold off on booking trips to upstate New York for the big party. See who the finalists are in October. Wait for the announcement at baseball's winter meetings in December to see if he joins the club with Jack Brickhouse, Harry Caray and Bob Elson.
It's not just that there are other announcers with solid credentials. There are, although again, there's no one better.
It's that the Frick Award winner is determined by a committee of living former honorees and a handful of broadcast historians and journalists. It's hard to predict a consensus.
In Hughes' favor is that their stated criteria -- "Commitment to excellence, quality of broadcasting abilities, reverence within the game, popularity with fans and recognition by peers" -- virtually defines him.
Hughes not only is in his 37th successive season as a major-league announcer, but also spends his offseason producing an ongoing series of "Baseball Voices" recordings showcasing many of the game's great announcers. (Among them to date, and this can't hurt, are living Frick honorees Marty Brennaman, Denny Matthews, Jon Miller and Bob Uecker, with whom Hughes worked a dozen seasons before coming to Chicago.)
The problem is if Hughes doesn't get the Frick in 2020, he'll have to wait until 2023.
That's because the Hall a few years back embraced a three-year cycle for the award, and that's how long it will take to reconsider the so-called Major League Markets candidates.
This year, from the Broadcasting Beginnings pool of candidates, the late Al Helfer is being recognized for a career announcing games that began at age 16 with the Pirates in 1933. He also had stints with Reds, Yankees, Giants, Dodgers, Colt .45s and Athletics as well as a national radio gig with Mutual Broadcasting.
Two years ago, among National Voices, Bob Costas was picked over Al Michaels, Joe Buck, Dizzy Dean, Pee Wee Reese, Don Drysdale and others.
(Obviously, guys such as Michaels, Buck, Reese and Drysdale worked for teams at some point too. But see? Arguments!)
Meanwhile, Major League Markets announcers have been left hanging since 2017, when the committee picked Bill King, the late A's announcer, from a field of eight finalists that included Hughes and now-retired White Sox voice Ken "Hawk" Harrelson as well as former Cubs announcer Dewayne Staats (who now calls Rays games) and onetime Cubs pitcher Mike Krukow (with the Giants).
A very strong case can be made for Jacques Doucet, who also has been a finalist but hasn't gotten the call.
Before you say "who?" just know many consider Doucet French Canada's Vin Scully.
He now calls games in French for the Blue Jays, but for 33 years he was the French announcer for the Montreal Expos, a job that required him to create his own idiom.
One example, courtesy of a 2010 New York Times story, is his translation of "shoestring catch" to "vol au sol."
The Times said that means "theft at the ground," though Google Translate reads it more prosaically as "flight on the ground."
Either way, "vol au sol" is lyrical.
The Frick Award has gone to Spanish-language announcers Buck Canel in 1985, Jaime Jarrin in '98 and Felo Ramirez in '01. Longtime Padres voice Eduardo Ortega remains a contender, but Doucet would be truly novel.
It's hard to know whether there's lingering sentiment for Cardinals announcer Mike Shannon, the Mets' Gary Cohen or Staats, a major-league announcer for 40-plus seasons and with the Rays since their 1998 debut.
Krukow remains popular with the Giants, pushing on while battling the effects of inclusion body myositis, a muscular disorder. His announcing partner, Duane Kuiper, once was a finalist too.
Where do deceased former finalists such as Skip Caray, Ken Coleman and Ned Martin fit into the mix? And what of potential new finalists?
An excellent argument can be made on behalf of longtime Cubs and current White Sox analyst Steve Stone to be considered.
The 1980 Cy Young Award winner has been an excellent broadcaster from the day he made his debut with ABC's "Monday Night Baseball" in mid-1982, less than a week after he officially announced his retirement as a player.
Yankees announcer John Sterling has his critics, but the 81-year-old only recently ended a remarkable streak of 5,058 consecutive games, a run including postseason games that dated to 1989. Tough to ignore that.
Still, there's no one better than Hughes.
Anyone who doesn't agree is just asking for a fight.

Texto completo: Drug overdose deaths in the United States may have fallen by 5 percent in 2018, according to preliminary data released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Specifically, the CDC’s preliminary data estimate that more than 68,500 people died of drug overdoses in 2018, compared to about 72,000 in 2017. Both numbers are likely to change as the data become finalized, but if the overall trend holds, it would represent the first drop in drug overdose deaths in the U.S. since 1990.
That 68,500 number is still shockingly high, however. It makes 2018 the second worst year for drug overdose deaths in U.S. history. It also means (as the New York Times points out) that drug overdoses claimed more lives in 2018 than did car crashes, HIV/AIDS and guns during their most deadly years.
Last year’s decline in drug overdose deaths appears to be driven almost entirely by fewer deaths from prescription opioids, the medications that have been fueling a massive drug addiction epidemic since the late 1990s. Overdose deaths caused by those drugs fell from around 49,000 in 2017 to an estimated 47,600 in 2018, according to the CDC’s preliminary data.
For comparison, in 1999 — as the prescription opioid epidemic was just beginning to gather steam — about 16,800 Americans died from overdoses from all types of drugs.
While overdose deaths involving prescription opioids may be making a modest decline, those involving synthetic opioids, particularly illegally manufactured fentanyl, continue to climb. The CDC data suggests that overdose deaths associated with synthetic opioids, excluding methadone, numbered almost 32,000 in 2018, up from more than 29,000 a year earlier. Overdose deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants like methamphetamine and MDMA (“ecstasy”) also rose slightly from 2017 to 2018.
Minnesota’s numbers
In their report on the preliminary data, CDC officials estimated that drug overdose deaths in Minnesota had dropped from 730 in 2017 to 638 in 2018 — a 12.6 percent decline. Last week, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) reported that its preliminary data suggested a drop of 17 percent, from 733 deaths in 2017 to 607 in 2018. (The MDH numbers are likely to be more up-to-date than the CDC ones.)
As was true nationally, the overall decline in Minnesota’s drug overdose deaths last year was largely driven by a drop in deaths from prescription opioids. Such deaths fell 32 percent, from 195 in 2017 to 134 in 2018. Heroin deaths also fell significantly in the state, from 11 in 2017 to 85 in 2018 — a drop of 23 percent.
As was also true nationally, deaths from synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, continue to climb in Minnesota. MDH officials estimate that 195 Minnesotans died from synthetic opioid overdoses in 2018. In 184 of those cases (85 percent), fentanyl was listed on the death certificate as a contributing factor.
“It’s encouraging to see this turn-around in the trend in 2018 as Minnesota has implemented a broad range of efforts to prevent opioid misuse and combat the overdose crisis,” Minnesota Commissioner of Health Jan Malcolm said in a statement that accompanied the release of its preliminary data.
“This is good news,” she added, “but we want to emphasize that this is still preliminary data and that overdose deaths continue to remain at historic highs. There is still much work that needs to be done to end this crisis and mitigate its effects.”

Texto completo: BY LARRY NEUMEISTER
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Federal prosecutors have told a judge in New York they have concluded their investigation into campaign finance crimes committed by President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.
The closure of the case is the strongest suggestion yet that federal prosecutors have decided not to bring criminal charges against anyone besides Cohen in the scheme to use hush-money payments to protect Trump's reputation during the 2016 presidential campaign.
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III made the disclosure in a court filing Wednesday as part of a legal fight over whether to unseal search warrant materials dealing with the investigation.
For months, prosecutors had asked that the documents remain sealed because they were still probing payments Cohen helped orchestrate to two women - porn actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal - who claimed they had affairs with Trump.
While Cohen pleaded guilty last August to charges that the payoffs amounted to illegal campaign contributions, others involved remained uncharged, including Trump himself and executives at the Trump Organization and American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer.
Now, though, prosecutors have informed the court in a sealed filing that they've concluded the investigation, clearing the way for the release of documents related to the case.
The judge rejected a request by prosecutors to black out portions of the documents to protect third-party privacy interests, saying the records involved "a matter of national importance."
"Now that the Government's investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the materials," Pauley wrote.
He ordered the government to put the search warrant records related to searches of Cohen's residence and office in the public record by 11a.m. Thursday.
Trump has denied any sexual relationship with Daniels and McDougal and said any payments made to them were private in nature and not related to his campaign.
"We are pleased that the investigation surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed," Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said Wednesday. "We have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation."
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment and wouldn't answer questions about whether the completion of the investigation meant that no one else would be charged.
In December, Pauley sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for crimes including the campaign finance violations, lying to Congress and tax evasion.
He began serving the sentence in May, saying at the time it was an injustice that he was going to prison for crimes that benefited Trump.
In previous court filings, federal prosecutors in New York appeared to implicate Trump directly, saying that he directed Cohen to make the hush money payments.
However, the Justice Department has held that sitting presidents cannot be charged in the federal criminal justice system and instead can only be punished for misdeeds by Congress through the impeachment process.
"Case closed?" asked Cohen's spokesman, Lanny Davis, in a statement questioning why Cohen was the only member of Trump's company to be prosecuted and imprisoned.
"Especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael's admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump. Why?" Davis said.
The records to be unsealed include search warrant applications that federal prosecutors made to judges in New York when they sought permission to raid Cohen's home and office. In them, they outlined some of the evidence they had gathered about his alleged crimes.
Some of the documents were released publicly previously, but large sections related to the campaign finance probe were blacked out.
In requesting the records, The Associated Press and eight other media organizations had cited high public interest and a right to access.
Prosecutors had initially opposed the request, saying disclosure "would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties."
News organizations in the legal action to unseal the documents included the AP, The New York Times and the parent companies of ABC and CBS News, CNN, the Daily News, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday and the New York Post.
Pauley said the record should be "unredacted in its entirety" except for limited references in a footnote to an uncharged third-party and the names of law enforcement investigators, references to individuals purportedly engaged in business transactions or contemplated business transactions with Cohen relating to his taxi business.

A Facebook event called "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us" is organizing people to rush the fabled Nevada Air Force base Friday to see aliens' secrets, including ships and bodies, that some people believe the government has stashed there.
It's being called a joke, but the event caught the attention of the Air Force.
A spokeswoman told The New York Times that "any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous."
No-trespassing signs in the area state that the use of deadly force is authorized.
The event caters to early risers -- it's set for 3 to 6 a.m. It has an "official" website, which is hawking T-shirts for $20 each.
"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry," the event's Facebook page says. "Let's see them aliens."
Area 51 hasn't had this much attention since it was famously featured in the 1996 Will Smith movie "Independence Day."
Independence Day
One person, named Jackson Barnes, offered a "game plan" with a diagram for storming the base. But he doesn't really seem to mean it. In a post-script to his plan, Barnes says, "Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get some thumbsy uppies on the internet.
"To anyone actually thinking of storming area 51, there isn't any UFO's or anything of extraterrestrial origin there it's a research base, this has been confirmed by Bob Lazar (if you dont know who he is, google him)."
Lazar is a conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed physicist who has claimed to have spent some time in Area 51. He has strongly urged people not to show up there.
"Area 51 is a classified research base," Lazar said. "There are no aliens or alien technology located there. The only place there was ever any alien technology was at Site S4, south of Area 51 proper."
The federal government acknowledged the existence of Area 51 in 2013, when the CIA released a classified report on spy planes that were tested there.

Texto completo: The federal investigation into whether the Trump Organization was involved in Michael Cohen's hush money payments to Stormy Daniels is over.
A federal judge revealed today that federal investigators for the Southern District of New York have concluded their investigation, and ordered the information gathered on Cohen's campaign violations be made public.
U.S. District Judge William Pauley said in a Wednesday court filing that while prosecutors wanted certain parts of the information they’d gathered on Cohen to remain redacted for privacy reasons, he was denying their request and ordering the documents be released in their entirety.
“We are pleased that the investigation surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed," said President Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow in a statement. "We have maintained from the outset that the President never engaged in any campaign finance violation.“
Cohen pleaded guilty to eight different counts, ranging from lying to Congress about the timing of plans for a proposed Trump Tower Moscow to campaign finance violations flowing from hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. Investigators alleged that the Trump Organization approved reimbursement of hundreds of thousands of dollars paid from Cohen's business accounts, which were listed as legal expenses rather than hush money payments in official filings. The now-concluded criminal probe centered on whether any other crimes had been committed.
Cohen started a three-year stint in prison in early May following high-profile congressional testimony earlier this year in February, where Cohen tried to connect Trump to a number of scandals.

“The campaign finance violations discussed in the materials are a matter of national importance,” the judge said Wednesday. “Now that the government’s investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the materials.”
The judge ordered that prosecutors post the documents on the public court docket by 11 a.m. Thursday.
The FBI executed warrants and searched Cohen’s home, hotel room, office, deposit box, cell phones, and electronic communications in April 2018. A number of media outlets — including the New York Times, ABC, CNN, the Associated Press, the New York Post, and others — have been battling in court for full access to the warrants, the warrant applications, and for the underlying materials to be released to the public.
The judge ordered prosecutors to release a redacted version of these documents earlier this year, and they were unsealed with blacked-out sections in March. Those warrants claimed that Cohen participated in an “illegal campaign contribution scheme” and the documents revealed, among other things, that the FBI had access to Cohen’s emails from as early as the beginning of the Trump campaign.

The judge said as recently as May that the redactions were justified due to the “ongoing aspects of the government's investigation.” Now that the investigation is finished, per the court order, these investigative materials will be released nearly in their entirety.

The only continued redactions that the judge is allowing are the names of law enforcement investigators, individuals who had business dealings with Cohen related to taxi medallions, and private information related to an uncharged third party.

Texto completo: Silicon Valley and the Historic Triangle around Williamsburg, separated by a continent, are about as different as two places could be.
The home of Google, Facebook and Apple is focused on building the future while the Williamsburg region's specialty is history. The former is a magnet for entrepreneurs and young people; the latter has become a premier retirement destination.
Yet both share a problem common to other prosperous American communities: They've priced homes out of reach for the people they depend upon.
Several of the current Democratic presidential candidates are raising this problem of unaffordable housing and offering the usual liberal solutions in the form of more government subsidies paid for from your wallet.
But The New York Times, with whom I rarely agree, astutely places blame for housing inequity squarely on government regulations driven by local politics.
Specifically, the Times blamed local zoning restrictions that reserve most of the land in our communities for single-family residences while restricting development of affordable multifamily housing.
Many communities, including James City County where I live, then pile on demands for a variety of "proffers," or additional features such as sidewalks that developers must provide and which further push up costs.
A 2016 task force of private and public representatives fingered zoning restrictions as a major culprit in James City County's lack of affordable housing.
The group reported that even in two-income families, the majority of people working in the county's top 10 occupations (by number of employees) could not afford to rent an apartment there, much less buy a home.
Military personnel and those in the clerical professions could afford to rent, not buy. College professors and registered nurses were the only professions in the top 10 who could afford to either rent or buy.
James City is hardly alone in adopting regulations that price workers out of local homes. Since I am most familiar with its policies, I use it as an example of the unintended consequences of government regulation.
I first came to the area more than 40 years ago when James City County was largely rural. County supervisors met in the Williamsburg City Council chambers because the county government complex on Mounts Bay Road did not yet exist.
The county's population has quintupled since then to more than 76,000. Yet even in the 1970s, there was rising tension between the new suburbanites and the developers and farmers who wanted the right to sell their property to them.
Bill Brown was James City's planning director at the time and wryly called the dynamic "the drawbridge syndrome." Recent arrivals want to preserve the characteristics that attracted them to the area in the first place by making it harder for others to enjoy the same thing.
Even in more urban communities such as Virginia Beach or Newport News, suburbanites resist the development of apartment buildings they say will hurt the value of their homes. The usual complaint is about traffic and crowded schools, but I've always suspected there was some unacknowledged bias against lower-income residents being too close.
In Minneapolis, the subject of that New York Times editorial I referred to, the city's elected leaders hit on a radical yet simple solution to the problem last December. They eliminated single-family zoning.
Such a solution allows those who want them to still buy a single-family suburban home, although they will probably pay more. That's how free markets are supposed to work.

Texto completo: I felt like the only reporter who didn’t know John Hickenlooper when he decided to run for Denver mayor in 2003.
Sure, I had gone to his Wynkoop Brewing Co., but to indulge in that famous artichoke dip and bread, not the craft beer. I never threw one back late at night with “Hick” or covered any of the boards he sat on or attended his parties.
Those who know me won’t be shocked to hear that didn’t stop me from dissing Hickenlooper when I got to know him early in the campaign. I was at his birthday party/fundraiser when I laughingly hurled an insult at the candidate.

“See if I ever buy you a beer again!” he joked back.
Ah-ha, I told Hickenlooper, I just caught you in your first campaign lie: I don’t drink!
Ever since, I’ve had a pretty good relationship with the brewmeister turned mayor turned governor turned presidential candidate. Oh, there have been some blowups, like when he was governor and decided to blab at length about his ex-wife and his ambitions with a New York Times reporter, subjects he had refused to discuss with the local press.
But for the most part it has been good. Good enough that his run for president puzzled and worried me.
And now, according to various news accounts, his campaign is in trouble. “Hickenlooper campaign in shambles,” Politico reported on July 2.
He wasn’t bringing in enough money and at least five staffers had left or were thinking of leaving. Polling hadn’t moved him from near the bottom of the 20-plus Democratic field.
Hickenlooper blamed his campaign team -- a move that had Coloradans who covered him or worked with him groaning. By all accounts, he isn’t the easiest guy to work for.
Since then, Hickenlooper has said the problem was him “not being as good of a messenger as I need to be.”
Full disclosure: I’ve donated to the other Coloradan in the presidential race, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, who served as Hickenlooper’s first chief of staff when he was mayor. But if Bennet were not in the race, I would have donated to Hickenlooper. I still want him to succeed.
But the presidential campaign trail is so different than the one where Hickenlooper excels.
His first mayoral campaign was so unorthodox. Campaign mailers, going door-to-door, the traditional bland bio TV ads -- Hickenlooper wanted nothing to do with any of that.
His best known and most beloved campaign commercial featured him in a showdown with a guy issuing parking tickets -- a hot-button issue in downtown Denver.
Hickenlooper’s supporters hosted neighborhood parties where friends and family got to hear his story. His father died young. His mother, who buried two husbands before she turned 40, was so frugal she washed and reused wax paper. A geologist, he lost his job in Colorado’s downturn in the 1980s, wandered a bit, and decided to open one of the first brewpubs in the country in Denver.
“He delivered a performance that was part standup comic, part Dudley DoRight, part deft mechanic able to fix a sluggish City Hall,” I wrote for the Rocky Mountain News.
That combination doesn’t sell well in this day and on a national stage.
Hickenlooper once flubbed the ending of his State of the State speech and uttered, “Oh, Jesus.” The Republicans who had sat stoned-faced minutes before when he talked about gun control burst into laughter, and later talked about Hickenlooper’s likability and “humanity.”
That wouldn’t happen now.
And Democrats have taken a hard left, making it tough for a middle-of-the-road businessman who doesn’t see oil and gas as a bogeyman.
The Politico story said Hickenlooper’s senior campaign staff urged him to drop out of the presidential race and pursue other opportunities, such as taking on Colorado U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner in 2020. That field of Democrats trying to unseat the first-term Republican senator from Yuma also is crowded, but conventional wisdom is Hickenlooper would be at the top of the pack in that race.
Hickenlooper said in February he’s not sure he’s cut out to be a senator, where he would have to make decisions in small groups.
But that statement brings me back to 2009. Gov. Bill Ritter appointed Bennet, then the superintendent of Denver Public Schools, to the U.S. Senate seat held by Ken Salazar, who was joining the Obama administration as secretary of the Interior.
Some Democrats were unhappy with Ritter’s choice. Bennet had never run for office. The governor had bypassed tremendously popular Democrats, including outgoing state House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter -- and Mayor Hickenlooper.
The mayor’s favorables were so high that in 2004 pollster Lori Weigel said of him, “He’s not quite John Elway, but he’s close.”
The Senate was a different place then, it got things done, and Hickenlooper was interested in the job.
But politics is a funny business. Ritter decided in early January 2010 against seeking a second term that November. Within days Hickenlooper jumped into the governor’s race, which turned out to be one of the weirdest contests ever.
Former Congressman Scott McInnis was hit with a plagiarism charge and political neophyte Dan Maes won the primary. Remember Maes? He claimed that Denver’s bicycle program was a U.N. plot, he racked up campaign finance violations and then there was the stuff about his time working as a cop in Kansas. Former Congressman Tom Tancredo demanded Maes drop out, and when he refused Tancredo jumped in as a third-party candidate.
In a Tea Party year that saw two Democratic members of Congress from Colorado lose their seats, Hickenlooper won the governor’s race.
Columnist extraordinaire Mike Littwin called Hickenlooper “the luckiest guy since Ringo.” The Washington Post in 2012 named Hickenlooper one of the 10 most popular governors in the country.
Later, some critics accused Hickenlooper of indecisiveness and criticized him on everything from gun control to the death penalty. His quirkiness, his life story of going from rocks to hops, was used against him.
“The governor is a nice man,” District Attorney George Brauchler once said. “I think he wants to be a friend. I think he wants to be an adviser. But at the end of the day, no one elected him to be the state bartender. They elected him to be governor.”
They did that again in 2014, although this contest was much closer.
In 2014, Hillary Clinton’s people interviewed him about a spot on her ticket. When that didn’t happen, most expected that she would tap him for a Cabinet post after she got elected president.
But she lost.
And now he seems lost.
Who knows what will happen with Hickenlooper’s campaign by the time this piece goes live?
“Sometimes, the long shot becomes the legend,” he recently told an Iowa reporter, saying he was staying in the race.
But no matter. I’m of the opinion that the guy who jumped out of a plane to help pass a tax timeout, who danced in a blue bear suit to benefit the convention center, who invited hip bands to various events over the years, will be just fine.
He is still Hick, after all.

Facing their toughest challenge, members of 'the Squad' turned to Pressley for her 'positive, loving tone'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — When the four Democratic congresswomen at the center of the racially charged feud with President Trump faced the cameras, one led them onto the stage and stepped to the microphones to speak first: Ayanna Pressley.
And after all four had made their statements at that Monday news conference and reporters started asking questions, Pressley's three colleagues in what they call “the Squad" — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib — turned their heads and looked to Pressley, who again stepped up to answer.
“We can sit here and continue to recycle his hateful rhetoric, of which I cannot feign surprise or inflated outrage because he is, if nothing else, predictable," Pressley said of Trump, urging Americans not to take his “bait." “What we are focused on are the hateful policies that are draconian and oppressive and life-threatening and family-separating that [are] being rolled out by this administration every day."
The Boston lawmaker is the most politically experienced of the four outspoken women of color who have shaken up the Democratic Party establishment since arriving in Washington six months ago with the new, diverse House majority. But so far, she's also been the least controversial.
Adrian Walker: Ayanna Pressley has done more than weather Trump's attacks. She's winning
Tlaib said they chose Pressley to speak first because she sets a “positive, loving tone." That was something they felt was needed after Trump declared they should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came." He also said they hate the United States.
“We wanted her to lead us in taking on the biggest bully probably in our lifetime," Tlaib said Tuesday in an interview.
Pressley, 45, is the oldest member of the Squad. She worked for former Massachusetts senator John Kerry for 13 years, including as his political director, before making history when she became the first African-American woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009. In 2018, Pressley stunned incumbent Representative Michael Capuano when she beat him in the Democratic primary.
In Boston, Pressley is known for championing women's and children issues as well as antiviolence causes. She has used her own personal story as a survivor of sexual assault to highlight that issue as well.
Pressley was elected to the City Council at a time when it was dominated by white men. During her time in office, other women of color were also elected. There are now six women on the 13-member council, including five women of color, one of whom is president.
“She was the tip of the iceberg that totally changed the Boston City Council," said Erin O'Brien, a political science professor at University of Massachusetts Boston who has followed Pressley's career.
On the council, Pressley did not have the controversial, outsider reputation she has now earned as part of the Squad. O'Brien said that could be because, as the only woman of color on the council earlier in her career, she did not want to jeopardize her seat.
“I don't think she had the option to throw bombs in the same way until she was surrounded by other like-minded individuals," O'Brien said.
Jeneé Osterheldt: The 'Squad' is doing its job: Telling Trump how the US should work
Trump's comments this week come after the four first-term lawmakers have repeatedly criticized him on a range of issues during their short six months in office.
Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, with her huge social media following, is the constant lightning rod of the group with pointed critiques of Trump and his policies.
Omar, of Minnesota, has faced criticism — and charges of anti-Semitism — for her comments about Israel and its allies, suggesting, for example, that supporters of Israel were motivated by money. Tlaib caused outrage just hours after taking the oath of office for her profanity-laced call for Trump's impeachment. And Ocasio-Cortez suggested House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was singling out women of color when she upbraided them recently.
So far, by contrast, Pressley has not had a personal controversy of that level.
Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas said she was impressed that Pressley visited El Paso this month and spoke powerfully about the conditions for immigrant detainees there.
“She is such a powerful force for good," Escobar said about Pressley. “She is kind, generous, thoughtful. She's got the strength that I admire. So it just breaks my heart that because she wants to create a better country for all of us that she has to endure such abuse [from Trump]. But I know her strength, and I know she'll power through it."
But even as the House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's comments, Democrats are still divided because of the internal struggle the squad has created by bucking the leadership of Pelosi. She publicly dismissed the four after they recently were the only four Democrats to oppose a bill to address the humanitarian crisis at the border.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world, but they didn't have any following. They are four people and that's how many votes they got," Pelosi told a New York Times columnist.
The long, sordid history behind Trump's 'go back' to your country comments
Barney Frank, a longtime Democratic representative from Massachusetts who retired in 2013, said the Squad's tactics are doing more harm than good to the progressive policies they want to advance. Yet, he said, Pressley seems different.
“My puzzlement about Pressley is that I haven't seen her do anything that seemed to me mistaken the way the other three have, but then she joins them, and apparently agrees with their approach, and I think their approach is very wrong," Frank said in an interview.
Part of the reason Pressley and the rest of the Squad might feel confident in their pushback against Pelosi is because the Democrats are in the majority, said Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers and an expert on Congress.
But Pelosi is focused on retaining the Democratic majority in the House, which means she needs to ensure that moderate Democrats are reelected. That probably means a more cautious political style.
“Pelosi sees the big picture, she understands what it means to be in the majority, and she also remembers, painfully, what it was like to be in the minority," Baker said.

Texto completo: Surprise! Not. The New York Times' White House crew are going after President Trump’s immigration policy. In a Facebook brag, they announced the submission to Simon & Schuster of a new book titled, Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration Hardcover.
It will be available Oct. 8. Written by Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis, their Amazon preview reads, “no issue matters more to Donald Trump than immigration.” It promises “never-before-told stories.” Shear said, “Our baby weighed in at 6.6 pounds and 11 1/2 inches long.” …
The media mocked him and his legion of critics called top Trump aide Jared Kushner’s recent Peace to Prosperity Workshop in Bahrain a waste. But after he made his impassioned plea to investment in Palestine as a way to foster peace, billionaire investors warmed to the plan, according to an organizer of the event. “Reporters might have rolled their eyes, but the money people were impressed and they told him that,” said the official. And two weeks after the event, even the media started to report on a desire in Palestinian territories to trade bullets for shekels and dinars. …TweetMaryland-based Warrior Canine Connection, which helps link dogs with recovering veterans, is naming a new litter after D-Day veterans. “These dogs will be a living memorial to the sacrifices that brave American heroes who fought on D-Day,” said Rick Yount, WCC founder and executive director. It was announced at the Eighth Annual Tribute to Veterans and Those Who Serve in Congress featuring CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett, retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Wald, Rep. Peter King, and world-renowned tenor Anthony Kearns. In a nice twist, the "Operation Overlord" litter was born on June 24, the day of the event. …Screen Shot 2019-07-09 at 4.09.19 PM.pngFormer Democratic aide and trade exec Sean Kennedy debuts this month as the National Restaurant Association’s new executive vice president of public affairs.

House resolution will condemn Trump's 'disgusting' attacks on AOC, Tlaib, Omar and Pressley

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Democrats plan to introduce a resolution condemning President Donald Trump’s attacks on four of its most outspoken progressive members after he told the women to "go back" to where they came from.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the resolution Monday in a letter to those in her caucus, writing that, "the President went beyond his own low standards using disgraceful language about Members of Congress. "
"Let me be clear, our Caucus will continue to forcefully respond to these disgusting attacks," Pelosi wrote. "The House cannot allow the President’s characterization of immigrants to our country to stand. "
Congressional Democrats have been quick to back freshmen Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. ; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. after they were seemingly targeted by a number of posts by the president, though he didn't mention any lawmakers by name.

'This is what racism looks like': Congresswomen react to Trump's 'go back' tweetstorm
All four are American citizens. Ocasio-Cortez was born in New York City, Pressley was born in Cincinnati and Tlaib was born in Detroit. Omar was born in Somalia. Her family fled that country's civil war when she was 8-years-old and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before arriving in the U. S. and settling in Minneapolis in 1997, according to her biography.
They are some of the president's most vocal critics in the House and have become known as the "squad" — sticking together even when they seem to go against the rest of their party on key votes and issues.
The resolution is to be sponsored by Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N. J. , who was born in Poland and moved to the U. S. when he was a young boy. Pelosi said other Democrats who immigrated to the U. S. would also be sponsoring it.
A vote on the resolution will force Republicans to choose whether to denounce the president's comments or stick beside him.
Trump wrote on Sunday that it was "so interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe" now telling the U. S. how to run its government.
"Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came," Trump wrote on Twitter. "Then come back and show us how it is done. "
After widespread criticism of his remarks, which many called racist, the president doubled down on Monday, seemingly asking that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley make an apology for their actions. "So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!" he wrote Monday afternoon.

At an event at the White House, Trump said he wasn't concerned about the criticism he was getting because many people agree with him.
"These are people who in my opinion hate our country," he said of the members of Congress, again not explicity calling out the lawmakers by name. "I’m not happy with them. "
The president's tweets appeared to help unite House Democrats after weeks of infighting that exploded into the public last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.
The feud garnered headlines after Pelosi criticized members of the "squad," telling the New York Times that the four congresswomen "have their public whatever and their Twitter world" but do not "have any following. "
Ocasio-Cortez shot back questioning why Pelosi would single out the new women of color in the caucus, telling the Washington Post it was "outright disrespectful. "
The back-and-forth digs ended this weekend after Trump's attacks. Instead, Democrats united against the president and denounced his comments.
"I reject the President’s xenophobic comments meant to divide our nation," Pelosi said. "Rather than attack Members of Congress, he should work with us for humane immigration policy that reflects American values. "
The four congresswomen held a news conference Monday evening about the president's posts and remarks about them, calling the comments nothing more than a distraction.
While calling Trump's attacks racist, they used the news conference to highlight some of the president's most controversial remarks over the years and his immigration policies that are under heavy scrutiny due to the worsening conditions of migrant detention centers along the southern U. S. border. The group also used Trump's attack to highlight what they say is the need to impeach the president.
"We can either continue to enable this president and report on the pile of garage that comes out of his mouth or we can hold him accountable to his crimes," Omar said. "It is time for us to stop allowing this president to make a mockery out of our Constitution. It is time for us to impeach this president. "
On Monday, some Republicans also criticized the president's remarks, many calling for him to focus on differences of policies instead of comments about race or country of origins.
"We must be better than comments like these," Rep. Paul Mitchell, R-Mich. "I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders. "
Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd went further, saying the president's tweets were "racist. "
"The tweets are racist and xenophobic," he told CNN. "It’s behavior that’s unbecoming of a President of the United States. "

Texto completo: Goosen holds on for Senior Players crown
AKRON, Ohio - Retief Goosen birdied the final two holes to win the Bridgestone Senior Players Championship on Sunday at Firestone Country Club for his first PGA Tour Champions title.
The 50-year-old Hall of Famer from South Africa broke a tie for the lead with a 15-foot putt on the par-4 17th and made a 10-footer on the par-4 18th for a 2-under 68 and a two-stroke victory over 65-year-old Jay Haas and Tim Petrovic.
Three strokes ahead after opening rounds of 69 and 62, Goosen dropped a stroke behind Scott Parel on Saturday with a 75. The two-time U.S. Open champion rebounded from a bogey on the par-4 first with an eagle on the par-5 second, then parred the next eight. He offset a double bogey on the par-4 11th with birdies on the par-3 12th and par-4 13th, but dropped another stroke on the par-4 14th.
Haas closed with a 67, and Tim Petrovic shot 68.
Steve Stricker, the first-round leader after a 64, shot a 72 to finish sixth at 1 under. He was coming off a victory two weeks ago in the U.S. Senior Open at Notre Dame.
Dylan Frittelli won the John Deere Classic for his first PGA Tour title, closing with a 7-under 64 for a two-stroke victory over Russell Henley.
Sei Young Kim won the Marathon Classic for her second LPGA Tour victory of the season, making five straight birdies in a mid-round burst and shooting a 6-under 66 for a two-stroke victory over Lexi Thompson.
Bernd Wiesberger beat Benjamin Hebert on the third playoff hole at the Scottish Open for his sixth European Tour title.
Tony Romo completed a wire-to-wire victory in the American Century Championship for his second straight victory in the celebrity tournament in Stateline, Nev.

Pagenaud wins Indy race at Toronto
TORONTO - Simon Pagenaud won his third race of the season as IndyCar's championship fight tightened.
The win on the streets around Exhibition Place was the third of the season for Pagenaud, but first away from Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Frenchman won the Indy 500 and the road-course race at the speedway to save his job with Team Penske.
Pagenaud had to save fuel in the waning laps to hold off reigning series champion Scott Dixon. But Penske teammate Will Power caused a caution on the final lap, and Pagenaud was able to coast to the finish in his Chevrolet.
Alexander Rossi finished third, one spot ahead of IndyCar points leader Josef Newgarden.
Robert Wickens drove the parade lap in a car equipped with hand controls that allowed the Canadian to drive for the first time since he suffered a spinal cord injury in a crash last August.
Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton won a record sixth British Grand Prix after jumping ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by taking advantage of the safety car being deployed.

SOCCER
P&G provides $529K to U.S. women
NEW YORK - Procter & Gamble, a sponsor of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, is now supporting its members' fight for equal pay.
The company, which supports U.S. soccer through its Secret deodorant brand, said it will donate $529,000 - $23,000 for each of the 23 players on the U.S. team that won the World Cup earlier this month - to help close the pay gap. The sponsor took out a full-page ad printed in The New York Times on Sunday, urging the U.S. Soccer Federation to "be on the right side of history."
In March, 28 members of the USWNT sued the U.S. Soccer Federation for alleged gender discrimination. The suit claims the federation pays the women less than members of the men's national team.

Texto completo: In “The Thirteenth Child,” the Brothers Grimm meet Hitchcock.
Forget about those magic beans and bowls of porridge. This fairy tale is a down-to-the-wire thriller.
In 2016, Danish composer Poul Ruders read a cryptic short story by the Brothers Grimm and turned it into a fairy tale opera.
“It was the once upon a time elements that drew me to one of the lesser known Brothers Grimm stories ‘The Twelve Brothers,' ” Ruders said.
The opera is not based on the original story, but suggested by it, Ruders said.
The first act spans 18 years from the birth of the main character Princess Lyra, the 13th child in the title. The libretto takes Lyra through the deaths of both her father King Hjarne and of her mother Queen Gertrude. By the second act, Lyra's brothers have been turned into ravens by an evil spell. If Lyra utters a single word, they will remain that way, never returning to human form.
Ruders described the music as “ear candy with chile

Mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford will make her Santa Fe debut as Queen Gertrude. Tenor Joshua Dennis is Frederic and Metropolitan Opera tenor (“The Magic Flute,” “Tosca”) Bradley Garvin will sing Drokan. New York bass David Leigh will play King Hjarne in his Santa Fe Opera debut.
One of today's most highly acclaimed composers, Ruders wrote “The Handmaid's Tale,” hailed as a “riveting, kaleidoscopic score' by the New York Times. “The Thirteenth Child” is his fifth opera and Santa Fe's 16th world premiere.

Texto completo: The free-spirited Texan who overcame his quirky name to become a distinguished actor in television, theater and movies and to win an Emmy in his 60s for "The Larry Sanders Show" died Tuesday afternoon. Rip Torn was 88.
His work on stage and screen spanned seven decades, ranging from an early career of dark, threatening roles to iconic comedic performances later in life.
After acclaimed performances in "Cross Creek," "Sweet Bird of Youth" and other dramas, Torn turned to comedy to capture his Emmy as the bombastic, ethically challenged television producer in "The Larry Sanders Show." Created by and starring Garry Shandling, HBO’s spoof of TV talk shows aired from 1992 to 1998 and is widely credited with inspiring such satirical programs as "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and "30 Rock," in which Torn had a recurring role as the CEO of General Electric.
Torn played Agent Zed in the first two "Men in Black," movies, which starred Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.
Born Elmore Rual Torn, the actor adopted the name Rip in his boyhood, following the tradition of his father and uncle. It was the subject of endless ridicule during his early days as a stage actor in New York, and fellow drama students urged him to change it.
With customary stubbornness, he refused, eventually overcoming the jokes with a series of powerful performances that led to his being regarded, along with Marlon Brando, Paul Newman and James Dean, as actors of a postwar generation who brought tense realism to their craft. He was also a political activist who joined James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte and other cultural and civil rights leaders for a frank and emotional 1963 meeting with then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy about the country’s treatment of blacks.
* Hodan Nalayeh, a Canadian-Somali journalist who was dedicated to showcasing the hidden beauty of her homeland and its people, was killed Friday — along with her husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, and at least 24 others — after a bomb exploded outside the Asasey Hotel in the Somali city of Kismayo and gunmen stormed inside. She was 43 and expecting her third child.
On Twitter, Nalayeh shared posts featuring marine life dangling from the hands of fishermen, a small boat setting out in cerulean waters and locals holding leopard-spotted stingrays.
"Dried fish is big business on the island of #Ilisi. They call this fish ‘Shabeelka Bada,’ or ‘tiger of the ocean,’" she wrote Thursday.
"People save all their lives to have a retirement by the beach, yet we have plenty of it and cannot see its value. Let’s appreciate the beautiful blessings we have," she wrote in an earlier post.
* Jerry Lawson, who for four decades was the lead singer of the eclectic cult-favorite a cappella group the Persuasions, died Wednesday in a Phoenix hospice after a long illness. He was 75.
* The former New York Yankees pitcher who shocked and angered the conservative baseball world with the tell-all book "Ball Four" died Wednesday while in hospice care at his home in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Jim Bouton was 80 and had fought a brain disease linked to dementia.
Published in 1970, "Ball Four" detailed Yankees great Mickey Mantle’s carousing and the use of stimulants in the major leagues. Bouton’s revealing look at baseball off the field made for eye-opening and entertaining reading, but he paid a big price for the best-seller when former teammates and players and executives across baseball ostracized him for exposing their secrets. He wasn’t invited to the Yankees’ Old-Timers’ Day until 1998.
* Valentina Cortese, an Italian postwar screen diva who was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role as a fading diva in Francois Truffaut’s "Day for Night," died Wednesday. She was 96.
While Cortese didn’t win the Academy Award in 1975, she was showered with praise by the actress who did clinch it that year: Ingrid Bergman for her performance in "Murder on the Orient Express."
In an elegant acceptance speech devoted to Cortese, Bergman said the Italian actress had given "the most beautiful performance" in "Day for Night" by playing an aging actress who forgets her lines like "all we actresses" do sooner or later.
"I’m her rival, and I don’t like it at all," Berman said and gestured toward a smiling Cortese in the audience. "Please forgive me, Valentina."
* The eccentric Dallas billionaire whose two independent runs for president in the 1990s tapped into voters’ frustration with the major political parties and foreshadowed the rise of the Tea Party two decades later died Tuesday at his home in Dallas. H. Ross Perot was 89.
The son of a politically connected cotton broker, Perot followed a long tradition of buccaneering Texas entrepreneurs. Following an unhappy stint in the peacetime Navy of the 1950s, he became a top salesman at IBM and was such an exhaustive peddler of computer hardware that he once met an annual sales quota in less than three weeks.
Perot went into business for himself in 1962 and made a fortune twice over, starting two software companies that each sold for billions of dollars. He received national attention for showering his largesse on efforts to aid or free U.S. hostages in conflict zones from Vietnam to Lebanon.
In 1992, running without party affiliation, Perot received 19.7 million votes, draining support from both major-party candidates and possibly contributing to the victory of Democrat Bill Clinton over the incumbent president, Republican George H.W. Bush.
Perot’s 19% share of the total was the most for an independent or third-party candidate since former President Theodore Roosevelt won 27% as a Bull Moose in 1912.
Perot ultimately carried no states but edged Bush for second in Maine. He ran years later, earning just over 8 million votes, or 8.4%, as Clinton easily defeated Republican Bob Dole.
Perot’s legacy was evidenced nearly two decades later when the Tea Party reignited anti-incumbent fervor and insistence on small government, though Perot also vowed higher taxes while promising to cuts federal spending and the deficit.
* Architect Phil Freelon, who designed buildings ranging from local libraries to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, died Tuesday in North Carolina. The 66-year-old had suffered from Lou Gehrig’s disease for several years.
* Fernando de la RÃºa, the Argentine leader whose dramatic departure by helicopter from the roof of the presidential palace in 2001 epitomized the tumult of his short-lived administration, a period of financial free-fall and deadly social unrest in one of Latin America’s largest economies, died Tuesday at 81. He suffered from cardiac and other ailments.
* Actor Cameron Boyce, best known for his role as the teenage son of Cruella de Vil in the Disney Channel franchise "Descendants," died July 6 at his home in Los Angeles. A cause of death for the 20-year-old was not released, but his family said in a statement July 7 that he "passed away in his sleep due to a seizure that was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated."
* The Tony- and Emmy-winning writer, director and producer who turned a Depression-era comic strip into a hit Broadway musical about a freckle-faced orphan with a "hard knock life" died July 6 at a hospital in White Plains, New York. Martin Charnin was 84 and had suffered a heart attack three days before his death.
Long before he conceived, directed and wrote the lyrics to "Annie," Charnin was a Broadway actor playing a Jet in the original 1957 production of "West Side Story." But he found he had little inclination for singing and dancing and soon turned toward behind-the-scenes creative work.
"Annie" opened on Broadway in 1977 and ran for 2,377 performances, spawning two Tony-nominated revivals, three film adaptations and countless local theater productions, with The New York Times estimating in 2012 that 700 to 900 "Annies" run each year in the United States alone.
* Marie Ponsot, who in recent years was increasingly recognized as one of the most distinctive poets of her generation, died July 5 at age 98.
After the publication of her first collection in 1956, Ponsot set aside her career to raise her seven children and didn’t publish her second book, "Admit Impediment," until a quarter-century later. She went on to release five more books.
Ponsot received the National Book Critics Circle Award for her 1998 collection, "The Bird Catcher"; was elected a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets; and in 2013 was awarded the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, a $100,000 lifetime-achievement honor from the Poetry Foundation.

Texto completo: Immigrant advocates in El Paso are preparing migrants for possible federal deportation raids in the area.
The raids reportedly are set to begin Sunday morning in 10 major U.S. cities, according to the New York Times. The cities where the raids will take place have not been announced.
The Border Network for Human Rights and the Hope Border Institute in El Paso have begun to inform migrants of their rights and what to do if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers show up at their homes.
Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights, said the announcement of the planned raids by President Donald Trump and ICE officials has created a sense of fear and uncertainty in the El Paso community.
Migrants' fear of family separations The biggest worry is that children legally born in the U.S. will be separated from parents who are not U.S. citizens.
"There is a fear," Garcia said. "We don't know if, when or where these raids will happen. There will be family separations with these raids. There are families whose children are legal residents and could be separated from their parents. So, the parents are getting their children's documents ready. They are making plans for someone — a family member, a friend or a neighbor — to take their kids in case the parents are taken and put in detention or deported."
Since immigration advocates don't know whether there will be raids in the El Paso area, "we are just preparing in case it happens here," Garcia said.
Marisa Limón, deputy director of the Hope Border Institute, also said the impending raids have caused fear and pain in the Borderland.
"Not only is it causing pain, it's psychological trauma, and it's really going to wreak havoc on immigrants and people and their relationships with law enforcement in general," Limon said. "It just makes things a lot more complicated, so we're really encouraging people, especially those with mixed-status families, where maybe the parents are undocumented but the children are U.S. citizens, to make a plan."
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials declined to provide details on where the raids will take place due to security concerns.
"Due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations," an ICE spokesman said in a statement.
The raids will reportedly target migrants who might pose a national security or public safety risk, although officials said all migrants violating immigration laws could be deported as part of the raids.
"As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security," the statement said. "In fact, 90 percent of aliens arrested by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations component in FY2018 had either a criminal conviction(s), pending criminal charge(s), were an ICE fugitive, or illegally reentered the country after previously being removed."
It added, "However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and — if found removable by final order — removal from the United States."
Limón said that while she believes most of the raids are scheduled for the interior of the country, they still can have an effect on El Paso.
"Here in El Paso, this is naturally a migratory space and place," Limón said. "We are a binational community. It just happens that a lot of things that are felt nationally are felt here, too, so when we see more attacks on immigrants in particular, it comes home because this is a community of immigrants and everyone here has an immigrant story."
She said that while the raids seem to be targeting migrants with removal orders, it is possible for migrants in the same area to also be detained.
"So, that seems like not just these people that have been ordered for removal, but anyone that happens to be in their vicinity might get swept up as well, and that's incredibly challenging," she said.
Don't have to open the door The Border Network for Human Rights already has created programs and reached out to migrant families to help them plan and prepare for raids.
One of the most important actions being taken by both the Border Network for Human Rights and the Hope Border Institute is helping families understand their constitutional rights.
"We have launched the 'Community Defense' project to get people ready in case this happens," Garcia said. "The first one in the project is we are organizing community forums and house meetings, teaching people about their constitutional rights and how they can exercise their rights in case of a raid or encounter with law enforcement."
Network officials also walk migrants through simulations of what they could be confronted with during a raid.
"We do role-playing about the element of the Constitution that they exercise and how they can do it during a raid," Garcia said. "For example, during the role-play dynamic where we tell them not to open the door, they don't have to answer any questions that may incriminate them in any way, that there has to be a legal process for every law enforcement action — search or arrest warrant — and that they have the right to call an attorney."
Network members also are conducting house drills to further prepare families on what exactly could happen during a raid.
"For families that want to prepare a little more, we are doing house drills where we reenact a potential raid at their home," Garcia said. "So, they know what to do during the raids."
Advocates also have launched the "Migra Watch" program that encourages families to record all interactions with law enforcement. As part of the program, network volunteers will to go to the scene of raids and record what is happening.
"The 'Migra Watch' is a program where young people are ready to go with cameras or phones to record videos of immigration law enforcement actions, especially during raids," Garcia said. "We want to make sure these incidents are documented so we can check to see if there were any human rights and constitutional violations."
The organization also is urging all community members who see raids occurring to video record the interactions.
At the Hope Border Institute, Limón said they have been using social media to reach migrants and inform them of their rights.
"We just want to make sure that folks know what rights they have, what protections they have and how they really need to make a plan," Limón said. "We're obviously concerned with all people, especially when the government talks about collateral folks being included."

Texto completo: The new Toni Morrison documentary, "The Pieces I Am," premiered in Washington the day after Congress held an unprecedented hearing on the question of reparations. As I listened to the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates testify on the enduring toll of slavery on the black body, the black family and black opportunity in this country, I realized why filmmaker Timothy Greenfield-Sanders told the audience at the premiere that "it's always the right time for Toni." To be haunted by the ghosts of the past, to live with and among them, is a world made possible by the mind and the language of Toni Morrison.
"The Pieces I Am" opens with Morrison's voice. She reads from the novel "Beloved" as photographs of her are disassembled and assembled into completion: "She is a friend of my mind. She gather me, man. The pieces I am, she gather them and give them back to me in all the right order. It's good, you know, when you got a woman who is a friend of your mind." At 88, Morrison remains a guiding force of our national conscience and a friend of its mind.
Morrison lives, in my imagination, at a higher plane than any other living writer, a Nobel laureate operating at the peak of language and moral clarity - a mythical, monumental deity of American letters. That enigmatic persona is partly of her making. As Greenfield-Sanders tells me, she has consciously avoided the public eye and maintains a fierce sense of privacy. "You can't operate at her level without retaining some distance," he says. For lack of a better word, Greenfield-Sanders's new documentary "The Pieces I Am" demystifies the woman behind the icon.
Born Chloe Wofford in 1931, the author looks directly into the camera as she tells the story of her life - from her childhood in Lorain, Ohio, to juggling her career as an editor at Random House with her other roles - a single mother, a teacher and a writer. Given her absence from my generation's digital public square, it is a gift to "see" Morrison through reflections of Angela Davis, Oprah Winfrey, the critic Hilton Als and the poet Sonia Sanchez, among others. Like any great commercial documentary, the film illuminates and entertains. It is a banquet of music, images, conversations, and, of course, Morrison, at its center, talking directly to you, as luminescent, radiant and wise as you'd imagine.
I saw "The Pieces I Am" while rereading Morrison for the first time in 15 years. In February, Knopf released a collection of her essays and speeches titled, "The Source of Self-Regard." Drawn from four decades of writings, it's the kind of collection one can return to over and over again. Wrapped in a light-pink cover with gold typography, each essay disentangles the same questions we're wrestling with in our public discourse today: inequality, white supremacy, sexism, migration and the role of artists in political life. According to Greenfield-Sanders, it was an unplanned scheduling alignment between publisher and film distributor that made this an interdisciplinary season of return. As a reader, one could not ask for a better combination of sources for revisiting Morrison in 2019.
The 350-page collection traces the formation of the author's ideas, the breadth of her interests and her prodigious gift for language. Morrison unpacks the corrosive public and private pain of discrimination but always returns to her belief in the artist's ability to reimagine the world. In the opening essay, "Peril," about the dangers of censorship, she writes that "certain kinds of trauma visited on peoples are so deep, so cruel, that unlike money, unlike vengeance, even unlike justice or fights, or the goodwill of others, only writers can translate such trauma and turn sorrow into meaning, sharpening the moral imagination. A writer's life and work are not a gift to mankind; they are its necessity."
I first encountered Morrison as a high school movie critic for the Richmond Times-Dispatch when I was assigned to review Winfrey's adaptation of "Beloved." My immigrant parents had settled outside Richmond in a small town where the curriculum largely excluded black writers, opting instead for a revisionist history of the Civil War as the "war of northern aggression." Plantation slavery was conveniently glossed over in the haunted landscape of the former Confederate States of America. I dug up my review in writing this essay. I described "Beloved" as "confusing," clearly lacking the historical awareness and the maturity to comprehend the source of my profound confusion. It was not until we were assigned "Beloved" in a political theory seminar at the University of Virginia that I began to grasp the American arc of injustice and the idea of moral reckoning and haunting.
With piercing language and extraordinary storytelling, Morrison forced readers to confront the depravity and terrorism of American slavery, shattering the English-language canon in the process. In breaking from what she describes as the existing "master narrative" of white, male writers, Morrison saw enslavement from a black mother's perspective while also crafting a singular ghost story. In a section of "The Source of Self-Regard" dedicated to the craft of writing, Morrison explains how she set out to develop a language that was both "race-clotted and race-inflected" but also free from the existing architecture of "race." She writes, "I am deeply and personally involved in figuring out how to manipulate, mutate and control imagistic, metaphoric language in order to produce something that could be called race-specific race-free prose: literature that is free of the imaginative restraints that the racially inflected language at my disposal imposes on me."
In the documentary "The Pieces I Am" she recounts how, as a professor at Princeton University, she urged her writing students to get outside of their "own little lives" and to imagine lives of others. In an essay titled "Goodbye to All That: Race, Surrogacy and Farewell," she writes, "this effort to balance the demands of cultural specificity with those of artistic range is a condition, rather than a problem, for me. A challenge rather than a worry. A refuge rather than a refugee camp. Home territory, not foreign land." It is a critical examination by Morrison herself of how to balance collective responsibility with creative autonomy at a time when the role of "women artists" or "black artists" is being revisited across mediums. Morrison explains that at the core of her artistic project is a desire to celebrate and luxuriate in her blackness without participating in the trap of America's "raced" imagination and the limitations that it creates for an artist.
It feels appropriate, therefore, that Greenfield-Sanders integrates so many visionary and pioneering black artists into his cinematic portrait. Eschewing the conventions of filmed biographies, the camera glides over paintings, photographs and illustrations as interviewees speak about Morrison's life. The episodes of her career are accompanied by Jacob Lawrence's Great Migration paintings, Kara Walker's plantation silhouettes and Gordon Parks's photographs of segregation.
"The Pieces I Am" is an inspired and beautiful monument. That said, the film is best experienced in stereo - and in conjunction with reading Morrison's words. By diving into essays that marinate in the themes touched upon in the film, it becomes self-evident how her language is the ultimate "Source of Self-Regard."
As one would expect, Toni Morrison is neither giving interviews nor appearing at screenings of the documentary film about her life. It is not and has never been her style. But Greenfield-Sanders says that when she saw the finished film, she offered this appraisal of its subject: "I liked her."

The new plot against Obamacare

Texto completo: The Affordable Care Act was an imperfect and incomplete reform. The political compromises needed to get it through Congress created a complex system in which too many people fall through the holes. It was also underfunded, which is why deductibles are often uncomfortably high. And the law has faced sabotage both from GOP-controlled state governments and, since 2017, the Trump administration.
Despite all that, however, the act has vastly improved many Americans' lives - and in many cases, saved lives that would otherwise have been lost due to inadequate care. The progress has been most dramatic in states that have tried to make the law work. Before the ACA went into effect, 24% of California adults too young for Medicare were uninsured. Today that number is down to 10%. In West Virginia, uninsurance fell from 21% to 9%. In Kentucky, it fell from 21% to 7%.
Overall, around 20 million Americans who wouldn't have had health insurance without the ACA now do.
At the same time, none of the dire predictions conservatives made about the law have come true. It didn't bust the budget - in fact, deficits came down steadily even as the ACA went into effect. It didn't discourage workers from taking jobs: Employment of Americans in their prime working years is back to what it was before the financial crisis. And despite Donald Trump's best efforts to undermine it, the system isn't in a "death spiral": Insurers are making money and premiums have stabilized.
In short, Obamacare is a success story. And the U.S. public really, really disapproves of Republican attempts to destroy it, which was arguably the main reason Democrats did so well in the midterm elections.
But Republicans still hate the idea of helping Americans get the health care they need. They're still determined to reverse the progress we've made. And in case you haven't noticed, today's GOP doesn't believe that the will of the voters should determine policy, or that rule of law as normally understood should constrain the right's efforts to get what it wants.
Which brings me to the federal lawsuit currently before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a suit brought by 18 state attorneys general, and backed by the Trump administration. This suit claims that the whole act is unconstitutional and should be thrown out. The plaintiffs' arguments are clearly specious and made in obvious bad faith. But one lower-court judge has already ruled in the suit's favor, and early indications suggest that the two Republican-appointed judges on the three-judge panel hearing the appeal may agree.
But wait, haven't we been here before? Yes. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare was indeed constitutional. On one central dispute, the constitutionality of the individual mandate - the requirement that individuals be insured, or pay a penalty - Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that the penalty constituted a tax, and that taxes are clearly constitutional. So the law stood.
Why, then, is this being relitigated? Well, in 2017 a Republican-controlled Congress, after balking at actually repealing the ACA, reduced the penalty for being uninsured to $0.00 - effectively eliminating the mandate. Aha, said the law's opponents: Since the mandate no longer collects any money, it's not a tax, and it is hence unconstitutional, and so therefore is the whole law.
As far as I can tell, a vast majority of legal experts consider this argument ridiculous, and so it is. After all, it says that the ACA would be constitutional if Congress had explicitly eliminated the mandate, as opposed to simply making it irrelevant; the act would also be constitutional if the penalty had remained positive, no matter how small, say $1, because then it would still be a tax.
I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure that if a legal argument has absurd implications, it's an absurd argument.
Yet, as I said, one Republican judge has already ruled in favor of this nonsense, and it looks at least possible that the two on the appellate panel will follow his lead.
Even if they do, the case will be appealed to the Supreme Court, which probably - probably - will reject the suit. But few would have imagined that it could get as far as it has.
There are, I'd say, two main implications of what we're seeing here.
The first is that right-wing partisanship has already corrupted much of the judiciary. At this point it's clear that there are many judges who will rule in favor of whatever the GOP wants, no matter how weak the legal arguments.
The second is that even though Obamacare is now part of the fabric of American life, even though many of the beneficiaries are Republican voters - think about those numbers for Kentucky and West Virginia - Trump and his party are as determined as ever to destroy it.
And what this means in turn is that the 2020 election will be another referendum on health care. If you're an American who suffers from a preexisting condition, or doesn't have a job that comes with health benefits, you should know that if Trump is reelected, he will, one way or another, take away your health insurance.

A national disgrace

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing – to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.

Texto completo: This is always the risk when you try to build a better mousetrap. Someone is likely to come along and build a bigger mouse.

So it should hardly come as a big surprise that when efforts began to bring solar energy to Florida it was greeted by some naysayers who argued the Sunshine State (too subtle a marketing concept?) was actually a dark, dreary landscape that made Blade Runner look like Tahiti.

A few days ago, my old Tampa Bay Times colleague Ivan Penn, now with the New York Times, explored the difficulties the solar power industry has confronted in establishing a foothold in Florida.

This was less an analysis of Floridas solar energy potential than it was a stroll down the states insane Ezra Pound-like denial of reality.

Or consider a quote from U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, who offered up this spit-take moment: Ive had electric utility executives say with a straight face that we cant have solar power in Florida because we have so many cloudy days.

This is a bit like arguing gondolas will never work in Venice because theres not enough water.

Lets do an experiment. Go outside. Look up. What is that big hot thingy in the sky?

Perhaps when it comes to stuff like this it could be suggested that while the rest of the state is sweltering, up in Tallahassee a nuclear winter of radioactive fairy dust has stifled any chance common sense might bloom within the Florida Legislature.

Good government doesnt come cheap. And inept government is even more pricey.

Penn noted that from 2014 until May, the states largest utilities pumped some $57 million in campaign contributions to members of the Florida Legislature. Florida Power & Light alone dropped $31 million of that total, proving once again that while members of the Florida Legislature cant (Heaven forbid!) be bought, they are available for a time share.

And just to make sure that investment in turning the state House and Senate into a buffet line of legalized baksheesh was protected, the utilities also spent $6 million on lobbying, with at least one utility lobbyist for every two members of the Florida Legislature.

Thats a lot of babysitting. But it has been worth every dime and bar tab.

After all, if you are a homeowner who wants to install solar energy panels on your home, you likely find yourself navigating a maze of bureaucratic hurdles that would exhaust a steeplechase jockey.

Penn cited examples of homeowners waiting for months to have their panels activated. Thanks to your public servants in Tallahassee, Florida is one of only eight states that prohibit the sale of solar power directly to consumers unless the provider is a utility. And Florida also requires homeowners to pay onerous and expensive insurance policies on their solar panels.

Indeed, one homeowner was discouraged from installing solar because in Florida it rains.

Florida law also bars solar energy companies from owning panels and selling the energy they create directly to consumers as 27 other states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico already allow.

Meanwhile as the utilities attempt to suppress solar energy, the companies themselves are pursuing their own solar energy businesses.

Forgive an admittedly naïve observation.

The Florida Legislature is dominated by a Republican Party that loves to draw close to its bosom the high ideals of capitalism.

In the spirit of Freedom and Liberty (exclamation marks optional), Republicans extol the virtues of entrepreneurship, free markets and the spirit of competition  unless, of course, all this fiddle-faddle blithering about free enterprise threatens the bottom lines of the states most entrenched (and deep-pocketed) monopolies.

If the Florida Legislature really believed in all this claptrap about the power of ideas, innovation, the value of robust competition and the rights of consumers to make their own choices about the goods and services they buy, well then, why shouldnt the solar power industry be permitted to operate on a level playing field with the states utilities?

According to the Republican faux mantra of rugged individualism, businesses ought to succeed or fail on the strength of creativity, sound management and their consumer appeal. Fair enough.

Ah, fairness.

All the solar power industry is entitled from government is fairness. The fairness to compete unimpeded. Its not too much to ask.

Instead, the states utilities are using their money and their power to pay off Tallahassee to protect their interests against competition. So much for progress.

Sounds a little bit like (shush!) socialism, doesnt it?

Sólo 3 celdas separan a El Chapo de Epstein, magnate amigo de Trump detenido por sexo con niñas

Texto completo: Un giro inesperado del destino ha convetido al narcotraficante mexicano Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán en vecino del magnate Jeffrey Epstein, ex amigo de Donald Trump y Bill Clinton.
Sólo 3 celdas los separan en el Centro Correccional Metropolitano, en el Bajo Manhattan (150 Park Row). Pero estos famosos presos no pueden verse, porque están aislados.
Epstein se encuentra bajo custodia desde el 6 de julio por cargos de que contrató a niñas de 14 años para masajes desnudos que incluyeron contacto sexual en sus hogares de Nueva York y Palm Beach. Se declaró “no culpable” el lunes y su caso apenas “recomienza” tras un acuerdo de 2008 en Florida; mientras, “El Chapo”, extraditado desde México en 2017, ya fue declarado culpable y está programado para ser sentenciado esta próxima semana.
Epstein está en la celda número 4, tres puertas más abajo de “El Chapo”, preso en la número 1.
“El lugar es tan asqueroso”, dijo a New York Post el abogado del mexicano, Jeffrey Lichtman.
“Si no tienes contacto humano allí arriba, empiezas a perder la razón. Presumiblemente, Epstein tendrá la capacidad de contratar personas para que lo visiten. De lo contrario, se volverá loco “, dijo.
El abogado de Epstein, Marc Fernich, no devolvió un mensaje para comentar las condiciones de la cárcel. Pero la defensa del magnate ha pedido que lo dejen aguardar el juicio en su mansión de siete pisos en el Upper East Side, y se espera que el juez tome una decisión al respecto este lunes.
Mientras, en el explosivo caso un nuevo reporte indicó que Epstein donó importantes sumas de dinero a varias escuelas en EEUU y en el extranjero, incluyendo un exclusivo colegio sólo para niñas cerca de su mansión en de Manhattan.
Según informó The Associated Press, Epstein donó $15 mil dólares a la prestigiosa escuela “Hewitt” en East 75th St en 2016, años después de que se declarara culpable en 2008 de solicitar a una menor para la prostitución.
No está claro por qué Epstein seleccionó a esa escuela para la donación, pero los administradores dijeron que el monto fue devuelto hace varios meses después de que se enteraron de que provenía de Epstein, acusado por pedofilia.
En otras donaciones, el magnate judío donó $35 mi dólares al “Junior Tennis Champions Center” en Maryland, y $25 mil la escuela primaria “Ecole du Bel-Air” en Haití, destruida por el huracán de 2010.
Este escándalo de abuso sexual de menores ya salpicó a la Casa Blanca, donde ayer renunció el Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete de Trump, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo de culpabilidad de Epstein en 2008.
Ahora Epstein podría ser encarcelado por hasta 45 años , informó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Trump y Bill Clinton.
En medio del escándalo, trascendió que NYPD también falló en supervisar la libertad condicional de Epstein.

Report of ICE raids has Latino community on edge

Texto completo: The Latino community in Delaware is bracing for possible immigration raids planned across the country this weekend.
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials would neither confirm nor deny a New York Times report about raids targeting 2,000 illegal immigrants planned for 10 large cities starting on Sunday.
Activists in Delaware are gathering to support local immigrants and protest the ICE raids.
Lights for Liberty: A Vigil to End Human Detention Camps will take place in Rodney Square Friday night.
"Let's unite and protest together for the inhumane things that are happening in this country," said Charito Calvachi-Mateyko, co-chair of the Delaware Hispanic Commission.
They hope to educate immigrants on what to do if they encounter an ICE agent and explain their rights.
That education includes helping families plan for the care of their kids if they are detained, said Maria Matos, head of the Latin American Community Center.
Latinos account for close to 10% of Delaware's population or 92,000 people, according to the Census Bureau. The population continues to grow.
Jose M. Somalo, publisher and owner of the Spanish-language publication Hoy en Delaware, said even citizens who appear Hispanic are fearful of being approached by an ICE agent.
Pew Research reported there were 30,000 undocumented immigrants in Delaware in 2016.
A large number of immigrants live in rural Delaware working on farms and in chicken processing plants. Many of those workers are concerned for their safety, Somalo said.
Delaware falls under the ICE Philadelphia Field Office, which also covers Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
Philadelphia ICE officials could not be reached for comment on the potential raids.
Matos said she is "praying it won't happen."
President Donald Trump said two weeks ago that he would delay nationwide raids for two weeks to give Congress time to develop an immigration plan.
Trump's hard line on immigration has been a recurring theme in his presidency and is expected to take center stage in his 2020 reelection bid.

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6 billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Texto completo: Cuando en 2011 una jueza ordenó que, como parte del cuestionado acuerdo judicial en Florida, el multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein debía reportarse ante NYPD cada 90 días como “agresor sexual”, la abogada defensora Sandra Musumeci insistió en que no era un “residente de Nueva York” y que su propiedad de siete pisos era una “casa de vacaciones” en la que no tenía planes de quedarse “más de un período de 10 días”.
Pero ahora que fue encarcelado por nuevos cargos de tráfico y abuso de menores, de los que se declaró “no culpable”, Epstein (66) solicitó ayer la opción de esperar el juicio bajo detención domiciliaria en su mansión del Upper East Side.
La medida incluiría cámaras de seguridad, vigilancia con un brazalete en el tobillo, una fianza garantizada por la residencia de $77 millones de dólares y prohibición de vuelo de su jet privado.
La defensa también dijo que se podría nombrar a un “fideicomisario” residente para vigilarlo, y ofreció pagar a guardias armados las 24 horas para evitar que huya , detalla el expediente judicial citado por amNY.
Según la acusación federal, en esa misma casa de siete pisos (9 East 71 St), él abusó de “docenas” de menores de edad en una sala de masajes equipada con juguetes sexuales. También allí, según los documentos judiciales, los agentes encontraron cientos de fotos de chicas desnudas el pasado fin de semana.
Pero los abogados de Epstein, en la nota de fianza presentada el jueves en el tribunal federal de Manhattan, continuaron sosteniendo que los nuevos cargos están prohibidos por un acuerdo de no persecución con las autoridades federales en Florida en 2008, y que la “hipérbole” sensacionalista no debería obstaculizar su derecho a fianza.
“Dejando a un lado la condena popular, las cuestiones legales imperantes se interponen entre el señor Epstein y cualquier posible condena por las acusaciones de conducta de hace 14 a 17 años presentadas en la acusación”, dijeron los abogados Reid Weingarten y Martin Weinberg al juez de distrito de Manhattan, Richard Berman, quien el lunes decidirá si otorga la libertad bajo fianza.
Epstein se encuentra bajo custodia en Manhattan desde el 6 de julio por cargos de que contrató a niñas de 14 años para masajes desnudos que incluyeron contacto sexual en sus hogares de Nueva York y Palm Beach (Florida), entre 2002 y 2005.
Este escándalo por abuso sexual de menores ya salpicó a la Casa Blanca, donde esta mañana renunció el Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete de Donald Trump, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo con Epstein en 2008.
Ahora Epstein podría ser encarcelado por hasta 45 años , informó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Trump y Bill Clinton.

Texto completo: Event planned for July 11 in Damariscotta.
DAMARISCOTTA — Skidompha Library’s Chats with Champions will feature Arlie Russell Hochschild at 10 a.m. Thursday in the Skidompha Library’s Porter Meeting Hall on Main Street. Please allow time for parking.
Hochschild is a renowned professor emerita of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her Chat with Champions at the library will focus on her latest title, “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,” a New York Times Best Seller and finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, according to a news release from the library.
In an era in which most of us live in our own “political bubble,” Hochschild dared to venture from liberal Democratic Berkeley, California, to conservative Republican Lake Charles, Louisiana. By the time Donald Trump had won election to the United States Presidency in 2016, Hochschild had spent five years immersed in the “deep story” of a nation grappling with its identity. Her Chat with Champions will unpack the political trends that elected Trump and offer solutions for moving forward.
For more information, call 563-5513.

We need to know that US is greater than 'just OK'

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
The fact is, all the freedom those other countries enjoy would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea— the idea of human liberty.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. Today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the light bulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty. That is better than "just OK."

¿A qué inmigrantes afectarán las redadas que se prevé que empiecen este domingo?

Texto completo: El diario The New York Times publicó este jueves que las tan anunciadas redadas comenzarán finalmente el próximo domingo. El operativo se desplegará previsiblemente en diez grandes ciudades (entre ellas Nueva York, Chicago o Los Ángeles) y estará destinado a todos los extranjeros “que violen las leyes de inmigración” , según dijo a Univision el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés).
Aunque la agencia federal rechazó ofrecer “detalles específicos relacionados con las operaciones”, si adelantó que el 90% de los extranjeros arrestados en 2018 “ tenían una o más condenas criminales pendientes o eran fugitivos” . Matthew Bourke, vocero de ICE, insitió en que la prioridad de la agencia migratoria es arrestar y deportar a quienes constituyan “una amenaza para la seguridad nacional, la seguridad pública y la seguridad fronteriza”.
ICE considera fugitivos a los extranjeros que permanecen en el país a pesar de tener una orden de deportación y a quienes firmaron una salida voluntaria del país pero no se fueron en la fecha acordada con las autoridades migratorias. Por su parte, volver a entrar a Estados Unidos sin autorización después de haber sido deportado en el pasado ( reentry ) implica un delito criminal, que se castiga incluso con cárcel.
Las redadas que Donald Trump ha anunciado ampliamente desde principios de junio ya son “inminentes”, tal como aseguro una fuente anónima del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) a Univision y como confirmó más tarde The New York Times.
Cinco días después de llegar a la Casa Blanca, Trump firmó una orden ejecutiva con la que declaró la permanencia indocumentada como una amenaza para la seguridad pública y nacional . En este sentido, el objetivo del presidente es deportar a los inmigrantes que se encuentren en alguno de los siguientes casos :
1. Condena por cualquier delito.
2. Acusación no resuelta por cualquier delito.
3. Comisión de actos que constituyen delito penal imputable.
4. Fraude o tergiversación deliberada de cualquier asunto oficial.
5. Sujeción a orden penal de deportación.
6. Riesgo para la seguridad pública o nacional (según un funcionario de migración).
7. M igrantes legales que perdieron sus derechos de permanencia y que continúan en el país.

Texto completo: Food halls and online competition make it hard to stay in the niche
Synonymous with gastronomic luxury and excess for 42 years, the Dean & DeLuca high-end grocery chain is in trouble. In 2018, it backed out of three leases in Manhattan and pulled the plug on a second D.C.-area store. It abruptly closed all four of its Charlotte locations in April 2018, and shortly after that its Maryland and Wichita locations.
The Upper East Side location on Madison Avenue in New York ceased operation this June 30, and the St. Helena, Calif., store was shuttered on July 4, both considered flagships.
This could herald hard times for other fabled ultra-premium grocers.
In May, the New York Post reported that the gourmet grocer has not only been closing stores, but also failing to pay landlords and vendors, embroiled in battles with suppliers big and small.
Founded by Giorgio DeLuca and Joel Dean, the company was bought by Thailand-based Pace Development Corp. in 2014 for $140 million.
As recently as 2018, owner and real estate tycoon Sorapoj Techakraisri announced plans to expand the brand by hundreds of stores within two years, dramatically increasing the company's presence in Asia and the Middle East.
Other super-premium grocery brands such as Balducci's have closed underperforming stores - although Zabar's remains stalwart, controversy over lobster salads without lobster notwithstanding. Which prompts the question: Is there too much competition for the gourmand's affections?
"There are a couple things at play," said David Henkes, a senior principal at food service industry analyst firm Technomic. "When you look at the grocery space, even Whole Foods has slowed. You look at the little [chains] that are coming in from other places, many of them are much more discount grocers. That's where a lot of the growth has been on the retail side."
The proliferation of specialty grocery stores has been fierce, confounding predictions that grocery sales would pivot to online sales. Amazon has bet big. Whole Foods and Trader Joe's have been joined by Germany-based discount chain Aldi, "healthy food" chains like Asheville, N.C.-based Earth Fare, swiftly expanding Sprouts Farmers Market and more upscale Lucky's out of Colorado.
(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
Other relative newcomers have chiseled from the ultraluxury grocers, the kinds of places where you can taste a little French cheese and kibbitz about precisely which piece of wild sockeye looks just right.
Food halls and markets like Grand Central Market in Los Angeles, Ponce City Market in Atlanta or Eataly in New York were one of the biggest food trends of the past couple of years, whittling market share from fine casual restaurants and upscale grocers.
And Henkes said that for the kind of fancy foods Dean & DeLuca built its reputation on - aged balsamic vinegars and pink salts from the Himalayas - much of it is now available online.
"And for prepared foods, that niche of their business is a much more competitive space, as well. Those areas where they were differentiated has become much more commoditized. The competitive landscape has really changed," Henkes noted.
Only seven Dean & DeLuca stores remain in the United States. According to the New York Times, small vendors in New York are owed hundreds of thousands of dollars, while larger vendors have discontinued credit. Store shelves in remaining stores are reportedly sparsely stocked.

Piper Jaffray buys Sandler in $485M deal

Texto completo: Piper Jaffray Cos. will buy Sandler O'Neill and Partners -- the New York boutique investment bank that recovered and thrived after losing co-founders and dozens of staffers in the 9/11 attack -- in a partnership that sharpens its ability to help other firms make deals.
Piper Jaffray will pay $485 million in cash and stock for Sandler. It will remain based in Minneapolis, have annual revenue of $1.1 billion and a new name: Piper Sandler Cos., the financial-services firm said Tuesday.
Though Sandler is a younger and smaller company than Piper Jaffray, the addition of its name is a sign of its stature in the investment banking industry. Executives from both firms emphasized that Sandler's bankers, including its leader Jimmy Dunne, will remain with the combined firm for years to come.
"Transactions in investment banking are always about the people," Chad Abraham, Piper Jaffray's chief executive, said on a call with investors and analysts. "We have a long history with Sandler and have admired the people and quality of the franchise they have built."
Dunne and his colleagues, Abraham said, will "do what they do best and that's be on the front line with their clients."
"I am completely in, completely excited," Dunne, who is 63, said on the call.
Piper Jaffray, whose history stretches back to a Minneapolis brokerage firm that opened in 1895, has in recent years gradually made deal advising across industries a greater source of business. With Sandler, it picks up the investment bank that has put together more deals in the financial-services industry than any other during the last
seven years.
For Sandler, the deal brings its closely held business into the view and pressure of more outside investors. The bank is a highly regarded niche player that Dunne helped start in 1988 and has led since the 2001 terror attack.
On Wall Street, Sandler O'Neill's financial success is as well known as its resilience after 9/11. Sixty-seven staffers, including co-founder Herman Sandler, died in the company's office on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower after the building was struck by a jetliner that day.
The loss represented 40% of the bank's workforce at the time. Sandler O'Neill's partners and employees remained committed to the families of its 9/11 victims, paying the college tuition of all of their children, the youngest of who was born six months after the attack.
Sandler O'Neill currently has 300 employees and grew from $243 million in 2012 revenue to $343 million last year, chiefly by doubling the size of its deal-advising practice.
"We are selling. From a partnership and outside investor perspective, that's true," Dunne said. "But the truth is we're really merging the two businesses, which is evidenced by the fact that Piper thinks enough of Sandler to put the Sandler name, which is very important to us both emotionally and commercially, to stand next to Piper."
Piper Jaffray will pay $350 million in cash to Sandler O'Neill's shareholders and another $135 million in restricted payments, chiefly in the form of Piper Jaffray shares to partners at Sandler O'Neill.
The firms put together another $115 million package to hang on to Sandler O'Neill partners and employees. When complete, Sandler O'Neill employees will own 16% of Piper Sandler.
"There's over 100 people at Sandler O'Neill that have extensive retention packages. We've got five- to seven-year agreements," said Jonathan Doyle, Sandler O'Neill's No. 2 executive. "We're staying right where we are doing right what we do with the clients."
With Sandler O'Neill, Piper Jaffray will pick up about $300 million in new revenue and see an immediate gain to its operating margin. The deal is expected to close early next year.
Dunne will become vice chairman, and Doyle will join the board of the combined firm. In a 2013 profile, the New York Times called Dunne "an old-school trader whose values include shunning debt."
Asked about future growth, Dunne expressed caution about setting expectations.
"We're really excited, and we're nervous," Dunne said. "That's the way we operate. We're going to go out and get whatever's there."
For Piper Jaffray, the deal is the latest aimed at focusing the firm on mergers and acquisition advising. At the moment, its largest mergers-and-acquisition advising unit serves health care firms. Helped by the 2016 acquisition of Simmons & Co., Piper Jaffray also has a sizable unit advising energy firms.
In addition to having a bigger footprint in financial-industry deal making, Piper Jaffray by purchasing Sandler O'Neill will expand its stock research, sales and trading business and add a differentiated fixed-income business.
Piper Jaffray recently moved to exit the asset-management business with the sale of a subsidiary in two transactions announced in May.

Sale of EDS made Perot GM's biggest shareholder

Texto completo: In the early 1980s, H. Ross Perot would become General Motors' largest individual shareholder and engage in a massive clash of egos with GM CEO Roger B. Smith.
Perot and Smith's deal initially looked like a match made in heaven, but it culminated with Perot declaring, "We've got to nuke the GM system," amid exasperation with what he considered GM's sluggish and bloated bureaucracy.
Perot, who twice ran for president as a third party candidate, died Tuesday at the age of 89.
A simple plan In 1984, GM bought Electronic Data Systems Corp., the company Perot had founded, for $2.55 billion.
Perot, a graduate of the Naval Academy, started EDS in 1962 with $1,000 after working for IBM for five years.
Perot's loyalty to his company was well known. He made front-page news in 1979 when he sent a team of 15 commandos to Tehran, the capital of Iran, and started a mass prison break so he could free two EDS employees.
GM wanted EDS for several reasons. First, its computer expertise would allow it to handle GM's bookkeeping, help computerize factories and integrate GM's computer systems, according to a 1989 New York Times article.
Smith also liked the entrepreneurial culture at EDS, which he believed would help GM recapture its status as a premier industrial power.
For Perot, the deal delivered a premium price for his EDS stock and the chance to play a major role in GM's turnaround. He became GM's largest individual shareholder.
The merger also allowed EDS to potentially become the greatest computer organization in the world.
The deal seemed simple: Perot would continue to lead EDS, which would operate as an autonomous unit within GM. GM Class E stock was created to preserve a separate identity for EDS in the market.
It was crafted to be a win-win for both sides, so what could go wrong?
Confusion reigns Almost from the start, the arrangement was doomed to escalate into a colossal battle of egos as Smith and Perot faced ambiguous lines of power.
Smith, as GM's leader, was Perot's boss, yet EDS remained Perot's charge.
Perot wanted independence for EDS, but Smith demanded subservience to GM. And Perot's entrepreneurial spirit that once so attracted Smith clashed with the GM bureaucracy.
Soon, there was dissension in the ranks. GM workers knew little about the merger in advance. Likewise, EDS employees became GM employees virtually overnight.
Perot and Smith disagreed over even the basic elements of their deal, such as employees' pay. Perot wanted to dictate EDS workers' salaries, but Smith argued the amounts were too high compared with GM's payment structure. In one case, Smith complained that a top EDS executive drew a higher salary than Smith did as chairman, the New York Times reported.
Those clashes aside, some good came out of the merger. EDS's revenue more than tripled to nearly $3.5 billion within a year of merging with GM. Within two years, employment nearly tripled to more than 40,000, Dallasnews.com reported in 2012.
A bad breakup Smith downplayed the conflict publicly, insisting that he and Perot had only minor differences. But after months of feuding, Perot resigned from the board and as chairman and CEO of EDS in 1986. GM's board of directors approved the buyout of all of Perot's GM stock for about $750 million at that time.
Perot put the money in escrow for two weeks to give GM a chance to reconsider its "morally wrong" buyout plan that would close 11 factories and throw 30,000 people out of work, the Los Angeles Times reported in 1986.
"I've got to live with myself," Perot said. "Why should I take this money? It would be morally wrong."
But GM had no change of heart. It said that EDS would be incorporated into a new division along with subsidiaries Hughes Aircraft Co., Delco Electronics and GM's defense operations.
GM and Perot were set to cut ties, except one more dispute arose, this time over the terms of the buyout agreement, specifically a noncompete clause. GM and Perot disagreed about how and when he could start up a rival company, Perot Systems. The legal wrangling eventually ended with both sides going their separate ways.
"The entire process since 1984 has been emotional," EDS chairman Les Alberthal told a reporter from Dallasnews.com.
"All these personal relationships have been torn apart by one man's decision to jump the gun and start a new company," he said.
About 150 of Perot System's first 190 employees came from EDS, according to news reports. There was a "real divide" among workers, said Todd Carlson, a former EDS executive, in the Dallas News article. "It was a tough time for a lot of people."
Indeed. In a bizarre twist, among Perot's former EDS colleagues to sue him on GM's behalf was one of the two men Perot rescued from Iran years earlier.

Bidens Earned $15 Million After 2016, Challenging 'Middle-Class Joe' Image

Texto completo: Over his long career in politics, Joseph R. Biden Jr. established his everyman bona fides by citing his status as the poorest member of the Senate and referring to himself as "Middle-Class Joe." But in the first two years after leaving office, Mr. Biden substantially improved his financial fortunes, earning more than $ 15 million, according to tax returns his campaign released Tuesday.
Thanks to six-figure speaking engagements and a lucrative deal to write a set of books, Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, reported an adjusted gross income of about $ 11 million in 2017 and $ 4.6 million in 2018 -- far more than any of his major Democratic primary opponents. Senator Kamala Harris of California and her husband reported the next-highest income, earning $ 3.4 million over those two years.
On a separate financial disclosure report, also made public Tuesday, the Bidens reported current assets worth between $ 2.2 million and $ 8 million, up from the range of $ 303,000 to just over $ 1 million that he reported when his second term as vice president ended in January 2017.
In a crowded field of Democratic rivals, many of whom are rolling out policies to address income inequality and channeling anger toward corporate America, being ranked among the millionaires amounts to an unwanted title. And for Mr. Biden, 76, it could be a particularly thorny issue.
[ Here's the latest data on who's leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]
He has spent decades carefully crafting his image as a relatable figure, often referring to his hardscrabble roots in Scranton, Pa., and working-class childhood in Delaware, and seeming at home with union voters in the industrial Midwest. Now a millionaire himself, Mr. Biden is likely to face the uncomfortable claim that he is suddenly out of step with the voters he covets.
Certainly, Mr. Biden is not alone: His three closest rivals in the polls -- Ms. Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- are all millionaires, too. The latest Democrat to enter the race, Tom Steyer, is a billionaire former hedge fund investor. And President Trump openly discusses his wealth, yet he still enjoyed support from blue-collar and union workers in 2016.
Since leaving office, Mr. Biden has worked with advisers to create nonprofits and academic centers while holding a paid professorship at the University of Pennsylvania. His campaign said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Biden had worked to "generate ideas on how we can help rebuild the American middle class, strengthen global leadership and end cancer as we know it."
Mr. Biden has also given dozens of paid speeches, including to universities and business leaders, with fees as high as $ 234,820. And in 2017, he and his wife signed a three-book deal with Flatiron Books, which was reported to be worth $ 8 million. After the announcement, they purchased a six-bedroom vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del., for $ 2.7 million.
The Bidens' income increased sharply after he left office. On their 2016 tax return, the Bidens reported an adjusted gross income of $ 396,456. At the time, their income included Mr. Biden's annual salary as vice president and his government pension, Dr. Biden's income as a community college professor, and social security benefits.
Mr. Biden's newfound wealth has not changed his message. In his first remarks during last month's Democratic debate, Mr. Biden spoke of "enormous income inequality" and promised to eliminate Mr. Trump's "tax cuts for the wealthy."
"Ordinary middle-class Americans built America," Mr. Biden said. "My dad used to have an expression -- he said, 'Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity, it's about respect, it's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything's going to be O.K."'
But in contrast to some of his more progressive rivals, who have sought distance from wealthy donors -- or have at least played down their reliance on them -- Mr. Biden is open about his frequent high-dollar fund-raising events, which are covered by the news media. He raised $ 21.5 million since entering the race at the end of April, his campaign said last week -- less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., raised in the second quarter of the year, but still outpacing other top rivals.

According to the campaign, which sought to emphasize Mr. Biden's appeal to small-dollar donors, the average donation was $ 49.
As Mr. Biden grew his personal wealth during his time away from elective office, he saw how Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential bid faced withering attacks over claims that she and her husband had cashed in on their public service as they made tens of millions of dollars giving speeches, consulting and writing books.
Mr. Biden tried to toe the line of making money off his celebrity while also not damaging a future presidential bid.
On his disclosure, Mr. Biden listed honorariums for roughly 50 public appearances beginning in late 2017, including book tour events and speaking engagements. Mr. Biden also made unpaid speaking appearances during that time, his campaign said when asked about engagements that were not listed on the disclosure. (The disclosure only included honorariums paid in 2018 or later.)
In January, Mr. Biden visited the battleground state of Florida for a speaking engagement in Fort Lauderdale, where he was paid an honorarium of $ 134,933 from the Performing Arts Center Authority. During a November swing through the Bay Area of California, an important Super Tuesday state that is also home to Ms. Harris, Mr. Biden gave four speeches, receiving about $ 500,000 in fees.
Most of Mr. Biden's paid speeches have been in conjunction with a tour to promote "Promise Me, Dad," a best-selling 2017 book about the final year of his son Beau's life, Mr. Biden's spokesman told The New York Times for an article this year. His campaign said that "every one of his speaking engagements was public, and more than half were also open to the press."
Dr. Biden also listed over a dozen speaking engagements that had associated honorariums ranging from $ 25,367 to $ 66,400.
In releasing his tax returns for the past three years, Mr. Biden's campaign noted that he had now released 21 years of returns. Other Democrats in the field have also shared their recent returns, while chiding Mr. Trump, who has refused to make his taxes public.
The Bidens' effective tax rate has increased as they have earned more money -- and paid more federal taxes -- in recent years. In 2018, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 33 percent, compared with the 24 percent they paid in 2016. The Bidens reported charitable donations of $ 1 million in 2017 and $ 276,000 in 2018, up from $ 5,889 in 2016.
Presidential candidates are required to file financial disclosure reports with the government, giving voters a view into their assets, income and debts. Some of Mr. Biden's rivals have also disclosed considerable wealth, including book deals, in their filings.
According to recent figures from the Center for Responsive Politics, Ms. Warren reported a net worth between $ 4.9 million and $ 11 million; Ms. Harris reported a range of $ 1.9 million to $ 6 million; and Mr. Sanders disclosed a range between $ 729,030 and $ 1.8 million. (Mr. Sanders also acknowledged in April that he was a millionaire.)

Texto completo: Remember when ketchup turned upside down? Or when half gallons of milk grew plastic screw caps on their sides? We are resistant to change in food packaging, attached to our squeezy honey bear, Toblerone's triangular prism, the resealable paperboard tube that houses Pringles's neat stack of hyperbolic paraboloid chips.
But what if there's a better way? (Seriously, try going back to doing the pinchy-pully motion to open the cardboard wings of a milk carton without mauling things.)
Something new is coming and soon you will scarcely remember when it didn't exist. It's called the Standcap Inverted Pouch. Daisy brand sour cream led the charge, debuting its Daisy Squeeze in 2015: a soft-sided, inverted wedge shape with a flat, flip-top dispensing closure on which it sits jauntily. It rolls down like a toothpaste tube, uses gravity as an assist and minimizes the introduction of oxygen, thus slowing spoilage.
And now the pouches are coming fast and furious: Chobani whole-milk plain yogurt, Original Uncle Dougie's organic barbecue sauces. A major player in the guacamole business will debut its version Aug. 1.
What's behind the pivot? Money is a motivator, but so are minimizing mess, cutting down on waste and conferring a halo effect via sustainability claims. In the first year of its pouch, Daisy reported a 69.7 percent increase in sales (despite charging about 25 percent more per ounce than for the traditional tubs). Other companies took notice.
According to Ron Cotterman, vice president of corporate innovation and sustainability for the packaging-solutions company Sealed Air, some of the drive for innovative packaging is a turn away from glass. He says in the past decade there's been a shift for three reasons: One is the cost of transporting and storing a heavy product, the second is the perception of safety (consumers fear breakage and shards) and the third is that there are not a lot of end markets for the glass. There has been a significant shift away from municipalities recycling glass because of the enormous cost associated with it.
"Part of it is consumer-driven," Cotterman says. "But it's also about sustainability. Walmart has its Project Gigaton goal to avoid 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases from the global value chain by 2030. And Amazon aims to make half of its shipments carbon neutral by 2030."
The race is on to replace heavy, bulky cans and jars with flexible packaging that can be stored flat for shipment before being filled.
That flexible standup pouch requires significantly less water, and produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other waste, says Evan Arnold, the director of product development and engineering at flexible packaging firm Glenroy, one of three companies that collaborated on the pouch.
"I just spoke at the Association of Dressings and Sauces technical meeting in Louisville and I asked everyone if they wanted to save the world. And I meant it, kind of," Arnold says.
Fine, world-saving. For now the body of the Standcap pouch cannot be recycled (they're working on that), although the cap can be screwed off and recycled. But let's talk about flips, drips, lips and other quotidian woes. There's the jerking motion required to coax a viscous liquid down the neck of an upright glass or hard plastic bottle (and the anguish of an unexpected deluge), then the wrist-flick flip back upright so gravity halts the flow. There's the goo that accumulates around the lip and cap of a regular bottle. And there's the vexing last 10 percent of a product that clings stubbornly to the container's innards, taunting you and wasting your money.
Aptar is the company responsible for the Standcap's silicone dispensing-valve technology. Regular inverted bottles with dispensing valves have a re-intake of air after you squeeze (like a shampoo bottle). Aptar's invention dispenses and cuts off the product without introducing air. According to Rob Johnson, chief executive of Original Uncle Dougie's, this feature dramatically extends shelf life.
But there are other reasons companies might be shifting to this kind of package. It's about a cultural shift, taking a product like sour cream from an ingredient (the anchor to a casserole or coffee cake) to a condiment.
"All of the research going on would validate this," Johnson says. "More and more people are using dipping sauces as a way for people to add flavor to food. A lot of restaurants are doing that."
The New York Times took some heat several years back for suggesting that millennials were killing breakfast cereal because there was too much cleanup. There is validity to this: Younger generations don't want to dirty silverware if they don't have to. Thus, the condimentization of foods. Look for the Standcap soon for nut butters, salsas and jams, that Aptar valve adjustable for different thickness and chunkiness levels.
For now, the Standcap Inverted Pouch is a novelty that stands out, and up, in the condiment aisle. (The more elongated the package, by the way, the more consumers perceive they contain, so the Standcap may trounce squattier tubs for eye appeal.)
But companies may also be playing to consumer psychology. Products that reside in the door of the refrigerator see more action. A tub gets pushed to the back of the fridge and into Siberia, green fuzz and solitude its inevitable fate. This new technology's upright design makes it door-appropriate, living cheek to jowl with heavy-rotation items. The Standcap Inverted Pouch may, in a sense, give companies a foot in the door.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump lashed out on Monday at Britain's ambassador to the United States, saying the White House would no longer deal with him after the publication of confidential cables in which the ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, disparaged Trump's administration as "clumsy and inept."
Trump's criticism, delivered in a pair of midday tweets, escalated the tensions between the United States and Britain that erupted after the cables were published Saturday by a British tabloid, The Mail on Sunday. The president broadened his criticism to include Prime Minister Theresa May, whom he accused of botching Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union.
"What a mess she and her representatives have created," Trump tweeted. "I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way."
Of Darroch, the president said, "I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him." Trump's statement came close to declaring Darroch persona non grata - an extraordinary breach between the United States and one of its closest allies.
In his cables, Darroch described the White House as a "uniquely dysfunctional environment" and said Trump was an unpredictable character. "There is no filter," he wrote. He also said the president faced the prospect of further disclosures that could lead to "disgrace and downfall."
In the leaked documents he called the Trump administration's policy toward Iran "incoherent," said the president might be indebted to "dodgy Russians" and raised doubts about whether the White House "will ever look competent."
"We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept," one missive said.
British officials scrambled to contain the damage from Darroch's unvarnished private assessments of the president and his administration. Britain's trade minister, Liam Fox, said he planned to apologize to Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, for the leaking of the cables at a meeting this week during his visit to Washington.
"Either our Civil Service or elements of our political class have not lived up to the expectations that either we have or the United States has about their behavior, which in this particular case has lapsed in a most extraordinary and unacceptable way," Fox said Monday on BBC Radio.
Fox's gesture of contrition speaks equally to Ivanka Trump's rising status in the administration and Britain's dwindling status as it faces a post-Brexit future. But it is not clear that it will be enough to mollify the president. On Sunday, Donald Trump told reporters he would not bother to criticize Darroch beyond saying, "We are not big fans of that man."
A day later, however, Trump made clear that he took the ambassador's criticism personally, and he used it as an occasion to renew his past critique of May.
The diplomatic row comes at a deeply awkward moment for Britain, which has been paralyzed and increasingly isolated by its looming deadline to leave the European Union. After failing to win support in Parliament for a negotiated exit, May announced she would step down as leader of the Conservative Party and relinquish the prime minister's post as soon as the party elects a new leader.
Boris Johnson, a pro-Brexit former foreign secretary and mayor of London, is the odds-on favorite to replace May. That prospect clearly delights Trump, who all but endorsed him during a visit to Britain last month, and celebrated the coming change in leadership Monday.
"The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister," Trump tweeted. "While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month, it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!"

Sid Ramin, orchestrator for Broadway hits, creator of hummable jingles

Texto completo: Sid Ramin was attending elementary school in Roxbury when he met Leonard Bernstein one day at the home of a mutual friend. Bernstein was trying, with little success, to teach their friend to play a song on the piano.
“Mind if I try?" Sid Ramin asked. Bernstein watched him play the song with ease and remarked: “Well, you're the fellow I should be teaching," according Humphrey Burton's biography “Leonard Bernstein."
That boyhood encounter turned into a lifelong friendship between Bernstein and Mr. Ramin, who as an orchestrator, arranger, and composer would go on to win an Oscar and a Grammy for his work on the film of “West Side Story," for which Bernstein composed the music.
Mr. Ramin, whose work ranged from revered Broadway musicals to perfume commercials, died July 1 in his Manhattan, N.Y., home. He was 100.
He was one of two orchestrators — or three, if you count the contributions of Bernstein — on the original Broadway production of “West Side Story," which opened in 1957. According to “The Sound of Broadway Music" (2009), by Steven Suskin, Mr. Ramin worked on the haunting ballad “Somewhere," the evocative “Something's Coming," the sweetly comic “I Feel Pretty," the bravado-of-youth anthem “Here Come the Jets," and the irreverent “Gee, Officer Krupke."
Sid Ramin could easily have put the letters EGOT after his name, as one of the small group of artists who have won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards. But the Tonys did not formally honor orchestration until 1997, four years after his last Broadway show (“The Red Shoes"). His 1983 Emmy was not usually the first award he talked about; it was for his work on the daytime drama “All My Children."
If EGOC had existed instead, Mr. Ramin would have easily qualified: He won 12 Clio Awards, the advertising industry's highest honor.
“Music to Watch Girls By," a peppy, Latin-accented instrumental he wrote for a Diet Pepsi commercial in the mid-1960s, became something of a phenomenon. It was recorded by a diverse group of musicians, including Al Hirt, Chet Atkins, the Bob Crewe Generation, and (with lyrics added) Andy Williams. Both the Crewe and Williams versions were Top 40 hits.
The consumer products for which he wrote or arranged lively jingle music included a Revlon fragrance (“Kind of free/Kind of wow/Charlie!"), a laundry liquid (“You'll look better/In the clothes you trust/To Woolite"), and a toothpaste (“How's your love life?/How's your love life?/Use Ultra Brite" — sung to the tune of “The Hallelujah Chorus").
But Broadway was his major platform. Shows whose orchestrations he worked on, in addition to “West Side Story," included “Gypsy" (1959), “I Can Get It for You Wholesale" (1962), “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" (1962), Bette Midler's “Clams on the Half Shell Revue" (1975), “Jerome Robbins' Broadway" (1989), and “Crazy for You" (1992).
His overture for “Gypsy" was particularly lauded. The British actor John Gielgud once said it was the only recording he would need with him if he were stranded on a desert island. Mr. Ramin made the decision not to include song excerpts in chronological order, as most Broadway overtures do, but to begin with the opening notes (“I had a dream") from “Everything's Coming Up Roses," originally sung by Ethel Merman in the role of Gypsy Rose Lee's mother.
Mr. Ramin's work seemed omnipresent in 1960s popular culture. He wrote the music for the “Patty Duke Show" theme (“They're cousins/Identical cousins . . ." and he was also the show's conductor and music supervisor) and for another popular series, “Candid Camera."
Although he was the arranger and conductor for “Stiletto," a 1969 crime drama, and for a 1973 television movie remake of “Miracle on 34th Street," the movie business was never a major part of Mr. Ramin's career.
In a 2011 interview sponsored by the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Ramin recalled going to the West Coast to work on the film of “West Side Story" (1961) and deciding that he and his collaborator, Irwin Kostal, should do as the Romans do.
“Let's set up a bridge table at the pool and work poolside," Mr. Ramin recalled suggesting. When the two men, who had also worked together on the Broadway production, decided to take a break and a swim, all their pages flew into the pool beside them – and they had been working in ink. The moral: “We decided we should not go Hollywood."
Sidney Nathan Ramin was born in Boston on Jan. 22, 1919, the older of two sons of Ezra Ramin, a Russian-born visual merchandiser (the job was called window dresser at the time) for Jordan Marsh, and Beatrice (Salamoff) Ramin. He grew up in Roxbury and was 12 when he and Bernstein became best friends.
“We created little songs together," Mr. Ramin recalled decades later in a Film Music Foundation video interview, and they exchanged constructive criticism. Bernstein assumed the role of teacher early on.
When Bernstein enrolled at Harvard, Mr. Ramin arranged for them to continue studying together. “I'll pay you a dollar a lesson and a candy bar," he told Bernstein.
“I'm glad to see that you've decided to study with me. I think you'll get a lot out of it," Bernstein wrote to Mr. Ramin in a March 1937 letter, adding that “I can give you a comprehensive outlook on harmony. . . with an eye ever cast in the direction of jazz."
Mr. Ramin always contended that aside from his early colloquy with Bernstein, he had no training in orchestration – and that he never learned to play a musical instrument. Before joining the Army, though, he did attend the New England Conservatory of Music, as well as Boston University.
On the cover of Mr. Ramin's album “Love is a Swinging Word, Bernstein wrote: “I have known Sid Ramin since we were both 13. I was impressed with his great musicality then, and I have continued to be more and more impressed ever since. His work with me (and Irv Kostal) on 'West Side Story' was invaluable – sensitive, strong, and facile."
Mr. Ramin spent five years in the Army, much of it in France, where he created original productions for the Army band. In 1946 he moved to New York City, where he attended Columbia University with the help of the GI Bill.
By the 1950s he was the musical arranger for “The Milton Berle Show" (originally “Texaco Star Theater"), NBC's hit hour-long variety-comedy series. He was also making albums for RCA Victor as the leader of Sid Ramin and His Orchestra. Then Bernstein called about the “West Side Story" job.
Mr. Ramin married Gloria Breit in 1949. In addition to his wife, he leaves a son, Ron, and two grandsons.
“As you may know, Lenny, I'm always on cloud nine when I'm in the same room with you," Mr. Ramin wrote to Bernstein in a 1976 letter.
Bernstein died in 1990, but Mr. Ramin continued to be interviewed about their work together. “He loved to talk, and I loved to listen to him. I guess it's about as close to idolizing someone as you can get," Mr. Ramin told The New York Times in 2003. “My analyst used to say it was a little much."

Texto completo: Could aid Democrats seeking information on president's tax records
New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) signed legislation Monday that allows Congress to review President Trump's state tax returns, giving House Democrats another potential tool for accessing the president's closely guarded financial records.
Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has suggested he will not pursue Trump's state returns, saying he is focused on obtaining documents held by the Internal Revenue Service. Last week, Neal filed a lawsuit against the IRS and Treasury Department over their denial of his request for Trump's tax returns.
Some New York lawmakers have pushed the new law as a way to grant Congress greater oversight over the president. It gives certain congressional bodies the authority to request the state returns, provided those requesting the returns cite a "specified and legitimate legislative purpose."
"This bill gives Congress the ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities, strengthen our democratic system and ensure that no one is above the law," Cuomo said in a statement.
New York's legislation would not give House Democrats access to the six years of federal tax returns sought by Neal. But the state returns, if obtained, could provide an unprecedented look into Trump's New York business dealings, his income and a range of other personal financial information, according to legal experts.
"The New York state tax returns likely contain information that is similar to what is in the federal returns," said Harry Sandick, former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, noting that Trump's business losses and income probably would be similar at the federal and state levels.
Under the legislation, the state tax returns can only be released if requested by any of three committees: the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation.
In May, the New York Times published a report, based on data from 10 years of Trump's federal tax returns, showing he took more than $1 billion in losses and lost more money than almost every other taxpayer in America from 1985 to 1994.
But a spokesman for the House Ways and Means Committee said the state documents may not be relevant to the committee's investigation, which has cited the need to conduct congressional oversight over how the IRS handles presidential audits. The records would have to be requested by the committee for them to be turned over. Their disclosure by state officials could also be challenged in court.
"This request was in furtherance of an investigation into the mandatory presidential audit program at the IRS," said Dan Rubin, a spokesman for Neal. "State returns would not help us evaluate this program and decide if legislative action is needed to codify this program into federal law."

What's on TV
I LOVE YOU, NOW DIE: THE COMMONWEALTH VS. MICHELLE CARTER (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This two-part documentary examines a story so unusual it could have been plucked from a "Black Mirror" episode. In 2017, teenager Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for using text messages to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill himself. The director Erin Lee Carr, the daughter of the late New York Times columnist David Carr, asks: Were Carter's actions criminal? The first half of the film deals with the prosecution's case; the second half focuses on the defense and presents Carter as a troubled young woman who truly believed she could help Roy.
LOVE ISLAND 8 p.m. on CBS. The original version of this reality show debuted in Britain in 2015. It has since amassed a huge following, but has also garnered sharp criticism of its promotion of hookup culture and, in some cases, what has been seen as normalization of gaslighting and emotional abuse. Now, for better or worse, a new version of the series has washed up on American shores. It follows the same premise: Eleven attractive, single 20-somethings are marooned in a glamorous villa in Fiji and forced to couple up. Nearly every second is saucy, especially when producers present the "islanders" with challenges. (Some have tested their pole-dancing and kissing skills.) Viewers can vote off their least favorite contestants, and the last couple standing wins a cash prize. If this spinoff isn't to your liking, the first four seasons of the British series are available to stream on Hulu.
THE DISAPPEARANCE 10 p.m. on WGN. When Anthony (Michael Riendeau) takes surreptitious photos of residents for a school project, he causes a stir and upsets the whole neighborhood. Then he goes missing during a treasure hunt on his 10th birthday. That sets the scene for this new, six-part limited series. The boy's fate brings his separated parents (Aden Young and Camille Sullivan) closer, and, as his family investigates his whereabouts, they uncover clues that his disappearance may have ties to his grandfather's past as a no-nonsense prosecutor.
What's Streaming
AZIZ ANSARI: RIGHT NOW (2019) Stream on Netflix. Aziz Ansari practically disappeared from the public eye after a woman anonymously accused him of sexual misconduct in a controversial essay published last year. Although the article was criticized for its reporting methods, the comedian responded to the accuser in a statement at the time, saying he "took her words to heart." He also addressed the allegation head-on during a "pop-up show" in February: "It made me think about a lot, and I hope I've become a better person." It's unclear whether Ansari returns to the issue in this new stand-up special, directed by Spike Jonze. But viewers can count on the set including his takes on family, the social climate and "wokeness."

Cuomo signs a bill to allow release of Trump's state tax returns

Texto completo: As the battle over President Trump's federal taxes intensifies in Washington, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York signed a bill Monday to allow congressional committees to access the president's state tax returns.
The bill requires state tax officials to release the president's state returns for any “specified and legitimate legislative purpose" on the request of the chairperson of one of three congressional committees: the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, and the Joint Committee on Taxation.
It is effective immediately, though it is unclear whether it would be challenged by the Trump administration, or used by the congressional committees; the Ways and Means Committee, for instance, has said previously that it remains focused on pursuing Trump's federal tax information.
Still, the state tax documents from New York — the president's home state and business headquarters — would probably contain much of the same information as the contested federal returns, tax experts say.
Democrats in Washington have been unable to obtain Trump's federal returns. The House Ways and Means Committee has unsuccessfully sought six years of the president's personal and business tax returns, and last week the House of Representatives sued the Treasury Department and the IRS to try to force them to release the returns.
Cuomo, a third-term Democrat and frequent critic of Trump, said that signing the bill would help Congress “fulfill its constitutional responsibilities, strengthen our democratic system, and ensure that no one is above the law."
The Legislature had passed the measure in late May. Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, said that the six-week delay in signing the bill was because the governor's office needed to do a diligent analysis of the legislation and its amendments.
“Any responsible government would thoroughly review this bill, just as we will with more than 930 bills passed this session," Lever said, noting “how high the stakes are of this particular legislation."
The bill has been harshly criticized by Republicans in New York and elsewhere as a “bill of attainder" — an unconstitutional piece of legislation aimed at a single person or group — as well as a potential invasion of privacy. In a statement, Cuomo agreed that “tax secrecy is paramount," with, however, “the exception being for bona fide investigative and law enforcement purposes."
Legal challenges could await. Trump has previously said that he is ready to take the fight over his federal tax returns to the Supreme Court.
But there have been several amendments made to the New York bill to address potential legal concerns, according to the bill's supporters, including broadening its focus to cover an array of public officials, federal executive branch employees, and political party leaders.
Assemblyman David Buchwald, who sponsored the bill in Albany's lower chamber, called the governor's actions “a momentous step," a sentiment echoed by his Senate counterpart, Brad Hoylman, a Democrat from Manhattan.
“Our legislation isn't about one person," Hoylman said. “It's about assisting Congress in its oversight abilities."
In May, the New York Legislature also passed a bill to allow state prosecutors to pursue charges against any individual granted a presidential pardon for similar federal crimes, closing a loophole some in Albany feared would be exploited by Trump seeking to indemnify former associates. That bill is also awaiting the governor's signature.

CNN will assign debate slots in 'live draw' on July 18
WASHINGTON — CNN, the host of the next Democratic presidential primary debate, said Monday that it would conduct a televised "live draw" next week to determine which candidates in the crowded field appear on which night of the two-night event.
NBC, the host of the first debate, conducted a similar process behind closed doors in Manhattan last month to divide the 20 qualifying hopefuls into two packs, with aides standing in for the candidates.
CNN said its process would air July 18 in the 8 p.m. period of its "Anderson Cooper 360" program. Further details on how the draw will unfold will be released later, the network said.
The second Democratic debate is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit.
CNN announced Monday that three of its anchors — Dana Bash, Don Lemon, and Jake Tapper — will moderate.
The network said that the Democratic National Committee will notify the 20 candidates who qualify for the second debate on July 17.
Under DNC qualification rules, candidates must either register 1 percent support in three approved polls or have 65,000 unique donors to their campaign, with a minimum of 200 different donors per state in at least 20 states.
For the first debate, NBC divided candidates into two tiers, based on polling. Candidates from both tiers were randomly assigned to both nights, in an attempt to even out the two stages.
Still, the result was somewhat lopsided, with most of the candidates leading in the polls — including former vice president Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Kamala Harris, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,— placed onstage together for the second night.
Senator Elizabeth Warren was the only top-tier candidate onstage the first night.

Steyer enters Democratic race; Swalwell drops out
Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who toyed with the idea of a Democratic presidential campaign before announcing in January that he would not run, has changed his mind and intends to enter the 2020 contest on Tuesday, according to multiple people who have been told of his plans.
Word of a possible Steyer candidacy was a surprise to the Democratic political world, which has counted on the 62-year-old's largess to finance super PACs in recent years, and has grown used to his plotting and then discarding his own ambitions for elected office.
The news that Steyer is again entertaining entering the race himself came as a fellow northern Californian, Representative Eric Swalwell, said that he was ending his bid for the Democratic nomination for president, becoming the first candidate to do so since the field expanded to historically large proportions. Swalwell, 38, made the announcement Monday at an afternoon news conference at his campaign headquarters in Dublin, Calif., just three months after he declared his candidacy in April.

Texto completo: If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance. Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18 percent of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost - if they ever had - an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times - not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign - says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as Mr. Sanders," the Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?" Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed, "I'm with Bernie." Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell, and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans - 80 million more than voted in 2016 - something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4 percent of whites and 9 percent of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions - forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole," and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage."
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering - modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Michael Colgrass, comedic Pulitzer Prize-winning classical composer, dies at 87

Texto completo: Michael Colgrass, a Pulitzer Prize-winning classical composer who often highlighted percussion instruments in his works and sometimes stripped to his shorts and stood on his head while carrying the message of music to skeptical students and listeners, died July 2 at a hospital in Toronto. He was 87.
The cause was complications from cancer, said his wife, Ulla Colgrass.
Before becoming a full-time composer, Colgrass was a jazz drummer during his youth in Illinois, then a versatile percussionist who performed with orchestras and in the first Broadway production of Leonard Bernstein's "West Side Story.
He composed orchestral and chamber works, operas and other works for chorus and solo vocalists. Amid strong lyrical lines, he often incorporated elements inspired by nature, literature and earlier musical styles.
Colgrass once described how he created his work "Letter From Mozart, which was commissioned for an ensemble associated with traditional classical music. Realizing that his audience might be reluctant to hear a modern composition, he pondered what he should compose "because whatever I write is going to make them unhappy, he told the Toronto Star in 1987. "And I kind of fantasized a little bit and thought, Well, what would Mozart do?'
Colgrass said he had an imaginary conversation with Mozart: " Gee, Amadeus, I have this problem. I have to write for this audience who loves you, but they won't love me.' And so he says, Look, why don't you take a theme of mine and run it through a lot of modern music techniques, and here and there make it recognizable?'
The rhythms were so tricky that the composition required two conductors at its premiere in 1976. The result was "a collage of Mozartean ideas filtered through the clever mind of Colgrass in a very modern manner, New York Times music critic Harold Schonberg wrote.
"A spot of jazz is succeeded by a touch of serialism, followed by aleatory, by marches, by [tuneful] lyricism, by the percussion effects so beloved by the new generation. It's all skillful, terribly clever, and without much substance. But fun.
A year later, Colgrass debuted "Deja Vu, a single-movement concerto for four percussion players and first performed by the New York Philharmonic. The work featured timpani, vibraphone and a variety of more obscure instruments and percussive effects.
"Fragments of melody were tossed around, and every now and then they assembled themselves in a quite Romantic manner, Schonberg wrote. "... Mr. Colgrass understands the entire potential of percussion, and some of his mixtures were very beautiful.
"Deja Vu was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1978. Four years later, Colgrass won an Emmy Award for a PBS documentary about his music.
In addition to music, Colgrass studied acting, clowning and comic traditions and became interested in hypnosis. (He once hypnotized members of an audience before a performance.)
"A really good composer, he said in 1981, "puts you in a trance and talks to your subconscious mind.
While speaking to school groups or workshops, Colgrass would sometimes shed most of his clothes, stand on his head, do somersaults and balance on his forearms to demonstrate the connection of the body to rhythm and dance. Students at one urban high school were shocked to silence, he wrote in a 1972 essay, but "by the time the session was over, the wrestling team was dancing to Stravinsky's Rite of Spring.'
Michael Charles Colgrass Jr. was born April 22, 1932, in the Chicago suburb of Brookfield, Illinois. His father, an Italian immigrant who changed his name from Colagrossi, was a professional boxer and later a postmaster. His mother was a homemaker.
Colgrass dated his interest in music to 1943, when he saw the movie "Reveille With Beverly. The film featured the tune "Big Noise From Winnetka, in which drummer Ray Bauduc's thumping rhythm was joined by a driving bass line from Bob Haggart, who whistled a melody.
Midway through the number, Bauduc began to drum on one of the strings of Haggart's upright bass, creating one of the most thrilling and oft-imitated moments in jazz history.
"I was more than intrigued, I was overwhelmed, Colgrass told Toronto's Globe and Mail newspaper in 1981. "I wanted to do the same thing. I wanted to play jazz.
He worked as a golf caddie to earn money for his first set of drums, organized his first group at 11 and performed in jazz bands through high school. He did not read musical notation until he entered the University of Illinois, from which he received a bachelor's degree in percussion performance and composition in 1954. He then served in an Army orchestra in Europe.
In 1955, Colgrass wrote in a 2015 essay, he decided to visit his father's hometown of San Marco in southeastern Italy. He spent three days feasting, drinking and taking photographs. When he sent the pictures home, his father didn't recognize anyone.
"You went to the wrong San Marco, he said.
A year later, Colgrass returned to the correct San Marco, where the whole town turned out to meet the cousin visiting from distant Chicago.
Colgrass later moved to New York, where he performed with classical and jazz ensembles and was part of the pit orchestra for "West Side Story when it debuted in 1957. He had begun to compose music in college and, in 1966, wrote one of his best-known works, "As Quiet As, which was recorded by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
In 1974, he and his wife moved to Toronto, believing it would be a better place to raise their son.
Survivors include his wife of 52 years, the former Ulla Dahgaard, a music journalist, and their son, Neal Colgrass, both of Toronto; and a sister.
Colgrass occasionally taught at colleges, but since 1967 he made his living as a full-time composer. He often counseled other aspiring musicians and composers and became a trainer in "neuro-linguistics programming, a method of developing human potential. He published an autobiography in 2010.
Long concerned about attracting new audiences to classical music, Colgrass believed one solution was to invite composers to write works for young listeners.
"A lot of these new compositions, he wrote in 1969, "would make unusual demands, perhaps using film, dance, lighting effects, even experimenting with a different kind of concert hall. All this would make the symphony orchestra grow with the times and stay fresh, perhaps even be fun as it was to Haydn and Mozart.

Texto completo: Last week, as an estimated 5 million people watched two nights of debate by the Democratic Party's presidential contenders for the 2020 nomination, we should have remembered the role of West Virginia in presidential politics almost 60 years ago.
John Kennedy's televised debate with Hubert Humphrey during the state's 1960 presidential primary was only the second time television was used to broadcast a debate associated with a presidential contest. Broadcast from WCHS studio in Charleston on May 4, 1960, the event was carried on four other television stations in the state - WHIS at Bluefield, WBOY at Clarksburg, WTRF at Wheeling and WTAP at Parkersburg.
Only once before in American politics had there been a televised debate between two presidential contenders. In 1956, during the Florida presidential primary, the ABC network televised a debate between contenders for the Democratic nomination - Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver. The event marked the first use of the medium for that kind of event. But the format resembled more of a discussion rather than a standard debate. The event had no opening statements and involved only a couple of questions for the candidates.
Four years later, in Charleston on May 4, six days before this state's primary election, there would be a second one that would reflect a more traditional debate format that would be used in most of the succeeding presidential campaigns. More than a half-million viewers watched two Democratic contenders - Kennedy and Humphrey - square off in Charleston.
The debate that night represented one more sign post in the ascension of television as the dominant journalist media. But few recognized the historic importance of the broadcast. WTRF-TV reporter Charles Schussler would later recall that his station sent only one reporter, because no one else on the staff wanted the assignment and the long drive to Charleston that went with it.
Although not widely recognized at the time, television came out the champion, as the medium was able to instantly transmit the historic event to more than a half-million West Virginians. Even The Charleston Gazette acknowledged the numerical and intimacy advantage of television. An editorial on the day after the debate noted that, "Television has a responsible role to play in the political campaigns, for no other medium can attract so vast an audience or has so immediate impact.
The night of the debate, John Kennedy arrived at the studio of WCHS just minutes before the event started at 7:30 p.m. The television station was in a converted downtown mansion on Kanawha Boulevard.
A coin toss by moderator Bill Ames was won by Kennedy, who chose to go second in the opening statements by the candidates. It was the first of many wise choices the Massachusetts senator made that night. The debate, while not that substantive or heated, proved to be a success for Kennedy, in terms of style. The man who would have the first "televised presidency demonstrated his skill in that medium.
Kennedy's performance that night in Charleston set a standard in two areas for future contenders in a presidential primary debate.
Familiarity: That night, Kennedy showed West Virginia viewers that he was familiar with the problems facing the Mountain State. He used statistics, read a personal letter and even held up a can of dried eggs to underscore his point that he was familiar with and would advocate for the state of West Virginia.
Which of the 20 contenders for 2020 will most effectively use their limited time to show their familiarity with the problems facing the nation by using statistics or stories? They cannot use visual aids, since they have been banned from televised debates.
Language: Performance will be graded on not just what they say, but how they say it.
Kennedy's performance that night surprised New York Times reporter James Reston, who noted that it was usually Sen. Humphrey who made the connection, by being "more local and more vernacular, in his arguments. At the Charleston debate, however, it was Kennedy "who concentrated on the specific illustrations, and who avoided the jargon of Washington for the simple language of the average voter.
Which contenders will most effectively use the language of the average voter this time?
Information: The day after the 1960 debate, Reston recognized that history was made on several levels that night in Charleston. After noting that the consensus of reporters was that Kennedy gained ground in the debate, he concluded that the "real winner was not the man, but the technique using modern communication of television to inform voters of presidential candidates.
With the first stage of the televised 2020 primary debates over, let us hope that Reston's words ring true as the campaigns continue, and the media we watch provides the information we need.

Iowa has the secret to fix districting dysfunction

Texto completo: Iowa has never been particularly effective at tooting its own horn. We Iowans are naturally self-deprecating. I remember back in 1999 when the state held a contest to come up with a new tourism slogan. The entry that made the national newspapers: "Baja Minnesota."
Maybe that's why Iowa has never been terribly successful at touting the fact that this state holds the cure to one form of political cancer that has long plagued our country: partisan gerrymandering. It's time to change that, now that the U.S. Supreme Court has again refused to lift a finger to address an obvious source of dysfunction in our democracy.
Gerrymandering is one way politicians manage to stay in power no matter how ineffective or corrupt they may be. This abuse of political power deserves at least part of the blame for extreme polarization in Congress. Every 10 years, after the Census, the boundaries of political districts have to be redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the party in power manipulates the redistricting process to benefit its incumbents and to minimize the minority party's chances to gain seats.
That hurts everyone, because it contributes to an environment in Washington where otherwise "safe" incumbents fear only a primary challenge. That adds pressure for incumbents to cater to the far-right or far-left fringes of the party and empowers moneyed interest groups pushing extremist agendas.
In Wisconsin, Republicans used computer models and voting data after 2010 to redraw district lines for its General Assembly. They were so spectacularly successful that Democrats have failed to win more than 39 of 99 seats in the past three elections, "even when they won a majority of the votes cast statewide for Assembly candidates," according to the New York Times.
Clean-government advocates were hoping the Supreme Court would use this case to offer some guidance for how far race-based or partisan gerrymandering can go to disadvantage minority voters. Instead, the court punted the case back to district court on technical grounds, suggesting this is a problem for states to manage.
The good news is that Iowa has managed this problem and has done so extremely well since 1980. That's when the Iowa Legislature adopted the nonpartisan redistricting process that has been used ever since. The law puts nonpartisan legislative staff in charge of drawing district maps for legislative and congressional districts. The maps, by law, cannot consider partisan factors or the effect on officeholders. The primary consideration is creating districts that are as close to equal in population as possible, while respecting political subdivisions and maintaining a reasonably compact area.
The Legislature must vote the first map up or down within a limited period of time, with only corrective amendments allowed. If the first map is defeated or vetoed by the governor, a second map is prepared that takes into account reasons cited by the Legislature or governor for refusing the first map. The second map also must be voted up or down, with only corrective amendments allowed. If the second map fails, the third proposed map could be amended like any other bill. If no plan is enacted or the plan is successfully challenged in court, the job of redistricting falls to the Iowa Supreme Court.
That has never happened, however. Lawmakers feel significant pressure to avoid this outcome. I watched the process work through the Legislature in 2001 and 2011. In 2001, lawmakers rejected the first map because it would have retired 60 out of 150 lawmakers by pitting them against fellow incumbents. The second map was approved in a special session, even though it tossed two incumbent GOP congressmen – Jim Leach and Jim Nussle – into the same district. Leach moved from Davenport to Iowa City to avoid a primary.
In 2011, lawmakers accepted the first map even though it again paired two sets of congressmen – Republicans Tom Latham and Steve King were thrown together, as were Democrats Bruce Braley and David Loebsack. Loebsack moved into the redrawn 2nd District to avoid a primary. Latham moved into the 3rd District, challenged incumbent Democrat Leonard Boswell, and won.
Nonpartisan redistricting tends to function as Iowa's form of term limits. It helps create open seats, providing opportunity for fresh blood, while gerrymandering does the opposite. It has not prevented single-party dominance in recent years, but it does maintain the minority party's ability to compete and potentially regain control. That's healthy for the process, no matter which party you prefer. It keeps both sides accountable to voters. We need more of that in Congress, not less.
As Iowans, we can't afford to keep this secret to ourselves. We also can't afford to be complacent. Nonpartisan redistricting tends to benefit the minority party, at least in the short term. There's always the temptation for a strong majority party – such as today's GOP-run Legislature and Republican governor – to try to tweak the process to its advantage. Iowans need to impress on lawmakers and candidates that such action would be a roadmap to their retirement from politics.

CSU moves into new phase with Tony Frank, who says higher ed must change to stay relevant

Texto completo: Higher education in Colorado and across the country is evolving. So, universities and colleges had better prepare for change if they want to meet the needs of tomorrow's students, said Tony Frank, chancellor of the Colorado State University System. In the coming years, technological advances and changing student expectations are likely to push higher education toward facilitating learning outside of traditional campuses, classrooms and tests that hinge on what a student knows on a given day. "If all we do going into the future is hand out a static fact set — and with the pace of knowledge now, many of those facts are stale by the time the student walks out the door — then shame on us, we haven't evolved," Frank said. "And evolution has a rather dim view of organisms that don't adapt." After serving nearly 11 years as president of CSU, Frank became chancellor of the CSU System on a full-time basis July 1.
Since 2014, Frank served as president and chancellor. The time had come for a change, Frank said, including new leadership and fresh perspectives at CSU.
How 1 job became 2 "Over those five years, both jobs have grown," he said. "It became very apparent to me about a year ago that the opportunity cost and the risk of trying to do two jobs with one person was now tilted in favor of saying we're better off splitting the roles."
The system is composed of CSU in Fort Collins, CSU-Pueblo and CSU Global Campus, a 100% online university. Combined, the CSU campuses serve about 60,000 students.
Joyce McConnell is the new president of CSU.
Salaries for Frank and McConnell will cost the system about $1 million a year.
Frank and the CSU System Board of Governors had originally planned to split the roles in 2020, in part because of symmetry: The "State Your Purpose" fundraising campaign would end; Frank's contract was scheduled to end; he would turn 60 years old; and CSU would celebrate its 150th birthday.
A milestone anniversary for the university would carry great symbolism and present an opportunity for a new president, he said.
"That's a powerful moment, it's an emotional moment," he said. "We've already hit our goal for the campaign. That could actually work as a pivot and turn the institution to look forward and start to talk about what the 150 years look like and to start to build momentum in a new direction."
Frank's new contract runs to 2024. As chancellor, he will play a role in setting the system's direction. He expects CSU, as a research university, to thrive over the next 10 to 20 years in terms of increased enrollment, research and statewide outreach, as it did during his tenure.
The university climate is changing While some universities in the Northeast and upper Midwest are seeing decreasing enrollment because of contraction in the number of high school graduates, schools in growth areas such as CSU are likely to keep attracting out-of-state and Colorado students.
The university is in good shape financially and can continue following a growth model for a while, he said. But changes are in the air for higher education in general and for the CSU System specifically.
More 17- and 18-year-olds are choosing to enter the workforce after high school and pursue higher education at the same time. They are not interested in a college with a residential campus, he said.
That trend could impact CSU-Global and its student population, which started out as people with bachelor's degrees seeking master's degrees or certifications to get ahead with their careers, he said.
Programs are designed for working adults. CSU-Global doesn't follow a semester model; terms start monthly, and accelerated courses are offered.
Frank said it will be "fascinating to see how many 18-year-olds are in that bucket" in a decade.
Ever-changing technologies will affect the nature of education and how it is delivered. Experts say the long-held model workers followed is shifting from "learn, work, retire" to "learn, work, learn, work, learn work," according to a recent piece by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.
For universities, that means changing how customers are served and pursuing revised business models, Frank said. Institutions won't be just "selling" bachelor's degrees, he said. They might be "upgrading the apps" of alumni to teach them fresh skills.
"Then instead of having 35,000 students on this campus, you've got a quarter-million alumni that you're working with," he said.
What Frank will do as full-time chancellor As chancellor, Frank said he will be spending time working with state and federal elected officials and agencies to ensure regulatory requirements are met. He'll also help CSU, CSU-Pueblo and CSU-Global better coordinate their services and programming.
The campuses, diverse as they are, can learn a lot from one another, he said.
Frank and the CSU System expect to spend a lot of time working on the National Western Center, a major urban redevelopment project in Denver intended to create a state-of-the-art campus for education, business, research and entertainment.
The project is a collaboration involving CSU, the city and county of Denver, the National Western Stock Show, History Colorado, and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
CSU is contributing $250 million to the project, which ultimately could cost $3 billion to $5 billion, Frank said.
What higher education will look like As much as higher education will probably change in the coming decades, some of its elements are likely to stay in place, Frank said.
Some universities will continue to provide residential campuses if that's what customers want. They will continue to provide meaningful education, although how that education is delivered might be different.
And higher education will continue to be a realm where ideas are exchanged. The goal will be the same as when President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act in 1862 that established public land-grant universities, Frank said.
"The success of the places will be about taking what a young man or a young woman is given, in terms of their talents, and allowing them to put their brain with their motivation and really improve their life. And in doing so, improve the lives of all of us through a community of educated citizens and professionals.
"I don't think that fundamental will ever go out of fashion."

Texto completo: These are the facts, more or less: On Dec. 5, 1975, Ronald Egleton, of Luton, England, killed his wife, Barbara Egleton, bludgeoning her with a hammer and leaving her in the bathtub to drown. Convicted of her murder, he served 18 months in various prisons, then returned home, prompting his older son, David Egleton, to run away, first to his grandmother's, then to London and then to America. David Egleton gave himself a new name, David Cale, and a new life as a playwright and performance artist.
In "We're Only Alive for a Short Amount of Time," a solo music-theater piece that runs at the Public Theater through July 14, Mr. Cale is finally telling this story, though arguably it's the story he has been telling his whole career, from his first major piece, "The Redthroats," in 1986, through 2017's "Harry Clarke," in which a misunderstood boy flees an abusive childhood and remakes himself in Manhattan.
Through decades of musicals and plays, he disguised these events, rewrote the characters, tore up his autobiography and scattered its details -- confetti-like and not always consciously.
"I was very, very private about it for many years," Mr. Cale, 60, said on a recent afternoon, slouched in the first row of the Public's Anspacher Theater. "I didn't tell anybody." When he arrived in New York, in 1979, with $ 400 and vague dreams of making it as a musician, no one knew him as the son of a murderer, the son of a victim. He intended to keep it that way. "I didn't want to be defined by this," he said.
In "The Redthroats," a surrealistic vision of the murder that The New York Times called "a fanciful flight into a world above the clouds of reality" (whoops), Steven, the character modeled on Mr. Cale, says that he wants to take his life in his hands and shake it until all the bad parts fall away.
"No past," he says. "I'll shake off the past. Let the past get past." Which is what Mr. Cale did.
But a few years ago, he began to wonder how it would feel to put his mother (he calls her by her maiden name, Barbara Arnold) onstage. "I didn't need to tell my story," he came to realize. "I needed to tell her story."
In his dressing room at the Public, he keeps the card, unsigned and printed with a picture of Liza Minnelli, that his mother bought in advance of his 17th birthday. That and a few photos are all he has left.
Since the mid-1980s, Mr. Cale has racked up a couple of Obie awards, a stint as a "Law & Order" judge, an HBO special, a "This American Life" episode and some songs for Deborah Harry. A lot of critics consider "Harry Clarke" his breakout, but as Robert Falls, who directs "We're Only Alive," noted, critics say that about all of his shows. (Jesse Green, in The New York Times, called the new one "a transformation and culmination of Mr. Cale's many dark, downtown works," while Sara Holdren, in New York magazine, dubbed it a "delicate, funny, heart-twistingly generous combination of eulogy, séance, and exorcism.")
In person, Mr. Cale presents as friendly, gangly, at 60 still a naïf. He is, as Mr. Falls said, "so open, so vulnerable." His hair -- a monk's tonsure -- circles his head and his beaky nose and bright eyes seem lifted from one of the birds he writes about, a finch maybe. He grins more than most performance artists.
He began working on "We're Only Alive" in 2015, at the Space on Ryder Farm, an artists' residency in upstate New York. His process was slow, occasionally tearful, though Emily Simoness, Ryder Farm's executive director, remembered him as a "relentlessly buoyant" presence, "just sort of ferociously alive."
When the summer ended, he told her that he needed more time and she arranged for him to stay on the farm. He finished the first draft that December.
The following spring he met the composer Matthew Dean Marsh. Together they originated an evening called "More Songs for Charming Strangers" which they performed at the East Village restaurant Pangea, then began to work on music for "We're Only Alive," creating a lush, romantic score to counterbalance the anguish, making of grief a gift.
Mr. Cale told me how, in 1978, he had seen Bette Midler at the London Palladium and how her show had made him feel connected to life again in a way he hadn't thought was possible. That is what he wants "We're Only Alive" to do, to show an audience that he survived. That anyone can survive. (Though the show doesn't discuss it, the catastrophe of his parents' marriage has never barred him from writing feelingly about love and sex. He and his longtime boyfriend are broken up at the moment, but he's pretty sure they'll get back together.)
"Watching him, it's still really inspiring," his collaborator, Mr. Marsh, said, speaking by telephone. "In a way it's a feel-good show." He paused. "In a way, it's just not," he said.
In 2017, Mr. Cale performed a work-in-progress version at the New Stages festival at Chicago's Goodman Theater. He imagined audience members saying, "Why did you put us through that? We don't go to the theater to be tortured." But no one complained. Instead Mr. Falls, the Goodman Theater's artistic director, came to him, in tears, and asked to direct it, aiming it for the Goodman's main stage, where it opened last September, after a quick run at the Public's Under the Radar Festival.
In telling the truth of his parents' marriage and his own mangled adolescence, Mr. Cale has left some things out, like the way the tabloids savaged his mother after her death, like his father's subsequent criminality. And he has allowed himself a few inventions.
The extraordinary stuff? It all happened. The murder, the trial, the hundreds of birds kept in aviaries in the backyard. But other sections are imagined, like the love interest he supplies for his mother and a thrilling ride on the back of that man's motorbike. He figured his mother deserved some joy. Some good songs, too.
Mr. Cale sings all those songs and he plays all the parts. If you're new to his world, that might seem unlikely. That afternoon at the Public, Mr. Cale wore a version of his costume, a collared shirt in some inconsequential shade and skinny jeans that he was possibly too skinny for. He didn't look like anyone's mother. But onstage, when he becomes Barbara -- or his father, his grandfather, his younger brother -- his face and body recede. Another person seems to stand there.
Mr. Falls compared this onstage experience to an "odd séance." Mr. Cale didn't exactly disagree. If he thinks that channeling is too pretentious a word for what he does, he doesn't have a better one.
He knows that "We're Only Alive for a Short Amount of Time" can't bring his mother back, can't right the wrongs done to her, can't wrest the hammer from his father's hand. He knows it eight shows a week. But on a good night, he senses his mother in the room, or even closer. "It does just feel like she's inside me," he said. "It's quite, quite a wild feeling."

Texto completo: BY BERNARD CONDON
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - A group of immigrant workers fired from President Donald Trump's golf clubs say they want to meet with him at the White House to make the case that they should not be deported.
The 21 maids, grounds-
Keepers and other workers fired earlier this year from five of Trump's clubs asked their former employer in a letter this week to remember all their hard work and give them a chance to make their case in person why
They should stay in the country.
"I'm hopeful that he'll look at the letter. I believe he has a heart," said Gabriel Sedano, who worked for 14 years as a handyman at Trump's club in Westchester County, New York, before he was fired in January.
The response on White House stationery Wednesday, in what appeared to be a form letter, assured the workers that "we are reviewing your message." The White House didn't respond Friday to a request for further comment.
The troubles for Trump workers started in December when a maid who had made the president's bed at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, told The New York Times that a supervisor there knew she and other housekeepers and workers were in the country illegally, and used their status against them if they complained about working conditions.
Then other workers at other Trump clubs without proper documents - some employed by him for a decade or more - began speaking out, and the Trump Organization began rounds of firings.
The Trump Organization has said it does not tolerate workers who lie about their status and only recently discovered its workers were in the country illegally. It did not respond to requests for comment about the proposed White House meeting.
Democrats in Congress requested earlier this year that the FBI look into whether the Trump Organization acted as a "criminal enterprise" by knowingly hiring workers with false documents and even helping them procure such papers, as some fired workers have claimed.
A lawyer for 39 former Trump workers, Anibal Romero, said he has been interviewed by the FBI as well as the offices of attorneys general in New Jersey and New York, though he declined to talk about what was discussed.
The letter from the workers said the president knows many of them and asked him to "do the right thing" and "not deport us and our friends and family."
"You know we are hard workers and that we are not criminals or seeking a free ride in America," the letter said. "We all pay our taxes, love our faith and our family, and simply want to find a place for ourselves to make America even better."
Former club handyman Sedano said he couldn't believe it when he was fired in January because he was a trusted employee who was asked to do work on Eric Trump's house nearby, and given access to come and go as he pleased.
"I had keys to the house, all the codes. I knew him personally," said Sedano, who has three children in the U.S., the youngest 8. He added: "I was the first one fired. There was a list. I was the first one."

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — A Gobernador rancher who has emerged as one of the leading local proponents of requiring the capture of methane emissions in the Four Corners region is featured in a new documentary film about climate change airing on HBO.
Don Schreiber, owner of the Devil's Spring Ranch in western Rio Arriba County, said the director and crew members for the film "Ice on Fire" — which made its debut on HBO June 11 — visited his family three times in late 2017 and early 2018 to conduct interviews and shoot footage.
According to hbo.com, the 98-minute film is narrated by Leonard DiCaprio, and produced by him and his father, George DiCaprio, among others. It features locations around the world and focuses on solutions to what it calls the escalating environmental crisis.
Schreiber's ranch was chosen because he has advocated for stricter regulations regarding venting and flaring from natural gas wells. The Four Corners region is home to a sizable "methane cloud" that researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology have attributed largely to gas wells, storage tanks, pipelines and processing plants. Industry advocates have responded by linking the emissions to natural sources such as coal formations and have fought increased regulation, which they say will have a negative economic impact.
Schreiber, who served on the transition team for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, said the segment of the film in which he appears deals with the issue of methane emissions in the Four Corners, a topic that he said remains relevant since he was interviewed a year and a half ago by director Leila Conners.
"These things have not lost any currency here and are more timely than ever," he said.
Schreiber said he a cameraman and Conners followed him on a tour of his ranch, where a FLIR thermographic camera was used to capture footage of methane leaking from well sites. Schreiber said Conners peppered him with questions as they walked.
"In this film, there's nothing scripted," Schreiber said, describing the experience of being interviewed by the director. "You have no idea what questions they're going to ask you. They're looking for honest, uncut reactions."
Schreiber has spoken to media outlets ranging from NPR to PBS over the years about the methane cloud, so he is relatively used to being interviewed. He said he always takes care to choose his words carefully, aspiring to be a voice for others in the region who are not on the radar of major media organizations.
"I'm always concerned that I represent in my answers the truth," he said. "I'm always aware that I'm talking for so many people who don't get the call from The New York Times or HBO. ... I feel a great burden every time they turn the camera on me to say something meaningful."
Schreiber was invited to the documentary's Los Angeles premiere at the Bing Theater on June 5 and got to view it then. He said the segment on the Four Corners lasts for approximately seven minutes and features Dr. Gabrielle Petron, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association who has studied the methane cloud for many years.
"It all went by in a flash," Schreiber said. "But I felt we were well represented."
When asked to evaluate his own appearance in the film, Schreiber burst out laughing.
"Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?" he asked rhetorically before turning serious. "Yes, I think that with their editing and their choices, they got a great representation of what it's like to live on the ground with this."
Schreiber attended the premiere with one of his daughters and his sister. He said it was an extremely rewarding experience, one made more memorable by the chance to visit with Conners again and the opportunity to meet Leonardo DiCaprio.
Schreiber admitted to being a little starstruck at the premiere — not just by the Hollywood types that were among the crowd of 700 people, he said, but by some of the nation's more prominent scientific minds. He laughed when he recalled how he realized to his dismay that his phone had run out of photo storage memory and died when he arrived at the event. Schreiber found himself running around with a canapé in one hand and a phone charger in the other, looking for an electrical outlet.
His viewing of the film at the premiere may turn out to be the only opportunity Schreiber has to see the documentary.
"We don't have a TV at the ranch," he said. "We're at the opposite end of the pole from Hollywood."
Nevertheless, he seemed pleased with his decision to participate in the documentary and hopes it sheds some light on the issue of the Four Corners methane cloud.
"I would say the science and the scientists are the stars of this movie, and I'm glad our Four Corners methane problems are getting international attention," he said. "But we really have to be grateful to the DiCaprios for putting science and the scientists at the forefront of the film."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, deleted a tweet after mistaking a character from the movie "A Few Good Men" for an actual military veteran.
Ken Klippenstein, a reporter for the progressive media outlet The Young Turks, had tweeted at King earlier on Thursday, asking for a retweet for his "uncle Col. Nathan Jessup," who Klippenstein said was "in the Marines. " Jessup was Jack Nicholson's character in the 1992 movie "A Few Good Men. "
King then retweeted Klippenstein, writing "Colonel Jessup and all your Marines: God Bless you all!"
Klippenstein changed his username to "Steve King is a white supremacist," a reference to previous remarks by the Iowa congressman.
More: Steve King: All cultures do not contribute equally, to claim otherwise is to devalue the 'Founding Fathers'
More: Everything that's happened with Rep. Steve King since his New York Times comments
More: Iowa Rep. Steve King has a history of controversial remarks. Here are some that riled people up
The tweet has since been deleted, but Klippenstein tweeted a screenshot, and a copy of the original tweet was saved in the Internet Archive.
Twitter users mocked King for the mixup.
Charlotte Clymer, press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, asked King for a retweet of her "cousin" – in this case a picture of an ant.
Another user asked King for a retweet of Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, a character from the 1986 science fiction movie "Aliens. "
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. , said he preferred praising Lt. Daniel Kaffee, Tom Cruise's character from "A Few Good Men. "
King has been a subject of controversy over accusations of racism. He was removed from his committee spots after making remarks bemoaning how the term "white supremacist" became offensive. King plans to run for re-election in 2020.

Is the political cartoonist an endangered species?; OP-ED

Texto completo: Here's how I define unnerving times: When professionals who write, draw or talk about current events for a living worry that if they dare create anything satiric, mocking or funny, they'll be laid off, shut down, let go or put through the wringer.
America's - and the world's - increasing inability to tolerate irony, dissonance and humor is enough to make you bite your tongue or, worse, put your pencil down, as if democracy's test has just been declared at an end. I'm particularly worried about the future of political cartoonists.
The best political cartoonists, like gunslingers, have always been able to hit their mark every time they draw. They've been doing this for hundreds of years. But as of this spring, they're not doing it for the pages of the international edition of The New York Times anymore.
Even one frame of a single political cartoon is considered too dangerous for traditional sources to risk running them. Newspapers apparently fear being hit in the crossfire when The Outraged fire back.
In the Middle East (I'm thinking particularly of Saudi Arabia, where you can go to jail for making fun of the royal family), and now in North America (I'm thinking particularly of the brouhaha over Michael de Adder's cartoon depicting a golfing Trump "playing through" the bodies of the father and daughter lying dead in the water at the U.S. border), The Outraged are what Mr. Trump calls "cocked and loaded."
Most often they fire back through the internet, either acting like robots or using actual robots to send what are often exactly the same messages to editors, editorial board members or advertising departments, promising to bring upon their heads the full force of destruction, either metaphorically or literally.
"The internet is the world's biggest bully - and a stupid one, like Bluto." Invoking Popeye's huge and dumb antagonist, my friend Gene Weingarten, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner who writes for The Washington Post, said that the internet "derives this power both because of its sheer size, and because of the cowardly license conferred by anonymity. The best cartoonists are still good, and the great cartoonists are the most fearless ones - a stance that is harder and harder to take because of a sad third variable. The news industry is financially distressed, meaning threats by the Blutos carry extra menace."
Longtime and influential political cartoonist Bob Englehart - who was once a regular at my hometown paper and whose work is now available at Patreon - is quick to add that "The internet is not the only thing killing newspapers. Newspapers are doing it from the inside. To be sure, there are plenty of courageous editors and publishers still on the watchtower of the First Amendment, but they're dwindling fast."
Ed Wexler, a political cartoonist whose work I've written about in earlier columns not only because he is renowned but because we've been friends since high school, told me that he, too, "sometimes has concerns" when his Trump cartoons are extreme. "I've received some hate mail - but there's still a lot of fun in having a platform in the national discussion."
I feel the same way Ed Wexler does, and I don't think that's only because we attended Oceanside High School in the mid-1970s. As a woman who writes humor, I also get hate mail but nevertheless get a kick out of being in the conversation.
Yet I don't want those kicks to become literal. And I want to be able, with a clear conscience, when talking to the most disengaged and cynical young people, to argue that creativity, originality, insight and a quick wit are essential to our nation's civic health.
Mary Lou Solomon, who taught art for more than 20 years, put it this way: "Artists, regardless of the medium they choose, are the rebels of their times, and they instantly and viscerally 'show people what they didn't know they needed to know.'"
Finally, Mark Twain's "Mysterious Stranger" argued that "Power, money, persuasion, supplication, persecution" can be weakened a little over centuries "but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast" because "Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand."
Humor is created and appreciated when people are free.

Texto completo: Headnote The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will feature a special screening of the classic film "Cooley High," at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater. The screening will be hosted by Robert Townsend with special guests Michael Schultz and Lawerence Hilton.
Directed by Michael Schultz from a screenplay by Eric Monte, "Cooley High" (1975) starred Glynn Turman (Preach), Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs (Cochise), Garrett Morris (Mr.Mason), Cynthia Davis (Brenda), Corin Rogers (Pooter), Maurice Leon Havis (Willie), Joseph Carter Wilson (Tyrone), Sherman Smith (Stone), Garrett Morris (Mr. Mason), and Norman Gibson (Robert).
Set in 1964, the now classic "Cooley High" tells the story of a group of Chicago high school friends Richard "Cochise" Morris (Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs), a local basketball hero, and Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Glynn Turman), who dreams of a career in writing. In their happiest days, they hang out with their friends, party, chase girls and dance to the immortal sounds of Motown. Each wanting more than what's expected and dreaming big in their own way with a goal of getting out of the projects.
Then life suddenly changes for two of the guys when they meet a pair of career criminals and get falsely arrested in connection with stealing a Cadillac. We follow their lives through the end of high school and the dramatic end to their school year.
In an article entitled 'Cooley High' - More Than Just A Black 'Graffiti' that appeared in the New York Times (August 10, 1975) journalist Jack Slater wrote, "So 'Cooley High' altogether ignores the social and political significance of 1964 to explore instead the softer, warmer areas where young people really live. Concentrating on the exuberance, the aspirations, awkwardness, silliness, despair - and the culture - of urban Black youths about to graduate..."
"Cooley High" was often compared by themedia to the film "American Graffiti" but Slater didn't agree offering this in the same article: "Because it takes a backward glance, the movie is now being called 'a Black 'American Graffiti,' ' but it has, in my view, far more vitality and more variety than 'Graffiti,' which profiled bored, despairing youth in small-town America of the early sixties. No one in 'Cooley High' is bored."
This was 1975 in the heat of the explosion of Blaxploitation films, a term coined in the early 1970s to refer to African American action films that were directed atAfricanAmerican audiences. Featuring African American actors in lead roles but rarely written, directed or produced by people of color. Many had strong anti-establishment plots and characters who were frequently condemned for stereotypical characterization and glorification of violence. But, to highlight the point, most of these films were not created by an African-American voice.
But "Cooley High" markedly different. It was directed by Michael Schultz, an African American and written by anAfricanAmerican screenwriter, EricMonte.
On July 8 at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater, theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will be hosting a special screening of the classic film "Cooley High" hosted by Robert Townsend with special guests including Michael Schultz, Larry Karaszewski, Jackie Taylor and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs.
Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs started his career in New York City with the Negro Ensemble Company. Along with the classic "Cooley High," his credits include Claudine (1974) and his breakthrough role as 'Boom BoomWashington' on "Welcome Back, Kotter" (1975), to name a few.
Here is an edited conversation with Lawrence Hilton- Jacobs who played Richard "Cochise"Morris in the classic film "Cooley High."
Los Angeles Sentinel: I'mabsolutely jazzed that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is hosting a special screening for "Cooley High" with Robert Townsend as the moderator. Thoughts?
Lawrence Hilton- Jacobs: Robert [Townsend] and I are very good friends. He's more like family, really so having him as the moderator for the July 8th screening at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater (8949 Wilshire Blvd.) is going to be fun. I understand there will be a brand new print of the film ["Cooley High"] and that's exciting. I've not seen the film on the big screen in a very long time.
LAS: 1975 and correct me, if I am wrong, but the reviews for "Cooley High" were very good, across the board.
LHJ: You're right. They [reviews] were fantastic. Everyone seemed to love it. It's really something to be a part of something that is so well received. Many adults to this day tell me how the movie impacted them. You know Sinbad [the comedian] is a "Cooley High" junkie. Denzel [Washington] and Wesley [Snipes] they all told me how much the movie meant to them, as well
LAS: Take us back to 1975, please.
LHJ: I was just 22-years-old when I went to Los Angeles. I was shooting the "Welcome Back, Kotter" series and the film had not come out, yet. When I went home, to New York, I had no idea of the response. I went to Times Square - old Times Square the way it used to look - and seeing the posters and everything all blown up so large, man, it was really something.
LAS: Old Times Square, 1975 and "Cooley High," I can see it. I can see it. What's next for you?
LHJ: Next, I am in the new television series A House Divided which will stream on the Urban Movie Channel. The story is set in a new multi-generational family and I'm the father. It premieres later this summer.

Kamala Harris is surging. Here's what that means for her campaign

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , had a campaign-defining moment last week during the first Democratic primary debate that has led to a jump in polls. Harris' sudden surge has arguably secured her status as a top contender in a Democratic 2020 field of two dozen candidates.
During last week's debate, Harris had a powerful exchange with former Vice President Joe Biden, where she called out Biden for opposing federally mandated busing to integrate schools while he was in Congress.
Since then, several polls have shown Harris surging ahead of other leading Democrats in the party's crowded primary field.
Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters, Harris is at 20% nationally — just two percentage points behind from Biden, who is at 22%, according to a Quinnipiac Poll released Tuesday.
In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday, 41% of Democratic-leaning voters said Harris stood out in the debate. In that same poll, however, Harris trailed behind Biden, who was 29%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who was at 23%, as the preferred candidates among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Harris stood at 11% alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , who was also at 11%.
CNN poll: Joe Biden slides, while Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren surge after debates
Iowa poll: Kamala Harris surges as Bernie Sanders suffers after debate
In most polling, Biden has repeatedly been the front-runner in the sprawling Democratic field. However following his performance at last week's debate, the former vice president's support has seen a significant drop. In last month's Quinnipiac poll, Biden was at 30%, meaning Tuesday's poll represents an 8-percentage point drop for him. Biden also dropped 10 percentage points to 22% in a CNN poll published Monday.
In Tuesday's Quinnipiac poll, Warren came in third at 14%. Sanders was the only other candidate in the double digits at 13%.
This was one of three recent polls showing a surge by Harris. The California senator has jumped into second place in Iowa with 16%, according to a Suffolk University/USA TODAY Poll released Tuesday. Harris also surged to second place nationally in Monday's CNN poll
However, that changed just two days after she took to the debate stage when the president sought to downplay Harris' performance.
"I thought that she was given too much credit," Trump told reporters in a news conference in Japan following the G-20 summit. "I think she was given too much credit for what she did.
"It wasn't that outstanding," he concluded.
The president added that Biden "didn't do well" and "maybe the facts weren't necessarily on his side. "
The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , also commented on Harris. Trump Jr. has repeatedly criticized several Democratic presidential contenders, including Biden.
Trump Jr. caused backlash from a number of other 2020 Democrats who came to Harris' defense when he retweeted a post by Ali Alexander – a conservative commentator whose Twitter profile claims to have "exposed Kamala Harris. "
Alexander's tweet said "Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican. I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting. "
"Is this true? Wow," Trump Jr. wrote in a retweet, before deleting the post that same night, according to The New York Times. Harris is American and was born in Oakland, Calif.
Harris campaign communication's director Lily Adams called Trump Jr. 's attack "racist. "
“This is the same type of racist attack his father used to attack Barack Obama,” she said in an interview on CNN. “It didn’t work then and it won’t work now. ”

Will Harris have a fundraising surge?
The second quarter fundraising period ended June 30, three days after Harris' challenge to Biden on the debate stage.
Although Harris has yet to announce her second-quarter fundraising totals, pundits and voters will be closely watching how many contributors she tallied and how much money she took in.
South Bend, Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced he raised more than $24. 8 million in the second quarter, outraising Sanders who raised $18 million and Biden who raised $21. 5 million.
During the first quarter, Harris raised $12 million. And in the first 24 hours after the start of last week's debate, she raised $2 million online, according to the New York Times.

Given her recent polling surge, her second-quarter fundraising will be scrutinized to see how she measures up to the other top-tier 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
Harris' history as a prosecutor
Throughout her campaign, Harris has invoked her record as attorney general for the state of California and embraced her past as a prosecutor.
While campaigning in South Carolina last month, Harris said that she is best positioned to "prosecute the case" against Trump due to her history.
“I know how to get that job done,” Harris said. “We need somebody on our stage when it comes time for the general election who knows how to recognize a rap sheet when they see it and prosecute the case. ”
However, many progressives have criticized Harris for her record as California attorney general, arguing she was part of an era of "tough on crime" Democrats. And those criticisms will likely become more salient as Harris continues to gain national attention.
Lara Bazelon, a law professor and the former director of the Loyola Law School Project for the Innocent in Los Angeles, wrote in a New York Times op-ed in January that Harris was not a "progressive prosecutor. "
"Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state’s attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent," Bazelon wrote. "Most troubling, Ms. Harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors. "
Scrutiny of her record will continue to rise as Harris continues to appeal to voters. Over the past couple years, criminal justice reform has been a growing issue for voters, according to several polls and surveys.
Rising support from black voters
In addition to her surge with the national electorate in recent polls, Harris is also gaining traction with black voters.
In Tuesday's Quinnipiac poll, 27% of black Democratic voters backed Harris. Last month, Harris was at 9% among non-white Democratic voters, according to the Quinnipiac poll. However, Biden still currently leads with black voters. He is at 31% with black Democratic voters, according to the Quinnipiac poll.
Biden also has won the support of several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, despite the fact that two African American senators and members of the caucus -- Harris and Cory Booker of New Jersey — are also seeking the Democratic nomination.
Black voters are a crucial bloc for Democrats. Many of the Democratic wins in the 2018 midterms were driven by black voters, particularly black women, according to many political observers and an analysis from the NAACP.
Over the past couple of weeks, Harris has also tried to specifically appeal to black voters. Early last month, Essence Magazine announced Harris would have a monthly column with the only black woman in the Senate. On Saturday, Harris will be at the 2019 Essence Festival in New Orleans.
Since her debate performance, Harris has also raked in a new endorsement from Congress.
Rep. Jahana Hayes — the first Black woman elected to Congress in Connecticut — endorsed Harris on Wednesday, citing her debate performance.
"During last week’s debate, we watched all the Democratic candidates for President discuss their hopes and plans for our country," she wrote in an op-ed published in Essence. "We watched as one candidate in particular had the courage to ask the tough questions and demonstrate the strength to handle difficult situations. We watched Kamala Harris remind us of how policy directly affects people. "
Hayes wrote that Harris is "the perfect antidote to our current President’s false narratives. "
"Kamala knows what it takes to move us forward as a country, and I am proud to endorse her for President of the United States," Hayes concluded.

Report: Kawhi Leonard has asked suitors for ‘total silence’ during free agency

Texto completo: In a league loaded with leaks, it’s telling that this summer’s most anticipated free agent has let few details seep out about his forthcoming decision.
Kawhi Leonard still has to decide where he’s playing next season, but the 28-year-old has already achieved something unlikely: There’s little public insight into his process of choosing between the Toronto Raptors, the Lakers and the Clippers. That quiet even might be part of the pitch.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that Leonard’s camp had asked for “total silence” during free agency, which has influenced how teams are handling his recruitment. While the three teams have made moves, little is known yet about the nature of their presentations to Leonard, who is reportedly taking meetings in Los Angeles.
The Lakers’ vision for Leonard is making him part of a new superteam: Along with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the franchise would boast three of the NBA’s most heralded players, and potentially add to their 16 championships as a team. The Athletic has reported that James is expected to communicate to Leonard that he’d be more willing to adjust his role around that of Leonard, ceding a degree of his stardom as he prepares to turn 35 later this year.
Leonard, a Riverside native, has maintained a private profile relative to his NBA stardom off the court. His uncle Dennis Robertson has a strong influence over his work affairs.
According to ESPN, Leonard also reportedly spoke with Magic Johnson, the Hall of Famer and former president of the team. The NBA has asked that Johnson not be a part of the Lakers’ official presentation since he quit his role in April.
SUMMER LEAGUE TEAM EVENS RECORD
The second outing of the California Classic went markedly better than the first for the Lakers’ Summer League squad: The Lakers topped the Golden State Warriors 100-90 on Tuesday night in Sacramento.
Zach Norvell, a two-way contract player out of Gonzaga, led the Lakers with 20 points, including three 3-pointers. Devontae Cacok, a forward from UNC-Wilmington, had a 16-point, 12-rebound double-double, while guard Joe Young had a team-best seven assists. The Warriors had 20 turnovers in the loss.
The Lakers will play their California Classic finale against the host Sacramento Kings on Wednesday at 8 p.m.

Trump's North Korea spectacle shows he’d do anything, even undercut America, for attention

Texto completo: President Donald Trump loves big foreign policy events that draw the nation’s attention to — well, President Donald Trump.
He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen, ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her government, which is in a state of transition, if not outright paralysis. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But nothing is like his approach to North Korea, where he’ll apparently do anything, potentially even undermining America's interests, for the coverage it brings.
As the result of a tweet, which seems to be the foundation of a lot of his on-the-go policymaking, Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on Sunday to announce the reopening of nuclear talks.
To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle. Not only has he already become the first U. S. president to meet with a North Korean leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, which is also a first. But he has been down this road before with little in the way of results. When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore a year ago, he also drew the world’s attention. Then after a second meeting in Vietnam in February, the talks broke off. Now he’s at it again.
OPPOSING VIEW: For reasons good and bad, Donald Trump seems to have an affinity with Kim Jong Un
There’s more here than self-promotion, though. In constantly providing a stage for Kim, Trump is giving him legitimacy and global standing that he most assuredly does not deserve.
Making matters worse, Trump is, according to The New York Times, considering recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power and merely asking for it to freeze its arsenal, rather than giving it up. That’s a step back from where Kim was last year, when he promised to denuclearize.
Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. North Korea has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze its nuclear weapons program. These pledges go back to 1985, when it joined a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and 1992, when North Korea and South Korea signed a pact to denuclearize the peninsula. In 1994, it negotiated a deal with former President Jimmy Carter to freeze its program.
To give Kim so much upfront now, in hopes that he will reform his ways, is unwise. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to follow suit, developing their own nuclear arsenals and forcing their way onto the U. S. president’s agenda.
Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran’s foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded the enrichment caps set down by the accord.
Now, instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump's diplomacy has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to address. So far, Trump's diplomatic moves in Iran and North Korea have shown great success in focusing international attention on the White House — but they show little sign of tangible nuclear progress.

Reds-Indians game will honor Ohio suffragist women's push

Texto completo: If you enjoyed it when Sen. Kamala Harris went after former Vice President Joe Biden with surgical precision or got a kick out of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's articulating a plan for darn-near everything during the recent Democratic presidential debates, let this sink in. A century ago, these two candidates for President of the United States could not even have voted.
It took more than 50 years of fighting for women to finally win the right to vote in 1920, which included rallies and marches, community organizing and, yes, baseball with a bit of sex appeal and home economics thrown in. That, according to research by Mary Anne Christie, of Madeira, vice chair of the Ohio Republican Women's Suffrage Committee. The group is spearheading Ohio's effort to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.
With baseball? Yup.
Christie will be on hand Saturday, July 6, as the Cincinnati Reds hold special events before and after their 4:10 p.m. game against the Cleveland Indians to honor the women of Ohio gaining the right to vote. Christie especially wants women and girls to respect the moment. "I hope this is going to make them realize that it wasn't so long ago that they got the right to vote, that they are going to realize the time when their mothers and their grandmothers for the first time got a right to vote," she said.
Saturday's event harkens to June 3, 1916, when the Reds played the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York. The suffragist moment was in full swing, and clearly, the women knew the value of product placement, considering baseball was the nation's most popular sport.
Suffragist women mingled in the stands, wore blue, silk sashes and sold flags. The New York Times noted that some men paid more attention to the ladies than the game. They hung billboards all over the polo grounds with messages like, "Let Women win the Vote in One Inning" and "Women Hate Coaching from the Sidelines."
A week before the game, suffragists negotiated with the Mets to offer a piece of chocolate cake for every ticket purchased at the suffrage headquarters to increase their share of ticket sales.
In 2019, as part of the Reds-Indians game promotion, Kroger stores are selling chocolate cakes to recognize Ohio women's suffrage efforts for Saturday's game. And members of the committee will wear purple, white and gold sashes with the phrase, "Votes for Women" written on them.
Today, women vote in higher numbers than men, 117 women were elected or appointed to Congress in 2018, and six are vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. "Soccer Moms" are a voting bloc.
But before all that happened, the Women's Suffrage Movement had to succeed.
Congress passed the 19th Amendment on June 4, 1919. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it 12 days later, but it took more than a year to fully approve the amendment when Tennessee became the 36th state to vote in favor of ratification in August 1920.
It's difficult to fathom a time when only white males who owned land got to vote and make laws in the United States. That's an ugly American legacy mitigated by the ratification of the 19th Amendment and the many other changes that ensued over time.
And to think, Reds baseball had a small hand in that.
If you go The Cincinnati Reds and the Cleveland Indians will celebrate the 100th anniversary for Ohio women's right to vote. Gametime is 4:10 p.m., July 6. Tickets can be purchased by going to groupmatics.events/OhioWomen.

Questions surround woman whose fetus died in shooting

Texto completo: PLEASANT GROVE, Ala. - In the days since police officers arrested Marshae Jones, saying she had started a fight that resulted in her unborn baby getting shot, the hate mail has poured in.
."I will encourage all U.S. business owners to boycott your town," a woman from San Diego wrote on the Facebook page of the Pleasant Grove Police Department.
"Misogynist trash," wrote another.
"Fire the chief and arresting officers," wrote a third.
But Robert Knight, the police chief, said his officers had little choice in the matter.
"If the laws are there, we are sworn to enforce them," he said. "That's what we're going to do."
Around the country, the case of Jones - who was indicted by a grand jury for manslaughter - has served as a stark illustration of how pregnant women can be judged and punished when a fetus is treated as a person by the justice system.
Activists have also cited it as a demonstration of the dangers of the "personhood" movement, which pushes for the rights of fetuses to be recognized as equal to - or even more important than - the rights of the mothers who carry them. And many are now watching as the movement gains momentum in Alabama, which already has some of the most restrictive reproductive rights laws in the country.
But in Pleasant Grove, a city of 10,000 people on the western outskirts of Birmingham, the case appears to have caused little controversy. Gun rights are popular here. Reproductive rights are not. Many conversations in the city focused on how harshly Jones should be punished, not whether she was culpable.
Outside Hill's Foodland, the city's only grocery store, two mothers raising money for the Pleasant Grove middle school cheerleading squad said both Jones and the woman who shot her should face some consequences - perhaps anger management classes - for the death of a fetus.
"In the state of Alabama, an unborn baby has the same rights as a living child," said Sharonda Hall, 38, who just earned her bachelor's degree in criminal justice and is hoping to attend law school. "Most people agree with it."
Others said prison time would be appropriate. Inside a local restaurant, the Olipita Mediterranean & American Grill, Forrest Brown, 64, a retired musician, said that from what he had heard about the case, he believed the indictment was fair.
"You have to go by the law," he said.
The notion that the law should treat a fetus like a person is widely held in Alabama. Lawmakers passed the most restrictive anti-abortion bill in the country in May, banning abortions at any stage of pregnancy, even in cases of rape or incest. A protest against the measure in Birmingham drew only about 2,000 people, in a metropolitan area that is home to more than 1 million.
In November, Alabama voters approved a ballot measure that amended the state's constitution to recognize the "sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children."
In the wake of that vote, a Madison County judge ruled that a 19-year-old man could pursue a wrongful-death lawsuit against a clinic and a pharmaceutical company that provided an abortion pill to his girlfriend.
It is that case - not the case of Jones - that pushes the envelope of "personhood" for many in Alabama.
Brent Helms, the attorney who filed the wrongful-death suit on a contingency basis, said that case law had established personhood for fetuses who perish at the hands of reckless people, such as drunken drivers or domestic abusers. His is the first case, he said, to "establish personhood for even an unborn aborted child."
He acknowledged that conferring "personhood" so early in a pregnancy had the potential to affect everything from fertility treatment - which discards fertilized eggs that aren't used - to the freedom of women who play risky sports or drink wine.
"At this stage, we don't know all of the ramifications," he said. "Every time I speak to someone, they come up with something new."
Years of legal precedent have set the stage for this debate in Alabama. Hundreds of women have been prosecuted in the state for exposing their fetuses to controlled substances under a 2006 "chemical endangerment" law, according to an investigation by ProPublica and Al.com. In Pleasant Grove, three women who were addicted to drugs have been prosecuted for chemical endangerment in recent years.
Last year, Jessica Lindsey, 29, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to chemical endangerment for using heroin while pregnant. Raven West, a heroin addict who gave birth to a stillborn baby, received a five-year suspended sentence last year. And Alexandra Laird, who gave birth to two children who tested positive for heroin, received two suspended 10-year sentences and access to a treatment program, according to court records.
The cases have sometimes put police at odds with doctors who argued that prosecuting pregnant addicts, discourages them from seeking treatment they need. But in each of those cases, Lt. Danny Reid of the Pleasant Grove police, who serves as a spokesman of the 16-officer department, gave passionate public statements about the need to protect the rights of the unborn.
A similar approach can be seen in the case of Jones. Shortly after the shooting, which took place in December, Reid told reporters that the mother's culpability will be presented to a grand jury.
"The investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby," he said then. "It was the mother of the child who initiated and continued the fight."
Jones was five months pregnant and working at a company in Pleasant Grove that sells fuel for fires, when she got involved in an altercation in the parking lot of the Dollar General store.
The fight stemmed from a long-simmering feud with a female co-worker, Ebony Jemison, 23, over a man who worked at the same company. Jones spotted Jemison in the parking lot and started a fight with her, according to a law enforcement officer with direct knowledge of the investigation who didn't want to be identified. By the officer's account, Jones was winning the fight and had Jemison pinned in her car.
After taking repeated blows, the officer said, Jemison reached for a gun, and fired point blank into Jones' stomach. Jones was driven to the hospital in a car that apparently broke down on the way. Paramedics eventually arrived and took her to the hospital, but her fetus - struck by a bullet - died.
This account of the fight differs from others that have been offered in recent days, which have suggested that Jemison fired a warning shot at the ground and the bullet bounced up and hit Jones in the belly.
Pleasant Grove officers initially arrested Jemison. But the grand jury declined to indict her, concluding that she had acted in self-defense. It then took the unusual step of indicting Jones, for "initiating a fight knowing she was five months pregnant." Police were surprised by the decision, according to the law enforcement officer, but agreed with its logic.
Reached by phone Friday night, the forewoman of the grand jury, Mischelle Cagle, said she was unaware of the national furor. She declined to discuss the details of the case but said it was one of hundreds of cases the jury had heard over the course of a few days. She said the jurors did their best to probe for the truth and follow Alabama law.
"You think certain things, but then when you look at the law, it's different," she said.
Since the furor erupted, prosecutors have distanced themselves from the charges.
A statement from the office of Lynneice Washington, the district attorney for part of Jefferson County, emphasized that no decision had yet been made about whether to go to trial, file lesser charges against Jones or dismiss the case. A decision is expected within the week.
"Foremost, it should be stated that this is a truly tragic case," the statement said. "We feel sympathy for the families involved, including Ms. Jones, who lost her unborn child."
Washington, a Democrat, became Alabama's first Black female district attorney when she was elected in 2016 by a slim margin of about 300 votes. The case is being closely watched by liberal reproductive rights advocates in Birmingham, as well as conservative voters in her district.
Jones was taken into custody Wednesday, and posted bail the next day with the help of her family and the Yellowhammer Fund, an organization that supports abortion rights. Her attorney Mark White, whose law firm has taken on the case, said Jones is resting in an undisclosed location.
"She's devastated," he said.

Texto completo: Shoot the moon. That's what "Apollo's Muse" - a photo-driven exhibition launching Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art marking the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing on July 20, 1969 - is all about.
Subtitled "The Moon in the Age of Photography," the show, running through Sept. 22, features more than 170 photographs, including the iconic snap of Buzz Aldrin by fellow Apollo astronaut Neil Armstrong, which shows the lunar surface in a mirror-faced space helmet.
"The Apollo 11 moon landing was a major event in human history, one that has changed the way we think about our place in the cosmos," Mia Fineman, exhibit curator, tells amNewYork. "Photography, in both a scientific and artistic way, was an important part of this whole landmark journey." 
Fineman was 3 when her parents plopped her down in front of their television set to witness "one giant leap for mankind." They were among a half a billion people around the world who watched as images of American astronauts on the moon beamed 238,900 miles back to earth a half-century ago.
But centuries before that, Earth's natural satellite had already captivated people's curiosity and fascination. The Met exhibit "traces back that history," explains Met director Max Hollein, who describes the moon as a "nearly universal source of fascination and inspiration."
Oscar-winner and acknowledged space geek Tom Hanks echoes that sentiment in his introduction to the book accompanying "Apollo's Muse." "From the earliest days of human history, no matter where our kind was scattered, the moon was a mystery," writes the "Apollo 13" star. "Was that a face looking down on us? Did the gods live there? Or a big rabbit? Or a divine woman? Maybe a race of cricket-men?" 
Photography has helped answer those questions. "As soon as photography was invented, the moon was a target and focus," according to Fineman.
While photos make up the bulk of the show, there's an array of drawings, paintings, film clips, astronomical instruments and NASA cameras. Across the show's five galleries, there's something for everyone.
Photography fans will savor two newly discovered lunar daguerreotypes from the 1840s, which, says Fineman, are believed to be the earliest photographs of the moon in existence. Works by 19th-century lunar photography pioneers Warren De La Rue, Lewis Morris Rutherfurd and John Adams Whipple are also on view.
Science aficionados will appreciate a book of lunar etchings by Galileo published in 1610 that helped give birth to selenography, the science of the moon's surface. 
Sci-fi geeks will be over-the-moon for lunar-centric cinematic excerpts which, beyond their kitschy qualities, offer reminders of the overlap between art and science. Perch on a bench and check out clips of Georges Méliès 1902 classic "A Trip to the Moon," Fritz Lang's 1929 "Woman in the Moon" and Irving Pichel's 1950 "Destination Moon."
A 1968 mini dress, made of paper and printed with NASA rocket ships on the front and back shows how space had blasted its way into the fashion of the times. Created by Harry Gordon, the mod frock is part of a series of disposable poster dresses that could be cut at the seams and hung on the wall.  
For an "eagle has landed" flashback, a vintage television console plays CBS News television coverage - actual footage and simulation. The look of excitement seen on the face of anchor Walter Cronkite is the real deal.  
"It's a truly dramatic moment," says Fineman. "But as a 3-year-old, I didn't appreciate that things like this didn't happen all the time."
Fifty years later, Hanks wonders: "Who will attempt the next lunar landing with its so-very-slim margin for error? Who is going to go where no woman has gone before?"
Feeling moonstruck? Don't snap out of it! Consider: Just in time for the lunar landing 50th anniversary, Christie's is auctioning space-exploration artifacts including the Apollo 11 Lunar Module Timeline Book used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to navigate the Eagle onto the moon's surface. Moondust included (seriously). It's expected to fetch $7-$9 million. Here are three more options with down-to-earth prices. One Giant Leap: The Apollo 11 Moon Landing, 50 Years On Tony-winning playwright J.T. Rogers ("Oslo") understands the value of teamwork. "In a moment of great political upheaval and divisiveness, remember what it meant when we worked and did something together." That's one theme of his new 45-minute drama about the space race drawn from transcripts, news reports and interviews that will be read at this event by stars like Lauren Ambrose, Jeff Daniels and Samuel L. Jackson. The idea for the play came to Rogers from a science writer at The New York Times, which presents this event that also includes chats with Apollo 11 command module pilot Michael Collins and Peggy Whitson, the first woman commander of the International Space Station and others. (Town Hall, July 21, 7 p.m., $50 and up) Apollo, a Party! Space-themed music, drinks, treats, solar observations and stargazing with members of the Amateur Astronomers Association and more events are on tap at this evening family affair. (New York Hall of Science, Queens, July 20, 7-10 p.m.) Moon Landing: 50th Anniversary Celebration Space is the summer reading theme at the New York Public Library. "The moon landing was a remarkable moment in U.S. History, one that showcased to a generation that literally anything is possible," NYPL interim chief library manager, Caryl Matute   tells amNewYork. "The sky's the limit." Readings and events run through the summer. Check NYPL.

For 9th year in a row, Mass. lawmakers don't hit their own budget deadline

Texto completo: There is no shortage of vexing problems facing Massachusetts government these days: The MBTA is in constant crisis. Housing is increasingly unaffordable in Boston and beyond. And the state is being sued for failing to provide minority children with a decent education.
But don't look to the Legislature for any kind of immediate action. Its leaders are not planning to tackle most of these key policy debates until later in the year — at the earliest — and they've also just blown through their July 1 deadline to finish their most fundamental task: crafting a budget.
For the ninth year in a row, the Legislature had to pass a stopgap spending measure to keep state government running. And it's not as if budget writers have to slog through tough debates about where to cut spending: Tax revenues are pouring in far in excess of estimates.
Other states manage to do more — in some cases, much more. Forty-two states have enacted budgets for fiscal 2020 already, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. In fact, Massachusetts is one of just two states with a fiscal year starting July 1 where the Legislature has not passed an annual spending plan yet. (The other is Ohio.)
Beacon Hill leadership says behind-the-scenes work is happening on several fronts, including an overhaul of the state's troubled education funding formula and proposals to pump more money into the beleaguered public transportation system. House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo recently described the latter as a “crisis" after Governor Charlie Baker announced his request for $50 million in additional revenue to speed up fixes to the MBTA.
“So far this session, the House has passed major pieces of legislation to fund state services, keep our roads safe, raise revenue, invest in our roads and bridges, support farmers, put in place consumer protections and create safeguards for workers, among other items," DeLeo said in a statement.
“The Senate has been working diligently since January, and will continue its collaborative process to craft bold, actionable solutions to the challenges facing the Commonwealth," said state Senate President Karen Spilka.
In several cases, bills that have passed one chamber are awaiting further action elsewhere on Beacon Hill. The Legislature has sent only a handful of meaningful measures to Baker's desk so far this year, according to a Globe review.
He's taken action on 30 bills, but only two of these qualify as meaty policy matters — a ban on so-called gay conversion therapy for minors, and the repeal of a policy precluding families receiving welfare benefits from getting additional assistance when another child is born. Lawmakers passed the latter over Baker's veto.
Lawmakers and other Beacon Hill defenders argue bills sent to Baker's desk are not the only yardstick by which to gauge the Legislature's productivity. The start of the two-year legislative session is typically dominated by hearings, of which more than 100 have happened to date.
For comparison, in their six-month legislative session that ended earlier this month, New York legislators not only completed a $175.5 billion budget, they hammered out deals on more than a dozen consequential policy issues. Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, approved stronger rental laws and protections for undocumented immigrants, moved to eliminate almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and overhauled the state's voting laws and the Legislature's own ethics rules, among other measures.
“A sense of jealousy and a sense of serious anger," is how former state representative Jay R. Kaufman said he felt reading a recent New York Times editorial praising all the New York Assembly accomplished this year. “A comparable editorial cannot be written about the Massachusetts Legislature," said Kaufman, who left Beacon Hill after 24 years to start a nonprofit focused on leadership training for the public sector.
Some items are nearing the finish line on Beacon Hill. Both chambers have passed legislation this year banning the use of mobile devices while driving. The House and Senate also each passed bills to bolster organized labor. In both cases, lawmakers still must work out differences in conference committee.
They also recently approved a constitutional amendment to raise income taxes on millionaires — the first procedural step to putting the proposal on the ballot, something that would happen, at the earliest, in 2022.
In Beacon Hill's biennial rhythm, the season for hard-nosed negotiation and horse trading on the big, complicated matters typically comes in the second year — with the hard deadline at the session's end.
At the close of the previous two-year session, lawmakers struck a so-called grand bargain that combined a $15 minimum wage and a paid family and medical leave program with a permanent sales tax holiday and overtime changes. (Legislative action only came, though, after progressive activists and business interests had secured separate ballot measures on their respective priorities.)
Lawmakers and others point to the complexity of the state's almost $43 billion budget and stress the importance of getting it done right, not fast — especially since the stopgap spending measure means there's no practical consequences to a delay of a few weeks' time.
On Monday, Baker told reporters he is unbothered by the Legislature's repeated budget tardiness. Passing a temporary budget to let lawmakers have more time “usually ends up producing a better product then simply getting there by June 30," he said.
And several outside advocates said they're optimistic Beacon Hill will prove able to finish legislation on key policy fronts during the session, which ends next year.
“I actually give high marks to the Legislature this session because there's been a clear acknowledgment of the need to act decisively on our transportation crisis, and it is a crisis," said former state transportation secretary James Aloisi. While they may not have the details worked out, both DeLeo and Spilka have indicated “action is not just warranted but necessary. That alone gives me a lot of hope that the Legislature intends to step up and do something significant" this session, he said.
DeLeo has said the House plans to take up a tax package this fall to help fund transportation. House and Senate education chairs are meeting regularly to hash out a consensus on revamping the state's antiquated education funding formula, which they hope to unveil before lawmakers scatter for August vacations.
The timeline for other high-profile initiatives remains murky — including legislation pushed by Baker that would make it easier for cities and towns to change zoning to allow new housing. Another Patriots season is set to start without Massachusetts allowing legal wagers, a year after the Supreme Court cleared the way for states to have sports betting — while a dozen other states, including Rhode Island, have charged ahead.
Even mundane matters can move at a sluggish pace. Lawmakers did not finish a $200 million borrowing bill for municipal road repairs until June, taking five weeks longer to pass the annual measure than they did last year, according to State House News Service, even though the borrowing level has remained essentially unchanged since 2012.
“It's not like we're reinventing the wheel. . . . This is the same thing over and over again," said Franklin's director of public works, Robert Cantoreggi.
Passing the annual road repair bill after March makes it harder for many cities and towns to plan their construction projects and can drive up costs, because so many municipalities are trying to hire a limited pool of contractors in a compressed amount of time, he said. The House transportation committee chairman, William Straus, said he disagrees that the timing of the bill had a negative impact on any cities and towns.
But Cantoreggi said the process for authorizing these funds “could be a lot more efficient, but that's Beacon Hill."

Texto completo: The former president of the West African nation of Gambia responded on Monday to rape allegations against him by a former beauty queen, with a statement from his party saying the accusations are part of a smear campaign "aimed at tarnishing the good reputation of Gambia's legendary and visionary leader."
Yahya Jammeh, the president who led a brutal regime in Gambia for 22 years, was accused by Fatou Jallow, whom he crowned as beauty queen, of raping her five years ago after she turned down his marriage proposal. She was 18 at the time.
The president's party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction, said in a statement emailed to The New York Times that, "The APRC, as a Party, and the Gambian people are tired of the steady stream of unfounded allegations that have been reported against our ex-President."
The statement from the president's party, by the deputy party leader, Ousman Rambo Jatta, came in response to an article in The New York Times last week in which Ms. Jallow came forward publicly for the first time to accuse the president of rape. The statement said that Ms. Jallow's account contained "no iota of truth," and claimed that the accusations were orchestrated by Western corporations. It noted that Mr. Jammeh is still the party's leader.
[Read about Ms. Jallow's experiences here.]
Ms. Jallow, who received asylum in Canada soon after the alleged incident, has triggered a #MeToo moment in Gambia, a nation of two million, with widespread responses on social media in the country and beyond as women began airing their own experiences of sexual assault.
It is a significant development in Gambia, where rape carries a heavy stigma for victims and such accusations are rarely discussed, even among family members. Ms. Jallow is widely known in Gambia as Toufah; the hashtag #IamToufah was circulating along with some women's claims.
The nation's attorney general said on Monday that he was investigating numerous sexual assault claims against Melville Robertson Roberts, a deputy secretary at the foreign ministry and a prominent lawyer. Mr. Roberts has denied the claims and said they were made by women he had rejected or who wanted to extort him for money. Efforts to reach him on Monday were unsuccessful.
Abubacarr M. Tambadou, Gambia's attorney general, has also called on women with accusations against Mr. Jammeh to come forward, and said he was investigating Ms. Jallow's claims.
Ms. Jallow, now 23, said that after she turned down the president's marriage proposal, she was summoned to the statehouse for what she was told was a Ramadan event with all the beauty pageant participants. When she arrived, she said, she was directed to a room where the president entered in his undergarments, pushed her on a bed and raped her.
"Toufah hit Gambia like a tsunami smashing a huge taboo," said Reed Brody, a lawyer for Human Rights Watch who is representing Ms. Jallow.
Ms. Jallow said that a driver working for the president drove her to and from the statehouse. The party statement said that the driver denied her claims.
The statement also asserted that The Times had not sought "clarifications" from Mr. Jammeh's family or the party. However, The Times made repeated requests for a response in the week before the article was published to the party's spokesman, to other officials close to Mr. Jammeh, as well as a relative and government officials in Equatorial Guinea, where Mr. Jammeh fled after losing an election in 2017. None responded.
Mr. Jammeh, who came to power in a coup that he led in 1994, was accused of running a brutal regime in which citizens were tortured, jailed, raped and disappeared. He threatened to behead gay people, ordered government agents to hunt down people he said were witches and demanded that AIDS patients be taken off their medications and treated with an herbal mixture.
He lost an election in December 2016, but refused to step down for more than a month. Regional leaders intervened, and he was allowed to flee to Equatorial Guinea. He has never faced charges for any accusations against him.
"He was accused of far graver crimes than rape and most of the accusations have now been proven to be false," read the statement from Mr. Jammeh's party.
The statement called him "a pious leader, who has nothing but respect for Gambian women and women around the world," and noted that he had enacted laws to abolish the practice of female genital mutilation.
A Truth and Reconciliation and Reparations Commission is hearing testimony from victims of alleged crimes during Mr. Jammeh's regime. Ms. Jallow is scheduled to testify later this year.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Tucked away in a small, dimly lit room on the second floor of The New York Times's headquarters, the team tasked with digitizing the newspaper's vast archive of photographs recently reached a milestone: one million photos scanned.
The ceremonial millionth photo, taken in 1940 and scanned by Mark Rubenstein, a former archival scanning technician, shows two men proudly displaying a 225-pound fish that one of them caught in Montauk, on Long Island. "PROUD OF HIS FIRST BROADBILL," the caption reads.
The group of five technicians, who celebrated their accomplishment with Champagne and candy, are a part of the archival storytelling department that works to make the photo archive accessible to editors through a digital database. The project, a partnership with Google, started last summer and aims to upload at least four million images to the cloud.
Each person scans about 1,000 images per day, according to Sarah Borell, an archival assistant. Parked next to each technician's desk is a cart filled with folders taken from drawers in the morgue, the newspaper's underground archive. After they're uploaded, the photos are categorized on an internal, searchable app.
Scanners handle the photographs with care -- some of the pictures date back to the early 1900s -- by replacing tattered folders and taping images if needed.
Members of the group have backgrounds in arts and history, and they get along well. "It's nice being in a small space and getting to know what everyone's working on," said Alexandra DiFiglia, who worked in the photo archive at "Saturday Night Live" before joining The Times.
The technicians often stumble upon photographs that shed light on important moments in history. "There was a folder I found a couple months ago of Woodstock," which came as a pleasant surprise, Ms. DiFiglia said.
Megan Paetzhold's discovery of a trove of dog photographs led to a round-table discussion, and an article from the Past Tense archival team, about the love of canines.
"I opened a drawer and it was all dogs. I was so happy," Ms. Paetzhold recalled.
Aaron Sorscher, a history buff, favors "morbid shots, which unfortunately we have a lot of," while Shayla Black, who has a background in fashion history and photography, likes "any images of black folks and people of color -- there are not a lot in the archives."
Vintage photographs also show how technology has changed labor. Sam Richards, who is interested in science and tech, shared a photo of a man monitoring a Las Vegas casino in 1972.
"He's above a gambling hall, and he's looking down -- he's the 'eye in the sky,' a term they use for security to see who's cheating," Mr. Richards said. "Now they have cameras, but back in the day, there was a guy up in the rafters looking down at people, which is fascinating."
One of Ms. Borell's favorite images is a 1923 photograph of the Eiffel Tower. The iconic landmark is flanked by hot air balloons. The @nytarchives Instagram account shared the photo around the 130th anniversary of the tower's construction. The image featured orange marks that used to show where a picture should be cropped before being published.
When archival technicians finish scanning their stacks of images, they journey through a series of obscure hallways and into the morgue, which is in a building next door.
The scanning team members mark every folder they have uploaded with a stamp and move on to the next filing cabinet, which could contain a collection of photographs related to space, fashion, Winston Churchill or even flowers.
"You're in history. You can get lost and go down a rabbit hole," Ms. Borell said.
Ms. DiFiglia agreed. "The best part of scanning is the nostalgia."

Federal wealth taxes and the incremental erosion of liberty

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

Texto completo: Aurora officials celebrated Aurora native and internationally acclaimed artist Wendell Minor in a homecoming May 28-29.
Minor, 74, of Washington, Connecticut, is a designer, illustrator and painter for trade fiction and nonfiction books, young adult books, children’s books and private and corporate commissions.
At Tuesday’s city council meeting, Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin presented Minor with a key to the city. On May 29, the city dedicated a block of New York Street in front of West Aurora High School, Minor’s alma mater, as "Wendell Minor Way."
In a final appearance May 29 at Aurora’s Santori Public Library, Minor presented an hourlong slideshow chronicling his life and answered audience questions. According to Minor, he decided on a career as an artist while a fourth-grade student at Aurora’s Greenman Elementary School.
Minor is a graduate of the Ringling School of Art and Design. He received an honorary doctorate from Aurora University in 2004.
His work is in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of American Illustration, and the NASA Art Collection at the John F. Kennedy Space Center.
Minor is the author and/or illustrator of nearly 50 award winning books for children. He has collaborated with many accomplished authors, among them Newbery Award winning naturalist Jean Craighead George, Charlotte Zolotow, Mary Higgins Clark, Robert Burleigh and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Several of his books, including two with Buzz Aldrin — "Reaching for the Moon" and Look to the Stars," and Mary Higgins Clark’s "Ghost Ship" — were New York Times best-sellers.
In addition to children’s books, his illustrations and design have enhanced more than 2,000 works, including the covers of David McCullough’s "Truman," "John Adams" and "1776," Pat Conroy’s "The Prince of Tides" and "South of Broad," and "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee.

Texto completo: The Palm Beach Post last week earned five individual honors in the Society for Features Journalism’s “Excellence In Features” contest. The staff took home the third-most awards of any newspaper or magazine staff in their circulation category.
The Post’s awards included two first-place honors, both by food editor Liz Balmaseda, one second-place and two third-place awards.
The winning stories chronicled a taste of Haitian culture in Boca Raton, snapshots of Palm Beach County cultural history, and a bizarre story of money, drugs and mysterious death in a Palm Beach mansion.
“Outstanding honors for these creative, graceful storytellers,” Post Editor Nick Moschella said. “Their ability to make us feel, think and connect on a range of topics is truly a treat for our readers.”
SFJ, which annually judges entries from publications with circulations that span from under 90,000 daily to those with more than 200,000, describes its mission as promoting “the craft of writing and innovation in lifestyle, arts and entertainment journalism.” Award winners include writers from the New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times.
Judges appeared enamored of Pulitzer Prize-winner Balmaseda, who won first place in the Specialty Features Writing Portfolio category, Division 1. They wrote that the three pieces submitted “deftly connects people, food and culture in an engaging,
sophisticated style. Her passion for food, people and writing comes through in each piece, and in the end, you feel as though you know these people and you know this place.”
Balmaseda also took home top honors in the Food Feature Writing category for “A Sliver of Haiti in Boca Raton,” a profile on Chef Greg Romulus of Boca’s Bistro 2.0. The judges wrote that Balmaseda “writes with ease and elegance as she introduces readers to (Romulus). At each step of the way, the flavors of Haitian food come through with her beautiful descriptions. This is a great example of how a story can be written tightly and yet effective.”
Other honorees from the Post included:
Larry Aydlette, who won third place in Feature Specialty Writing Portfolio, about whom judges noted “Readers surely love this series of historical and celebrity stories. Aydlette combines history, clips, the present and the past in a style that seems effortless.”
Leslie Gray Streeter, who won second place in General Commentary Portfolio. Judges wrote that “Streeter takes personal thoughts and raises them from the individual to the universal. Her writing is sophisticated with a distinctive voice.”
Joe Capozzi won third place in Narrative Storytelling for “The Strange Tale of Wolfie and the Addicts,” about which the judges wrote “This story features wonderful voice and style in the opening section, and it’s smart and effective, without becoming a burdensome trick.”
The awards will be presented during SFJ’s national convention in Detroit.

Byron York: Anti-Trump fever takes threatening turn

Texto completo: The toxicity of the resistance to President Trump has risen in recent days, with the nation's most respected newspapers publishing rationalizations for denying Trump supporters public accommodation and for doxxing career federal employees, while a journalist found himself under physical attack from the so-called anti-fascist group Antifa, which has stepped up its violent activities since Trump's election.
The justification for denying public accommodation came from the Washington Post in an op-ed by Stephanie Wilkinson, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant in Lexington, Virginia. Wilkinson became famous in June of last year, when she refused to serve White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders and and told Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant. Wilkinson's staff then followed the Sanders group in protest as they tried to find another place to eat.
Wilkinson later told the press she ejected Sanders because the Trump administration is "inhumane and unethical" and because the Red Hen "has certain standards that I feel it has to uphold, such as honesty, and compassion, and cooperation."
In her new article, Wilkinson discussed the case of The Aviary, a trendy bar in Chicago where a waitress recently spat on Eric Trump, the president's son. Wilkinson wrote that the incident, along with her own decision to oust Sanders, shows that in the age of Trump "new rules apply" in public accommodations: Americans who work for the administration or support the president should stay away.
"If you're directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home," Wilkinson wrote.
Wilkinson noted that "no one in the industry condones the physical assault of a patron," but at the same time declared that Americans should understand that a "frustrated person" -- for example, a restaurant employee -- will "lash[] out at the representatives of an administration that has made its name trashing norms and breaking backs." Americans should accept that such things will happen.
"If you're an unsavory individual," Wilkinson concluded, "we have no legal or moral obligation to do business with you." Better to stay home than risk the spittle. (And of course, Wilkinson and her colleagues in the hospitality industry will decide who is "unsavory.")
The apology for doxxing came from the New York Times in a piece by Kate Cronin-Furman, an assistant professor of human rights at University College London. The article focused on the treatment of illegal immigrant children in detention centers near the U.S.-Mexico border.
Cronin-Furman discussed the detentions, as well as actions by employees of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in terms of the Holocaust and genocides in Cambodia and Rwanda. Those are, of course, contexts which most Americans would likely dismiss as preposterous and offensive but which Cronin-Furman and the New York Times apparently take seriously. Her idea is that opponents of the administration should publicly identify and shame low- and mid-level Customs and Border Protection employees who care for migrant children.
Such workers would be dismayed at being publicly shamed because they are "sensitive to social pressure," Cronin-Furman wrote, "which has been shown to have played a huge role in atrocity commission and desistance in the Holocaust, Rwanda, and elsewhere. The campaign to stop the abuses at the border should exploit this sensitivity."
"This is not an argument for doxxing," Cronin-Furman continued. "It's about exposure of their participation in atrocities to audiences whose opinion they care about. The knowledge, for instance, that when you go to church on Sunday, your entire congregation will have seen you on TV ripping a child out of her father's arms is a serious social cost to bear. The desire to avoid this kind of social shame may be enough to persuade some agents to quit and may hinder the recruitment of replacements. For those who won't (or can't) quit, it may induce them to treat the vulnerable individuals under their control more humanely. In Denmark during World War II, for instance, strong social pressure, including from churches, contributed to the refusal of the country to comply with Nazi orders to deport its Jewish citizens."
Needless to say, that was a clear argument for doxxing.
Finally, there was Antifa's recent attack on Andy Ngo, a freelance journalist often associated with the pro-free thought cultural publication Quillette. At a demonstration in Portland, at which Trump was a focus of dispute, Antifa fighters beat up and milkshaked Ngo, apparently because he was there and he was not on their side.
The president is not always at the center of such demonstrations, but Antifa has become an angry and violent fringe force in the Resistance. It has played an ugly role in a number of events, most notably Charlottesville, in which feelings about Trump have played a role.
Shunning, shaming, doxxing, attacking. As the 2020 campaign reaches full speed, would it surprise anyone to see all of it increase? And all from people who congratulate themselves for standing against hate. Perhaps our politics will cool down at some point in the future. But not now.

Texto completo: In this country, there is a huge disparity when it comes to the salaries paid to members of the men's and women's national teams, even though players such as Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, Julie Ertz and elder stateswoman Carli Lloyd are just as recognizable as their male counterparts.
To that end, the Austin soccer community arrived in force at Easy Tiger in North Austin on Friday to support the U.S. women's national team. From guys walking around in Morgan's No. 13 jersey on the covered
patio area where three video screens were set up to the American Outlaws Austin chapter leading the crowd in chants, it was some party. Austin FC and its fan group Austin Anthem kept everyone loose with giveaways and party favors, and the Lady Birds — Anthem’s female soccer support division — served as amazing hosts.
"We want to create outreach for women to support Austin FC and soccer overall," said Chloe Hanson, Anthem’s director of accessibility. "We want to make it a safe place for everyone through our love of the sport."
The love was in the room. Manager Noah Gray told me the restaurant-bar-bakery on North Interstate 35 in the Linc shopping center — it opened in December — was the ideal Friday afternoon choice for a watch party, though fans also hung out at the Sixth Street location downtown. The Linc spot holds 500 and was close to capacity by the start of the game.
The beer was cold, the pastrami on home-baked rye was great, and the soccer was even better. Despite a sluggish second half, the Americans, behind scoring machine Rapinoe, took a 2-1 win to advance to the semifinals against England. Amid the high-fives, hugs and the general bonding experience shared by most in attendance — there were a couple of tables of passionate French fans there as well — was the unquestioned belief that the U.S. women’s team consistently moves the fan needle, both here and abroad.
At least on the playing field.
On an international level, the U.S. women’s team is easily the more dominant of the two, having won three World Cup trophies and four Olympic gold medals. The men have never made it to a final in either the World Cup or the Summer Olympics. Their best Olympic finish was a bronze medal a few weeks back in, uh, 1904. In 10 World Cup appearances, they reached one semifinal, during the Great Depression. Of late, the men’s team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, losing to Trinidad and Tobago knowing it only needed to tie to get in to the big tournament.
While the women are always one of the favorites in any international field — they have been ranked No. 1 in 10 of the past 11 years — the numbers on their paychecks reflect a different reality. The 28-member team filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation in March alleging gender discrimination in pay and overall working conditions. The women argued that they play more games, win more games and draw larger television audiences — the 2015 World Cup title win over Japan was viewed by a U.S. record 23 million — yet receive just $99,000 per player while the men get just over $263,00.
The lawsuit attracted international attention, and world soccer’s governing body, FIFA, in either a show of good faith or just good old-fashioned PR savvy, doubled the prize money pool to $30 million for the 24 teams. The 32-team men’s field gets $400 million, in case you’re wondering.
“I think to be on this team is to understand these issues,” Rapinoe told The New York Times in March. “And I think we’ve always — dating back to forever — been a team that stood up for itself and fought hard for what it felt it deserved and tried to leave the game in a better place.”
The USSF granted the women an undisclosed raise in 2017, but it was obviously not enough. Soccer fan Lisa Dempsey pointed to the popularity of the women’s team in America as one reason they should get a bigger piece of the pie.
"They’re the best team on the planet," she told me. "I’m constantly getting into pleasant arguments with people as they try to say the men draw a bigger audience and that’s why it’s fair for them to be paid more. The facts don’t line up. It’s not true. The women deserve higher pay because their performances are far better."
Austinite Greg Dvorak has traveled to the men’s World Cup and was on hand because he simply loves watching the sport played at a high level, male or female.
"People love a quality product, and they’re doing it the right way," said Dvorak, who works at Dell. "Soccer is growing in Austin and nationally. You could see by the number of people who showed up here to support the women. We just need to get a win."
The win happened, and the turnout was a testament to the respect the women have earned through a dominant run in their sport over the past two decades. It also shined a spotlight on the team’s desire to earn its fair share because of the hard work the players put in to be the best at their profession.
You go, girls.

Texto completo: I can't believe the Milwaukee Bucks made it to the NBA's Eastern Conference Finals this season. I really can't believe that we went up 2-0 and then lost 4 straight and blew our chance to face the Golden State Warriors in the Finals.
Instead, Kawhi Leonard and the Toronto Raptors went on to beat the mighty Warriors, although Golden State will argue the title should have an asterisk next to it because many of their key players were injured.
But to the victor go the spoils. Leonard is now an unrestricted free agent and the bidding wars will soon begin. Everyone loves a winner and everyone wants a piece of a winner.
In addition to the huge NBA salary he will command, Leonard earns a pretty penny with endorsement deals. Like most players, he has a huge shoe deal. Surprisingly, last year Leonard left Nike for New Balance. While the terms of the deal are unknown, we do know Leonard walked away from a $22 million, 4-year deal that Nike's Jordan brand put on the table. Insiders speculate his New Balance deal is worth over $5 million a year for him for at least 5 years.
However, it's unclear if the unique 'Klaw' logo Nike used to promote Kawhi Leonard products will be used at New Balance. Leonard actually sued Nike, claiming he designed the logo that appeared on the shoe company's apparel that it copyrighted without his consent. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Southern California.
In the suit, Leonard claims the logo is an extension of his drawings he made and gave Nike permission to use on "certain merchandise." According to his attorneys, "Leonard traced his notably large hand, and, inside the hand, drew stylized versions of his initials 'KL' and the number that he had worn for much of his career, '2.' The drawing Leonard authored was an extension and continuation of drawings he had been creating since early in his college career." The Finals' MVP alleges Nike "falsely represented" in its copyright application that the company had created the "Klaw" logo.
Meanwhile, in an interesting twist, according to the New York Times, the Los Angeles Clippers have "quietly looked into ... purchasing the rights to Leonard's 'Klaw' logo." If they obtain the logo, the Clippers believe it will increase their chances of signing Leonard this off-season.
While Leonard is hashing out the rights to a logo, so is his team. In 2015, the Raptors unveiled their new logo, which is a basketball that looks like it was shredded by the claws of a dinosaur. Shortly after, Monster Beverage Corporation blocked the Raptors' initial trademark filings, and the team still doesn't own the registration for its logos. The energy drink company claims the NBA franchise infringed on its copyright for Monster Energy, which features claw-marks shredding a neon green 'M' into the side of the can, saying it is too similar to theirs.
The Raptors are not alone: Monster has filed several other lawsuits claiming copyright infringement. Last year, Monster lost its lawsuit against the U.K's Monsta Pizza because the court disagreed with Monster's contention that customers would confuse one business for the other.
Monster also sued MonsterFishKeeper.com, a brewery selling a beer called "Vermonster," and a maker of craft sodas, Thunder Beast, because Monster has the slogan "Unleash the Beast."
All of the lawyers in these cases should be stocking up on Monster, as it looks like there will be many long days in court ahead.

New Inspiration From Old Sources

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Pig costumes in Tokyo in 1994. A group of children at an arcade in Seoul in 1987. The spiral staircase at the University of Mumbai in 1936.
Novelists draw their inspiration from endless sources, and for a special section in today's paper, The New York Times gave 10 of them decades-old photographs, including the ones described above, hoping that it would spark ideas for short fiction.
"Viewfinders" -- a project from Past Tense, a Times initiative that uses our archives to tell new stories -- began as a celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. But it has grown into something much larger.
"One of the things that we wanted to do is to try to bring different groups of people and different kinds of people into the archives," Veronica Chambers, the editor of Past Tense, said.
The Past Tense team selected 10 young-adult authors of Asian-American heritage, including the New York Times best-selling authors Sabaa Tahir, a Pakistani-American who wrote the young-adult series, "The Ember in the Ashes," and Soman Chainani, author of the children's book series "The School for Good and Evil." Each author was asked to pick a photograph and write a short story about it.
Ms. Chambers chose the group of writers, in part, for their reach and their commitment to their audiences. "They're writing the new classics," she said. "They're creating these series that have reached hundreds of thousands of readers, and so to invite that really special group into the archives felt like a wonderful opportunity."

Samira Ahmed, an Indian-American writer who participated in the project, was excited and challenged by the visual prompt. "One of the great challenges of writing is to try to capture these moments that you can see in your mind's eye," Ms. Ahmed said, "then translating them onto the page so that the reader can convert that into their mind's eye."
Ms. Chambers, who is a young-adult author herself, wanted to focus on the genre, she said, because "people who write for teenagers are always writing about the process of becoming, and that's what I think they've done for us."
Young-adult fiction "is about growing up. It's about finding your identity. And in some ways, I think that's partly why these authors are so popular with readers across the board, not just teenagers, because we're all always trying to figure life out."
Anika Burgess, a photo editor for Past Tense, combed through hundreds of photographs in order to give each author between six and nine images to choose from. She naturally gravitates to older photographs, she said.
She also wanted to provide the authors with images that had a variety of moods. Some images related to the authors' ethnic backgrounds, some were influenced by the authors' signature writing styles or themes and some were wild cards (like the pig costumes, for instance), selected for their visual appeal.
David Yoon, the author of "Frankly in Love," was immediately drawn to a photograph of Korean children playing at an arcade. His short story is titled "Rabbit in the Arcade."
"The arcade was my place as a kid," Mr. Yoon said. Some of his favorite games were Galaga, Marble Madness and Major Havoc.
"If my parents hadn't left the country and I had been born in Korea, I could have easily been one of those kids," Mr. Yoon said. He was around the same age as the boys in the image, which was taken in Seoul, South Korea, in 1987.
One of the photographs given to Ms. Ahmed, who wrote the short story called "Election Day," actually had a familial tie -- which came as a surprise to all.
It was the spiral staircase at the University of Mumbai (then the University of Bombay) around 1936. Ms. Ahmed's parents met under that tower's shadow, and a few years later, the writer was born at a hospital just a few miles away.
As Ms. Ahmed began to write her short story for The Times, she went back and forth with ideas of fantasy -- for example, "maybe the staircase is going to be a portal or lead somewhere into the stars" -- and more realistic themes. But ultimately, the recent Indian election and its Hindu-nationalist messaging weighed on her mind.

"I tried to put in there a little bit of my concerns or fears for my own family, who is Muslim and living in India because neither of my parents' families left during partition," she said.
"I was thinking of that man in the image," she said, "that had a melancholy to him, who was gazing at something that he couldn't reach."
Ms. Ahmed was excited that The Times had decided to celebrate Asian-American heritage, given what little representation she had experienced in literature when she was young.
"There were never really, in my library or definitely in my curriculum, authors or stories of characters who even remotely looked like me," she said, "or whose named sounded like mine or whose experiences as an immigrant kid or from a family of immigrants reflected my own."
This was a sentiment shared by many of the authors in the project.
"Young-adult literature has been trying to move into a space where our shelves reflect our world," Ms. Ahmed said. "And I think they should."
In this case, the reflections are showcased on the newsstand.
"You don't always get fiction in your newspaper, but I think this has a nice mix of photojournalism," Ms. Chambers said, and it illustrates "how photojournalism of the past can spark our imaginations in the present."

Texto completo: Anna Marie Ramírez gritó: “¡Amanda, me apuñalaste!” antes de morir desangrada la madrugada del sábado en una pelea en su hogar de Nueva Jersey.
Así lo afirmó ayer el juez de la Corte Superior del Condado Camden, Edward McBride, citando la declaración de un testigo a la policía.
El testigo no identificado también escuchó a Amanda Ramírez amenazar a su gemela Anna Marie poco antes de la tragedia familiar en los apartamentos de vivienda popular “Centennial Village” en Camden, alrededor de las 5:40 a.m. del sábado, dijo McBride en la corte.
“¡Mira lo que haré!”, dijo Amanda supuestamente antes de entrar al edificio para agarrar un cuchillo de cocina grande.
El testigo, que vive en un piso superior en el mismo edificio que la familia Ramírez, escuchó la amenaza mientras observaba desde una ventana y bajó las escaleras, llegando afuera justo después de que apuñalaran a Anna Marie, señaló el juez McBride.
La poderosa evidencia fue revelada durante una audiencia en la que a Amanda le fue negada la libertad bajo fianza. Desde el sábado ha estado detenida y acusada de homicidio agravado en el asesinato de su gemela.
El fiscal Peter Gallagher también entregó ayer una foto del cuchillo que Amanda supuestamente hundió en el lado izquierdo del pecho de Anna Marie.
Amanda se echó a llorar cuando entró en la sala del tribunal y vio a casi 20 amigos y familiares, incluida su madre, sentada en la galería. La joven no habló en el tribunal y pasó la mayor parte de la sesión sollozando en la mesa de la defensa con el rostro hundido en el hombro izquierdo.
Un “triángulo amoroso” está siendo observado como el motivo de la pelea entre las hermanas, dijo su tía Blanca Class al New York Times. “Fueron a una fiesta, volvieron a casa, estaban bebiendo, discutían sobre un novio”, afirmó.
Cuando llegaron al edificio había un hombre con ellos, informó New York Post, citando una vecina menor de edad.
La acusada tiene un antecedente judicial por un caso sellado cuyos detalles no han sido difundidos. Según la policía, ha dado versiones contradictorias sobre lo sucedido el sábado, incluyendo que actuó en defensa propia porque era su hermana quien la quería apuñalar.

Texto completo: Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez y Valeria, padre e hija se fueron juntos de El Salvador con la idea de llegar a Estados Unidos en busca de un mejor futuro. Lo hicieron vivos, tomados de la mano junto a Tania, esposa de Óscar y madre de Valeria. Hoy, seis días después, la única que vuelve con vida es Tania, acompañando dos féretros y volviendo al país del que huyeron.
El domingo 23 de junio, Óscar decidió que no podían esperar más en Matamoros, México , donde permanecían albergados, en medio del hacinamiento, las altas temperaturas y la poca alimentación. Le dijo a Tania y Valeria que cruzarían hacia el otro lado por las aguas del río Bravo , pero la idea fue fatal para Óscar y Valeria, que terminaron arrastrados por una corriente y murieron.
Desde entonces la imagen de los dos salvadoreños ha recorrido todo el mundo, provocando indignación y tristeza. Las portadas de periódicos en todo el mundo, como The New York Times de Estados Unidos y The Independent de Reino Unido, han evocado la tragedia durante toda la semana.
* El conmovedor testimonio de la madre de Óscar, el migrante salvadoreño que murió junto a su hija en frontera de México y EUA
“En un mundo abrumado por el populismo es fácil para los líderes demonizar y deshumanizar a los migrantes, como ha hecho Trump. Víctimas de la guerra, el hambre y la pobreza, víctimas como este padre y su hija que tratan de ingresar a Estados Unidos, no son vistas por lo que son, vidas con igual valor, hasta que es demasiado tarde”, escribió The Independent en su portada de ayer, con la foto de Óscar y Valeria, y en clara crítica a la política migratoria de Donald Trump, presidente de los Estados Unidos.
Los cuerpos de Óscar y Valeria eran esperados ayer, pero durante el día había más dudas que respuestas. La madre de Óscar, Rosa Ramírez, aseguraba que nadie les había comunicado detalles sobre el retorno de sus seres amados. En la embajada de México en El Salvador sostenían que había vuelos atrasados desde aquel país y que eran esperados en horas de la noche. Y las autoridades de Relaciones Exteriores tampoco daban información certera.
* Así avanzan los preparativos para el sepelio de padre e hija salvadoreños ahogados en río Bravo
En Matamoros, ciudad fronteriza con Estados Unidos, los cuerpos de Óscar y Valeria esperaban ser movilizados hasta el aeropuerto más cercano, en Monterrey, a 300 kilómetros.
Los medios locales que cubrieron la noticia reportaron que Óscar y Valeria, acompañados de Tania, salieron de la funeraria a las 2 de la tarde, hora salvadoreña. Desde ahí eran aproximadamente tres horas de camino al aeropuerto y luego otras tres en el vuelo hasta El Salvador.
“Es la misma tragedia de gente desesperada, de inocentes que nunca sabrán por qué murieron y los que sí lo saben, seguirán sin hacer nada. La memoria colectiva olvida pronto”, destacó el miércoles la cadena española COPE, al hablar sobre el caso.
La tragedia ha servido también para que medios internacionales hagan eco de la crisis que se vive en la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos, donde se han intensificado las medidas contra los indocumentados. México reforzó con casi 25,000 soldados para evitar que los migrantes crucen hacia el otro lado y la política en los albergues es retener a los viajeros mientras reciben una cita formal para pedir asilo. Pero la velocidad de este método no da buenos resultados.
Ayer por la mañana, dos tumbas comenzaron a ser cavadas en el cementerio La Bermeja, en San Salvador. Empleados del lugar confirmaron que son para Óscar y Valeria, pero dijeron que tanto familiares como miembros del Gobierno, que coordinan la repatriación, han exigido privacidad en el entierro, que podría ser hoy. Una medida que será difícil de cumplir, dado que la atención mundial estará puesta en la llegada de las dos víctimas a su última morada.
A la orilla del río Bravo, hoy yace una rosa.

Texto completo: Area residents will be able to explore the memoir and career of a Midwestern nature lover and scientist this fall through book discussions, nature hikes and other events sponsored by the College of Lake County, thanks to a $15,000 Big Read Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
The grant covers a month-long series of events, from mid-September to mid-October. Activities are centered around "Lab Girl," an award-winning autobiography of Hope Jahren, a Minnesota native who overcame gender stereotypes in science to become one of the world’s leading geobiologists.
Growing up in Austin, Minn., Jahren was interested in trees, flowers, plants and soil since she was a child. "Lab Girl" tells the story of a young woman who finds friendship in odd places, battles bipolar disorder, perseveres through setbacks and becomes a respected scientist and passionate observer of the natural world. Jahren eventually earned a Ph.D. in soil science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1996 and now lives in Oslo, Norway. In 2016, "Lab Girl" was named a New York Times Notable Book and an Amazon Top 20 Best Book.
"CLC is proud to be one of the recipients of this annual grant for The Big Read from the National Endowment for the Arts, and we hope it will bring our whole community together as the college celebrates its 50th anniversary," said CLC President Dr. Lori Suddick. "Lab Girl’ will appeal to diverse audiences and age groups across Lake County, and its themes represent many of CLC’s priorities, including sustainability and diversity. With our college’s growing STEM program, we seek women in the sciences as positive examples for our students."
Studies indicate that reading for pleasure reduces stress, heightens empathy, improves students’ test scores, slows the onset of dementia and results in more active and aware citizens. To view a video of Dr. Suddick’s additional comments regarding the Big Read, visit https://youtu.be/5M9dI8cU1Ro.
The event series will kick off Sept. 18 with a keynote address by Dr. Nancy Tuchman, Dean of the School of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola University. Other events include 10 book discussions at CLC and area libraries, a memoir-writing workshop and panel discussions on sustainability, nature therapy and mental health issues. The Lake County Forest Preserve District, a partner in the project, will offer hikes and workshops on plant identification. Times, dates and locations of these events will be announced later this summer.
Lake County is one of 78 communities nationwide participating in the program. For details on national efforts, visit National Endowment for the Arts at www.arts.gov/national-initiatives/nea-big-read.
Fall classes begin Aug. 19. For information about courses and how to apply and enroll, visit www.clcillinois.edu/fall.

Texto completo: Certainly, Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez must have known that his perilous journey to America would be in vain. Hadn't he heard even before leaving El Salvador in April that people like him and his family were not welcome here?
Why would he sacrifice so much just to end up facedown in the murky waters of the Rio Grande River on the Mexico border with his lifeless 23-month-old daughter's arm draped around his neck?
How could he not have known that granting U.S. asylum to people fleeing danger in Central America is a pipe dream? Did he think that his story of hardship and poverty would somehow elicit more sympathy than those of thousands of weary migrants who had been turned away at the U.S. border before him?
Didn't he realize that the idea of his daughter growing up in a country flush with opportunity was a fairy tale no more realistic than a lonely princess who kisses a frog and turns him into a handsome prince?
Did he think the stories about young children being abused and neglected at detention centers run by the U.S. government were a scare tactic designed to convince foreigners that they would be better off at home?
It is likely that 25-year-old Martinez understood it well. But he came anyway, with his wife, Tania, and daughter, Valeria, because he had no other choice. The disturbing photograph of him floating in the river with his baby's body tenderly nestled underneath his T-shirt tells us so.
Still, some of us lucky enough to have been born in a country where we are taught that even what seems impossible is attainable if we work hard enough might find it difficult to fathom the hopelessness that led Martinez to this river.
We might not entirely understand the desperation of a father willing to risk his family's life for a chance to live the American Dream -- an elusive promise that many Americans know firsthand is a lie. We question why he had to come here.
Maybe some have not heard about how gangs run rampant in El Salvador, targeting women and children, simply because they are the most vulnerable. Maybe some have not read about the open confrontations that occur between criminal gangs and the El Salvadoran government. Perhaps some have not paid attention to the tales of rape, torture, executions and extortion at the hands of violent gangs that have taken over large swaths Martinez' country.
It is likely that Martinez weighed his options carefully and decided that coming to America, even with its hard-line asylum policies, was better than staying in El Salvador. So he quit his job and traveled 1,000 miles, ending up in the river.
From his vantage point in Matamoros, Mexico, the Rio Grande may not have seemed so menacing. Its water was dirty. Trash and beer bottles were floating about, but Martinez likely had not seen the fury of a mighty current like the one that rose up Sunday and swept him and Valeria away.
A month earlier, the river claimed the lives of four migrants, including a 10-month old baby and two other children. Since October, more than 400 migrants, many of them children, have been rescued from the treacherous river. And there are many others who, if the river did not take them, the scorching heat in the valley did.
After waiting two months to apply for asylum, Martinez and his wife had grown desperate, she told news organizations. They were so close to their dream that swimming to the riverbank on the other side of the Rio Grande must have seemed inevitable.
On Sunday, Martinez attempted to swim across with Valeria on his back, tucked under his shirt. His wife followed on the back of a family friend. At some point, she turned back, but Martinez kept going, only to be swept away with his daughter shortly before reaching the banks of Brownsville, Texas, according to the New York Times.
The picture of the two of them, taken by a news photographer after their bodies were discovered downstream the following day, has been held up as a symbol of the great lengths to which migrants will go to live in America. But it also is a reminder of how determined the U.S. government is to keep them out.
Many Americans are saddened and angered that such a tragedy could occur, yet again, on our watch. We have vowed to do something -- anything -- to make it stop.
This is not who we are as a nation, we insist. But regardless of what we say, this is the nation we have become. The proof is in the picture.

Student journalist making headlines

Texto completo: A St. Thomas More Catholic High senior represented her state as the only student-journalist from Louisiana at the annual Al Neuharth Free Spirit and Journalism Conference.
The program is for 51 rising high school seniors — one chosen per state and Washington, D.C. — interested in journalism and who demonstrate qualities of "free spirit."
It is named for the founder of USA Today, The Freedom Forum and Newseum and aims to inspire students to pursue journalism.
STM senior Carlin Sekhani-Matthews, 17, was chosen for the all-expenses-paid journalism conference June 14-20 at the Newseum in D.C. She also received a $1,000 college scholarship.
During her time at STM, Carlin cultivated an interest in broadcast journalism through the school's weekly student-run broadcast — Cougar Cast.
It started three years ago as a club working out of a closet to produce stories for the school. Today, it is a for-credit class with state-of-the-art equipment and much more space in the school's multi-room DREAMS Lab.
Carlin was among the founding members, starting her freshman year as an anchor mostly. She wasn't exactly interested in journalism, though.
"I like to do public speaking," she said, adding that she's a part of STM's speech and debate program. "It was an extension of that."
She's come to love the different aspects that go into putting together an episode. She's anchored, edited, directed and produced, which is her favorite.
"I like calling the shots," she said with a laugh. "... I honestly have found a love for production."
The class is the first hour of the day, allowing for the Friday morning live broadcasts. Students work together during class and after school to pre-produce about two stories a week.
They also stay after on Thursdays to make sure everything is set for the next morning's show.
It's important to TV production advisor Robin Herrington that the students do just about everything themselves. She's there to guide when needed but wants them to get the hands-on experience
"I let them run the show," Herrington said.
Carlin said joining Cougar Cast was one of the best decisions of her high school career.
"It's opened up opportunities," she said, referring to Free Spirit and the scholarship as well as working the giant TV screen during football games.
It also has come with lessons about interviewing administration, speaking and getting it right the first time.
"You don't get another take," Carlin said. "When it's live it's live."
At the journalism conference, she got to network not only with student-journalists from across the country, but also hear from journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, PBS, NPR, ABC News and USA Today.
Many of them talked of perseverance.
"Never give up" she said was a lesson she learned. "To get to the front in line, you have to work hard."
Carlin and the group toured the USA Today newsroom as well as the Capitol and national monuments. She also got a taste of D.C. through its many restaurants.
The experience reminded her of the importance of setting high goals and working hard to achieve them, which are lessons she will apply this year as a senior on Cougar Cast.
"I can't wait to bring it to Cougar Cast, so we can grow it even more than it has," she said.
She hasn't decided on journalism as a career yet, or any career for that matter. As she has another year before college, she's still "a little undecided what path I want to take," but right now she's considering law.
Students entering grades sixth through ninth can get a taste of Cougar Cast with a TV production camp at St. Thomas More July 17-20. Camp is from 8:30 a.m. to noon.
Carlin Sekhani-Matthews, a rising senior at St. Thomas More Catholic High School, was selected as the Louisiana delegate to attend the Al Neuharth Free Spirit and Journalism Conference for high school seniors June 14-20 in Washington, D.C.

Texto completo: What's on TV
100%: JULIAN EDELMAN (2019) 9 p.m. on Showtime. "I'm emotionally pooped, mentally and physically pooped," the New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman told The Times earlier this year, after the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII. The fatigue was not surprising. The victory was the end of a road to recovery that had begun over a year before, when Edelman sustained a serious knee injury. That road -- and Edelman's rise to stardom -- is the subject of this documentary, which features interviews with Edelman's fellow Patriot Tom Brady, Edelman's father, and figures like Mark Wahlberg and Snoop Dogg.
COLLATERAL (2004) 10:40 p.m. on HBO Signature. Jamie Foxx earned two Academy Award nominations for performances in 2004, one for his starring role in the Ray Charles biopic "Ray" and another for his role as a cabdriver named Max in this Michael Mann thriller. (He ended up winning for "Ray.") Late into the Los Angeles night, Max picks up Vincent, played by Tom Cruise, who offers Max big money to drive him around the city. Vincent, it turns out, is a killer for hire -- as becomes evident when a body comes crashing down onto Max's cab, and it is made clear that Max has unwittingly been hired to escort Vincent between hits. Nightclub brawls and pursuits follow. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that, despite the action-movie premise and trappings, the story has depth, and reveals itself to be "a portrait of radically different souls clinging to radically different paths."
What's Streaming
PARIS IS BURNING (1991) Stream on Netflix. Jennie Livingston's influential documentary featured 1980s New York drag ballroom culture and helped lay the groundwork for shows like "RuPaul's Drag Race" and "Pose." Stream it, or better yet see the new restoration, which is currently at Film Forum in New York. "I stepped into a community where people were geniuses at becoming themselves," Livingston told The Times recently, "geniuses at using words and far beyond brilliant at using dance forms to express themselves."
SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1978) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In "Yesterday," the new movie from Danny Boyle, an English singer-songwriter discovers that he's living in a world where nobody remembers that the Beatles existed. "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," the much-maligned musical comedy with covers of songs by the Fab Four, is a movie that many might be happy to forget existed. (In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin concluded that "watching it feels like playing shuffleboard at the absolute insistence of a bossy shipboard social director.") But it's also one that younger fans who have already seen "A Hard Day's Night," "Help!" and "Yellow Submarine" might not be familiar with. And there's at least some fun to be had here: "Yesterday" might have Ed Sheeran playing a version of himself, but only "Sgt. Pepper's" has Alice Cooper playing a cult leader.

Texto completo: The last thing my murdered husband and I talked about was my birthday cake. Not at all unexpected, considering June 28, 2018 - the now infamous date of the Capital Gazette shootings - was my birthday.
I recall the morning vividly. Warm - but not muggy enough to prevent me from tiptoeing downstairs to make coffee and assume my perch in one of the new Adirondack chairs Rob had assembled the week before.
A high school English teacher about a week into the summer, I enjoyed the quiet as well as the luxury of actually getting to read rather than skim the New York Times. I knew Rob would be sleeping in another half-hour or so. He'd long ago determined that a later start helped him avoid the traffic backups he endured for the commute from Timonium to Annapolis, where he worked as assistant editor at The Capital. That drive took more than an hour - on a good day.
Soon enough Rob appeared on the deck, freshly showered and smelling of Kenneth Cole Reaction cologne with a touch of Johnson's Baby Powder. The 6-foot, 5-inch Norwegian dragged the sliding door to the deck shut and then sashayed in my direction. As anyone who has attended a wedding reception or mitzvah with Rob and Maria Hiaasen knows, Rob was willing to dance, but his ability to do so was questionable. Nonetheless, arms akimbo, he performed a little birthday dance and sang an original birthday tune, a sort of mash-up of the Beatles' "Birthday" and Lord-knows-what.
We shared a laugh. He adjourned for his coffee. And, when he returned to the deck, he got to the day's essential questions.
"What will the birthday girl do today?"
"Eye exam at 10 a.m. Swimming laps later."
"Will you treat yourself to lunch out?"
"Doubtful. But I might pick up Graul's shrimp salad."
"Do you want to open your birthday present now or later?"
"Later. Duh. We'll have more time."
I remember we talked briefly about whether he'd get out of the office that day for a much-needed haircut. Rob's wavy hair had started to protrude above his ears in Bozo the Clown fashion, and I told him I hoped he could get to his 2 p.m. appointment.
"No way that's happening," he said. "Going to cancel it. Too many people out on vacation."
Off to the kitchen, we went. I made his turkey sandwich. He gathered his usual snacks: a banana, some strawberry yogurt, pretzels, Nilla Wafers. I walked him to the garage, kissed him good-bye, and said what I always said during those summer days when I was home to see him off.
"I love you. Be safe."
So began what I assumed would be an innocuous birthday. Turning 58 as I was last year was no great shakes. I had even told Rob he should skip ordering a birthday cake. We didn't need the calories. But then as I bought my shrimp salad, I caught sight of Graul's voluptuous buttercream-frosted, yellow cakes. That's why I called Rob around noon - to tell him about my change of heart.
He answered brusquely.
"You're busy. Sorry. Just calling about the possibility of birthday cake."
The conversation probably didn't last a full minute.
"I can't talk right now. Actual news has broken out here. Paddleboarder missing and presumed dead. A veteran. Double amputee."
"No worries! I'll order it for Sunday when we have the kids over."
And I did. Minutes later, Rob emailed from work to apologize for being so curt, but he didn't need to. I totally understood the pressure he felt. A former cop reporter in South Florida, I remember frantic newsrooms vividly.
While it's true that cop reporting and high school English teaching have girded me for all sorts of challenges, nothing prepared me for what I faced in the coming days. Fathoming the heinous crime and the senseless loss of lives. Signing forms authorizing Rob's cremation. Staring at the date Rob was murdered on a death certificate.
How could it be that the same date I came into the world had become the date my loving husband left it? I wanted no part of my birthday - or anyone's, for that matter.
In the midst of all the anguish the day after the shootings, I managed to remember the doggone cake, and I canceled it. Days later, before my daughter Hannah returned to her home in Brooklyn, N.Y., I opened the gift bag Rob had left for me.
Contents: note cards and a pair of coasters bearing scenes of the Chesapeake Bay; a book about Key West, a place we planned a return trip to; and a journal, which I presume Rob figured I'd use to develop some ideas for writing since I had quit advising my high school's student newspaper.
I put all but the journal away and gave myself permission to forget everybody's birthday - forever.
Dodging birthday talk took a little effort. Once school resumed in September, I not only skipped the how-was-your-summer English department meeting, I later ducked out of discussions on how we'd supply sweets to mark each English teacher's birthday.
Months passed. Well-meaning friends and acquaintances presented me with unsolicited suggestions.
"You could have my birthday if you wanted to," one friend offered.
Nope. That's yours.
"You could celebrate 6 months from June 28," someone else said.
Too close to Christmas.
"You could pick a random day." Just no.
I had more important concerns, such as surviving, ensuring my kids were OK, navigating the holidays, and speaking out about gun violence. And let's get real. It's not as if I'm a kid anticipating sweet 16 or the legal drinking age. My birthday just seemed ridiculously frivolous.
What's more, June - once the sweetest month for me because of my anniversary (June 22) as well as my birthday - now became the cruelest. Instead of counting down the days until the end of the school year, I focused on June's unique challenges - how to accommodate my three adult children's needs on Father's Day and how to appropriately commemorate the passage of a full year since the Capital Gazette shootings.
But those who love me had other concerns this June. It began with a birthday card that arrived Monday from Debby, my dear aunt who is too young to be my aunt (that's always how I introduce her). "While I might not celebrate your birthday on the actual day, I will always celebrate your birth," she wrote. "Thinking of you always."
A few other cards arrived the next day, including one from dear friends in California, a husband and wife Rob introduced to each other back in the '90s during his time at The Baltimore Sun. "Celebrating you," their elegant card said. A noteworthy detail here: Mike, the husband in this duo, is responsible for making this June 28 Read Rob Day.
And then, on Wednesday, during a lunch that followed a shopping mission with my dear friend Patty, in need of an ensemble for her daughter's bridal shower, it happened. I felt joy. I felt loved. And I felt like celebrating. The sauvignon blanc we ordered with oysters probably contributed. Regardless, I declared June 26 my new birthday.
Hours later this Wonder Woman of a friend lured me to a favorite sushi restaurant for dinner with her family surprised me with a cake.
Yes, I blew out a candle (just one). But no, the cake wasn't buttercream from Graul's. Patty chose a small Wegmans chocolate cake with coconut macaroons on the side, something different for a new birthday.

Texto completo: The money Argosy University had in the bank when it closed won’t all be used to repay students and taxpayers for financial aid the school used inappropriately.
Instead, much of the $4.4 million the institution had on hand could go to the court-appointed receiver and attorneys overseeing the wind-down of the for-profit college chain after its financial collapse.
In May, a federal judge was asked to approve more than $2 million in fees and expenses for those firms. The request includes $973,000 in legal fees and $28,000 in expenses for Dottore Cos., the firm acting as the schools’ receiver, essentially its financial steward.
Sunflower, one of the companies Argosy owes money to, criticized the request for fees and expenses as “exorbitant and excessive” in a legal challenge filed June 12.
Betsy Talbot, Minnesota Office of Higher Education manager of institutional registration and licensing, agreed with that characterization. Talbot is one of the state officials working to recover money Argosy received that was supposed to go to students.
“The receiver, who is supposed to be acting in the best interests of the company, should not be billing in such a manner,” Talbot said in a phone interview.
Representatives from Dottore Cos. did not return a call seeking comment Wednesday. Officials in state Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office declined to discuss their efforts to recoup money from Argosy.
The school owed Minnesota students $1.3 million when it suddenly closed in March. Students at the Eagan campus were left without financial aid they were expecting to cover living and other expenses and had to scramble to find schools to continue their studies.
The chain of for-profit schools closed campuses nationwide after it lost access to federal financial aid because it used $13 million meant for students to cover payroll and other operating costs. Students, states and creditors the chain owes money to are now fighting in court to recoup their loses.
MINNESOTA MONEY
Much of what Argosy owed Minnesota students came from federal financial aid. State leaders do hope to recover about $181,000 worth of state loans and grants the school never provided to students.
About $62,000 of that money is in a restricted bank account that state officials hope the court will turn over, Talbot said. The rest would have to come from whatever cash Argosy has remaining that is now under the control of the receiver.
“It would be inappropriate to use those funds for anything other than the original intended purpose,” Talbot said of the state financial aid students were due to pay for things like food, rent and child care.
The size of the request for fees and reimbursement by the receiver and attorneys was first reported Monday by the New York Times, which noted students and creditors of Argosy had expressed frustration over the amount. Mark Dottore, who leads the Cleveland-based firm, defended the request as appropriate for the work involved.
Roughly 1,000 students were enrolled at Argosy when it closed. A number of state and private schools stepped in to help students.
LOAN HELP AND FORGIVENESS
In May, Minnesota lawmakers approved legislation to help Argosy students by sending them the loan and grant money the school failed to provide. State officials hope to eventually recoup that $181,000 from the school.
The U.S. Department of Education is expected to quickly forgive recent federal loans and aid students received to attend Argosy because of the sudden way in which the school closed. That’s not the case for many students who attended other for-profit schools that closed. Globe University and the Minnesota School of Business as well as ITT Tech and Corinthian College campuses have been shuttered in recent years.
Many students who attend those schools are still waiting to recoup money or have federal student loans forgiven. Last week, Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota joined her Democratic colleagues in asking U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to expedite the processing of loan-forgiveness requests.
Smith said more than 2,700 Minnesotans have waited an average of 882 days to have their loan-forgiveness requests processed.
“It is time for your cruel delays to end and for you to provide federal student loan discharges to which defrauded borrowers are entitled under the law;” the letter to DeVos says, “the courts have ordered it, students are begging for it, Congress expects it, and justice demands it.”

No more ‘poverty naps’ on campus

Texto completo: When college students return to their campuses in the fall, many will face a growing problem that threatens to undermine their chances for success. Hunger. Recent surveys agree that more than one-third of all college students suffer at times from bouts of food insecurity. The rate is far higher for students with an extra risk factor: belonging to a racial minority, having a single parent or being the first in their family to attend college, for example.
A New York Times report on local campuses told these stories: "A senior at Lehman College in the Bronx dreams of starting her day with breakfast. An undergraduate at New York University said he has been so delirious from hunger he’s caught himself walking down the street not realizing where he’s going. A health sciences student at Stony Brook University on Long Island describes ‘poverty naps,’ where she decides to go to sleep rather than deal with her hunger pangs."
In one sense, the problem reflects good news: the growing diversity of student bodies, from both racial and socioeconomic perspectives. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office says only 29% of those now in college are "traditional students," who enroll right out of high school and depend on their parents for support. The rest, especially in community colleges, can be older, and financially fragile — often with children of their own. But federal aid programs have not kept up with this changing profile and rising need. Forty years ago, Pell grants, the main source of public support for needy students, covered half the average cost at two-year colleges and 39% at public four-year colleges. Today, according to statistics from the Department of Education, those rates have dropped to 37% at community schools and 19% at bigger universities.
The result could be called the "hunger gap," which Steve sees firsthand at George Washington University, where he has taught for almost 30 years. The way the federal government calculates a student’s annual need is woefully inadequate, and even students with "full rides" can have trouble affording full meals.
One answer is a rapid expansion of campus-based food banks. Many campuses have tried other innovations. Programs called Share Meals and Swipe Out Hunger enable students to donate their unused dining hall credits to hungry classmates. There are more. One critical change would involve SNAP, the federal nutrition program once known as food stamps. Its rules regarding student eligibility remain highly restrictive and confusing, and the GAO reports that about 2 million students who could have qualified for aid in 2017 did not receive it.
Simplifying the rules and extending eligibility to more students makes total sense. But the Trump administration is actually trying to reduce the program and eliminate recipients, even as the need continues to grow. That’s both profoundly immoral and utterly counterproductive. Programs to combat hunger easily pay for themselves: Students who don’t have to worry about food do better in school, graduate at higher rates and are more likely to become productive, taxpaying citizens.
The public policy goal should be completely clear and compelling: No more growling stomachs in classrooms. No more "poverty naps" instead of lunch.

We can't turn away from crisis on border

Texto completo: Like many people, I spent the weekend enjoying the beautiful weather - in my case, with my 4-year-old toddler and 8-week-old newborn. During late night feedings and naps, though, I also spent hours on social media. I shared happy pictures of my babies, but also, in a heartbreaking juxtaposition, pored over the latest news from the border.
For those who haven't read about it, multiple news outlets, from the New York Times to Fox News, reported that hundreds of children as young as 2 are being held in inhumane conditions. They are in overcrowded cells, without soap or toothbrushes, without diapers or clean clothes, sleeping on cold floors with the lights on all night. Older children are doing their best to comfort other children they have only just met. Attorneys from the Justice Department argued that none of this violated their legal duty to provide "safe and sanitary" conditions for children.
Beyond the latest reports, we also know that thousands of children have been separated from their parents and that there have been thousands of reports of sexual assault and abuse in these detention facilities. In the past year alone, at least seven children have died in detention - after a decade of no deaths.
We have all heard the grotesque stories of children in the U.S. being held captive in basements, sexually abused and tortured by strangers and family members alike. I know we recoil at these stories, usually recounted in tearful interviews with People magazine or special reports on television. Who among us, if we knew this was happening, would decline to help one of these children? And yet, this kind of horrific treatment is happening on a mass scale, perpetrated by our very own government. And maddeningly, we have known about it for at least a year.
As I read report after report, I felt increasingly saddened, enraged and frustrated at the overwhelming scope of the problem and my own humble ability to do anything meaningful to affect change. My frustration grew worse as I searched phrases like "how to help migrant children" and "protests for migrant children," only to see articles from exactly a year ago, when there was a public outcry that resulted in Families Belong Together marches across the country. There were only a handful of search results from this year. How, in a whole year, has this continued?
This crisis should be front-page news and front of mind daily. We cannot forget that this is not normal, not something to be turned away from because the images and stories are too sad to bear and seemingly beyond our control. We must continue seeking information about how to address this crisis in any and every way possible.
For me, that means making humble donations to organizations that are providing legal representation nationally, like the ACLU and RAICES and humanitarian aid, like Kino Border Initiative, the International Rescue Committee and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service - the latter two of which have offices and employees right here in Baltimore. As someone who has worked in the nonprofit sector my entire career, I know that even the smallest of gifts (and believe me, with two children, mine are small!) are welcomed gratefully.
For me, addressing this crisis means desperately Googling protests like Lights for Liberty, which will hold candlelight vigils at border facilities and the U.S. Capitol Building on the evening of July 12. It means building relationships with other concerned citizens to ensure that we're thinking of every possible way to help. It means writing daily letters to our elected representatives, who have been far too quiet on this issue. It means posting regularly on social media to keep the conversation alive. And, it means writing an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun.
Whether you agree with current asylum laws (and it is federal law that immigrants have a legal right to seek asylum), surely we must all agree that no fellow human - much less a child - deserves this kind of treatment. We cannot turn away.

Texto completo: Topeka Police Chief Bill Cochran has a message for local residents who have grown frustrated that no arrests have been made in the April 28 shooting death of Washburn University football player Dwane Simmons.
The police department, Cochran said, empathizes.
However, Cochran also wants Topekans to know that he believes an arrest in the Simmons investigation — a probe that remains “very active” — is potentially only one piece of information away.
“My message to the public would be this: We understand your frustration,” Cochran said Wednesday during an exclusive interview with The Topeka Capital-Journal. “We’re frustrated too, but we feel very confident where we’re at in the investigation and I want the citizens of Topeka to know that we’re working diligently on it and we’re making progress on it.
“This would be one of those cases where I would ask the people to allow the processes to work, and if we allow the processes to work then we’re going to make sure it’s done properly, handled correctly. Again, like I said, we don’t want to rush into something
that will then in the long run jeopardize the case, which then will upset or frustrate people even more. So we’ve got to make sure that we’re methodical, we’re diligent and we present a very chargeable case to the (district attorney’s) office.”
Cochran said he was hopeful a $ 5,000 award announced Tuesday by Shawnee County Crime Stoppers might shake loose the elusive piece of information that detectives need to make an arrest.
Simmons, 23, a senior defensive back on Washburn University’s football team from Lee’s Summit, Mo., was shot and killed about 12:30 a.m. April 28 near S.W. 13th and Lane, where a large party had taken place to celebrate former Ichabod safety Corey Ballentine being selected in the sixth round of the NFL Draft hours earlier by the New York Giants.
Ballentine suffered a gunshot wound in the same incident and was hospitalized for a short time before being released. He has since joined the Giants in New York.
Simmons’ death, meanwhile, shook the Topeka community, particularly his fellow students, faculty and staff members on the Washburn campus. The death made national news the night of the shooting. Nearly two months later, it continues to be in the national news, as a story appeared Monday in the New York Times.
On Wednesday, Cochran said police detectives have developed some solid leads in the case, to the point of identifying “persons of interest.”
However, he said police want to ensure that they have enough concrete evidence before making an arrest so that charges can be filed by Shawnee County District Attorney Michael Kagay.
What police don’t want in the high-profile case, Cochran said, is to make an arrest, then to have the person or persons released from jail because of insufficient evidence to file charges.
Cochran said that after it was announced Tuesday that an anonymous person, identified only as a Washburn University supporter, had offered an additional $ 5,000 to Crime Stoppers for information leading to an arrest, some members of the public may have gotten the mistaken impression that the investigation had turned into a “cold case.”
“Nothing could be farther from the truth,” Cochran said.
Crime Stoppers offers rewards of up to $ 2,000 in any case in which information leads to a felony arrest and conviction. Coupled with the additional $ 5,000 donation, the potential reward in the Simmons case rose to $ 7,000.
In the midst of their investigation, Topeka police continue to work closely with the Washburn University football coaching staff, the Washburn University Police Department and the victims’ families.
Cochran said there remains no reason to believe that Simmons and Ballentine were engaged in any criminal activity when they were wounded, but rather that the shots were fired when the football players “crossed paths” with the wrong people.
While many people were at the party that night in a house four blocks north of the Washburn campus, there were few witnesses to what transpired, Cochran said.
That only adds to the frustration level, Cochran admitted.
“All four of us (Topeka police, the families, Washburn football and the public) feel a sense of frustration because it’s one of those cases that there appeared to be a lot of witnesses to the incident,” Cochran said. “But a lot of that comes down to there weren’t really witnesses to the incident — they were present and saw the aftermath of the incident.
“With that being said, there were still people we’re confident that saw, that still may have that one last piece. So frustration level is understandable, especially when you have such a high-profile case as this. It’s gotten a lot of media attention. It got national media attention. The frustrations do mount.”
A neighborhood resident told the New York Times that “it sounded like a war zone” with all the gunfire that erupted. That person estimated 40 rounds were fired. However, Cochran on Wednesday said investigators located 18 spent shell casings at the scene.
As they close in on the two-month anniversary of the shooting, Cochran said, police are doggedly pursuing any lead, any bit of information that might lead to an arrest.
He said it isn’t uncommon for arrests in homicide cases to take six months to a year.
After a case in 2018 in which two men were arrested in connection with a woman’s death in East Topeka and were subsequently released on two separate occasions, Cochran said, police want to make sure any arrests made in Simmons’ slaying are water-tight.
Anyone with information may leave anonymous tips by calling Shawnee County Crime Stoppers at 785-234-0007.

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Florida on Tuesday to launch a national "Latinos for Trump" initiative in a bid to bolster support for the Republican ticket at time when polling shows large majorities of Hispanics favoring the election of a Democratic president next year.
During an event staged in Miami, the city hosting the first of the Democratic presidential debates this week, Pence called President Trump "a great champion of Latino and Hispanic Americans" and said the new group is "one of the most important coalitions of the 2020 campaign."
Florida, home to more than 2 million Hispanic registered voters, is a key state for Trump's reelection fortunes. His immigration policies and rhetoric on the subject have drawn pointed criticism from many Latinos.
Pence largely sought to make the case for voting Republican next year on economic issues, pointing to a decline in the Hispanic unemployment rate since Trump took office.
Later in his remarks, Pence touched on Trump's efforts to "secure the border," prompting chants of "build the wall" — a reference to the president's long-promised barrier along the Mexico border.
Miami was among the cities that Trump targeted for sweeping raids when he announced a plan last week to remove "the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States." Although he subsequently postponed the raids, the threat was among the latest of his policies to alienate many in the Latino community.
The administration's practice of separating migrant families has also been highly unpopular. And Trump sparred with officials in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 about a federal response that many on the island and elsewhere viewed as less robust than those in hurricane-damaged states on the mainland.
Polling released this week by Telemundo showed Trump facing head winds among Hispanic voters in several states.
In Florida, only 34 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 56 percent would prefer to replace him with a Democrat, said the survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy.
The numbers were even less favorable to Trump elsewhere.
In California, 26 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 66 percent would prefer a Democrat. In Texas, 25 percent would like to see him returned to office, while 69 percent want a Democrat.
Republicans involved in the "Latinos for Trump" initiative express hope that he can build on his performance among Hispanics in 2016. Trump won 28 percent of the Latino vote nationally then, according to exit polling, while Democrat Hillary Clinton won 66 percent.
Washington Post
In reversal, McConnell vows a vote on 9/11 fund
WASHINGTON — Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to call a vote on a bill ensuring that a victims' compensation fund for the Sept. 11 attacks never runs out of money.
McConnell made the commitment after meeting Tuesday with a group of first responders. "We want to try to deal with (the legislation) before the August recess," the Kentucky Republican told ABC News.
The meeting came two weeks after comedian Jon Stewart, a longtime advocate for 9/11 responders, offered withering criticism of Congress at a public hearing at the Capitol that was attended by uniformed firefighters and police officers but few lawmakers.
McConnell now has "a sense of urgency" about the bill, said John Feal, a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site and a longtime activist.
Associated Press
In new plan, Warren seeks to safeguard federal elections
WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Tuesday released a far-reaching plan that would create new standards for how federal elections are carried out across the country, part of an effort to protect voting rights and make it easier for Americans to vote.
Warren unveiled her plan hours before holding a campaign event in South Florida, a place that has had ample experience with election controversy.
As part of her proposal, intended to expand voting access and strengthen election security, Warren would create a federal agency, the Secure Democracy Administration. She would replace every voting machine across the country with modern equipment and would require the use of a uniform federal ballot. All states would be required to have automatic voter registration and same-day registration, early voting, and voting by mail.
Elections in the United States are run in a decentralized manner, with rules and procedures that vary on the state and local level. Warren is calling for the federal government to play a much larger role, creating standards for federal elections that states would need to follow.
Under her plan, Warren would make Election Day a holiday, and she would restore voting rights for formerly incarcerated people nationwide.
The senator would also seek to end partisan gerrymandering by requiring states to use independent panels to draw congressional district lines, and she would restrict states from removing voters from election rolls.
Warren said she would allocate roughly $20 billion over 10 years to pay for her plan. She said that cost could be covered with proceeds from her proposed “Ultramillionaire Tax," which would impose an annual tax on a household's assets above $50 million.

Texto completo: The NBA is considering reducing its 82-game season, ESPN reported Wednesday.
A committee with about a dozen top team basketball and business operations executives had a conference call June 17 to explore alternative scheduling ideas for the 2021-22 season. In addition to shortening the season, executives brainstormed ideas around introducing in-season tournaments and a postseason play-in tournament for what will be the league's 75th season.
Commissioner Adam Silver told the New York Times in May that he was interested in both tournament concepts after studying their benefits in European soccer, but this is the first report of those being officially explored.
The committee that met doesn’t have governing authority and simply makes recommendations to the NBA’s Board of Governors. However, if eventually introduced, the reforms would be implemented as a pilot program, giving the NBA a trial run of sorts.

There are concerns about how reducing games would affect the revenue of teams, which make money from attendance and have commitments to broadcast and advertising partners, but executives hope the tournaments could, over time, make up for such losses.
The reduction of games was only considered as a way to supplement proposed tournaments, but the idea to do so has been a topic of interest around the league for some time.
Over the past few seasons, NBA teams have rested star players more and more to reduce the risk of injury during the regular season, which spans from October to April. The Toronto Raptors had Kawhi Leonard sit out certain games for “maintenance” during the regular season, and come June he led the team to its first championship and was named the Finals MVP.
According to ESPN, the number of games to potentially be reduced varied widely from just a few to trimming the season to 58 games — which would ensure each team could host the other 29 at least once. Though different options were discussed on the call, ESPN reports team officials weren’t in favor of a major reduction of games.
No decision is expected to be made for some time and nothing can be implemented without the agreement of numerous parties, including the players union, stakeholders, ownership groups, broadcast partners and sponsors, among others.

Opinion: Not everybody is supporting US women's team in 2019 World Cup quest

Texto completo: With Spain in the rear-view mirror and France on the horizon, most American sports fans and others who are paying attention are all on board as the U. S. women’s national soccer team continues its quest to win its fourth World Cup.
Most, but not all. There’s one fellow in particular who is sounding rather grumpy about the red, white and blue.
Oddly, it’s the U. S. president.
Donald Trump unleashed a rambling tweetstorm against co-captain Megan Rapinoe Wednesday morning just two days after he was asked in an interview with The Hill political website if her choice to stand at attention with her hands clasped behind her and not sing the national anthem during the World Cup is appropriate.
Trump's reply: “No. I don’t think so. ”
Wait. What? That’s not appropriate anymore? I was always taught that was a perfect way to honor the flag, the anthem and the country. I wasn’t a good singer, but I certainly knew how to stand ramrod straight and be silent. Apparently, we have all new rules now, people.
Rapinoe, who knelt during the national anthem nearly three years ago as a gesture of solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, and who has spoken eloquently about the serious issues facing this country, is not kneeling now. Her choice to stand silently during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner means that she is far more respectful of the anthem and the flag than the thousands of people at sporting events every year who walk the concourse or talk while in line for beers or otherwise don’t stand still or have any notion about what’s going on.
When the reporter asked Trump about Rapinoe, he could have brushed off the question. He did not. No, he willingly inserted himself into the conversation about this World Cup. He probably couldn’t stand that the openly gay Rapinoe, like millions of other Americans, has been critical of him, calling herself a “walking protest” of Trump’s policies. So he just had to say something negative about the woman who scored both goals on penalty kicks in the tense 2-1 U. S. victory over Spain Monday.
Trump also was asked about the U. S. team’s gender discrimination lawsuit against its national governing body, U. S. Soccer, but suggested he didn’t have enough knowledge about the issue to take a position.
"I love watching women’s soccer,” he said. “They’re really talented. I think a lot of it also has to do with the economics. I mean who draws more, where is the money coming in. I know that when you have the great stars like (Portugal’s Cristiano) Ronaldo and some of these stars … that get paid a lot of money, but they draw hundreds of thousands of people. But I haven’t taken a position on that at all. I’d have to look at it. ”
Of all the names Trump could have pulled out of the air to illustrate a point that gets harder to make every day with the financial success of the U. S. women’s team, he chose a Portuguese man, not an American – and a man who is facing an allegation of sexual assault and a federal lawsuit stemming from a 2009 incident in Las Vegas. How big of a deal is this allegation? The New York Times reported that Juventus, the Italian soccer league team for whom Ronaldo plays, wouldn’t participate in a tournament in the United States this summer to avoid the risk that Ronaldo would be detained by authorities as part of the rape investigation.
Wouldn’t you know that it would be his name that Trump would mention for a comparison with the most beloved U. S. national team, male or female, in any sport over the past 20 years? In a week when the nation is cheering on Rapinoe and her teammates, he’s name-dropping Ronaldo. Somehow, that makes perfect sense.

Texto completo: Alla Ausheva, la madre asesinada en Nueva York junto a sus dos bebés, crimen presuntamente causado por su pareja y colega militar, había recibido su nacionalidad estadounidense durante una ceremonia en la Casa Blanca el 4 de julio de 2012, junto al entonces presidente Barack Obama.
Ausheva (37) y sus hijos Iván (2) y Elia Walker (3) fueron encontrados muertos el sábado en su casa de Staten Island.
La mujer había obtenido una orden de protección contra el padre de los niños, Shane Walker (36), pero ya no estaba vigente, informó The New York Times.
Según una denuncia penal presentada en el Tribunal Penal de Staten Island, Walker inició un incendio en la casa de la pareja en Palisade Street alrededor de las 3 p.m. del viernes cuando “sabía” que Ausheva y los niños estaban dentro.
Aparentemente Ausheva murió apuñalada en el cuello y los niños fueron ahogados.
Ausheva se mudó de San Petersburgo (Rusia) a Queens (NYC) en 2011 y pronto se unió a la Guardia Nacional del Ejército de Nueva York. En 2014 se trasladó a la Guardia Nacional Aérea. Actualmente estaba sirviendo a tiempo completo en una fuerza de seguridad nacional con base en Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, según una portavoz militar citada por Pix11.
Su pareja, detenido por el crimen, también estaba activo en la Guardia Nacional Aérea. Esta mañana fue formalmente acusado de asesinato, homicidio involuntario, incendio premeditado y posesión criminal de un arma.
“Todos ustedes hicieron algo profundo: eligieron servir”, dijo entonces el presidente Barack Obama a los 25 militares durante la ceremonia de naturalización en 2012. “Te pones el uniforme de un país que aún no es completamente tuyo. Usted mostraron los valores que celebramos cada 4 de julio: deber, responsabilidad y patriotismo”.
Ausheva también era una cantante aficionada, en inglés y ruso.

Texto completo: The New York City Council came down on the Taxi and Limousine Commission on Monday after one lawmaker located a formal warning that medallion loans may leave countless drivers mired in debt.
City Councilman Ritchie Torres began the Council's oversight hearing into the extreme taxi medallion loan speculation by announcing that his office obtained the findings of a report - given to the TLC in 2011 - that looked into medallion prices and the loans used by drivers to purchase them at auctions during the late '90s and 2000s. Analyst Gary Roth predicted that more medallion owners would experience ballooning payments greater than the value of the medallion's original price and that medallion value would depreciate.
"In this case, owners may default on their loan, and have the medallion repossessed by the bank. If there were large number of repossessions, it could cause the major financers to go into default, and put a damper on sales," the memo read.
Acting TLC Commissioner Bill Heinzen testified Monday that he and other TLC administrators had not read the Roth report until last week. It was first reported by The New York Times last month. He repeatedly said he could not speak for former administrators or their actions and noted that the scope of the agency's jurisdiction is limited when it comes to loans.
"TLC licenses and regulates medallion owners, but it does not regulate the lending industry, including banks and credit unions who wrote, refinanced and hold medallion loans," Heinzen said.
Torres, however, called Heinzen's reasoning weak, especially since the TLC has had a copy of the report since 2011 and continued to promote medallion auctions to the public up until 2014.
"The city has the same perverse incentives as the predatory loaners and speculators. They are willing to destabilize the market to generate short-term revenue," he said.
Taxi drivers and advocates have been reporting that an increasing number of cabbies have experienced financial ruin over lower revenues and increasing costs, especially related to medallion loan payments. Bhairavi Desai, the president of the New York Taxi Alliance, which represents drivers in the city, estimated that the average net income for a driver last year was a negative $24,904.
Several drivers have committed suicide and others are working more hours just to stay afloat, she testified.
"Every single person in the city of New York should feel great shame when you look into that taxi and it's a man or woman in their late 60s or 70s. That is unbelievable, because their retirement was stolen," Desai testified.
Mouhamadou Aliyu, a driver who bought his medallion with a loan at a 2004 auction, gave emotional testimony in which he revealed he has thought about suicide because of his mounting debt but has continued to drive to support his wife and four children.
"I'm doing everything for them, and today everything is being taking away from me. I don't understand what is going on in this city," he said.
Heinzen apologized for TLC's role in the medallion mortgage crisis. He said the agency is providing mental health services through the city's Thrive NYC initiative and has worked with the city to reduce fees and regulations to help drivers.
"We do hear it, it does affect us very deeply. All of these stories, and the pain that the families are feeling ... it is devastating, it can be overwhelming," he said.
Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the TLC and Department of Consumer Affairs to investigate predatory practices behind taxi medallion purchases and their results are scheduled to be made public next month.
The council is also reviewing four bills aimed at giving the TLC new requirements and resources to curb the loan crisis and provide drivers with relief.
One would require the TLC to receive annual financial disclosures that include all revenue, expenses and debt from all drivers while another would require the agency to review all documents related to medallion loans.
Another bill would require the TLC to review taxi brokers, agents and licensees for any misconduct and gives the agency the power to revoke the licenses if there is any fraud. The fourth bill would set up an "office of financial stability," which would issue annual reports on the state of the industry.

Taxi Officials Blasted for High Medallion Prices

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The New York City Council excoriated the city officials who oversee the taxi industry on Monday, blaming them for a financial crisis that has ruined drivers and releasing a document that lawmakers said showed the officials knew for years that a disaster was looming.
The document, a memo written by a city employee in late 2010 or early 2011, described how the price of the city permit that allows a driver to own their cab -- called a medallion -- had skyrocketed to unsustainable levels. It also warned that in order to buy the permit, some drivers were taking out loans they could not afford.
A few years after the memo was written, the reckless loans helped cause medallion prices to crash, leaving thousands of immigrant drivers deeply in debt.
The New York Times first revealed the existence of the memo last month in an investigation on the crisis in the industry, but the city had refused to release it, claiming it did not exist.
On Monday, it became a key talking point in an emotional hearing at City Hall. The City Council's oversight and transportation committees sharply questioned the leaders of the city Taxi and Limousine Commission about the Times's findings.
Councilman Ritchie Torres, a Bronx Democrat who leads the oversight committee, said the investigation and newly obtained records showed that city officials turned a blind eye to artificial inflation of medallion prices and predatory lending practices because they were focused on making money by selling overpriced medallions for up to $ 1 million apiece.
"The collapse of the medallion market, properly understood, should be remembered as one of the greatest government scandals in the history of New York City," Mr. Torres said in his opening statement. "The medallion market collapse is a cautionary tale of what happens when both government and markets are governed not by laws but by greed."
Taxi industry leaders have denied wrongdoing, saying regulators approved their practices. They have blamed the crisis on unforeseen competition from ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.
The outgoing acting leader of the city taxi commission, Bill Heinzen, apologized to a group of several dozen cabbies who attended the hearing and testified about their financial difficulties. But he insisted the city was not as responsible as the lenders and the banking regulators who supervised them.
"I accept responsibility for what the T.L.C. has done, for what I have done, to make this crisis worse," Mr. Heinzen said. "I have tried to explain today my belief that other people are also responsible."
Mr. Heinzen deflected the Council's questions about the memo, saying that he was not leading the commission when it was written.
The hearing marked the first time that city officials have acknowledged the city's role in the financial crisis, which has rocked the industry amid a series of suicides by drivers. It also was the first time city lawmakers have asked commission officials about their oversight failures.
The Times investigation found that a handful of taxi industry leaders artificially inflated medallion prices and made hundreds of millions of dollars by channeling immigrant buyers into reckless loans. Prices rose to $ 1 million in 2014 from $ 200,000 in 2002, while lenders adopted tactics similar to those in the housing crash, issuing loans with exploitative terms to low-income drivers who could not afford them.
After the bubble burst and medallion prices crashed starting in late 2014, more than 950 medallion owners filed for bankruptcy. Thousands more are struggling to survive.
In the weeks since The Times investigation, the state attorney general has opened an inquiry into the lending practices; the mayor has launched an investigation of the brokers who arranged medallion loans; and the city has agreed to waive up to $ 10 million in fees owed by taxi drivers and to establish a driver assistance center to help struggling cabbies.
Several members of the City Council also have proposed four pieces of legislation to strengthen regulations and to attempt to stop a medallion bubble from happening again. Monday's hearing was scheduled in part to discuss those bills, but it quickly turned into a heated interrogation.
Mr. Torres set up a projector and posted images of advertisements that the city had produced when it was selling medallions at auctions. In one, the city said medallions were "better than the stock market." In another, it said medallions were a path to a "worry-free retirement."
"Was that misleading?" Mr. Torres asked.
Mr. Heinzen repeatedly declined to answer questions.
"I can't speak to the past," he said. He joined the commission in 2015.
Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, a Manhattan Democrat who leads the transportation committee, asked about the city's enforcement actions against unscrupulous brokers, leading Mr. Heinzen to acknowledge the city had not revoked the license of any brokers in recent history.
"This is a moral outrage," said Mr. Rodriguez, who pledged to hold many more hearings on the issue. "We need to fix it now."
The taxi drivers in attendance echoed similar themes in testimonies. Some of the drivers were allowed to testify before the city officials, and they used their time to share horror stories about their loans and struggles.
One driver, Mouhamadou Aliyu, said he emigrated from the Ivory Coast to New York in 1993, started driving a taxi and eventually bought a medallion. Now, he said, he is $ 700,000 in debt.
Mr. Aliyu said he contemplated suicide every day.
"What's happening in the industry is not American," he said. "It's not New York. I can even say it's not humane. It's brutal."

Texto completo: New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said he believed the publication was "overly cautious" with allegations by writer E. Jean Carroll that President Trump raped her in the mid-1990s.
The New York Times Reader Center, a section of the publication that gives behind-the-scenes information on the site's reporting, confronted top editors with reader concerns that the site's coverage of Carroll's accusations "showed too much deference to the president's denials."
Baquet denied that Trump had anything to do with the publication's coverage but said they were "overly cautious" with how they handled the story. He said the New York Times should have prominently displayed the story on the home page with a headline.
Baquet said the fact that the allegation was made against a sitting president "should’ve compelled us to play it bigger."
Carroll claimed Friday that Trump had sexually assaulted her in 1995 or 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room. The allegation was part of an excerpt from her new book What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, which is being released on July 2.

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (now in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones.
Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people ... as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize ... a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs.
Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s "Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.'"
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.

Abortion debate marks crossroads of values and beliefs

Texto completo: Ever since July 4, 1776, American's have had a special reverence for the Declaration of Independence. It has been called America's birth certificate. Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration, said it was "an expression of the American mind."
Contained within the Declaration are some of the most quoted words in the English language: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness...." These are the values on which America was founded.
If the sincerity of one's beliefs is measured in terms of what a person is willing to put at risk, the signers risked everything: their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. By placing their signatures on the Declaration, the Founders believed they were signing their own death warrants. Ben Franklin said it best, "We must all hang together, or most assuredly, we all hang separately."
The signers of the Declaration believed human beings are endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator. How did they get that idea? In a message delivered by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 at the Ebenezer Baptist Church, King explained, "You see, the Founding Fathers were really influenced by the Bible. The whole concept of the Imago Dei...is the idea that all men have something within them that God injected...and this gives them uniqueness...There are no gradations in the image of God. Every man from a treble white to a bass black is significant on God's keyboard, precisely because every man is made in the image of God."
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi seems to agree. Recently she said, "...we're all God's children, there's a spark of divinity in every person...we respect the dignity and worth of every person." When is a person infused with the "divine spark"? Is it at birth, two days before, two weeks before, when the fetus has a heartbeat? Pelosi didn't say.
America betrays her founding values whenever human life is devalued. We've seen this in the words of Roger Taney, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1836 to 1864, who wrote at the time that African-Americans were "beings of an inferior order" so much so that they had "no rights which the white man was bound to respect." Taney authored the Dred Scott decision, the Supreme Court case that declared slaves were property. Taney did not believe that all human beings are created equal. His racist decision was the tipping point in America's struggle against slavery.
Today, America is at another crossroads of values and beliefs.
On June 10, more than 180 top executives from U.S. companies sent a message to lawmakers in states that have enacted "heartbeat" laws, laws restricting abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. Their letter appeared as a full-page ad in the June 11 edition of the New York Times saying, "...strict abortion laws are...against our values and (are) bad for business."
On June 11, during an interview with the Des Moines Register, presidential hopeful Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand declared, "I think there's some issues that have such moral clarity that we have, as a society, decided that the other side is not acceptable." She went on to compare pro-life views to racism, stating it is wrong "...for President Trump and other ultra-radical conservative judges and justices to impose their faith on Americans." Gillibrand seems blind to the fact that she aspires to impose her own brand of faith on Americans who don't share her beliefs on abortion.
Gillibrand wants to place restrictions on American's Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. At the same time, Gillibrand, and other Democratic 2020 presidential candidates want to make abortion far more accessible and reject any efforts to place more restrictions on the procedure. Why? Because, as Hillary Clinton said, "the unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights." Clinton has forgotten our founding values: the right to life is not given by the constitution, it is given by God.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said the "biggest mistake" of his presidency was picking Jeff Sessions for attorney general.
In an interview that aired Sunday morning on "Meet the Press," host Chuck Todd asked Trump, "If you could have one do-over as president, what would it be?"
To which Trump replied, "It would be personnel," before lashing out at his former attorney general.
"I would say if I had one do-over, it would be, I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. That would be my one that was the biggest mistake."
It's not the first time Trump has openly criticized the former attorney general.
Trump fired Sessions as attorney general the day after the 2018 midterm elections, ending a year of open criticism. Trump had been incensed by Sessions' recusal from overseeing the Mueller investigation and railed against the former Alabama senator as "beleaguered" and "disgraceful," and he expressed "disappointment" in him.
The president told The New York Times in July 2017 that he would not have appointed Sessions if he had known Sessions would have recused himself.
In September 2018, Trump went so far as to tell Hill.TV: "I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad."

Texto completo: We lost a giant when cookbook author Maida Heatter died this month at the age of 102.
Despite never having enjoyed the universal influence that can come from a television show, Heatter still managed to shape the tastes and interests of several generations of home bakers, including many famous ones.
"Everything I know about baking I learned from Maida Heatter," admits Martha Stewart, on the dust jacket of Heatter's last book, "Happiness Is Baking" (Little Brown, $27), a recently released -- and gotta-have -- compilation of favorite recipes.
"I have to say that I learned from cooks, because I tend toward the savory side of things," said Los Angeles baker and cookbook author Nancy Silverton, in a 2001 Taste interview. "People like Alice Waters, Patricia Wells, Richard Olney. And, of course, Maida Heatter, because she's everybody's mom."
Heatter was one of those people who manage to carve out several lives across a century, a high-profile existence illuminated in newspaper archives across the country, including the Minneapolis Star and the Minneapolis Tribune. Her first mention in the Star was a 1940 ad for Dayton's department store, when the 24-year-old New Yorker (her name is pronounced MAY-da HEAT-er) was making waves as a jewelry designer.
Under a "Youth Designs for Youth" banner, the copy reads, "The designer, Maida Heatter, is very young herself; so she knows what the college crowd likes to clip to a sweater or wool dress, dangle from a wrist."
Her next appearance in the Strib's archive was entirely different, a 1949 announcement of her second marriage, to Ellis Gimbel Jr., a department store scion; their 1963 divorce was duly noted in the same "People in the News" column.
A role model to anyone considering a midlife career switch, Heatter, a lifelong baker, was 50 years old when she started making desserts at the Miami Beach restaurant that she opened with her third husband, Ralph Daniels. A true calling was discovered.
Influential New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne became a fan ("She is hands down the foremost food authority in Florida," he wrote in 1968), and under his guidance Heatter eventually published a string of recipes in the newspaper. (She was often mentioned in Claiborne's syndicated column, which ran in the Minneapolis Tribune's Food section.)
From then on, Heatter's imaginative, highly detailed and painstakingly tested recipes made her more famous than her father, a radio broadcaster. Her Chocolate Mousse Torte became the New York Times' most requested recipe in 1972.
Claiborne urged her to write a cookbook. Her "Maida Heatter's Book of Great Desserts" debuted in 1974 and became an instant classic. When it was published, the five-year-old Taste section shared her then-signature recipe, Queen Mother's Cake.
"A dense chocolatey delight that chocolate lovers will hail," wrote staff writer Beth Anderson.
"Great Desserts" was followed by eight more titles, with Heatter tackling the entire dessert canon, from cakes to cookies ("I love gingersnaps and I've put them in all of my books," she told Taste staffer Ann Burckhardt in 1986), from pies to tarts. Over the years, her work earned three James Beard awards.
She was celebrated as the "Queen of Cake," but, let's face it, Heatter's legacy will forever be chocolate-coated.
"Mention chocolate desserts and the name of Maida Heatter is bound to crop up," wrote Lee Svitak Dean in Taste in 1985.
Heatter's Palm Beach Brownies would be enshrined in the American Recipe Hall of Fame, if such an institution existed. Heatter, who declared herself "Chairperson of the Board of the Chocolate Lovers Association of the World" in her "Maida Heatter's Book of Great Chocolate Desserts," wasn't shy about expressing her affection/obsession.
"My favorite word is chocolate," she said in a 1999 Taste interview. "It's the most delicious word I know. The word -- if I read it or write it or say it -- just tastes great to me."

Chocolate Mousse Torte
Serves 6 to 8.
Note: This recipe must be prepared in advance. "Of the many recipes that were born in my kitchen, this was one of the most exciting because it became the New York Times 1972 Dessert of the Year," wrote Maida Heatter in "Happiness Is Baking." "It starts with a chocolate mousse mixture. Part of it is baked in a pie plate. When it cools, it settles down the middle, leaving a higher rim. Then the remaining unbaked mousse is placed over the baked mousse. And it is topped with whipped cream." Use a chocolate bar, not chips. Some of the mousse will be uncooked, so for food safety, use pasteurized eggs. Adapted from "Happiness Is Baking" and the New York Times.
For mousse:
• Unsalted butter, for greasing the pan
• Fine dry breadcrumbs or cocoa powder, for dusting
• 8 oz. semisweet chocolate, chopped into small pieces
• 1 tbsp. instant espresso or coffee powder
• 1/4 c. boiling water
• 8 large pasteurized eggs, yolks and whites separated (see Note)
• 1/3 c. granulated sugar
• 1 tsp. vanilla extract
• 1/8 tsp. salt
For whipped cream:
• 1 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream
•1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
• 1/3 c. powdered sugar
• Coarsely grated semisweet chocolate, for garnish (optional)
Directions
To prepare the mousse: Adjust rack to the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch ovenproof glass pie plate. Dust it with breadcrumbs (or cocoa powder). Set aside.
Place the chopped chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over gently simmering water. In a small bowl, dissolve the instant espresso (or coffee powder) in 1/4 cup boiling water and pour it over the chocolate. Cover and cook over low heat, whisking occasionally, until the chocolate is almost melted. Remove from heat and continue to whisk until smooth. Set aside and allow chocolate mixture to cool slightly.
(Alternatively, place chocolate in a medium microwave-safe bowl. In a small bowl, dissolve the instant espresso in the boiling water and pour it over the chocolate. Cover bowl with a plate or kitchen towel and let stand for 5 minutes. Vigorously whisk until the chocolate is melted and smooth. If there are still bits of unmelted chocolate, microwave in 15-second bursts, whisking between, until smooth and fully melted.)
In the bowl of an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg yolks until they are pale, thick and lemon-colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually add the granulated sugar and continue to beat at high speed for 5 minutes more, until very thick. Reduce speed to low, add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and the cooled chocolate mixture, and mix to combine, scraping the sides of the mixing bowl as necessary. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.
In the bowl of the electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, combine the egg whites with the salt and beat on high speed until the whites are stiff but not dry. Gradually, in 2 or 3 small additions, gently fold half the whites into the chocolate, then fold the chocolate mixture into the remaining whites just until no whites show. Handling as little as possible, gently reserve about 4 cups of the mousse in a separate medium bowl; cover and refrigerate.
Transfer the rest of the mousse into the pie plate; it will barely reach the top. Using a spatula, gently level the mousse and bake for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat, then leave the mousse in the oven for 5 minutes more. Remove from oven and transfer the plate to a wire rack to cool (the mousse will rise during baking and then, while cooling, it will sink in the middle, leaving a high rim).
When the baked mousse is completely cool, remove reserved mousse from the refrigerator. Handling as little as possible, transfer the chilled mousse to the center of the baked mousse, mounding it slightly higher in the center. Refrigerate for at least 2 to 3 hours.
To prepare the whipped cream: In the chilled bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a chilled whisk attachment, whip the cream, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract and powdered sugar on high speed until it holds a defined shape. Spread whipped cream over the unbaked part of the mousse, excluding the rim. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Coarsely grate some semisweet chocolate over the top before serving, if desired, and serve chilled.

Texto completo: When I settle in with a Jackson Brodie novel, I can't help but imagine the author, Kate Atkinson, snickering at her laptop as she taps out her sly narration and Brodie's self-deprecating inner monologues.
Not to undermine the hard work of one of the U.K.'s most respected novelists, but surely it's more painful for her to chip away the marble encasing intricate and deeply satisfying works like "Life After Life" than it is to stage-manage the life of Brodie, the ex-soldier, ex-cop, ex-husband and current private detective whose exploits quench another, equally important thirst among readers.
In "Big Sky," Brodie, in modest superhero mode, saves several lives, possibly besting his own record for deaths averted in a day.
Still, he remains haunted by the one he couldn't save, his slain sister, Niamh, who died when he was just a child. He's also in dad mode, entertaining his teenage son, Nathan, for several days while his former partner, Julia, an actress, shoots a TV show (and steps out with a new love interest).
How he came to discover that Nathan existed at all is a story in itself (covered in another book), since, like everyone else in the Brodie books, Julia lies, at least part of the time.
While he is saving lives, Brodie finds himself in the position of comforting the afflicted, and the off-the-cuff therapy he dispenses draws heavily on the country music lyrics that sustain him as he drives around following cheating hearts, in the employ of the spouses they're cheating on. He's clear on the fact that this job doesn't rise to "dealing with criminals, just high-functioning morons."
Inevitably, he falls into a nest of evil far more complicated.
In this new novel, that evil is exploitation, with one plot about human traffickers based in Yorkshire braided with a scandal involving a far-reaching empire of sexual predators built decades earlier by ice cream and amusement park barons. Blood flows and brutality abounds, but Atkinson's disciplined storytelling keeps everything in perspective.
To fill all the roles these storylines demand, the book is populated with a huge cast of characters, a veritable villageful, but even the bad guys are dimensional and human (or nearly so), and no character is too extreme to include.
Take the beautiful, determined Crystal, with her hard, glossy shell. Everything about her is a lie, indebted to an active self-preservation drive. A strict vegan when no one's looking and the mother of a little princess, she's married to Tommy, who wallows in the money he makes in partnership with some friends. (One member of Tommy's crew, Andy, goes so far as to invest the excess money in pricey designer bags for his wife, who is led to believe they are knockoffs.)
Among Crystal's responsibilities is her eccentric teenage stepson, Harry, who makes a lot of jokes about cheese and helps to fill in some of her intellectual shortcomings. When Harry compares someone to Mr. Rochester (of "Jane Eyre"), Crystal asks, "Is he a teacher at your school?" Harry has a couple of part-time jobs, among them one at a theater where he becomes a close friend of the drag queen Bunny Hopps.
And so, grisly subject matter and violence aside, thanks to its broad spectrum of inhabitants, "Big Sky" is full of raucous scenes, laugh-out-loud moments and dark humor:
"Julia, Nathan's mother, could go toe to toe with Jackson in the grief stakes -- one sister murdered, one sister who killed herself, one who died of cancer. ('Oh, and don't forget Daddy's sexual abuse,' she reminded him. 'Trumps to me, I think.')"
The novel is also studded with little gems from past Brodie books, including an encounter with Reggie Chase from "When Will There Be Good News." That may be enough of a hook to entice you to read that book, or even the whole series this summer. There are worse ways to while away a long afternoon.

Sanders is FDR’s unimaginative echo

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- That the Democrats’ two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called “debates” validates Finley Peter Dunne’s prediction that “when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy.” Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun “socialism.” So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America’s puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: “All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie.” Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders’ socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in “a defining and pivotal moment.” Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for “rights” to “useful” jobs, “good” education, “adequate” food and clothing and recreation, a “decent” living for farmers, a “decent” home, “adequate” medical care, “adequate” protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders’ agenda for “completion” of FDR’s New Deal is a right to a “decent” job, “quality” health care, “complete” education, “affordable” housing, a “clean” environment, a “secure” retirement. Details later.
Sanders says “what I mean by democratic socialism” is “economic rights are human rights.” Really. That’s it. FDR said “necessitous men are not free men,” implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR’s unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that “none of Sweden’s manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized.” And “when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy,” the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: “In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80% of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system.”
The morning after Sanders’ speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: “Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life.” This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6% and the GDP 25.7% smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party’s presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate Eugene Debs received (913,693) while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson’s administration.
A young adult -- a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism -- who attended Sanders’ exegesis of socialism told the Times: “In America we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks.”
This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City’s Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a “major force” think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth (“I have a plan for that”) Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a “capitalist to my bones,” is a more authentic socialist than Sanders because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity.
So she, even more than the other participants in this week’s Democrats’ presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The accusations poured in one after another.
One woman described Donald Trump forcibly kissing her when she tried to get a job at the Trump Organization. Another said he put his hands under her skirt in a Manhattan nightclub. Others said he groped their breasts, attacked them or watched them change in a dressing room. At least 15 shared similar stories, claiming sexual misconduct by the former real estate tycoon.
Trump denied and fended off the accusations, which came in the aftermath of an "Access Hollywood" tape recorded in 2005 on which he made vulgar comments about groping women.
That tape was released in October 2016, one month before he won the presidency.
After 2½ years in the White House, Trump is fighting a new allegation, lodged by longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She wrote in a forthcoming book, "What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal," that Trump forced himself on her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room more than 20 years ago. An excerpt from the book was published by New York Magazine and included a photo of Carroll wearing the coat she said she wore the day of the attack.
More women share experiences: Women share sexual assault stories amid Trump tape fiasco
After 'Access Hollywood' tape: Reports: Multiple women say Trump grabbed them inappropriately
As Democratic challengers to his presidency campaign for the 2020 election, Trump portrayed Carroll as someone whose only motivation is to sell books.
"I have no idea who this woman is," Trump said as he left the White House on Saturday for Camp David. "It is a totally false accusation. " The president alleged Carroll made a habit of accusing men of misdeeds and said "people have to be careful" because "it's happening more and more. "
He downplayed a photo included in the New York Magazine story of Carroll with Trump, saying his back was to the camera and he was with his wife. "Give me a break," he said, repeating that he did not know Carroll. Carroll wrote in the excerpt that she ran into Trump while shopping at the elegant New York City department store in the mid-1990s. She said she greeted him as "that real-estate tycoon," and he greeted her as "that advice lady. " He was looking to buy a present for a "girl" and asked for Carroll's help, she wrote. She pointed out handbags and hats, but Trump pointed out lingerie and asked Carroll to try on a piece, she said. Near the dressing room, Carroll claimed, Trump forced himself on her. "The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," Carroll wrote. "He holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights. " Carroll claimed Trump "opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway – or completely, I’m not certain – inside me. " The episode lasted no longer than three minutes, Carroll said. It was the last time she had sex, she wrote. The incident was not reported to the police, and Carroll said she told only two close friends, whose names were not made public in the story. One told her to go to the police. The other told her to forget about it, she wrote. "She is trying to sell a new book – that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section," Trump said in a statement Friday. "Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda. " He pointed out that the department store had no footage of the incident or the pair in the store together and said there was no proof of an assault. New York Magazine, along with other outlets, including The New York Times, talked with the two friends, who verified that Carroll told them her account. Both said they did not want their names publicized for fear of threats. Carroll could not be reached by USA TODAY on Saturday.

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger "forever" homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families. It also supports one of the most controversial things I've ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don't bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can't buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn't a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Davidson's story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location.
The housing market isn't uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco's property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That's your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it's cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren't guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well.
But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location. You're betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You're betting some hot new suburb won't steal your hamlet's thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don't shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn't stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn't.

Viewpoints, Michael Graham: Democrats lean moderate as progressive plateau

Texto completo: Democratic primary voters seem fine with it. Major New York Democratic donors are all about it. In the era of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and public support for socialism, is the Democratic Party really prepared to play it safe and nominate a moderate in 2020?
It's hard to ignore the numbers. The latest RealClearPolitics average shows that despite any missteps or flip-flops, Joe Biden is holding a solid lead among Democratic primary voters.
Yes, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's been on the rise. But Biden's average remains larger than progressives Sens. Bernie Sanders and Warren combined.
The race is tighter in the early states where the ground game has more impact, and Warren/Sanders have spent a great deal of time in Iowa and New Hampshire. And yet Biden remains above 30 percent in those states, including New Hampshire where Warren and (especially) Bernie have a home field advantage.
And South Carolina is just brutal for Bernie and Liz, with Biden polling at 45 percent.
Ah, but those aren't the only numbers of note. Sen. Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg are filling out the top five. Both are perceived as more moderate candidates in the race-a perception that may not match reality, but that doesn't change the fact that, in a party whose voters consistently say they support a more socialist government by a 60-40 margin, the non-socialists (Biden, Kamala, Buttigieg) combined have about half the vote.
Now add the other numbers: Fundraising. Buttigieg raised a whopping $7 million in April alone. And a New York Times report says that among the high-dollar fundraisers of the Wall Street Democrats, "three candidates are generating most of the buzz: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
"Those are the three," said Julianna Smoot, who was national finance director for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and remains plugged into the donor community...If you could roll all three of them into a single candidate," Ms. Smoot said, "you'd have the perfect candidate."
Perhaps. But what is indisputable at the moment is that if you rolled all the progressive/Democratic Socialist candidates together, you still couldn't win the Democratic nomination.
Why? Because amid all the talk about Green New Deals and Medicare For All, there's only one thing the truly matters to Democratic primary voters. As local Warren supporter Maureen Murphy of Newton, NH told the New Hampshire Union-Leader:
"I did some canvassing for her in Nashua, and the people who were home said their top issue was they wanted to defeat Trump. Then when you ask them what the second most important thing was, they said it was to get rid of Trump."
Democrats are so desperate to defeat Trump that 45 percent of them admitted to Fox News that voting for the candidate who can take out Trump is more important than voting for an ethical one.
Biden appears to understand that the promise of victory is the essence of his campaign. It explains his declaration this week that, "if I'm your nominee I'm winning Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, believe it or not, and I believe we can win Texas and Florida." The prospect of crushing Donald Trump in a landslide is far more appealing to many primary voters than any policy proposal, no matter how progressive.
Can Biden really beat Trump in Texas and South Carolina? Almost certainly not.
But if primary voters believe it's even possible, he can definitely defeat Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to become the nominee.

Study: Opioid epidemic hurts U.S. businesses

Texto completo: CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The nation’s opioid epidemic triggered a drop in the number of people able to work, hurting companies’ ability to grow and leading to an increased investment in technologies to replace those workers, a new study from UNC-Chapel Hill’s Kenan-Flagler Business School found.
The study, which hasn’t been published in an academic journal yet, says opioids “effectively make labor costlier” in some communities by shrinking the number of applicants available for jobs. That negatively affects company growth in areas heavily impacted by opioid addiction.
The study also shows that in areas with high levels of opioid abuse, companies have made more investments into technology and automation, which could cause “permanent negative effects on local labor markets.”
The effects were most significant in states with higher levels of opioid prescriptions, of which North Carolina was one.
“The substitution away from labor to capital has implications for communities,” said Elena Simintzi, an assistant professor of finance at Kenan-Flagler and a co-author of the study.
“Blue-collar workers who are middle-aged are more likely to get addicted, and these are the types of jobs that get subbed away with technology. That has a lasting effect in a community.”
She added that many of these employees will then need to be retrained or take jobs in the service economy, which often pays less than traditional manufacturing.
This isn’t the first study to tie opioid addition to labor participation rates.
The late Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist, wrote a paper that said opioids could account for “about 43% of the observed decline in men’s labor force participation.” Former Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen also suggested a link during her time at the Fed.
But UNC says this is the first study that looks at the impact on the companies that employ those workers.
In areas that had high levels of addiction, the study found a “negative and significant” relationship between opioids and the growth of companies there. In contrast, in states where levels of addiction were lower, the study didn’t find a significant relationship between opioids and firm growth.
Simintzi said this especially hurt companies that employ low-skill manufacturing workers, as low educated workers and those who are at risk for injury on the job are more likely to become addicted to opioids. These companies are often competing with other firms in countries like China or Europe that don’t have face these addiction issues, putting them at a disadvantage, she added.
The study uses a New York Times story about a Youngstown, Ohio-based boiler maker as an anecdote for this phenomenon.
That company misses out on about $200,000 worth of orders ever year because of a lack of labor to fill the orders. Many of its potential employees fail drug tests and can’t work the heavy machinery. A German company is the beneficiary of the firm’s inability to fill all of its orders, the company’s CEO told the Times.
The UNC study measured the relationship between opioid prescriptions and company growth by looking at sales and employment, using a proprietary Compustat sample of publicly traded firms and other data covering public and private companies.
However, there was a bright spot in the study.
In states that have passed laws and regulations around the dissemination of opioids, the study found a link between the passage of laws and stock price increases for the public companies based there.
The study notes that as of last October, 25 states have passed laws meant to limit prescription rates for opioids. North Carolina is one of those states, passing the NC STOP Act in 2017.
The Strengthen Opioid Misuse Prevention or STOP Act limits doctors to prescribing no more than a five-day supply of opioids such as Percocet during an initial visit to treat a patient’s pain issue, The News & Observer reported. Two years ago, the state also implemented an Opioid Action Plan to expand treatment in the state and reduce the oversupply of prescriptions.
From 1999 to 2016, the opioid epidemic claimed 12,590 lives in North Carolina. But the state reported it made some progress in fighting the epidemic earlier this week at the 2019 Opioid Misuse and Overdose Prevention Summit.
Since the state implemented an Opioid Action Plan two years ago:
• Opioid dispensing has decreased by 24%.
• The use of addiction treatment drugs has increased by 15%.
• Opioid-related emergency room visits dropped in 2018, the first such decline in over a decade.
“We are making headway,” Gov. Roy Cooper said at the summit.
“The numbers show progress, but it’s the stories that paint a picture,” he said. “Behind those numbers are lives saved, families kept whole. But we haven’t won yet, far from it. We have not yet stopped this disease in our state.”

How ballparks reflect our cities

Texto completo: The photograph of Wrigley Field on the cover of critic Paul Goldberger's insightful new book on ballpark architecture is evocative but outdated.
In the image, the bullpen along the right-field line is still present, not shunted beneath the bleachers where it's been since 2017. There's also no digital scoreboard, topped by a red Budweiser sign, rising above the right-field bleachers.
Yet "Ballpark: Baseball in the American City," (Knopf, $35) isn't a romantic paean to the ballparks of yore. Nor is it one of those wonky, statistic-filled surveys of baseball's fields of dreams.
It is, rather, a serious yet accessible examination of ballparks past and present, filled with sharp aesthetic judgments and flavored with piquant details. The subtitle suggests the overriding theme: The ballpark holds up a telling mirror, revealing America's attitudes toward its cities, for better and for worse.
In the early years of the 20th century, it was taken for granted that ballparks would be embedded in cities, even shaped by them. Then, reflecting the suburban boom and techno-modernism of the postwar years, "concrete doughnuts" expressed the values of a nation that was running away from its cities and erecting buildings that made one city practically indistinguishable from another.
In recent years, a wave of retro ballparks has reflected -- and helped to propel -- America's reengagement with its cities, though not always for the better as Goldberger argues in a provocative final chapter, "The Ballpark as Theme Park."
Full disclosure: I'm a friend of the author, who used to be the architecture critic of The New York Times and The New Yorker and is now a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. So take my words with a baseball-sized grain of salt. But other reviewers have praised the 364-page book. I don't disagree.
One of Goldberger's strengths is the way he links ballparks to broader design and cultural trends. For example, he connects the rise of the ballpark to the picturesque urban parks and cemeteries that provided relief from overcrowded industrial cities. Ballparks, however, were far less decorous than the other urban pleasure grounds. Beer flowed. Gamblers gambled.
Occasionally, Goldberger's expansive writing leads him astray. Take this observation: "As much as the town square, the street, the park and the plaza, the baseball park is a key part of American public space." Not really. While the public can gather at ballparks, it must pay to enter the privately owned venues. Grant Park is true public space. Not so Wrigley and Guaranteed Rate Field.
The foundations of Goldberger's analysis are solid, however, drawing on both original research and the work of other historians and critics. We learn, for example, that entrepreneur William Cammeyer built the first ballpark in Brooklyn in 1862. Its fence, 6 1/2 feet high, was designed to keep out nonpaying customers, not to divide the field of play from surrounding seats.
Complemented by photographs and drawings of ballparks stretching from the late 19th century to the present, Goldberger's lucid prose frequently alights on Chicago.
Consider the precursor of the modern skybox that appeared in 1883 in Chicago's Lakefront Park -- 18 private viewing boxes, outfitted with upholstered armchairs and served by waiters. So much for the democratic mixing of the classes that landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned in his urban parks.
Chicago, where the Great Fire of 1871 incinerated an earlier lakefront ballpark, also illustrates the shift from early wood-framed ballparks to fire-resistant steel and concrete structures that offered more seating and better sight lines.
Wrigley, called Weeghman Park when it opened in 1914 to the design of architect Zachary Taylor Davis, is rightly described as one of the glories of this trend. It's one of the "immortal ballparks," Goldberger writes, distinguished by an intimacy that makes fans feel connected both to the game and to each other.
Introduced in the 1930s, Wrigley's ivy-covered outfield walls exemplify another of the book's major themes: The ballpark presents an illusion of the countryside set within the confines of the city -- rus in urbe, as the Latin phrase goes. The rural and the urban are interdependent, accentuating each other. Without its frame of the packed grandstand, the view of the emerald green field would be far less stirring.
Goldberger ably explains the proliferation of postwar concrete doughnuts. These circular, publicly financed monsters, like Pittsburgh's now-demolished Three Rivers Stadium, could be justified on the grounds that they could accommodate both football and baseball. In truth, they served football better than baseball.
The White Sox's New Comiskey Park of 1991, now Guaranteed Rate Field, was a holdover from this era: It was baseball-only, to be sure, but a concrete hulk surrounded by parking lots and essentially suburban -- more mallpark than ballpark.
Ironically, New Comiskey was designed by the same architects, HOK Sport, who joined with consultant Janet Marie Smith to shape Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which inaugurated the third phase of ballpark design.
Opened in 1992, Camden Yards restored the long-lost qualities of idiosyncrasy, intimacy, references to traditional architecture and connections to the city. Yet it did so by accommodating skyboxes, dining facilities and souvenir shops that created new revenue streams. It was, as its backers liked to say, "an old-fashioned ballpark with modern amenities."
On the whole, as Goldberger points out, Camden Yards has had a positive influence on baseball architecture, leading to such acclaimed designs as Cleveland's forthrightly modern Progressive (originally Jacobs) Field, now 25 years old and the site of the July 9 All-Star Game.
Yet the enormous retractable roofs that allow play to proceed whatever the weather can be a bad fit for the human scale of the retro aesthetic. At Milwaukee's Miller Park, Goldberger writes, it looks as if "someone had put a nineteenth-century train shed on top of a nineteenth-century train station."
His freshest observation is that we have entered a fourth phase of ballpark design, in which team owners, always in search of more revenue, are shaping the areas around their venues, producing bland districts where conventional corporate taste prevails -- an urban version of a theme park. This trend, Goldberger argues, is taking a toll on Wrigleyville, where the quirky and the messy are giving way to generic architecture that lacks industrial-strength authenticity.
While that point is debatable -- few mourn the loss of the surface parking lots on Wrigley's western flank and their replacement by a lively, albeit sign-laced, park -- what matters, in the end, is the way Goldberger frames the debate. His absorbing, illuminating account enriches our understanding of baseball parks as well as the games they shape, the cities they inhabit and the emotions they stir.

Texto completo: Catfights? Not at This Pageant
Readers responded at nytimes.com to Rachel Syme's article last Sunday about the Miss Dog Mom USA pageant, which included women in sequins and heels with their pups by their sides. Comments have been edited for length and clarity.
This is the best thing I've read in The New York Times in years. The intrigue! The drama! The cute!
Caroline, Brooklyn
Awful things are happening, but we can still make time for fun and whimsy. The dogs are adorable, and it's a nice distraction in trying times.
Puzzled, Chicago
What is wrong with people? These women have nothing better to do with their time? Do you want to see an authentic "Dog Mom USA"? Head to your local humane society or county shelter and you will find dedicated volunteers, the real dog moms who enrich the lives of shelter dogs every day. No black sequined garb or dance routines required. Just an honest love and respect for dogs.
Margaret, Ohio
An abundance of time and money that could better be used to support dogs in shelters, fund spay-and-neuter programs, and offer aid to any number of charities that actually help animals.
BD, North Carolina
These people are not even embarrassed to be spending their time and money in this ridiculous way, which is disrespectful to dogs, who should be appreciated for their doggy selves, not as stage props for people who have too much time on their hands. If you care about dogs, why not devote this energy and these resources to prevention of animal abuse, instead of contributing to it so you can wear a satin sash? Honestly, people are often bizarre creatures.
Norburt, New York
If these women really cared about their dogs they would cease annoying and stressing their pets with this and other useless activities and not dress them in these outfits. If these dog owners have this much time and money, they should support charities benefiting animals.
JoAnn, Long Beach, N.Y.
I figure any dog under 30 pounds might as well be a cat (and I like cats -- we have two). I like all friendly dogs because I figure it's not a little yip-yip dog's fault it was bred that way. And they seem to be much happier when they are treated the same as a proper-sized dog than as a living teddy bear or fashion accessory. And if you want a lap dog, you can put this in the bank: There's nothing better than having a 60- or 70-pound dog happily stretched across your lap!
Dadof2, New Jersey
A few years ago, when I had more energy, I would take one of my cats, the most docile, to the mall at Christmas to have her/his photo taken with Santa. I think I put a Christmas-y collar on them. Nothing adverse happened to any of them.
bcer, Vancouver
My dog absolutely hates being dressed in anything; it's a struggle in the winter to put his doggy coat on. Other than that he runs around al fresco with only his collar; he is my doggy version of the naked cowboy, wearing his furry birthday suit. He's a good-looking boy and everyone stops to admire him; no need for costumes or affectations to make him cute. These women are a bit bizarre, but to each his own.
sm, New York
Take off their clothes: Set them free.
Alice Simpson, California
Is this normal? Playing dress-up dolls with animals? I would love to hear what a mental health professional has to say on the relationships of these owners to their pets.
Gerry Power, Philadelphia
Responding to Gerry Power: The mental health professional would say: "This silly human doggo behavior has been part of us since before written history. Dogs are better-looking and nicer and more intelligent than the first husbands of most women. So lighten up."

Family secrets: Which to keep and others to share

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

Texto completo: There's no truce in the Nicki Minaj-Miley Cyrus word wars.
In a new episode of her "Queen Radio" show Friday, Minaj dismissed her fellow music star as a "Perdue chicken" as part of a back-and-forth feud that goes back to 2015.
"Perdue Chickens can never talk (expletive) about queens," Minaj says, referring to herself as royalty. "But I do notice a lot of Perdue chickens have been trying to say the queen's name for clout. And that's always been happening. And that's what (Cyrus) did in the first place. And the white girl cry and made the black girl seem like she was a bad guy. . . She disrespected me in a magazine article for no reason. "
In the process, Minaj also threw a crude accusation at Cyrus.
Lyrical message: Miley Cyrus' uneven 'She is Coming' EP explores sex, drugs and Nicki Minaj shade
Minaj's slam comes a few weeks after fans questioned whether Cyrus was throwing shade in her new song "Cattitude," with the lyric: "I love you Nicki, but I listen to Cardi. " (Minaj and rap rival Cardi B got into an infamous brawl at a New York Fashion Week party in September. )
Cyrus clarified the lyrics on Roman Kemp's Capital Breakfast radio show, saying there is no beef anymore, according to complex. com.
“They’re both queens. And anytime you want to feel powerful and strong, that’s my go-to: Cardi and Nicki," Cyrus said on the radio show, according to People. com.
Nevertheless, fans looked back to the start of the beef between Cyrus and Minaj in 2015, which opened with Cyrus taking Taylor Swift's side vs. Minaj in a New York Times interview, according to billboard. com. Minaj responded tartly in person days later at the VMA Awards, saying host Cyrus "had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?"
Minaj shared some personal news, too, during the radio show. She started riffing about pregnancy, before saying she wasn't, "but we did get our marriage license," she said, referring to boyfriend Kenneth Petty.
She continued, explaining she's in a good place.
"I think I have what I was striving for, just happiness. It was so hard to get to a happy place. Now that I’m there I don’t want to compromise that for anyone or anything. Certain traveling things I don’t (want to) do it. I’m just enjoying my downtime. "

Black education declines

Texto completo: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says that the city's specialized high schools have a diversity problem. He's joined by New York City Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza, educators, students and community leaders who want to fix the diversity problem. I bet you can easily guess what they will do to "improve" the racial mix of students (aka diversity). If you guessed they would propose eliminating the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test as the sole criterion for admissions, go to the head of the class. The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test is an examination that is administered to New York City's eighth- and ninth-grade students. By state law, it is used to determine admission to all but one of the city's nine specialized high schools.
It's taken as axiomatic that the relatively few blacks admitted to these high-powered schools is somehow tied to racial discrimination. In a June 2, 2018 "Chalkbeat" article, de Blasio writes: "The problem is clear. Eight of our most renowned high schools - including Stuyvesant High School, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School - rely on a single, high-stakes exam. The Specialized High School Admissions Test isn't just flawed - it's a roadblock to justice, progress and academic excellence."
Let's look at a bit of history to raise some questions about the mayor's diversity hypothesis. Dr. Thomas Sowell provides some interesting statistics about Stuyvesant High School in his book "Wealth, Poverty and Politics." He reports that, "In 1938, the proportion of blacks attending Stuyvesant High School, a specialized school, was almost as high as the proportion of blacks in the population of New York City." Since then, it has spiraled downward. In 1979, blacks were 12.9% of students at Stuyvesant, falling to 4.8% in 1995. By 2012, The New York Times reported that blacks were 1.2% of the student body.
What explains the decline? None of the usual explanations for racial disparities make sense. In other words, would one want to argue that there was less racial discrimination in 1938? Or, argue that in 1938 the "legacy of slavery" had not taken effect whereby now it is in full bloom? Genetic or environmental arguments cannot explain why blacks of an earlier generation were able to meet the demanding mental test standards to get into an elite high school. Socioeconomic conditions for blacks have improved dramatically since 1938. The only other plausible reason for the decline in academic achievement is that there has been a change in black culture. It doesn't take much to reach this conclusion. Simply look at school behavior today versus yesteryear.
An Education Week article reported that in the 2015-16 school year, "5.8% of the nation's 3.8 million teachers were physically attacked by a student." The Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics show that in the 2011-12 academic year, there were a record 209,800 primary- and secondary-school teachers who reported being physically attacked by a student. Nationally, an average of 1,175 teachers and staff were physically attacked, including being knocked out, each day of that school year.
Here are questions that might be asked of de Blasio and others who want to "fix the diversity problem" at New York's specialized schools: What has the triumph of egalitarian and diversity principles done for the rest of New York's school system? Are their academic achievement scores better than students at New York's specialized schools? The most important question for black parents: What has been allowed to happen to cripple black academic excellence?

Texto completo: Just when we were thinking those rambunctious young newcomers in Congress were so eager to overthrow the old way of doing things and defy their elders, they went and did something sensible.
Some of those same first-term Democrats who seem so single-mindedly dedicated to impeaching the president, advancing their "New Green Deal" and one-upping each other on the cable TV shout shows apparently had a moment of lucidity. Somebody, somehow prevailed on their political survival instincts long enough to make them realize that this might not be a real good time for Congress to give itself a big pay raise.
Rank-and-file members already make $174,000 a year. Congress hasn't had a raise in 10 years but the House leadership in both parties recently agreed on a $4,500 bump. A lot of the new members were pushing for it, having fully realized about six months ago how much it can cost to maintain homes in Washington and back in their districts – especially if those districts are in places like New York or San Francisco.
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., worked out kind of a political truce with Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the second-ranking Republican. They were going to let the $4,500 glide through with a big appropriations bill, agreeing neither party would make an issue of the pay raise in next year's elections.
Yeah, sure, that could happen. We all know that next year's races, from President Trump on down the ballot, will be Socratic discussions of real issues, devoid of personal attacks or distortion of any officeholder's or challenger's voting record. Just like our elections have always been.
But just as the spending bill was being prepared for the House floor, the New York Times reported last week, some of those fearless first-termers went to Hoyer and suggested he delete the pay raise provision for yet another year. Some of the Democrats who boosted their party into the majority had won some extremely close races and, in a presidential year with higher turnout, they did not want a pay raise around their necks as they fought to keep their new jobs in Washington.
There's a good argument to be made for a raise. A six-figure salary sounds nice, but it's not all that much by Washington standards. And it has been 10 years. And most of those members could go lobby for big companies and make a lot more, without the headaches of living in the public spotlight.
But there's an even better argument to be made against a raise. A whole lot of constituents, whose taxes pay congressional salaries, don't make anywhere near $174,000. And every member knew the salary when he or she ran for Congress. If they can do better lobbying, there are ample crowds of candidates who'd just love to replace them in the Capitol.
If timing is everything in politics, this must be the worst time since – well, maybe ever – for members of Congress to remind us what we don't like about themselves. It's surprising they'd even broach the subject. In most districts, people like their own members but, from coast to coast, Congress as a whole is held in low esteem. You name the issue – health care, immigration, political ethics, managing our money – there's hardly any pressing societal need that Congress hasn't forthrightly addressed, and made worse.
And then there's just plain old political possibilities. If the raise had stayed in the appropriations package, the Republican minority would have voted against it, along with several Democrats in politically precarious positions back home. If it escaped the House, the GOP-run Senate would have blocked it, so the Democrats would have hung themselves out there for nothing.

Texto completo: HILLSBOROUGH – Homebuyers who "go against the grain" may consider setting their sights on the Neshanic Mill. The mill was built more than a century ago, in 1876, near the South Branch of the Raritan River. At the time, it served as a grain mill, grinding grain grown by local farmers into flour. Using the power of the river, a water turbine would turn to power all the other mechanisms of the mill, such as the grain elevator and pulleys to transport the grain. This continued until the 1940s, when the mill was abandoned because of advances in grain production and manufacturing. A few decades later, in the 1970s, the mill was purchased by the late Dan Cahill, an architect, and repurposed into a house, renovated with new paint and woodwork.
The mill is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Hillsborough; it's pictured on the "Welcome to Hillsborough" signs and is the centerpiece of the Neshanic Mills Historic District.
A mill has been on the site near a dam across the river since 1810, a half century before the village of Neshanic Station on the other side of the river was established with the coming of the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The original structure was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1876.
The mill is next to the Central Railroad of New Jersey bridge over the river. The Somerset County Park Commission is developing a park and recreational area on the Branchburg side of the river next to the Elm Street Bridge.
Vincent Costa, a real estate agent for RE/MAX Competitive Edge, said in the 1990s, after Cahill moved to Florida, the present owner bought the house and refurbished it even more by restoring the field outside the mill, incorporating newer plumbing and modernizing the interior. What is unique about the property is its open floor plan, which allows for flexibility, he said.
"If you want to put up a wall in one place, you can. If you don't want to, you don't have to," Costa said. "There's a uniqueness in the way you can really create a home in any way you desire."
Costa said the mill would be ideal for those who are interested in historic homes and living next to the longest river within the borders of New Jersey. Most historic homes have formal living rooms and dining rooms, as well as set spots for electric cables. The Neshanic Mill does not have such walls, since its construction includes large pieces of timber on the sides that hold up the entire house.
This follows the trend of converting old commercial buildings, such as warehouses, churches, schools, prisons and mills, into homes. In Connecticut, the abandoned Ponemah Mills are being repurposed into a series of apartment-style lofts, according to the New York Times. And Costa cites the example of many vacant warehouses in New York City being transformed into loft spaces for incoming residents.
A final draw to the Neshanic Mill is the pieces of history left behind throughout the home. Artifacts such as pulleys, a grain elevator and tracking for grain bags are integrated in the home as a reminder of the mill's long history and past functions.
"They've repurposed a lot of the original parts of the mill into the house," Costa said.
The selling price is $650,000.

Brian Kilmeade: Trump's lack of action in Iran 'looks like weakness'

Texto completo: Host of "Fox & Friends" Brian Kilmeade was deeply critical of President Trump's choice to suddenly back down from retaliation on Iran during a panel discussion on Friday morning. Kilmeade said, in light of attacks on two oil tankers and a U.S. Navy drone shoot down in the Strait of Hormuz, the president's withdrawal from his initial order to attack looked like "weakness."
The New York Times reported late Thursday evening that Trump had authorized attacks on Iranian radar and missile battery targets, only to withdraw the order to strike before any bombs were dropped. The president has been hesitant to use military force against Iran and early on Thursday insinuated that the drone may have been shot down by mistake.
The decision to take action came after Trump told reporters that, "This is a new wrinkle, this is a new fly in the ointment, what happened, shooting down the drone. And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.”
Kilmeade said of the sudden choice not to attack Iran, "North Korea is watching. All our enemies are watching. Of course, Assad is watching, and for seven weeks, nothing but provocations. There is a price to pay for inaction and that says a lot."
He continued, "Every day that passes by when they blow up four tankers and we do nothing and they blow up a drone that costs $130 million and we do nothing ... it's not going to end there. At some points in the Middle East no action looks like weakness. Weakness begets more attacks." iFrame Object

Texto completo: There's no truce in the Nicki Minaj-Miley Cyrus word wars.
In a new episode of her "Queen Radio" show Friday, Minaj dismissed her fellow music star as a "Perdue chicken" as part of a back-and-forth feud that goes back to 2015.
"Perdue Chickens can never talk (expletive) about queens," Minaj says, referring to herself as royalty. "But I do notice a lot of Perdue chickens have been trying to say the queen's name for clout. And that's always been happening. And that's what (Cyrus) did in the first place. And the white girl cry and made the black girl seem like she was a bad guy. . . She disrespected me in a magazine article for no reason. "
In the process, Minaj also threw a crude accusation at Cyrus.
Lyrical message: Miley Cyrus' uneven 'She is Coming' EP explores sex, drugs and Nicki Minaj shade
Minaj's slam comes a few weeks after fans questioned whether Cyrus was throwing shade in her new song "Cattitude," with the lyric: "I love you Nicki, but I listen to Cardi. " (Minaj and rap rival Cardi B got into an infamous brawl at a New York Fashion Week party in September. )
Cyrus clarified the lyrics on Roman Kemp's Capital Breakfast radio show, saying there is no beef anymore, according to complex. com.
“They’re both queens. And anytime you want to feel powerful and strong, that’s my go-to: Cardi and Nicki," Cyrus said on the radio show, according to People. com.
Nevertheless, fans looked back to the start of the beef between Cyrus and Minaj in 2015, which opened with Cyrus taking Taylor Swift's side vs. Minaj in a New York Times interview, according to billboard. com. Minaj responded tartly in person days later at the VMA Awards, saying host Cyrus "had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. Miley, what's good?"
Minaj shared some personal news, too, during the radio show. She started riffing about pregnancy, before saying she wasn't, "but we did get our marriage license," she said, referring to boyfriend Kenneth Petty.
She continued, explaining she's in a good place.
"I think I have what I was striving for, just happiness. It was so hard to get to a happy place. Now that I’m there I don’t want to compromise that for anyone or anything. Certain traveling things I don’t (want to) do it. I’m just enjoying my downtime. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Only hours after saying Iran had made a "big mistake" for reportedly downing a U. S. drone over international waters, President Donald Trump abruptly halted a planned retaliatory strike on Iranian targets by U. S. forces Thursday only minutes before it was scheduled to begin, he said on Twitter.
How imminent was the threat of an attack?
United States diplomatic and military officials had expected strikes to be carried out as late as 7 p. m. Thursday after a day of discussions and debate, according to the New York Times.
Trump said on Twitter that he called off the strike 10 minutes before it was to begin because he believed it was ":not proportionate" to the downing of an unmanned drone. He said he asked a general at the last minute how many people might die in the strike, and was told 150.
One U. S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the operation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the targets would have included radars and missile batteries.
In an Oval Office meeting with reporters, Trump said, "Iran made a big mistake. This drone was in international waters, clearly. We have it all documented scientifically, not just words. And they made a very bad mistake. "
When asked about how the U. S. would respond, he said, "you'll find out. " He added that he thought it was someone "loose and stupid who did it. "
Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of U. S. Air Forces Central Command, said Thursday that the unmanned U. S. Navy RQ-4 was shot down in international airspace in the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz while on a surveillance mission in international airspace in the vicinity of recent Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command maritime attacks. He said the IRGC surface to air missile was fired from a location in the vicinity of Goruk, Iran.

S. drone in 'unprovoked attack,' heightening tensions
What triggered the most recent rise in tension?
Iran's drone takedown came a week after two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman.
The Trump administration has said that Iran is responsible for those attacks, although Iran has denied responsibility. Since then, the U. S. military has released video and photographs claiming to show a relationship between Iranian forces and the attacks on the tankers.
Despite previous comments by top Trump administration advisers on the threat posed by Iran, Trump has contradicted his top advisers. In an interview with Time magazine posted this week, Trump said that the attacks were "very minor. "

video: U. S. -Iran relationship status: It's complicated The United States and Iran have been lobbing threats, fighting proxy wars, and imposing sanctions for decades. USA Today looks at over 60 years of this back-and-forth. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY SEO Warning Layout Priority What steps has the U. S. taken toward broader military action?
The U. S. has also deployed more troops to the Middle East in what Pentagon officials say is a direct response to Iran's provocations.
On Monday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced that 1,000 troops would be sent to the Middle East "to address air, naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East. " Shanahan cited "hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region. "

What is Iran's position on seeking nuclear weapons?
Iran announced this week that it would soon be breaking its nuclear stockpile and enrichment limits set under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the "Iran Deal. " The U. S. withdrew from that pact in 2015, but the U. S. has urged Iran to abide by its provisions.
In a television interview last Sunday on Fox News, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo restated America's goals regarding Iran's nuclear program.
"President Trump has been unambiguous: Iran will not get a nuclear weapon," he said. "That's the goal, that’s the objective of our entire campaign with respect to Iran and to create stability throughout the Middle East as part of that effort. "
How the crisis compare to the buildup to the 2003 Iraq War?
The saber-rattling between the U. S. and Iran appears to have parallels to the build-up to the 2003 Iraq War.
On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was trying to make the case to Congress that Iran had ties to Al Qaeda, which under a 2001 congressional authorization, would potentially give the Trump administration the legal authority to take military action against Iran.
Pompeo ducked a question about military authorization during a Fox News interview last Sunday, saying that “the president has the authorization to act to defend American interests," but did not elaborate on what authorization that was.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late May shows that half of all Americans believe the U. S. will go to war with Iran "within the next few years. "

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I’m going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. You read that right. At the current pace of change, gender equality won’t arrive in the U. S. until the year 2227.
Underneath triumphant headlines about women running for office in record numbers, changing the face of Congress and breaking glass ceilings are trend lines that tell a much more somber story about the pace of progress for women in our country.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women.
A damning number could spur us to action
On the political front, women are 51% of the U. S. population, but hold only 24% of seats in Congress. And unlike 59 other countries — including India, Israel, Liberia, Slovakia, Mali, and Malawi — the U. S. has yet to have a female head of state.
WEF’s projection also reflects the grim reality that the U. S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse. The risks are especially high for African American women, who are three to four times more likely to die during or after delivery than white women.
Way beyond the numbers: Record election success in Year of the Woman 2
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. If we can accelerate the pace of progress, that number will start to go down. And therein lies our call to action.
I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren’t sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
As it turned out, we were far from alone in wanting to do something about the unconscionable number of children dying preventable deaths. Our foundation was quickly connected to a wide range of partners eager to play a role in driving progress. Together, we created a new organization — Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — which has spurred a 40% decrease in the number of children in low-and-middle-income nations who die before their fifth birthday.
Spend money to speed up women's progress
Once again, we find ourselves facing an urgent challenge that calls for new investment and collaboration. Shrinking the number 208 is going to require many people across many sectors. But I believe progress is possible, and as a philanthropist, I’m particularly interested in the role that philanthropy can play in accelerating it.
While comprehensive data on U. S. philanthropy is hard to find, there’s evidence that gender equality in the U. S. has been chronically underfunded. Preliminary, unpublished research based on foundation data from Candid suggests that for every $1 spent on gender equality by private donors, there is $9. 27 spent on higher education, and $4. 85 spent on the arts. What’s more, 90% of the money that is going toward women’s issues is going toward women’s reproductive health specifically. If we want to make gender equality a priority, we need to be spending more — and spreading those resources more broadly.
Republicans have a woman problem: Can they fix it? Only if they change practically everything.
In addition to writing checks, philanthropists can play a critical role in driving progress by creating new platforms to bring people together. As we saw with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, it’s essential to have a mechanism for getting a diverse range of stakeholders around the same table.
We need to tackle systemic inequality
When it comes to the fight for gender equality, one of the most important assets we have is the huge array of people who are already activated — from the thousands of organizations that have been working on these issues for years to the more than 4 million women who joined women’s marches across 600 cities. That’s why I think there’s a lot of potential in new efforts to channel existing energies and expertise more effectively into one broad-based assault on systemic inequality. My company, Pivotal Ventures, recently invested in two of these efforts — Time’s Up and The Collaborative Fund for Women’s Safety and Dignity. Both are creating new partnerships to tackle harassment, discrimination and inequality at scale.
The gender gaps in our country are real, and they aren’t going away on their own — at least, not any time in the next 200 years. If we want to see them close in our lifetimes, we will need to come together to insist in one voice that equality can’t wait. Over two decades ago, a statistic in a newspaper called me to action. I hope the statistic WEF published this week does the same for others. If we commit to being part of the solution, the number 208 is ours to reject.

Texto completo: When police raided gay bars back in the day, they expected the patrons to scatter. But one hot Friday night 50 years ago, at the Stonewall Inn, no one was going anywhere. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, old, young -- they booed and jeered as the cops walked their prey out of the bar. Kids across the street started throwing pennies, then bricks. Finally, the riot squad was called in, and even they couldn't clear the streets.
Martin Boyce remembers sitting on his stoop the next day, exhausted from the melee. "My God, we're going to pay so desperately for this," he thought. But that's not what happened.
"The next day we were there again," he says. "We had had enough. Every queen in that riot changed."
On June 28, 1969, what happened at Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn became "Stonewall," the legendary uprising against homophobic abuse.
The telling and retelling of the Stonewall story makes it seem like Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous arc of the moral universe isn't long -- as he claimed -- but explosively short. Much of the 50th anniversary coverage of the uprising has marveled at how quickly gays won their civil rights, at how everything changed in one night when, in Boyce's words, "We had had enough."
But nothing about Stonewall was sudden. The homophobia was an age-old story, and the riot was the product of activism that had been building for decades. King's quote is correct: History's arc traces a very long line. It only bends toward justice because so many activists over so many years hammer relentlessly upon it.
The movement that erupted into a riot at Stonewall in 1969 dates back to the early 1900s, when LGBTQ people began to migrate to cities. Abuse and harassment followed them.
The repeal of Prohibition in 1933 empowered states to license liquor, and with licensing came the requirement that bars must be "orderly," which gave authorities cover for harassing gays even in their own establishments. In the 1940s, the Red Scare became a "Lavender Scare," as investigators applied the "subversive" label to gay men and lesbian women working for the government. The longest surviving gay resistance organization, the Mattachine Society, was founded, alongside the lesbian Daughters of Bilitis, in the early 1950s; it all but unraveled under the pressure of government scrutiny.
But in 1957, the government made a terrible mistake when it fired physicist Franklin "Frank" Kameny for being gay. Instead of going quietly, he sued. Kameny lost (the Supreme Court would not consider discrimination based on sexual orientation unconstitutional until 1996), but his fight revived the Mattachine Society. Kameny organized early gay rights protests at the White House, the Pentagon, the United Nations.
By 1969, gays who had honed their activism protesting the Vietnam War had had enough maltreatment from their straight lefty brothers. They came out and applied their politics to a new front. One of them, Carl Wittman, once a leader in Students for a Democratic Society, wrote a manifesto calling for gays to openly embrace their identity: "Stop mimicking straights, stop censoring ourselves. We have to learn that our loving each other is a good thing, not an unfortunate thing."
With exquisite timing, two other SDS alumni, Bill Katzenberg and John O'Brien, scheduled a "homosexual discussion group" at a counterculture school in Greenwich Village for July 1969. It would go from five pre-Stonewall registrants to 40 post-Stonewall.
When the first stone flew at the Stonewall Inn, an architecture for the movement was already in place. Before Stonewall, smaller uprisings in San Francisco and Los Angeles galvanized individuals. After Stonewall, there were meetings.
Within days, lesbian activist Martha Shelley invited everyone to a demonstration protesting police abuse. She soon dubbed the protest planning committee the Gay Liberation Front. The game was on or, more appropriately, it was continuing.
We can see a corollary to the Stonewall milestone in another explosive cultural moment. In the course of 10 days in early October 2017, seemingly out of nowhere, The New York Times and the New Yorker both exposed Harvey Weinstein's epic sexual abuse and harassment history. Then actress Alyssa Milano shared a message: "If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted, write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet." Overnight, #MeToo (originated by black activist Tarana Burke in 2011) echoed 55,000 times.
Presto, change-o, right? Not really.
Way back in 1974, Paulette Barnes, a brave clerk at the Environmental Protection Agency, sued a boss who had given her a choice: sex with him or lose her job. Happily, a brilliant law student, Catharine MacKinnon, was laying the theoretical groundwork to establish sexual harassment as sex discrimination -- a civil rights offense. Barnes won on appeal, and MacKinnon's theory became law. That wasn't enough to protect Anita Hill or to make Monica Lewinsky a purely sympathetic figure. It would take another two decades, when a cadre of young feminists empowered by the internet -- Andi Zeisler, Jessica Valenti, Rebecca Traister -- began to insist on another "we've had enough" moment. Out of their ranks came the change in mindset, and some of the mainstream journalists who would break the Weinstein story.
"Stonewall" conveniently marks a movement that was a century in the making and that would go on to be honed by assassination (Harvey Milk), a deadly epidemic (AIDS) and a brilliantly strategic same-sex marriage campaign. The Weinstein revelations likewise mark a milestone for women, but to say it launched a movement isn't exactly accurate. Gay rights and women's rights don't turn in an instant, no matter how galvanizing. The revolution is incremental. It takes agonizing courage, a dedicated fight, herculean perseverance. It takes time.

Texto completo: Cancer therapies should shrink tumors. Diabetes treatments ought to lower blood sugar. But what should society expect from drugs for sexual desire?
In the coming days, the Food and Drug Administration will decide whether to approve a Waltham company's injection meant to increase women's drive for sex. Its demonstrated effects are modest, but some doctors say the drug would meet a real need for thousands of women. Others, however, argue it is simply pharmaceutical overreach, another effort that reduces the complexity of human sexuality to a set of measurable dots on a chart.
“It's a mismatch of models," said Leonore Tiefer, a sex therapist who previously ran the sex and gender clinic at New York's Montefiore Medical Center. “They want the car repair model: 'Hello, doctor, I've got this carburetor that doesn't work in my car. Could you fix it for me without talking to me?' It's laughable."
The drug, bremelanotide, is an on-demand therapy for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD, which is defined as a distressing loss of interest in sex. AMAG Pharmaceuticals hopes the drug can do for sexual desire what Viagra did for erectile dysfunction. It could win FDA approval as early as Friday.
There's already a marketed treatment for HSDD in the form of a pill called Addyi, a drug whose 2015 FDA approval came with intense debate over whether sexual desire was indeed a medical issue. Addyi has since become a commercial nonentity, in large part because women are restricted from drinking alcohol before taking it. The controversy around the drug's approval faded along with its meager sales.
But bremelanotide, which promises a similar effect with fewer side effects, has rekindled the conversation.
Dr. Sharon Parish, who practices sexual medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said the debate over HSDD is “an old argument that there's no point in having anymore." Regardless of the semiotics of female sexuality, there are women in the real world suffering distress from a lack of desire, Parish said.
“Lighting a candle and having a glass of wine isn't helpful for these women, just as going to see a funny movie isn't helpful for someone who's depressed," said Parish, who has served as a paid adviser to AMAG.
To Emily Nagoski, a sex educator and author, prescribing drugs for desire runs the risk of pathologizing normal sexual function. What women diagnosed with HSDD need “is not medical treatment, but a thoughtful exploration of what creates desire between them and their partners," Nagoski wrote in The New York Times before Addyi's approval.
AMAG's approach to the biology of sex begins in the brain. Desire, the company argues, is governed by a compromise between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Women with HSDD are imbalanced toward inhibition. Bremelanotide, which targets an excitatory receptor called melanocortin 4, is meant to even things out, improving desire and reducing distress.
The drug, self-administered through a tiny needle that goes under the skin, met its goals in a pair of clinical trials involving more than 1,200 women. At the median, bremelanotide decreased distress by one point from baseline on a four-point scale. The results in desire were smaller, with the median patient seeing an improvement of just .6 from baseline on a scale that ranges from 1.2 to 6.
AMAG, which licensed bremelanotide from Palatin Technologies in 2017, says such an improvement is enough to spell a real benefit for women with HSDD. The scale comes from a questionnaire that asks women how often and how intensely they want to have sex.
“We're not trying to prescribe a one-size-fits-all desire," said Dr. Julie Krop, AMAG's chief medical officer. “It's about empowering women to have the choice and the ability to restore their desire where they think it's been robbed."
But finding women who might benefit from bremelanotide will likely be a challenge, AMAG acknowledges. For a woman to be diagnosed with HSDD, a doctor must rule out every other possible cause of her waning sex drive, whether it be a relationship problem, the side effects of another medicine, or the impact of a surgery.

Texto completo: 'PEPPERMINT SODA' AT TRANSMITTER PARK (Friday, 8:30 p.m.) Although this movie is set during the 1963-64 academic year, many contemporary middle-school girls will identify with the trials its 13-year-old heroine, Anne (Eléonore Klarwein, above), experiences: dealing with difficult teachers, getting her first period, quarreling with her older sister and trying to talk to boys. Her divorced mother also opposes the adult things Anne would like to do, which include wearing stockings and visiting cafes to drink the film's titular beverage. These mild acts of rebellion -- the picture, in French with English subtitles, is rated PG -- are drawn from the adolescence of its acclaimed writer and director, Diane Kurys, whose first feature is "an expert, utterly charming movie," Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times in 1979. Part of the free series Films on the Green from the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, "Peppermint Soda" should be extra tangy: This Brooklyn outdoor screening is of a recent 2K restoration.

Texto completo: It's a rare and refreshing moment for the queer coffee table book collector (your reporter included): As New York City prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion by hosting World Pride this June, an array of titles celebrating the L.G.B.T.Q. community's history, art and culture are suddenly on offer. The lineup is impressive, both in its scale -- there are more books than the 10 fit to print here -- and in its sweep, comprising histories of rights, artworks and lovers gained and lost to time.
[Read Holland Cotter's review of Stonewall exhibitions, and our guide to Pride events .]
"We Are Everywhere: Protest, Power, and Pride in the History of Queer Liberation" (Ten Speed Press, $ 40), the tallest of the titles, ironically began as a pocket-sized project: the Instagram account @lgbt_history. Matthew Riemer and Leighton Brown, the creators of the 400,000-strong account and the book's co-authors, were compelled to immerse themselves and their readership in a legacy that eludes many of today's Millennials and Generation Z-ers. In print, this translates to an impassioned photographic tour of an ever-changing, increasingly vocal and insistently resilient L.G.B.T.Q. community and culture, from 19th-century ideology to contemporary conversations around intersectionality.
Those still grappling with terminology (including the L.G.B.T.Q. community's reclaiming of the former slur "queer" itself) would benefit from flipping through the diminutive "The Queeriodic Table: A Celebration of LGBTQ+ Culture" (Summersdale, $ 13.99). The author Harriet Dyer goes far beyond the abbreviation to explore key vocabulary, figures, historical markers and artistic works, all packaged in cheery graphics and clear, conversational language. "Oh, labels. We humans use them to make things easier and they just don't always work that well," Dyer writes in the book's introduction, a fitting invitation to unpack and question them.
"Pride: Fifty Years of Parades and Protests From the Photo Archives of The New York Times" (Abrams Image, $ 24.99) offers a self-reflexive review of the ways in which this newspaper has reported on the L.G.B.T.Q. community over the past half-century. In his introduction, The Times's Los Angeles bureau chief, Adam Nagourney, takes the paper to task for its shortcomings in regards to its coverage of Stonewall and AIDS, among other subjects. The book reproduces a February 28, 1971 article, "More Homosexuals Aided to Become Heterosexual," published two years before the American Psychiatric Association declared that homosexuality was not, in fact, a mental illness. The chronological interplay of published stories and more than 350 photographs presents a timeline of the relentless march -- and marches -- of recent history, as filtered through the media's perspectives and prejudices.
"Pride: Photographs After Stonewall" (OR Books, paper, $ 30) offers a more intimate account of the events of June 28, 1969, and the decades hence, via the lens of The Village Voice's first picture editor and staff photographer, Fred W. McDarrah. The book is a reissue of a 1994 publication, now out of print, initially published in time for Stonewall's 25th anniversary, but the black-and-white images somehow feel more resonant today than ever before. Despite the visual ephemera on display in recent retrospectives and publications, McDarrah was one of the only photographers to capture the immediate aftermath of that now legendary weekend, from the smashed jukeboxes and graffiti-scrawled windows to the slightly stunned and celebratory crowd outside of Greenwich Village's 53 Christopher Street. McDarrah continued to document New York's often-overlooked L.G.B.T.Q. community until the 1990s, and his full body of work is interspersed throughout the book with poignant quotes from the subjects pictured.
Similarly, "Love and Resistance: Out of the Closet Into the Stonewall Era" (W. W. Norton & Company, $ 24.95) frames the turbulent and triumphant 1960s and '70s from the distinctive vantage points of the photographers Kay Tobin Lahusen and Diana Davies. The album is a distillation of an exhibition at the New York Public Library, running through July 13, here culled into four themes by the editor and curator Jason Baumann. One of them, "Visibility," comprises a collection of quiet portraits of Lahusen and Davies's community of activists, such as the tireless, seemingly ubiquitous Marsha P. Johnson.
Sometimes, a rebellion begins with a rebrand. In "Queer X Design" (Black Dog & Leventhal, $ 24.99), the professor Andy Campbell weaves a telling visual tapestry of an emerging L.G.B.T.Q. language and identity. The spare ink illustrations gracing the seminal lesbian publication "The Ladder," first published in 1956, stand out among the coded visuals of the "pre-liberation" era, while Gilbert Baker's rainbow flag, hand-sewn for San Francisco's 1978 Gay Freedom Day celebration, epitomizes the boldness of post-Stonewall visibility. California's blue and white all-gender bathroom signage from 2017 speaks to this generation's fight for the rights of transgender and gender-nonconforming members of the community.
First published in 2013, "Art & Queer Culture," by the professors Catherine Lord and Richard Meyer (Phaidon, paper, $ 39.95), aimed to codify, dissect and celebrate an L.G.B.T.Q. fine art canon. There's much to absorb in this expanded reissue -- over 130 years' worth -- and much of it benefits from a close read of the (very) fine print, owing to its furtive, discrete or symbolic nature. Thus does the sexually ambiguous Thomas Eakins's 1883-85 scandal-steeped "Swimming" open the first portion, its sensuous portrayal of nude male bodies a prelude to the increasingly bold, complex and diverse queer work that follows.
Per its title, the scope of "Art After Stonewall, 1969-1989" (Rizzoli Electa, $ 60) is relegated to the two seismic decades following the uprising. This particular catalog coincides with an exhibit organized by Ohio's Columbus Museum of Art, split into two segments for its opening at New York's Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art and New York University's Grey Art Gallery (through July). Helmed by the artist and curator Jonathan Weinberg, the book and exhibition situate the work within seven themes. Among them: "Coming Out" (Peter Hujar's triumphant photograph for a Gay Liberation Front poster in 1970) and "AIDS and Activism" (Lola Flash's haunting image "AIDS Quilt," 1987).
Weinberg has also authored another title, the result of 16 years of research: "Pier Groups: Art and Sex Along the New York Waterfront" (Penn State University Press, $ 34.95). This far more personal and academic tome focuses on the 1970s, when Weinberg himself used to trawl Manhattan's West Side piers for both sexual and artistic gratification. The rambling, blighted structures that once represented the city's reputation as a booming seaport were newly rife for site-specific artwork and documentation by the likes of Gordon Matta-Clark, whose 1975 "Days End" -- five gaping incisions into the now-destroyed Pier 52 -- presided over the comings and goings of gay men looking for connection and satisfaction. It's an alluring homage to a time, a community and a landscape that have long since vanished.
Likewise, "Tom Bianchi: 63 E 9th Street" (Damiani, distributed by ARTBOOK | D.A.P., $ 55) presents a compelling, charged portrait of gay men in New York, depicted in their sexual prime in the golden years before the major devastation of AIDS. "In the early days of the queer revolution, we seemed inevitably heading to a more playful and loving way of being," Bianchi writes in the book's introduction, and that spirit is reflected in the lush, to-scale, and unapologetically erotic Polaroids of his paramours, his apartment and the city beyond it all.

Texto completo: Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'¡BUENA ONDA! MUSIC FROM SOUTH AMERICA' at Carnegie Hall (June 23, 2 p.m.). Roughly translated, the phrase in the title means "good vibes," and you will encounter plenty of those at this Spanish-language family event. Presented by Distinguished Concerts International New York, the afternoon will feature a variety of children's choirs in two works by the Venezuelan composer Alberto Grau: "Cinco Canciones Infantiles," which draws on the traditional music of the vibrant June festival Parranda de San Pedro; and "Opereta Ecológica," a salute to nature that incorporates poems for young people by Jesús Rosas Marcano. The program, recommended for listeners 10 and older, also includes the Argentine composer Martín Palmeri's "Misa a Buenos Aires" and "Gran Misa," pieces that infuse the ancient melodies of the Roman Catholic Mass with the high-spirited rhythms and energy of tango.

NEW PLAYS FOR YOUNG AUDIENCES: 'RETURN TO SENDER' at Provincetown Playhouse (June 22, 7:30 p.m.; June 23, 3 p.m.). Boundaries, both physical and psychological, are at the heart of this theatrical adaptation of Julia Alvarez's young-adult novel of the same title. Tyler, the play's protagonist, struggles to understand the lives of the Mexican migrants his father, who is recovering from an accident, has recently hired to work on the family's Vermont farm. Commissioned by the Nashville Children's Theater and written by Marisela Treviño Orta, the drama chronicles Tyler's developing friendship with Mari, a Mexican girl, as it examines the plight of immigrants who enter the United States illegally. These free rehearsed readings will conclude this year's New Plays for Young Audiences, an annual series of works in development presented by the educational theater program of the Steinhardt School at N.Y.U.

'PEPPERMINT SODA' at Transmitter Park (June 21, 8:30 p.m.). Although this movie is set during the 1963-64 academic year, many contemporary middle-school girls will identify with the trials its 13-year-old heroine, Anne, experiences: dealing with difficult teachers, getting her first period, quarreling with her older sister and trying to talk to boys. Her divorced mother also opposes the adult things Anne would like to do, which include wearing stockings and visiting cafes to drink the film's titular beverage. These mild acts of rebellion -- the picture, in French with English subtitles, is rated PG -- are drawn from the adolescence of its acclaimed writer and director, Diane Kurys, whose first feature is "an expert, utterly charming movie," Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times in 1979. Presented as part of the free series Films on the Green from the Cultural Services of the French Embassy, "Peppermint Soda" should be particularly tangy: This Brooklyn outdoor screening is of a recent 2K restoration. (The rain date is Saturday.)

'SLEEPING BEAUTY' at the Jeffrey and Paula Gural Theater at A.R.T./New York Theaters (June 22-23, noon and 3 p.m.; through June 30). A princess needs to be awakened in this play, but little else conforms to the fairy tale's usual plot. Here, the slumbering maiden's rescuers are an unconventional brother and sister: Prince Rocky, who would rather spend his time baking, and Princess Jewel, who prefers swordplay to the typical girlie pursuits. Commissioned by Project Y Theater Company, Amina Henry's feminist adaptation is recommended for young people ages 6 to 13. Presented as part of the Women in Theater Festival, it also features fire birds, a troll and some well-known storybook siblings.

SUMMER FAMILY FAIR at the Morgan Library & Museum (June 23, 2-4:30 p.m.). You don't often expect a library to start a wild rumpus. On Sunday, however, the Morgan will focus on a number of wild things -- big and small -- during this celebration. Children, who can go on a family tour of the new exhibition "Drawing the Curtain: Maurice Sendak's Designs for Opera and Ballet," will be invited to make a crown like that worn by young Max in the operatic adaptation of Sendak's picture book "Where the Wild Things Are," or fox ears like those featured in his work for the Janacek opera "The Cunning Little Vixen." They can also arrange the word magnets on the library's Poetry Wall to write their own verse inspired by the show "Walt Whitman: Bard of Democracy." (The actor Stephen Ringold, who will give two brief performances as Whitman, will help create the appropriate atmosphere.) Other highlights will include making self-portrait photo collages and enjoying some untamed cinema: a 3 p.m. screening of Spike Jonze's 2009 film version of "Where the Wild Things Are."
212-685-0008, themorgan.org
SUMMER SOLSTICE WEEKEND at the New York Botanical Garden (June 22-23, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.). Despite its name, the Edible Academy isn't like the gingerbread house in "Hansel and Gretel" -- you can't eat it. You can, though, eat what it produces. An educational campus that is part of the Botanical Garden in the Bronx, the academy will give culinary demonstrations all weekend, offering healthy dishes young visitors can sample, like spinach pesto pasta with spring peas and spring pea panini. Children can also tour the facilities, which will have live music; enjoy games, puzzles and displays that teach about vegetables; help tend plants and pot up a sunflower seed to take home; and do solstice-inspired crafts, like decorate a harvest bag with stamps that honor the sun.
718-817-8700, nybg.org
WHITNEY BIENNIAL FAMILY OPENING at the Whitney Museum of American Art (June 22, 10:30 a.m.-3 p.m.). You can always see art at a biennial, but on this occasion, you can hear it as well. Laura Ortman, a composer, musician and one of the 75 artists in the show, will perform at 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. in a short-term installation she built, filled with instruments like a piano, chimes and an Apache violin; sound equipment; and ephemera such as photos and drawings. She will answer children's questions after each concert. Young visitors can also listen to raps that are delivered by houses and buildings in Meriem Bennani's video piece "Neighborhood Goggles" and make paper puppets inspired by those structures. Additional activities will include creating landscape sculptures; participating in a scavenger hunt and sketching exercise related to Nicole Eisenman's "Procession"; and making buttons that reflect attendees' beliefs and passions, a nod to the political nature of many of the biennial's works.

The Musical 'The Prom' Will Close in August

Texto completo: "The Prom," a musical comedy about four underemployed New York actors who try to get some publicity by promoting acceptance for an ostracized high school lesbian in Indiana, will close its Broadway production on Aug. 11.
At the time of its closing, "The Prom" will have played 23 preview and 310 regular performances at the Longacre Theater. The stage producers are planning a national tour beginning in 2021, and the television producer Ryan Murphy has said he wants to adapt the show as a "movie event" for Netflix.
The musical opened in November to strong reviews -- in The New York Times, the critic Jesse Green called it "a joyful hoot." He said, "With its kinetic dancing, broad mugging and belty anthems, it makes you believe in musical comedy again."
The show was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including best new musical. But it came away empty-handed and has consistently struggled to break through in a competitive theatrical marketplace.
The show, which had an initial production at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta, features music by Matthew Sklar, lyrics by Chad Beguelin, and a book by Bob Martin and Mr. Beguelin, and is directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw. The lead producers are Bill Damaschke, Dori Berinstein and Jack Lane.
It was capitalized for up to $ 13.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; that money has not been recouped. Its box office grosses have been middling -- last week, it brought in $ 638,365, which is 61 percent of its potential, according to figures released by the Broadway League.

Texto completo: Headnote lyanla Vanzant brings spiritual teachings to Boston's Boch Center
Celebrated spiritual teacher lyanla Vanzant brings her wisdom to Boston on June 22 at the Boch Center Shubert Theatre. Vanzant's "Acts of Faith Remix Tour" celebrates the 25th anniversary of her book, "Acts of Faith: Meditations for People of Color." Since the spiritual resource was first published, Vanzant has becoming an Emmy-Award-winning television personality for her show "lyanla: Fix My Life" and a New York Times bestselling writer, and has founded the Inner Visions Institute for Spiritual Development.
One of the hallmarks of Vanzant's work is its specific focus on the inner lives of people of color. "The same way that we inherit our eye structure and our hair structure, we inherit emotional and spiritual propensities that are very different for people of color than they are for the rest of the world," she says.
Though Vanzant's name is now synonymous with spiritual healing, she grew into that role from a challenging childhood. After a neglected and abusive upbringing and a period living as a teenage mother on welfare in New York City, Vanzant put herself through Medgar Evers College and then City University of New York Law School. She worked as a public defender for a number of years before channeling her own experiences overcoming obstacles into her practice as an ordained minister.
"The easiest way to get your life in balance, and that's what this is all about, is to have a daily spiritual practice. We have a maintenance plan on our car, but do we have a spiritual maintenance plan for our minds?" says Vanzant. "That doesn't mean that you won't have upset or sadness or fear or anger or anything. It just means that you can recover quicker."
According to Vanzant, this spiritual practice can utilize any number of tools to clean your energy and center your mind, including, among others, sound, meditation and cleansing with essential oils.
The world has changed significantly since Vanzant put pen to paper to create "Acts of Faith." But, the teacher says, our basic human problems remain the same. "All life is about breakdown in relationships - your relationship with yourself, your relationship with the world, your relationships with others and your relationship with money," says Vanzant.
During her tour appearance at the Boch Center, Vanzant intends to bring the wisdom from "Acts of Faith" to the stage in order to assist audience members in healing their emotional wounds and empowering their spirits.
Sidebar The same way that we inherit our eye structure and our hair structure, we inherit emotional and spiritual propensities that are very different for people of color than they are for the rest of the world."

Texto completo: More than a dozen shareholder proposals failed as expected at Google's annual meeting Wednesday, but they raised important questions about the massive company, which has had its share of scandals and controversy over the past year or so.
From ethical questions raised by Google products and contracts to the company's handling of sexual harassment and treatment of contract workers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Chairman John Hennessy and other executives got an earful from disgruntled investors, advocacy groups and employees at the meeting in Sunnyvale while protesters marched outside.
Among the defeated proposals was one that sought a breakup of the company. The presenter of the proposal, a representative of Students for a Free Tibet, urged the company to take steps now "rather than waiting for antitrust regulators to act." As the internet giant faces possible U.S. antitrust inquiries and calls to break it up, she said the company has "grown to a complexity that is unmanageable."
Another proposal that failed urged the company to study and share an assessment of the human rights implications of Project Dragonfly, Google's reported plan to once again operate a search engine in China.
"As we've said, we have no plans to open a search engine in China," said Kent Walker, senior vice president for global affairs and chief legal officer for Google, during the meeting's Q&A session. CEO Sundar Pichai said in a New York Times interview in November, after employees protested and quit over the issue, "It's not even clear to me that search in China is the product we need to do today."
There were more than a few mentions of recent employee protests and actions during the meeting, including one in November when thousands of workers walked off the job in response to a report of huge payouts to executives accused of sexual misconduct and harassment. A proposal for a clawback policy, in which an executive would be forced to pay the company back in case of misconduct, did not pass, either.
After the proposal to install a non-executive employee representative on the board of directors failed, a Google employee said during the Q&A: "What's really stuck out to me recently is this shift when we're challenged," she said. "I've seen executives feign powerlessness as if we're not a company the size of some countries. We're told we can't take dramatic action. When we respond this way it's disingenuous. We're choosing to use our power to solve the wrong problems, and we can do better."
Yolanda Chavez, who spoke at the meeting as a representative of Silicon Valley Rising, expressed concerns about Google's plan for a giant campus in San Jose.
"Yesterday's announcement (a $1 billion pledge by the company to help with Bay Area housing) was a positive sign that Google is listening to the community," she said through a translator. But Chavez noted that the 5,000 in affordable-housing units Pichai mentioned in a blog post as part of the plan are needed in San Jose alone, according to a study she cited. "What's your plan to mitigate Google's impact on San Jose?"
Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat answered that "our announcement really underscores our commitment to Bay Area," and pointed to other initiatives by the company, including its philanthropic arm Google.org, which she said is working on housing, and in trying to teach digital skills.
One shareholder complained that Alphabet CEO Larry Page wasn't present. Page and Google co-founder Sergey Brin are seldom seen at public company events.
"Maybe one year he's sick," the shareholder said. "But year after year, there's no CEO here."
Because of the company's multi-class stock structure, Page and Brin together have 51 percent of voting shares, a reason shareholder resolutions fail year after year.
But they're a way to keep putting pressure on Google, which needs it, said Don Heider, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.
"There are pockets of Google working on ethics, but not an overarching commitment that's taking place," Heider said.
Heider said big tech companies including Google have asked ethicists to talk to them in the past year as they've increasingly come under fire, and one member of the center is working half-time with the company to try to help build ethics into the company's products and designs.
"It has to include the C-suite," he said. "I want to get CEOs engaged in discussions because I think we can help the model in Silicon Valley lately is build it, release it, then fix it. We're saying reconsider that model."

Texto completo: President Trump is solid gold for the news media despite his attacks that reporters are the “enemy of the people.”
The media “Trump Bump” that began when he emerged in 2016 as the leading Republican presidential candidate has continued, driving news junkies to buy more news.
Screen-Shot-2019-06-11-at-8.47.47-PM.png
According to a new report from Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, 16% in the U.S. are paying for online access to news. That has held steady since Trump emerged on the presidential stage.
A report on the study from Nieman Lab said, “following the Trump bump of 2017, the percentage of U.S. respondents who pay for news in the U.S. is stable at 16%.”
And despite the president’s assault on big liberal media outlets, they are benefiting.
The New York Times, for example, added 223,000 digital subscribers in the first quarter of 2019. It has a goal of 10 million total subscriptions by 2025.
That comes despite a growing distrust in the media, in the U.S. and worldwide, said the report. Just 32% trust the media, putting the U.S. media at 32 of 38 countries tested.

Texto completo: It's just a matter of months before recreational use of marijuana is legal in Illinois.
Do the people of Illinois really know what Gov. J.B. Pritzker and members of the General Assembly have wrought? Or are they suffering under the delusion that consuming marijuana in a variety of forms is benign, certainly not harmful and maybe even a healthy pastime?
And what about the impact on young people -- teens and young adults? They already use marijuana obtained through the underground marketplace. But consumption will jump when legalization replaces the current state of decriminalization.
Legislators have repeatedly reassured the public that they put safeguards in place, just like with alcohol, to assure the young won't be able to join the party. But that kind of rhetoric is designed for saps.
Says who? Medical experts who study the impact of marijuana on those under 25.
How ironic it is that just as Pritzker is celebrating passage of legalized marijuana that both The New York Times and The Washington Post published articles on the same day warning of this impending public health threat.
"Marijuana Damages Young Brains," write Kenneth Davis, president of the Mount Sinai Health System, and Mary Jeanne Kreek, head of the Laboratory of the Biology of Addictive Diseases at Rockefeller University, in The Times.
"Potent pot, vulnerable teens trigger concerns in first states to legalize marijuana," screams a Post headline above a story quoting psychiatrist Libby Stuart saying that "horrible things are happening to kids."
What's happening in Washington, Colorado and soon will be happening in Illinois is hardly an unanticipated consequence. Psychiatrists and addiction experts have spoken out loud and long against legalization and been ignored.
"This is an unmitigated public health disaster in the making instigated by our General Assembly and governor," said Dr. Lawrence Jeckel, a Champaign psychiatrist.
In their articles, Davis and Kreek assert that marijuana is a threat to those under 25 because their brains are still developing, "especially the prefrontal cortex, which controls decision making, judgment and impulsivity."
The chemical THC in marijuana produces "mood elevation and relaxation." But it also "interferes with the exchange of information between neurons." Heavy consumption can "permanently change neuropathways" in ways that affect "cognition, including learning, attention and emotional responses" that can lead to "long-term dependence."
Compounding that problem is the increased potency of marijuana that creates what the father of a marijuana-dependent son called "nuclear-strength weed."
Proponents of legalized marijuana, of course, dismiss the criticism as a modern-day version of "reefer madness" hysteria being promoted by the terminally un-hip.
Besotted by the prospective euphoria of smoking legal dope and convinced that it leads to nothing more serious than a case of munchies, proponents succeeded in blowing away the opposition during the recent legislative session. At the same time, legislators were transfixed by the prospect of increased revenues generated by sales of legal marijuana and the prospect of expunging the criminal records of those convicted of marijuana-related crimes.
Marijuana has generated substantial revenue in Washington and Colorado: $266 million in Colorado and $358 million in Washington for the 2018 fiscal year.
That's a lot of dough, but hardly a staggering amount in the context of the recent $40 billion budget Illinois legislators recently approved.
Cash will come pouring in to the state. A lot of people probably will get rich selling the stuff, particularly in the minority neighborhoods where state officials want many of the dispensaries to be located.
But officials at Children's Hospital Colorado report that society also can expect a jump in emergency room visits for "cyclic vomiting, paranoia, psychosis and other acute cannabis-related symptoms." What a long, strange trip it promises to be.

Undocumented workers: ‘We are not like Trump used to say’

Texto completo: A day after President Donald Trump tweeted about a new crackdown on “illegal aliens,” and hours before he launches his 2020 reelection campaign, five undocumented workers said they were employed by the Trump Organization to work at golf clubs in New York and New Jersey and pointed out what they said was the president’s hypocrisy in hiring them.
Speaking through an interpreter during a news conference at UniteHere!, a group that represents over 270,000 workers in the hospitality industry in the U.S. and Canada, the four women and one man emphasized that they are telling the truth and that they believe the Trump Organization has hired hundreds of undocumented workers but those workers are too afraid to come forward.
“We need to tell the people how Mr. Trump is treating people and the way he is doing everything wrong,” said Victorina Morales, of Guatemala, who said she worked for Trump as a housekeeper at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, from 2013 to 2018. The New York Times broke the story of undocumented workers at Trump clubs in December, featuring Morales among others.
According to the article, Morales has made the president’s bed, cleaned his toilet and dusted his crystal golf trophies. Because of the “outstanding” support she provided Trump during his visits, Morales was given a certificate from the White House Communications Agency inscribed with her name.
Also featured in the article was Sandra Diaz, from Costa Rica, who worked as a housekeeper between 2010 and 2014. “We are honorable people and we are here telling you the truth,” Diaz said.
Morales and Diaz said they worked for years as part of a group of housekeeping, maintenance and landscaping employees at the golf club that included a number of undocumented workers, according to the article. Although there is no evidence that the president or the Trump Organization executives knew of their immigration status, at least two supervisors at the club were aware and took steps to help workers evade detection and keep their jobs, according to the article.
The workers and their attorney said they were not aware of any undocumented workers at Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private club in Palm Beach, or at Trump International Golf Club near West Palm Beach or Trump National Jupiter.
“We are here to let you know we are not like Trump used to say, that we are not drug traffickers and this kind of bad people,” said Margarita Cruz, of Mexico, who worked as a housekeeper at Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, New York, between 2010 and 2019. “We are honorable people, honest people just here for work.”
Attorney Anibal Romero, who represents 44 undocumented Trump workers, said he was deluged with calls from workers after the story broke. However, many are afraid to come forward.
“If we are supposed to be afraid of them, how can we give them the key to house to do our laundry, to cook our food, to take care of our grandchildren?” Romero said. “That is what some of these people were doing for the Trump family for many, many years.”
The news conference followed a tweet by Trump on Monday night warning of mass deportation of “illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United State. They will be removed as fast as they come in.” The tweet again ratcheted up an issue that has been a staple of Trump’s brand of politics, immigration.
Romero said he believes the president posted the tweet because he is afraid of the workers and knew they were speaking in Orlando before his rally.
“This is the one story the administration doesn’t talk about,” Romero said. “The undocumented immigrants who worked for Donald Trump in his house for many many years. These are the same people he vilifies.”
As for the status of the five workers, all remain undocumented and in the country illegally. As for why they have not been deported, attorney David Leopold, who also represents the workers, said he suspects “Trump knows and the administration knows these people have been the victims of crime. But that’s a good question.”

Here's Trump's winning message for 2020

Texto completo: President Trump launched his reelection campaign last night. It’s obviously anyone’s guess whether he can win. But if you’re getting your news from CNN, MSNBC, or the New York Times, you’re probably convinced at this point that he’s about to be impeached.
Assuming you see through such laughable disinformation, you’re probably aware that for all his sins, Trump has a pretty clear path to reelection.
First, he needs to take credit for the economy, and also avoid messing it up. Unemployment is at a historic low point, wages are up for lower-income workers, and the situation is especially good for black and Hispanic Americans. Trump, who as a reality star was popular outside the traditional conservative crowd, needs to continue making the most of this.
Yes, it’s always doubtful when presidents try to take credit for the economy. After all, economies rise and fall with business cycles and based on millions of individual choices. Former President Barack Obama was notorious for acting as if he had put the oil and gas in the ground that made the fracking revolution possible. But Trump can at least credibly make the case that, after years of relative stagnation under Obama, his deregulatory actions and tax cuts have allowed businesses to thrive.
Second, Trump needs to take credit for his accomplishments in foreign policy. Because as much as people complain about Trump’s brusque style in dealing with other nations, it has gotten good results in a number of important areas. Sometimes you just need a bull inside the china shop before you can get results.
For example, Trump may not be the most popular U.S. president in Europe, but he has successfully bludgeoned free-riding NATO countries into increasing their non-personnel defense spending. Although many allied nations are still falling short of their obligations, they had increased spending from 2016 to the beginning of this year by 4% overall in real terms, or more than $40 billion.
Trump has also successfully persuaded Mexico to stem the unmanageable tide of Central American migrants seeking to game the asylum system at the southern border. Although Trump’s threat of tariffs against Mexico drew a negative reaction from American businesses and from us, Mexico was persuaded and is now helping.
The jury is still out on Trump’s ambitious diplomatic outreach to North Korea and his brinkmanship with tariffs against China. But North Korea is at least not engaging in nearly as many threatening weapons tests, and Trump seems on pace to force China into making a fair deal.
The challenge for Trump over the next year is to continue restraining and constricting Iran’s terrorist regime without forcing a direct military confrontation. After all, Trump promised to keep his nation out of war, and a key part of his appeal involves keeping that promise.
Trump’s third card is the easiest one to play, and one he enjoys playing. He just needs to point out that the Democrats have lost their minds on his watch. They have chosen a moment of unprecedented peace and prosperity to go down the rabbit hole of the much-discredited, often murderous, and always failing ideology of socialism. Where any sensible person would leave well enough alone, they have promised to raise taxes and return to stagnation. They have abandoned the public consensus on abortion, deciding it must be legal up to and beyond the moment of birth, and also funded by the taxpayer. They have embraced anti-scientific gender ideology, and cheer the persecution of Christian bakers.
Even while talking from one side of their mouths about the rights of religious minorities, they wear their anti-religious bigotry on their sleeves, declaring that entire faith communities — faithful Roman Catholics, especially — should be excluded from public life entirely and especially from the U.S. judicial branch.
Trump remains the chaotic figure he always was, and that has always put people off. But he has to convince the public that the nation’s trajectory under his leadership — so long as you ignore the frenzied and often fake day-to-day news coverage — is just fine. To the extent that he can make that case to voters, he will gather support for 2020. And if he gets distracted with other irrelevant messages, he will fail.

Texto completo: A New York congressman called Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusets Sen. Elizabeth Warren "patronizing" for wading into the local race for Queens district attorney.
Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, who represents New York’s 5th Congressional District comprised mainly of Queens, issued a statement Wednesday condemning the two Democratic presidential candidates for endorsing Tiffany Cabán for Queens district attorney.
"I don't know who they spoke with, but clearly they did not speak with the elected officials of Queens County, or the people who elected them," Meeks said. Meeks has endorsed one of Cabán's opponents, Melinda Katz, who is white. Cabán is of Puerto Rican descent.
"African American voters are tired of the patronizing and tired of the arrogance. If they want to be the president for all Americans I suggest they speak with us before they decide to speak for us," Meeks added.
Tweet
The district attorney race has pulled in high-profile endorsements for both Cabán and Katz. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Cabán, while her 2018 opponent, former Rep. Joe Crowley, is backing Katz.
Cabán also secured a deflated endorsement from the New York Times, which called her "the best pick" of a disappointing field.

Texto completo: Conservative talker Mark Levin’s gutting of the liberal media’s bias and hate of President Trump in his latest book continues to dominate the New York Times best seller list, now for a fourth week.
Unfreedom of the Press has sold some 300,000 copies over all forms, hardcover, ebook, eaudio.
“Breaking News, as they say! For the 4th week in a row UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS is #1 on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction hardcover books and ebooks! Thank you Levinites!” Levin tweeted.
Levin told Secrets that he isn’t surprised with his book remaining at No. 1. “The public is furious with the left’s hijacking the media and want some answers. I think my book provides those answers,” he said.
Tweet
In announcing his reelection bid, Trump immediately attacked the media with charges of “fake news media,” and his crowd cheered. CNN stopped covering the speech when the crowd started chanting “CNN Sucks!”
Levin still has a way to go to top his blockbuster book Liberty & Tyranny that had the top spot for three months. The host of the Mark Levin Show on radio and Levin TV on Blaze TV, he has written 8 books, all NYT bestsellers and the last 6 in row ranking No. 1.
Behind him on the Times list are books from Howard Stern, former first lady Michelle Obama, historian David McCullough and CNN reporter Jim Acosta.
Considering that “ferocious competition,” he said his success has been “terrific.”
His recently told Secrets that his goal is not to destroy the liberal press but to nudge it away from being one-sided and driven to promote progressives and their policies.
“If newsrooms and journalists do not act forthwith and with urgency to ‘fundamentally transform’ their approach to journalism, which, sadly, is highly unlikely, their credibility will continue to erode and may well reach a point soon where it is irreparably damaged with a large portion of the citizenry, and rightly so,” he penned in the book.
He concluded, “The media will not only marginalize themselves but they will continue to be the greatest threat to freedom of the press today — not President Trump or his administration, but the current practitioners of what used to be journalism.”

Hal Boyd: A Latter-day Saint examines the conservative civil war

Texto completo: Yesterday in The New York Times; last week in The Atlantic; a week before that in First Things, National Review, The American Conservative; and, yes, once more, in The New York Times, an intramural feud within the dandruff-caked world of the conservative commentariat trickled into the broader public discourse.
The hard-to-define dispute is (mostly) about what posture the religious right — and the conservative movement generally — should take toward the current liberal democratic order, which some view as hostile to traditional religious values.
The ballyhoo began when commentator Sohrab Ahmari fired an intellectual shot at fellow conservative writer David French. Ahmari, the op-ed editor at the New York Post, recently published a memoir, "From Fire, by Water," detailing his conversion to Roman Catholicism. French, meanwhile, is an evangelical Christian and an Iraq war veteran, probably best known in Latter-day Saint circles for co-authoring the book, "Why Evangelicals Should Support Mitt Romney (And Feel Good About It!)."
So what’s Ahmari’s issue with French?
Well, Ahmari believes that “for French,” and for those like him, “the solution to nearly every problem posed by … individual autonomy … is yet more autonomous action.” Ahmari contends that simply backing religious morality as a matter of mere personal or social preference will be insufficient to compete with unrelenting cultural forces and economic systems intent on foisting vice on a sometimes unwitting populous.
As Ahmari puts it, “sentimentalization of family life won’t be enough to overcome the challenges posed to it by the present economy. Calls for religious revival are often little more than an idle wish that all men become moral.”
In short, Ahmari (whose memoir is critical of the way religion and government mix within the Middle East) seems to be not only open to government action on a suite of moral issues but downright advocatory.
To his credit, Ahmari is clear-eyed that government can’t resolve every problem.
But, his bullishness doesn’t seem to fully appreciate — despite the 20th century’s more-than-flirtatious history with totalitarianism — how many evils are birthed by well-intentioned strong-arming.
Ahmari may be justified in taking “issue with David French-ism’s almost supernatural faith in something called ‘culture’ — deemed to be neutral and apolitical and impervious to policy — to solve everything.”
Certainly, we cannot live on culture alone. In the spirit of full disclosure: I’m religious. And, I absolutely believe religion is normatively a wise choice. In fact, I think it’s the wise choice.
But, I also become concerned when I read — not from Ahmari himself, but from supporters — offensive comments characterizing the push for robust pluralism as surrendering “the public square … to the pagans and the perverts.”
I agree that our citizenry must match raw autonomy with morality, and liberty with responsibility. In this sense, government can play a part.
I’ve generally been laudatory of Utah’s legal regime when, at its best, it seeks to balance a reverence for human agency with prudent checks on the corrosive effects of social ills — gambling, DUIs, underage drinking, etc.
This trajectory seems to be aligned with Franklin Roosevelt’s declaration: “In teaching this democratic faith to American children, we need the sustaining, buttressing aid of those great ethical religious teachings which are the heritage of our modern civilization. For ‘not upon strength nor upon power, but upon the spirit of God’ shall our democracy be founded.”
So, you might ask, if we need religion so much to help sustain society, why not impose it a bit more? Why not, as some have recently advocated, start looking to Russia or Hungary as potential models in this regard?
For Christians, at least, the answer may be embedded within our own faith tradition. On this point, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s enduring reflection on faith and freedom in "The Brothers Karamazov" is instructive.
You’ll recall that, within the episode titled "The Grand Inquisitor," Jesus Christ comes back to earth during the period of the inquisition. He begins performing miracles and the people recognize him. Soon, however, the clergy of the day bring Christ in, and the Inquisitor lectures him on why the church ecclesiastics were forced to correct the “errors” he made during his temptations in the desert. The New Testament records that after 40 days of fasting, Satan came tempting Christ to turn stones into loaves, to cast himself down from the temple pinnacle and have the angels bear him up, and, finally, to assume the kingdoms of the earth in exchange for worshiping the tempter.
Professor Simon Critchley writes that Christ’s rejection of Satan’s temptations is the rebuffing of “three potent forces: miracle, mystery and authority .”
These three forces are salient in wielding political power — the first represents endless bread, or the promise of economic superfluity. Combined with authority and mystery, this unholy trio has often been used to legitimate the subjugation of many under the rule of the few.
“What Satan promises Jesus in the last temptation,” Critchley continues, “is complete political authority, the dream of a universal state. Namely, that one no longer has to render to God what is God’s and to Caesar what is Caesar’s. Temporal and eternal power can be unified under one catholic theological and political authority with the avowed aim of assuring universal happiness, harmony and unity.”
And yet, Christ resists.
So, back to Dostoevsky . In the story, the Inquisitor tells Christ that the church has finally corrected his "error" — that is, it has leveraged miracle, mystery and authority to take away freedom and, at last, to put an end to human rebellion to "make them happy."
The reader senses that Christ — who only answers the inquisitor with a kiss at the end — doesn’t believe that true obedience or happiness are gained from the sword or the dole.
But the inquisitor rails: "Oh, never, never, will they learn to feed themselves without our help! No science will ever give them bread so long as they remain free, so long as they refuse to lay that freedom at our feet, and say: 'Enslave, but feed us!'”
And, yet, a resounding message from the gospels is that the bread of heaven is only purchased through grace and the incremental labors of moral agency.
Fears that today's liberal order leads too many away from God are genuine; so too are concerns that the religious aren’t doing enough to combat the trends.
But before we seek to bargain away freedom in order to "make men happy,” we might first seek to do the arduous, but redemptive work of rendering unto God what is his in the varied vines and fig trees he’s so generously planted in the soil of American liberty.

Men's abortion stories should be heard too

Texto completo: Norman Pearlstine, executive editor of the Los Angeles Times, has written an essay about his college girlfriend's abortion, which nearly killed her. Eventually they married, he writes, but they were never able to conceive because of the damage to her uterus.
The abortion was 57 years ago, pre-Roe v. Wade, and was performed by an osteopath working out of an office in south Philadelphia.
"I have mostly kept this story to myself, and even now, I find it difficult to write or talk about it," Pearlstine writes. "I believe many men, under similar circumstances, have shared my preference for silence while encouraging women to assert their reproductive rights."
That may be starting to change.
On Friday, the Chicago Sun-Times published a column by Mark Brown about an ex-girlfriend's abortion "a long time ago in a place that seems far away."
"That's a memory I normally keep pushed way back in the recesses of my mind," Brown writes. "It's something I try not to think about and never discuss."
Until now.
"Because it's weighing on my mind more than ever these days with abortion so much in the news, as some states move to criminalize it, while Illinois pushes back in the opposite direction - both sides anticipating a potential Supreme Court reversal of Roe v. Wade," Brown writes. "Also because I keep thinking that, for every woman who has an abortion, there was a man somewhere in the equation, his part an unexplored secret."
Two op-eds do not a groundswell make. But it struck me, reading them back-to-back, that they are the first male voices I've read sharing their abortion stories.
Women have been sharing theirs with increasing frequency in the past five years, as reproductive rights are debated on a state and national level, as Planned Parenthood funding comes under fire, as the #MeToo movement keeps power and sex and gender and stigma swimming among the cultural waters.
Writer Lindy West and her friend Amelia Bonow created a #ShoutYour Abortion Twitter campaign in 2015, which hundreds upon hundreds of women joined. The stories have been made into a book of essays and photos, titled "Shout Your Abortion."
U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, published an op-ed in Thursday's New York Times about an abortion she had 22 years ago.
Activist Gloria Steinem dedicated her 2015 memoir, "My Life on the Road," to the doctor who performed her abortion in 1957. In her 2018 memoir, "In Pieces," Sally Field writes about her abortion at age 17, which she traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, to obtain.
Even in fiction, abortion is frequently explored as a plot device, a turning point, an agonizing, life-altering decision. Usually through the lens of a woman.
I hope we hear from more men. We need their voices in the mix. I want to hear their fears and hopes and what-if's and sadness and gratitude and every other emotion that abortion triggers in humans, and not just humans with wombs.
"A recent Pew Research Center poll shows there isn't a significant difference between the number of women (60%) and men (57%) who think abortion should be legal," Pearlstine writes in his LA Times op-ed. "Still, most pro-choice men view the campaign for abortion rights as a 'women's issue,' even though we must, obviously, share responsibility for unwanted pregnancies.
"Bestsellers like 'Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women' have understandably given priority to women's voices," Pearlstine continues. "Pregnancy and childbearing create physical risks for women, not men. In doing so, they may have, inadvertently, reinforced the silence of men who respect women's autonomy, while so many of their patriarchal counterparts routinely speak out against abortion."
There's room for both male and female voices on this topic. There are male and female stories, too many to count, on this topic. We need to hear them, I believe, in order to fully understand this topic.
I hope we're at the beginning of a movement within a movement.

Texto completo: PARIS -- Investigators in France detained Michel Platini, the former European soccer federation president, on Tuesday to question him about the awarding of the 2022 men's World Cup to Qatar, a decision made almost a decade ago that continues to roil the sport.
Platini, 63, met with prosecutors in Paris to discuss the circumstances of his vote for Qatar -- a desert nation smaller than Connecticut but with the largest per capita income in the world -- over other venues, including the United States. While Platini is not technically under arrest, the nature of his detention meant it was up to the authorities to decide when he would be free to leave.
A spokesman for Platini, citing his lawyer William Bourdon, said that Platini was not under arrest but was being heard as a witness. In a statement, the spokesman said that other matters had also been under discussion, including the awarding of the 2016 European soccer championship to France, a decision made while Platini was in charge of the sport on the continent as UEFA president.
"He has nothing to reproach himself about," the statement added.
Platini, a French former midfield great who won the Ballon d'Or three times during his playing career, was barred from soccer for four years in 2015 after an investigation into a payment of 2 million Swiss francs, or about $ 2 million, authorized by Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, the world governing body of soccer. Blatter has also been barred.
The 2010 vote on the hosting rights for the 2018 World Cup, which was granted to Russia, and the 2022 edition, which went to Qatar, had increased scrutiny on FIFA's decision makers long before an American indictment unmasked corruption at the governing body dating back more than two decades.
More than half of the 22 FIFA administrators involved in the final vote for those World Cup venues have faced accusations of wrongdoing, and many subsequently received bans from soccer.
French investigators have been looking into accusations of corruption connected to bids for the two World Cups for about three years and have spoken to other officials, including Blatter. A separate investigation is continuing in Switzerland, where the authorities have revealed little since they removed troves of data from the Zurich headquarters of FIFA in 2015.
The focus on Platini stems from a lunch at the Élysée Palace with Nicolas Sarkozy, then the French president, a month before the vote to decide where the World Cups would be held. At that meeting, several Qataris, including Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, now the emir of Qatar, were present. That led to speculation in France and elsewhere that Sarkozy, seeking multibillion-dollar contracts for French companies in Qatar, had sought Platini's support to swing the World Cup vote in the Middle Eastern country's favor.
Blatter said in a 2015 interview with The Financial Times that Platini had told him ahead of the World Cup vote that he had switched his plans at the behest of Sarkozy.
"I am no longer in your picture because I have been told by the head of state that we should consider the situation of France," Blatter recalled Platini telling him. The plan had been to vote for Russia and the United States, Blatter said.
Platini has always denied that he was swayed by Sarkozy, whose former chief of staff, Claude Guéant, was also detained for questioning on Tuesday. This month, in an interview with The New York Times, Platini reiterated that the decision to pick Qatar had been his alone.
In the interview, Platini said of the lunch that he had been expecting to have a private meeting with Sarkozy and that he had been surprised when he found the Qataris had also been invited. "I came to tell him face to face that I will choose Qatar and Russia," Platini said, adding that he immediately contacted Blatter to tell him what had happened. FIFA's rules, Platini said, meant meetings with bidding nations had to be cleared beforehand.
"After, I called Blatter to tell him I am in big trouble because I have lunch, I didn't know there were the Qataris at the lunch with Sarkozy," he added. The French authorities previously questioned Platini in December 2017.
Platini has said he was considering voting for the United States to host the World Cup. But he ultimately backed Qatar, even though billions of dollars of infrastructure would be needed to allow the Middle Eastern nation to host the event. FIFA's own inspectors had deemed that the summer temperatures there would be dangerous.
But Platini said he picked Qatar to give the Arab world a chance to host soccer's showpiece for the first time, after previous bids from Morocco and Egypt had failed.
"It's seven times the Arabs have lost the World Cup," he said.
After the vote, FIFA decided to upend a soccer calendar that had been in place since 1930, switching the dates of the World Cup in 2022 to winter, avoiding the sweltering summer temperatures in the Middle East but causing mayhem for European soccer leagues, which will have three seasons disrupted because of the change.
Qatar's bid team faced accusations of wrongdoing before and after the decision to grant the country the World Cup was taken. The country's leaders have consistently denied acting improperly and regularly point to a two-year FIFA investigation that failed to find evidence that it had cheated.

Texto completo: Should we eat food that exists because of circumstances we find morally reprehensible? I recently posed this question in a story after learning that Peet's — producer of Major Dickason's Blend, my daily brew — is owned by a company, JAB Holding, with Nazi ties. (Its portfolio also includes Stumptown, Intelligentsia, Panera, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Krispy Kreme, and more.) Previous honchos Albert Reimann Sr. and Albert Reimann Jr. had actively supported the Third Reich, and they built their fortune utilizing Nazi Germany's forced-labor system.
The UK-based Mail on Sunday broke the story in September 2018, when JAB was on the verge of acquiring sandwich chain Pret a Manger. But no one took much notice until March, when German tabloid Bild Am Sonntag reported on the company's past, coupled with an announcement that the Reimann family would donate about $11 million to charity as a result. Which charity? What was the timeline for the donation? The Reimanns are reportedly Germany's second-richest family, with a fortune estimated at about $37 billion last year. What is the price tag for atonement?
Some of these questions were answered last week, when a New York Times story announced that the money will be donated to “institutions that help former forced laborers and their families." The article also told the complicated story of the Reimanns' ancestry: Albert Jr. had an affair with a half-Jewish woman named Emilie Landecker and later adopted their three children, who today are partial owners of JAB. The Reimanns are renaming their family foundation after Alfred Landecker, Emilie's Jewish father, who was deported in 1942 and murdered by the Nazis, the New York Times reported. The Alfred Landecker Foundation will have an annual budget of about $28 million, used to “raise awareness of the Holocaust and support and promote projects in research and education, designed to uphold the memory of all the victims of the Nazis," according to the foundation's website.
I am not sure how much more one could ask of a company aiming to make up for its Nazi past, short of bowing out of business entirely. Many German companies have similar histories and have done much less, without the same transparency. (Companies including Bayer, BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens, and Volkswagen did contribute to the Foundation EVZ — the acronym for “Remembrance, Responsibility, and Future" in German — which paid restitution to former forced laborers from 2001 to 2007 and continues to work on related projects.) The Reimanns commissioned a report looking into the family's past in 2014, years before it became public, an indication of sincere motives beyond mere damage control. The New York Times story quotes Reimann Jr.'s grandson Martin, who is 30 years old: born the year the Berlin Wall fell and more than four decades after the end of the Nazi regime. Post-World War II generations of Germans have interrogated the actions of their forebears. Now far-right ideologies are on the rise again, in their country, and in ours, and beyond. We need as many Alfred Landecker Foundations as we can get.
So next time I run out of coffee, I won't mind buying from Peet's. But it is no longer my main brew, for reasons that have less to do with ethics than possibilities. After the initial story ran, so many of you wrote to tell me about your favorite coffee companies (or the ones you own) — Allegro, Birds & Beans, Dean's Beans, Equal Exchange, George Howell Coffee, Indigo Coffee, Karma Coffee, Mystic Coffee Roaster, Recreo, Redeye Coffee Roasters, Six Depot, Vermont Artisan Coffee & Tea Co., Virgin Hill Coffee Roasters, Wicked Joe, and many more. Some of them I've tried; others I'd never heard of. It will take me many mornings to work my way through them all.

Texto completo: Tom Steyer isn't done pressuring US Representative Richard Neal to demand Donald Trump's tax returns. The billionaire activist's group Need to Impeach put up two billboards Friday in the Springfield Democrat's district that read, “Rep. Neal, Get Trump's Taxes Now."
Wait — didn't Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, already ask for those tax returns? Indeed, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly declined to hand them over.
But this time, Steyer is hounding Neal for indicating he wouldn't use a bill passed by the New York Legislature to obtain them, according to a Need to Impeach spokesperson.
The bill — awaiting Governor Andrew Cuomo's signature — would allow Congress to obtain Trump's tax returns upon request.
Daniel Rubin, a spokesperson for the Ways and Means Committee, has said that the committee is focusing on Trump's federal returns. “Our request to the Internal Revenue Service was in furtherance of an investigation into the mandatory presidential audit program at the I.R.S.," he told the New York Times in May.
Rubin did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
The billboards will run until next Thursday and are part of a campaign targeting 11 districts — including Neal's — to urge representatives to support impeachment.
Steyer has spent more than $250,000 in Neal's district on television ads and billboards, and hosted an impeachment town hall in Springfield in March.

John Cusack shows how anti-Zionism is a gateway drug to anti-Semitism

Texto completo: In a rather embarrassing spectacle, actor John Cusack was forced to apologize after he sent out an virulently anti-Semitic tweet. Though he may be just a dumb actor, the episode is a demonstration of how easily harboring deep hatred of Israel can lead somebody to spread anti-Semitism.
This is a pattern of behavior that we've seen manifest itself at the New York Times, on college campuses, in the halls of Congress, and in the violence directed at Jews throughout the world.
The latest controversy occurred Monday night when Cusack, the 1980s movie icon, sent out a tweet that could have come out of the Nazi propaganda archives. It featured a giant arm with a Jewish Star of David, with the hand literally crushing a group of people. It features a quote attributed to Voltaire, "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize." In reality, Voltaire never said that, and it's actually a quote that most people attribute to neo-Nazi Holocaust denier Kevin Storm.
If the illustration that Jews were crushing people and controlling the world weren't enough, Cusack had to add, "Follow the money."
John Cusack Anti-Semitic Meme
As Yashar Ali cataloged, before claiming a "bot" got him, Cusack's initial reaction was to defend his posting of the Neo-Nazi image as merely legitimate criticism of Israel:
Tweet
His eventual excuse read, "A bot got me- I thought I was endorsing a pro Palestinian justice retweet - of an earlier post - it came I think from a different source -
Shouldn’t Have retweeted."
This is obviously not plausible, but still telling that his excuse also involved the idea that he was merely intending to support "Palestinian justice."
Even the most charitable interpretation -- that Cusack merely meant to criticize Israel, and that he's a not very bright -- is a good example of how the fostering of hatred of Israel can lead people to embrace anti-Semitism. As I've noted many times, criticism of actual Israeli policies is one thing, but the excessive demonization of the Jewish nation can easily lead people to spread some of the worst anti-Semitic stereotypes and also to the targeting of Jews.
It's more than Hollywood celebrities who are susceptible to this garbage.
We saw it with the New York Times which published a blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon in its international edition, which no editors picked up upon, because it was seen as an attempt to criticize U.S. policy toward Israel. We see it in the anti-Semitism crisis taking over the British Labor Party. We see it at U.S. colleges, where anti-Semitic incidents were eight times more likely at campuses that had at least one anti-Zionist group, such as Students for Justice in Palestine. We see it in Germany, where a court ruled that the attempted firebombing of a synagogue was merely an expression of protest against Israeli actions in Gaza. We see it in the anti-Semitism that engulfed the Women's March and the D.C. Dyke March. And thanks to Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and her enablers, we're seeing it in the halls of Congress.
If Cusack and others are so consumed with hatred for Israel that they cannot avoid accidentally promoting neo-Nazi propaganda, excluding Jews, assaulting Jews, and spreading age old sterotypes about Jews, they seriously need to rethink things.

News media is making a mistake on Biden

Texto completo: As Iowa journalist Robert Leonard talks to voters around his state, he finds himself baffled at the national portrayal of Joe Biden's dominance in the presidential campaign.
The local Democrats he encounters respect the former vice president, he told me, but many of them also feel his time has passed.
They're far more excited about other candidates, five in particular: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachsetts; Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke; and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.
So he shakes his head at the extensive coverage and commentary that depicts Biden as almost a shoo-in for a nomination that's more than a year away.
One example: CNN's morning briefing newsletter recently called Biden "the most formidable threat to President Donald Trump's re-election chances.
CNN is far from alone. It's common across the national media to see Biden pegged as the safest candidate for Democrats to put up to unseat Trump. He's got that secret sauce: electability.
"Sure, Democrats think he's electable, but they believe a half-dozen other candidates are, too, Leonard, the news director of two Iowa radio stations, told me. "No one I have spoken with sees Biden as more formidable than other top candidates.
But this thinking - much of it driven by early polling - creates a self-perpetuating effect: Biden is the front-runner, so he gets more news coverage.
"Joe Biden has done something no other Democrat has been able to do in this race: Command attention from all cable networks, and have them stream his entire event live, Washington Post political reporter Matt Viser tweeted last week during Biden's Iowa visit.
That coverage decision captures the electability delusion in action - and it cuts both ways.
Was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez seen as electable?
Certainly not. Not until the Democrat rolled to victory last year in her New York City primary against entrenched incumbent Rep. Joseph Crowley and soon afterward became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Some news outlets didn't even have her photograph available on election night; and The New York Times, her hometown newspaper, hadn't written a full profile of her during the campaign.
Was Hillary Clinton seen as electable?
More than electable, she was inevitable - the crowned queen of 2016, from about 2013 on. Until, of course, she wasn't.
"So-called electability is no more a science than astrology. Indeed, it is often little more than calcified prejudice, Boston-based political activist Jonathan Cohn wrote recently.
On one level, seeing Biden this way is understandable. The former vice president is out front in poll after poll.
On another level, it's downright unfair to other candidates at this early stage - and it may be dangerous to the Democrats' quest to unseat Trump.
Salons Amanda Marcotte finds it troubling to see Trump going after Biden with nicknames and other attacks, but not because she feels sorry for the former vice president.
No, her theory is that Trump - with his unerring instinct for steering the media caravan - is focusing on Biden because he knows the former veep may be relatively easier to beat.
"Biden's centrism, his big mouth, his age and out-of-touchness, and his handsiness sets him up to be beset with a both sides are the same, so don't vote' campaign targeting the same voters who sat out 2016, she tweeted.
When I followed up with her, Marcotte wrote me: "I don't have a problem with calling him the front-runner at all, since that's just a fact, but I do think it's unfair to take his political argument for himself (electability') as a fact instead of an opinion/argument. (The Washington Post has decided, for now, not to use the term "front-runner for Biden in its news coverage, according to an all-newsroom memo in May from National Editor Steven Ginsberg, "given the continued volatility among the candidates at this early stage. Some other news organizations are showing similar restraint.)
Wasn't former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush looking pretty electable early in the 2016 Republican primary campaign? Conversely, before the 2008 election, weren't pundits busy doubting whether the United States was ready to elect a black president?
Wrong, and wrong again.
For months now, I've heard network news chiefs, and political editors and reporters of all stripes, insist - often as they sat on soul-searching journalism panels - that it would be different this time: less horse race, more listening to the American people's concerns.
To their credit, there does seem to be more effort to talk to voters in the field, all across the country, not just in the Acela corridor of New York City to Washington.
Certainly, campaign staffs are bigger than ever at many news organizations. But that often leads to more horse-race coverage, rather than a deeper understanding of communities.
The excitement about the latest polls puts all that reporting effort in the background - even though it's too early for polls to be very meaningful, at least when forecasting the general election.
Combine that with the unquenchable thirst for a narrative, a simple story for savvy journalists to tell news consumers, and before you know it, you've got the pseudoscience of electability. Cable news pundits, although not alone, are especially culpable.
The lust for narrative often comes with a hefty side order of unexamined sexism, as in: "Biden's more electable than Warren or Harris because Democrats already tried running a woman and failed.
We don't know that, and it may be dead wrong.
The truth is that journalists and pundits are bad at predictions. They should have learned that when Trump - a candidate so manifestly unsuited to be president that he couldn't possibly win - blew their minds by doing just that.

Democrats must be daring

Texto completo: In presidential politics, timing is everything.
It is all about being the right candidate for right now. What you have or have not done is less important than how your sensibilities align with the cycle.
And every election is different, which makes efforts to graph the lessons of previous elections onto a current one a somewhat futile and fruitless exercise. Yes, there are some things that change slowly like demographics, but the mood of the electorate is not one of them.
Every electorate is shaped by and responds to not only the wind at their backs but also by whatever is blowing in their faces. Should an incumbent be unseated or saved? Is it an election for change or for continuity?
The problem is that voters figure out the true contours of a race only once voting and caucusing begin. The race at the beginning - the leading candidates and the most resonant issue - is often unrecognizably different from the race at the end.
This is why I take all current poll and prognosticating about the 2020 race with a grain of salt. It's not that I don't believe the polls. To the contrary, I very much do. I am not one of those who threw this legitimate scientific tool out with the 2016 bath water.
But being a person who follows polling, I know that everything the polls capture now is subject to extreme alterations as the race progresses. Current polls simply capture a moment in time, and this moment is too far away from the only moment that truly matters: Election Day.
Never forget that there was a time during the last election cycle when Ben Carson led the Republican field of contenders.
That said, it is interesting to see who the Democratic candidates line up and to consider which of them best fit this moment. Much of what is driving early responses is electability and familiarity, or name recognition. That will surely change. Also, media coverage will change. The insurgent candidate simply makes a better story than the establishment one. David is always the hero in his fight against Goliath. The very root of "news" is "new." The journalist is always asking, what's new, what's changed, what's surprising, what's unexpected, what's shocking, what's refreshing?
As much as some people may believe that the media seeks to defend establishment candidates and assist in their coronations, the opposite is often true. The establishment candidate is subjected to a withering scrutiny from which the insurgent is often spared. I believe that this is one of the reasons that Donald Trump is president today.
As for Democratic voters themselves, they in particular have a conundrum: Do they take the safest route to unseating Trump and back a candidate like Joe Biden, even if they aren't extremely enthusiastic about him as a candidate, or do they choose a candidate who wants to return the country to a pre-Trump normality or one who sees resistance to Trump as the perfect springboard to remaking the country?
Do they choose a candidate who appeals to - and reflects - the diversity of the Democratic Party itself, or do they choose the best candidate to appeal to the white working-class voters the party lost to Trump?
Do you follow your head or your heart? Do you dare to dream or dare not for fear of gambling that conviction cannot overcome caution?
I fear that too many Democrats, understandably traumatized by the unconscionable reality of the Trump presidency, are now leaning toward their safest candidates rather than their favorite ones.
I fear that Democrats may well produce a nominee who has to struggle in the same way that Hillary Clinton did in the general election to ignite enthusiasm in core constituencies that struggled to get excited about her.
For instance, people now point to Biden's strong support among African-American voters. In the last election, black people overwhelmingly supported Clinton, but on Election Day she faced an enthusiasm deficit, particularly among younger black voters.
I say that Democrats have to ask themselves who they really are and what they truly believe. Do they truly believe in diversity, body autonomy, equity and egalitarianism? Do they truly want to reshape American society - its economy, its political system, its racial and wealth caste systems, its approach to world issues like trade and climate change?
Whatever the answers to those questions are, I believe that Democrats must have the intestinal fortitude to follow that.
Politics is a war of ideas. If you don't believe in the strength of your weapon, you are destined to lose. If you limp into battle cowering and afraid, you are destined to lose. If your leading warrior isn't one who inspires the troops but is the one default general simply because he came of age in the arena, you are bound to lose.
Democrats have a field full of amazing talent, visionary ideas and refreshing new characters. It would truly be a shame to eschew that out of spinelessness.

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison? A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones. Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books
Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint soon was acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people
In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. "Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. "I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books."
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali
While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do.' And he would look up and recognize a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number
After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey.' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s
"Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no.'"
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men.' He said. 'Yes, but.' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but.' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You."
She got the money.

A 21ST-CENTURY AFFLICTION U.S. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY IS TAKING ON SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION

Texto completo: Addiction is actually the point. That's what social media shareholders are investing in."
The accusation came last month from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., in a speech at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. While some politicians have argued for years that tech giants such as Facebook are dangerous for the economy, Mr. Hawley's argument is that they are dangerous for us as people, creating "a society increasingly defined not by the genuine and personal love of family and church, but by the cold and judgmental world of social media."
Are Mr. Hawley's concerns about the downstream social effects of these platforms warranted? Research is in its infancy, and the early results are mixed. However, I see a consensus starting to emerge. The findings from a recent article in the journal Psychiatric Quarterly by psychologists Jean Twenge and W. Keith Campbell are typical, showing an enormous negative association in adolescents between heavy social media (and other digital media use) and life satisfaction. In their words, "Heavy users ... of digital media were 48% to 171% more likely [than light users] to be unhappy, to be in low in well-being, or to have suicide risk factors such as depression, suicidal ideation or past suicide attempts."
Of course, correlation isn't causation, and it's theoretically possible that depressed teens are simply more likely than their peers to engage in heavy social-media use. The best way to sort this out is to use experimental methods - as with drug tests - where social media is randomly assigned to people and the effects compared with those of a control group.
A few studies have done this. For instance, last year, University of Pennsylvania researchers reported in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology on their study of undergraduate students randomly assigned to one group with dramatically limited use of social media - 10 minutes per day on each of three platforms, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat - while a control group was given unlimited social-media use. The result: Compared with the control group, "the limited use group showed significant reductions in loneliness and depression over three weeks."
The research to date has generally focused on young people, for the same reason that we are most concerned about the marketing of any addictive product to children: We don't consider them responsible for their habits and thus must protect them from exploitation. But many adults confess that they worry about the effects of excessive social-media use on themselves. In my professional world, I have seen heavy Twitter use lay to waste the reputations of respected journalists and utterly consume the productive time of great scholars.
It's not as if this is the first time we have seen the negative properties of communication technology. Consider the telephone. Going back nearly 150 years to the time of the phone's invention, The New York Times argued in 1876 that when the telephone became ubiquitous, people would no longer go out in public, creating a societal breakdown. "The telephone, by bringing music and ministers into every home, will empty the concert-halls and the churches," The Times said. "The telephone may really be a device of the enemies of the Republic."
The prediction was overwrought, as these prognostications tend to be, but many older readers will remember that in their youth some people were near recluses in their homes, talking for hours on the phone. My parents had just one phone in the house to disincentivize anti-social behavior and make sure we kids weren't talking to weirdos.
What changed with the telephone? We made progress by learning how to use the technology beneficially. As a rule, today we are the master of the traditional telephone, not the servant.
And so it can be with smartphones and with social media generally. No one thinks that a few minutes a day on Twitter to see what's trending in one's area of interest or using Facebook to set up activities with friends is deleterious to one's mental health. Note that Ms. Twenge and Mr. Campbell found that light users actually tend to be a bit happier than nonusers. The problem is when light use metastasizes and begins to substitute for the real human connections in life.
Because he can't unilaterally make social media disappear, presumably the objective behind Mr. Hawley's argument is more regulatory scrutiny and oversight of the companies. Economists call that a "supply-side solution." Another supply-side solution is for tech companies to voluntarily resist the innovations that give social media addictive properties. Or they could impose other controls on abuse, such as banning anonymity and more tightly enforcing age restrictions.
However, there are also "demand-side solutions," controlled by us as users, consciously limiting our exposure and rationing our use of social media. It starts with the question of whether social media is substituting for the people and things we love and value. Ask: Do I have fewer in-person interactions because of social media? Am I using social media to pass the time? Has Twitter displaced any of my work? If my answer is yes to any of these, then it's time for a reset.
One effective way to correct unhealthy social-media habits is to "fast" for a few weeks and then come back with strict limits on use. That puts social media where it rightfully belongs: under each user's control, and as a complement to real life.

WIG 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. In 1984, a group of drag queens, including Lady Bunny, and other New York artists decided to stage and unplanned show in Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan. That impromptu event eventually turned into Wigstock, an end-of-summer drag festival that became a cultural touchstone for L.G.B.T.Q. people in New York. "Wig," a documentary from Chris Moukarbel ("Gaga: Five Foot Two" and "Banksy Does New York"), follows Lady Bunny as she works to resurrect the event in 2018. It also delves into Wigstock's origin story, using archival footage and interviews with veteran and up-and-coming drag queens. The documentary also discusses how drag, a rebellion against the norms of masculinity and femininity, has become more mainstream in recent years.
GOOD TROUBLE 8 p.m. on Freeform. In the second season of "The Fosters" spinoff, Callie (Maia Mitchell) and Mariana (Cierra Ramirez) pick up where they left off: Unable to accept the outcome of her client's case, Callie has to decide what she's willing to fight for. Mariana falls into a new relationship but is quickly confronted with a situation she didn't anticipate.
CNN SPECIAL REPORT: STATE OF HATE -- THE EXPLOSION OF WHITE SUPREMACY 10 p.m. on CNN. In this CNN special report, Fareed Zakaria chronicles the history of racism in the United States and delves into how white-supremacist ideology persisted into the present. Zakaria interviews experts on the topic including Randall Kennedy, a Harvard law professor, and Kathleen Belew, a historian at the University of Chicago. He also talks to Jared Taylor, an intellectual figurehead of the alt-right. The special also explores how American white supremacy has contributed to similar movements overseas.
What's Streaming
ADAM DEVINE: BEST OF OUR LIVES Stream on Netflix. Adam Devine makes his Netflix standup debut. The actor and comedian, best known for his roles on "Workaholics" and "Pitch Perfect," performed for a live audience at The Orpheum Theater in his hometown Omaha.
CAPTAIN MARVEL (2019) Stream on Amazon. Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), an Air Force pilot who crashed while flying an experimental aircraft, is taken in by the Kree, a militaristic and highly technological alien race.

#MeToo Work at Art Basel Offers Cautionary Tale

Texto completo: The Los Angeles artist Andrea Bowers made a monumental artwork that she hoped would support the #MeToo movement and presented it, with the help of four galleries, at the prestigious Art Basel fair in Switzerland. Three imposing walls of text and photos made up of 167 red panels retold the stories of men and women who had been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment since the movement began in 2017.
But if the intent of her work, called "Open Secrets Part I & II, 2018, 2019," was to raise awareness about insensitivity to women, it seemed to backfire when Helen Donahue, a woman who said she had been abused, complained on Twitter last week that photographs of her were used without her consent, and another woman, Abby Carney, said her name had been used without her consent. In a highly unusual move, Ms. Bowers extracted the panel in question, and issued an apology for having used the photographs.
Ethics scholars said the incident at the fair, which closed Sunday, offered a case study in the complexity of creating political art. What rules apply for appropriating images and stories previously posted on personal social media accounts, or allegations made in a journalistic context? As socially conscious art has become increasingly popular, and these works enter galleries and other commercial settings, should moral lines be drawn?
"This is a whole new set of questions," said Prof. Griselda Pollock, director of the Center for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds in Britain. "Artists have a right to quote from the world, and they have authorization to present it as their art. But if you use materials that come from one context of use, with its own inherent ethics and politics, into another one, then we find that there are people who are challenging it."
Ann Demeester, director of the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands, who is an authority on ethics in contemporary art, said that Ms. Bowers's work enters ambiguous territory because it makes artwork from personal images and material that was originally presented in a media context, without significant fictionalization or alteration.
"I don't know of any ethical written standards for artists, not even for curators," she said, "but there's a common understanding that you try to be as respectful as possible for any human person that you involved in an artwork. But sometimes when a work is activist, some people fall victim."
Protests erupted in 2017 at the Whitney Biennial when the artist Dana Schutz made a painting based on photographs of the mutilated body of Emmett Till, an African American teenager lynched in Mississippi in 1955. His mother had made the photos available to selected media after his death to illustrate the extreme brutality of his murder. Protesters objected to the fact that Ms. Schutz, a white artist, reused it for her own work.
The legal aspect at stake is a principle called "fair use," which typically applies when an original is transformed by being incorporated into art. The limits of fair use have been tested in lawsuits against Richard Prince, who has appropriated images posted on social media for his artworks and has sold them for millions of dollars.
In this case, there is no lawsuit, but Robert Penchina, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr who specializes in copyright, trademark and media law, said that the fair-use principle could apply here. Including Ms. Donahue's photo "in an artwork where the artist is putting it into context, combining it with 170-odd panels, is telling a particular story, transforming it by building upon it," he said. "I think it is a good candidate for fair use, and potentially defensible on that ground." The panel of the installation that contained the photograph was removed.
Charles Krause, founding director of the Center for Contemporary Political Art in Washington, said, "This incident at Basel is probably a useful cautionary tale" for artists who make political art, and for "the gallery owners and fair promoters who are their editors."
"What about the accused?" he said in an email exchange. "How many of them have been found guilty in a court of law, as opposed to the court of public opinion and political expediency? Can we trust Andrea's work is accurate with regard to them, or shouldn't we concern ourselves about the actual facts of each individual case?"
The panel of the installation that was removed concerned the freelance writer Michael Hafford and allegations made in 2017 by fellow journalists and former girlfriends in an article in Jezebel, an online magazine.
Ms. Bowers, who declined to be interviewed for this piece, seems to have based her panel largely on that article, in which four women described physical or sexual mistreatment by Mr. Hafford. One of them, Ms. Donahue, told Jezebel he had caused her physical pain -- and bruising -- during intercourse that went beyond "rough sex." Another, Abby Carney, said he had raped her in 2015. Ms. Carney wrote on Twitter, "TFW you find out someone turned your rape into "artwork" at Art Basel???"
Neither woman has filed formal charges against Mr. Hafford. Mr. Hafford, reached by phone and email, did not respond to questions emailed to him by The New York Times. Neither would he comment on the allegations in Jezebel.
In her artwork, Ms. Bowers incorporated photographs of Ms. Donahue's bruised face, chest and shoulders that were originally posted on her Twitter account, and were also used in the Jezebel article; Ms. Carney's full name was written into Ms. Bowers' text.
Ms. Donahue protested on Twitter that use of her image in the work was "exploiting us for 'art'." She added, addressing Ms. Bowers, "Do you know how [expletive] insane it is to find out my beat up face and body are on display as art rn for rich ppl to gawk at thru a stranger's instagram story."
Ms. Bowers "absolutely realized that that was a mistake," said Susanne Vielmetter, the owner and director of Vielmetter Los Angeles, one of the four galleries that collaborated to bring the artwork to the fair. "We all agreed it should be taken down," she said.
After they removed the offending panel from the installation, Ms. Bowers contacted Ms. Donahue, and explained the nature of her work and her intentions, Ms. Vielmetter said in an interview.
The artist, in a public statement sent to The New York Times by her gallery and published on Twitter on Wednesday, said: "I, Andrea Bowers, would like to apologize to the survivor whose image was included in my piece," adding "I should have asked for her consent."
Ms. Bowers is known for her drawings, videos and installations that focus on social issues ranging from workers' rights to immigration to victims of harassment, including transgender women. Her artworks, in the collections of the Hammer Museum of Art, in Los Angeles, and the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, have reused text from protest posters and activist slogans.
The galleries that brought "Open Secrets" to Art Basel, which also include Andrew Kreps, Kaufmann Repetto and Capitain Petzel, also issued an apology, adding "We stand by Andrea Bowers and her work and support the conversation that has only just begun."
In an interview, Ms. Carney said that she had never been contacted by the artist for any participation in the project and she had not received an apology from Ms. Bowers.
"Part of the retraumatization is that it's a half story or a poorly told version of the story," she said in a telephone interview. "I'm trying to conclude that chapter, and to be known for my career successes and not for that."
The gallery owner, Ms. Vielmetter, in an interview at the fair, said that "this piece is showing how widespread this problem of abuse is, and how the cultural dialogue of what is and what isn't acceptable sexual behavior is changing right now." She added, "The last thing that we wanted to do was to do more harm to one of the survivors."
Ms. Vielmetter confirmed that the original asking price of the installation was $ 300,000 but added that the galleries who presented the art have now decided not to offer it for sale "out of respect for the ongoing conversation between Andrea Bowers and the survivor."
Ms. Carney said that she has mixed feelings about the fact that the single panel was removed, because she supports the idea of a discussion about this topic.
"I believe she probably has good intentions," Ms. Carney said of Ms. Bowers, "but when you're telling someone else's story, if you're not careful, you can make it too general because you haven't really taken the time to understand it."
She added, "My upset is not so much that I hate having my name out there, but more about getting a chance to talk about it. We are all writers and journalists, and we have powerful voices of our own."

Texto completo: Every fall, tens of thousands of New York City students sit for a high-pressure exam that determines their admission into the city's most selective public high schools. Those students have three hours, a race against the clock to answer questions on subjects like trigonometry and to analyze reading passages.
But a few hundred students have double the time to take the exam, and there appears to be a racial disparity in who is receiving this special accommodation, which is covered under a federal designation known as a 504. The designation is meant to give students with mental and physical disabilities -- whether attention deficit disorder or a broken arm -- a fair shot in public education.
White students in New York City are 10 times as likely as Asian students to have a 504 designation that allows extra time on the specialized high school entrance exams. White students are also twice as likely as their black and Hispanic peers to have the designation. Students in poverty are much less likely to have a 504 for extra time.
And students who have this extra-time provision are about twice as likely to receive offers from specialized high schools, according to a New York Times analysis of newly released city data.
Last year, there were just 24 black students over all at Stuyvesant High School, which has over 3,300 students and is the most selective of the specialized schools. At the same time, 63 white students with a 504 extra-time allowance received offers to a specialized high school.
The number of students with the designation is quite small compared with the total number of test-takers: 323 students had the extra-time allowance last year, while over 27,000 students took the exam.
But the data underscores what testing experts have long emphasized: Income, race and privilege can influence testing in the nation's largest school system, particularly when those factors collide with a high-stakes exam.
The data could further complicate the debate over the future of the specialized school entrance exam, which has for years produced mostly Asian and white student bodies that do not reflect the city's mostly black and Hispanic school system. This year, only seven black students received an offer to Stuyvesant, out of 895 seats.
The question of how to enroll more black and Hispanic students in the city's elite high schools has set off a fraught local fight, at times divided across racial lines. Some Asian, black and Hispanic families have accused one another of racism and of trying to block their children's access to a specialized school, which many believe is a golden ticket.
White students make up about 24 percent of the elite schools -- larger than their 15 percent share of the public school system -- but have not played a large role in that clash. Whites have made up about a 42 percent share of those using a 504 in recent years.
Students with 504s make up a small percentage of all students who took the specialized school exam with more time. Most students granted extra time are served under laws for students with severe disabilities. Using extra time, students with 504s -- and therefore less severe disabilities -- performed better than the median test-taker, while students with more severe disabilities performed worse.
It sometimes falls to families to request 504s, which are typically granted after an often expensive consultation with a professional.
Doug Cohen, a spokesman for the Department of Education, said the city had "clear protocols" to review and approve testing accommodations for the specialized high school exam. There is no evidence that students are inventing or exaggerating disabilities in order to acquire extra time, he said. Experts say that most 504s are legitimate and have helped scores of students in New York and across the country.
Many students who receive extra time on the specialized high school exam attend some of the city's most prestigious public middle schools. New York's mostly white private schools do not participate in the 504 program but still allow extra time on exams for students with learning issues.
One school, Booker T. Washington on the Upper West Side, had 55 students over the last three years with additional time on the exam under a 504. About two-thirds of those students received an offer to a specialized school. Over half the students at Booker T., which has long been a feeder into the specialized schools, are white.
Over the last three years, 102 students in District 3 -- which covers mostly white and middle-class neighborhoods in Manhattan -- had extra time under a 504 allowance, and 59 were accepted to a specialized high school.
Students in District 3 were nearly five times as likely as students in the rest of the city's 31 school districts to have this provision.
By comparison, District 7, which includes mostly Hispanic and low-income neighborhoods in the South Bronx, had five or fewer students who had extra time under a 504 over the last three years.
As the number of students using 504s has ballooned nationally over the last decade, experts have questioned whether the practice has become another way for parents to game standardized tests, including the SAT and ACT. Some experts said that having even a small number of students deceitfully obtaining 504s could harm students who genuinely need extra time.
The recent college admissions bribery scandal has raised fresh questions about how white and wealthy students have maintained their access to prized colleges and universities -- some say at the expense of equally talented but less privileged Asian, black and Hispanic students. The city data indicates that the same patterns that have made 504 designations controversial nationally apply in the often cutthroat world of New York's high school admissions.
The specialized high school exam is the sole means of admission into New York's elite public schools, and some students spend months or even years preparing for it.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has declared the tiny number of black and Hispanic students in the schools to be unacceptable. He says he wants to replace the exam with a system that would automatically admit the top-performing students from each city middle school. Because Asian students would lose about half of their seats under the mayor's proposal, he has been accused of discriminating against the mostly poor and immigrant Asians who make up most of those schools' enrollment. Offers to white students would remain mostly flat under Mr. de Blasio's plan, projections show.
Mr. de Blasio's plan must be approved by the State Legislature, which appears unlikely to pass the highly controversial proposal before the legislative session ends on Wednesday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the “poor little rich girl” of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and ’80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper said Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
“Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms,” Cooper said in a statement. “She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they’d tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.”
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (“The Time of Your Life” on Broadway) and television (“Playhouse 90,” ”Studio One,” ”Kraft Theater,” ”U.S. Steel Hour”). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans — dressed up or down — remain a woman’s wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: “It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir,” which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older ‘Sex and the City.’”
“I’ve had many, many loves,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.”
Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.”
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary “Nothing Left Unsaid.”
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The “poor little rich girl” nickname “bothered me enormously,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in 2016. “I didn’t see any of the press — the newspapers were kept from me. I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t feel poor and I didn’t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.”
After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes’ press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.”
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in “Nothing Left Unsaid” that she contemplated following him, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.”
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ’80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt’s bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, “Obsession: An Erotic Tale,” a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.”

Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.”
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in “Nothing Left Unsaid” that she contemplated following him, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.”
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ’80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt’s bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, “Obsession: An Erotic Tale,” a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.”

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the “poor little rich girl” of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and ’80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper said Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
“Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms,” Cooper said in a statement. “She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife, and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they’d tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.”
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (“The Time of Your Life” on Broadway) and television (“Playhouse 90,” ”Studio One,” ”Kraft Theater,” ”U.S. Steel Hour”). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans — dressed up or down — remain a woman’s wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: “It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir,” which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older ‘Sex and the City.’”
“I’ve had many, many loves,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.”
Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.”
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary “Nothing Left Unsaid.”
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The “poor little rich girl” nickname “bothered me enormously,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in 2016. “I didn’t see any of the press — the newspapers were kept from me. I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t feel poor and I didn’t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.”
After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes’ press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has lashed out at The New York Times, saying it engaged in a "virtual act of treason" for a story that said the U.S. was ramping up its cyber-intrusions into Russia's power grid.
The Times reported on Saturday that the U.S. has bored into Russian utility systems in an escalating campaign meant to deter future cyber activity by Russia. It comes as the U.S. looks for new ways to punish Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and prevent a recurrence.
The Times, in its official public relations account, called Trump's accusation "dangerous" and said it had told officials about the story before it was published and no security issues were raised.
The newspaper, basing its reports on three months of interviews with current and former government officials, said this campaign was conducted under new cyber authorities granted by Trump and Congress. But it also reported that two administration officials believed the president had not been briefed in detail, fearing he might countermand the action against Russia or reveal sensitive information to foreign officials.
In a pair of tweets sent Saturday night, Trump asserted the story wasn't true and denounced reporters as "cowards."
"Do you believe that the Failing New York Times just did a story stating that the United States is substantially increasing Cyber Attacks on Russia. This is a virtual act of Treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story, any story, even if bad for our Country," he wrote.
The story reported the deployment of American computer code into Russia's grid and other targets to act as a deterrent. The newspaper also said the U.S. Cyber Command, part of the Department of Defense, has explored the possibility that Russia might try to initiate selective blackouts in key states to disrupt the 2020 election.
In a second tweet, Trump added about the story: "ALSO, NOT TRUE! Anything goes with our Corrupt News Media today. They will do, or say, whatever it takes, with not even the slightest thought of consequence! These are true cowards and without doubt, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!"
The New York Times' response also noted that the paper described the article to government officials before publication. "As our story notes, President Trump's own national security officials said there were no concerns."
The paper said there was no evidence the US had actually activated the cyber tools.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the "poor little rich girl" of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and '80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.

Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Tributes online came from celebrities and fans of her clothes alike. Alyssa Milano called her "an incredible woman," Dana Delany said she treasures one of her paintings and one Twitter user mourned by remembering the canary Vanderbilt jeans she wore in junior high school.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage ("The Time of Your Life" on Broadway) and television ("Playhouse 90," ''Studio One," ''Kraft Theater," ''U.S. Steel Hour"). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans - dressed up or down - remain a woman's wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: "It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir," which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.

In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary "Nothing Left Unsaid."
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the "poor little rich girl" in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child's mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book "Little Gloria ... Happy at Last," made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.

I didn't know what it meant. I didn't feel poor and I didn't feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant."
After spending the next seven years on her aunt's Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes' press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on "the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves."
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother's 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in "Nothing Left Unsaid" that she contemplated following him, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature "Glorious."
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name "Gloria Vanderbilt" to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early '80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt's bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, "Obsession: An Erotic Tale," a graphic tale about an architect's widow who discovers a cache of her husband's letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn't embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: "I don't think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive."

Texto completo: You may have read "Beloved," clutched "The Bluest Eye" to your chest or memorized "Song of Solomon" – but do you know the history of Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison?
A new documentary, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands through summer), seeks to demystify the acclaimed 88-year-old writer, digging into her personal history, showcasing how her work probes the interior lives of African Americans and highlighting the moments in her remarkable career that became touchstones. Here are five things you probably don't know about Morrison, from how her friendship with Oprah Winfrey started to how she worked her magic on Muhammad Ali.
1. Toni Morrison worked as an editor for years while also writing her own books
Morrison began her career as a professor at Howard University, before spotting a classified ad in The New York Review of Books in 1965 for a book editor in Syracuse. That imprint was soon acquired by Random House, sending Morrison to New York, where the single mother of two sons nurtured many influential black writers, including Toni Cade Bambara, Gayl Jones and Lucille Clifton. But at night, she worked on her own books. "Editors are not writers. So I don't tell anybody," she says.
Fun fact: She convinced secretaries to type up her manuscript for 1970's "The Bluest Eye" by baking the ladies one of her famous carrot cakes.
2. She was castigated by early critics for not writing about white people
In a 1973 review of "Sula," The New York Times criticized Morrison, saying her work was boxed in by her insistence on writing about her own community – without including confrontation with whites. “Toni Morrison is far too talented to remain only a marvelous reporter of the black side of provincial American life," wrote the critic.
In the documentary, Morrison addresses such claims. “I have had reviews in the past that have accused me of not writing about white people . . . as though our lives have no meaning and no depth without the white gaze," she says plainly. "I have spent my entire writing life trying to make sure that the white gaze was not the dominant one in any of my books. "
3. She went on a book tour with Muhammad Ali
While promoting Ali's book "The Greatest: My Own Story," the two got off to a rocky start. "When I first met him and asked him a question, he would answer and look at a man and never looked directly at me while he was giving the answer. But then I remembered he respects older women," Morrison recalls, saying she realized she should act more like his mother. "So I just crossed my arms as I walked in the room and said, 'Ali, get up from there, you have something to do. ' And he would look up and recognize . . . a grown-up. And from then on, he did everything I said," she chuckles.
4. Oprah got creative trying to get her phone number
After reading "Beloved," Oprah wanted to call Morrison personally, but the famous author's number was unlisted. So the TV star called the fire department and asked for it.
Morrison remembers picking up the phone. "She said, 'Toni Morrison, this is Oprah Winfrey. ' I said, 'How did you get my number?' " she laughs. Oprah made her plea to turn "Beloved" into a movie, ultimately convincing a skeptical Morrison. Oprah made the 1998 film and starred as Sethe, an escaped slave who murders her own daughter rather than see her child returned to a Kentucky plantation to live as a slave.
5. Morrison called time's up on equal pay in the 1970s
"Navigating a white male world was not threatening; it wasn't even interesting," says Morrison candidly, recalling her first job as an editor. "I knew more than they did and I wasn't afraid to show it. You have to be a little tough and rely on yourself, and tell people 'no. ' "
In her first job, the single mom noticed her male counterparts were getting more money when the raises were given out. "So I went to my boss and I said, 'You didn't raise me as much as my colleagues who are men. ' He said. 'Yes, but. ' And I said, 'I don't want to hear 'but. ' I want to tell you something: I am head of the household. Just. Like. You. "
She got the money.

Newspaper right to ban cartoons

Texto completo: The political cartoon by The Augusta (Georgia) Chronicle's Rick McKee that was published on Page A6 June 13 shows a lack of historical perspective.
The public outcry over the New York Times cartoon that prompted the International New York Times (not the U.S. editions) to cease publishing political cartoons is based in an understanding of how authoritarian regimes used them as a vehicle to separate certain peoples within their populations and allow them to become targets for hostility, discrimination and worse.
Indeed, cartoons from the Nazi era are reappearing in the European press and giving rise to expressions of anti-Semitism. This loosening of responsible standards is a harking back to a time when newspapers published vitriolic depictions of minorities: religious, political, physical (including invalids), racial and anyone viewed as "the other" by populists and nationalists.
Political cartoons are a powerful force that should be wielded judiciously, with the full knowledge of their impact on public opinion.

Too many questions on public power proposal
Here are my thoughts regarding the proposed creation of a consumer-owned utility ("Commentary: A consumer-owned utility could invest in Maine's economy," June 6):
One would think that Maine would be striving to attract private investment, not kicking it out.
Contrarily, if socialization is the goal, why stop at utilities? Why not nationalize banks and other private corporations? The arguments presented (perceived excess pay, shareholder dividends, etc.) don't seem to be limited to Central Maine Power.
A noted source of usable funds is high wages for management, while CMP is blamed for failure to "increase compensation for line workers."
When one hears proposals that CMP's "excess" funds could be diverted to general funds, run for the hills. Politicians covet nothing more than a new, unfettered source of money.
Vero Beach, Florida, of which I have knowledge, finally, last year, successfully voted out its municipal public power company (the second-highest rates in Florida) and brought in Florida Power & Light (a private company) and enjoyed a 30 percent rate cut.
Per the column, public ownership is apparently going to accomplish wondrous things with CMP's "excess" profits: n
Support renewable energy.
n
Reinvest in better service.
n
Lower price.
n
Redirect funds into the state or municipal general fund.
n
Earmark funds for alleviating energy poverty.
n
Investing in grid reliability.
n
Building out public transportation.
Do we really think there is that much excess money to be gleaned from reduced salaries and captured dividends after adjusting out taxes that are currently being received and higher benefits that will need to be paid?

Let unenrolled Mainers cast ballots in primaries
If there's one thing I've learned in my 15 years of living and voting in Maine, it's that Mainers do not like to be put in a box.
We are an independent-minded folk, and for a plurality of Maine voters, that independent streak extends to our politics.
As a community organizer, I've spoken with countless Mainers of all stripes, and the refrain I hear over and over again is that politics - here in Maine and across the nation - have become so polarized and so acrimonious that many have opted not to affiliate with any political party; instead remaining unenrolled ("independent"), assessing candidates based on their policy proposals and what they stand for, not just their party.
Maine boasts one of the highest levels of voter participation in the country, and that should be a point of pride for all of us. We are an informed and engaged electorate, and we demonstrate that at the ballot box. Unfortunately, when it comes to primary elections, voter turnout drops precipitously.
The reason for this is obvious: Maine's primary elections are closed, meaning one cannot vote in a primary unless registered with a party. Considering that 35 percent of Maine voters do not identify with a party, the practical implication of this policy is that countless Mainers are excluded from the process that determines which candidates advance to the general election.
Robust voter participation is something we should all strive for, and opening up the primary process to unenrolled voters will go a long way toward ensuring that our elected officials enjoy support across the broadest swath of the electorate, not just the party faithful.

Memorial tells important story
My wife and I recently traveled to the South, primarily to visit the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, located in Montgomery, Alabama.
Opened in April 2018 and built by the Equal Justice Initiative under the leadership of Bryan Stevenson, this stunning and sobering memorial is the first in the nation to acknowledge the over 4,000 documented racial terror lynchings of blacks by whites between 1877 and 1950.
Walking through the memorial we discovered one county where over 20 individuals were tortured and lynched in a single day. The walls are covered with the circumstances of many lynchings, such as "After Calvin Mike voted in Calhoun County, Georgia, in 1884, a white mob attacked and burned his home, lynching his elderly mother and his two young daughters."
When you consider how Germany has confronted its past (you can hardly walk more than a block in Berlin without encountering some marker or memorial to Holocaust victims), it's clear how little we have done in the United States to confront our racial history.
I agree with Mr. Stevenson that until we confront our past openly and honestly, we'll never achieve racial harmony in this country.
This museum-memorial brilliantly reveals part of what we must acknowledge and address, but it can only do so if you visit.
Those who visit will viscerally learn more in one day about our racial history than could ever be learned through years of lectures and books.

Texto completo: Even before she was offered the job of president of CBS News, colleagues were lobbying Susan Zirinsky to take it.
"Help us," one correspondent implored her via email.
It would be a challenging moment for anyone to manage: Charlie Rose had been fired from "CBS This Morning" and "60 Minutes" after being accused of sexual misconduct. Leslie Moonves, CBS's chief executive, had been pushed out amid accusations of sexual misconduct. Jeff Fager, a longtime executive producer of "60 Minutes," had been fired after threatening a colleague.
"Things were unraveling," Ms. Zirinsky told attendees of the New Rules Summit, an annual New York Times conference. "The debts of history were coming due."
But once the top job was on the table -- again, as she had been asked about it years earlier -- Ms. Zirinsky had an adage in the back of her mind: "A crisis is a terrible thing to waste."
"The company needed a major reset," she said. "I wanted to take the organization functionally and spiritually to a better place."
[Video: Susan Zirinsky, president of CBS News, in conversation with David Gelles of The New York Times at the New Rules Summit. Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Zirinsky, a highly respected producer who was the inspiration for Holly Hunter's character in the movie "Broadcast News" and who was described by Gayle King of "CBS This Morning" as "a badass in every sense of the word," has applied her trademark work ethic to helping her organization adjust its course.
Her calendar can be booked from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., she said, sometimes without a lunch break but with a laser focus on listening, including to small groups of colleagues convened specifically for that purpose.
"It was so unsettling to me" to hear about some colleagues' experiences, Ms. Zirinsky said during a conversation about unconscious bias.
"I felt that I needed to listen -- to hear what really people thought," Ms. Zirinsky said, emphasizing that action must follow. "There have to be consequences for behavior that isn't acceptable."
To that end, she said, CBS News has put in place a more robust human resources operation staffed with "real H.R. people who are listening and making recommendations and acting."
That focus on action has extended to personnel decisions, in which she said she was conscious of reflecting "a balance of who we are as a country." It is gratifying, she said, that "the effort is leveling the playing field."
But, Ms. Zirinsky added: "We're not putting people in because they're diverse. We're putting people in because they're talented."
One of her first big moves as president was making Norah O'Donnell the anchor of the "CBS Evening News."
Ms. Zirinsky, who joined CBS more than 40 years ago as a desk assistant answering phones on Saturdays, said her wide-ranging experience was crucial to the transition. "People feel that I had credibility because I had done their jobs," she said. "I knew what it takes. I know the sacrifices men and women make."
Those sacrifices are top of mind amid charges of "fake news" and attacks by President Trump on the news media. "The next two years as journalists are the most important two years," Ms. Zirinsky said. "It's time for us to reveal America to itself."
"The hunger for real, straight news is desperate," she said.

What Makes a Leader?

Texto completo: "You're too accessible."
That's what Susan Zirinsky, the new head of CBS News, was told early in her career -- because she was seemingly everywhere at once.
It was during that era that she agreed to meet with a young woman named Hannah Yang, who was on the verge of quitting what she had thought would be her dream job -- working for Charlie Rose. She was troubled by the workplace environment and had decided to leave, but was convinced her career in journalism would be over.
Ms. Yang had only briefly met Ms. Zirinsky, then executive producer at "48 Hours," but decided to ask for a meeting. She expected Ms. Zirinsky to say no. Instead, Ms. Zirinsky ended up giving her the most valuable advice of her career: to pursue the business side of media.
Eighteen years later, Ms. Zirinsky -- known to many as "Z" -- is president of CBS News, brought in to run the news division following a massive company crisis over sexual misconduct that included the firing of the company's chief executive, Les Moonves, and Mr. Rose. She is the first woman to hold that job. Ms. Yang is a business executive at The New York Times, who said she now makes a point of making herself accessible, too.
"It is because she was so accessible that I -- a nobody at the time, really -- was able to get this critical advice from her," Ms. Yang said of Ms. Zirinsky, who appeared onstage to talk about gender and leadership at The Times's New Rules Summit last week. Ms. Yang recently reached out to Ms. Zirinsky after nearly two decades to thank her. She said Ms. Zirinsky replied immediately.
For a long time, women were taught to "act like men" to get ahead at work. They donned shoulder pads and boxy suits, played by the rules, and acted out qualities that seemed to make for successful leaders -- authority, decisiveness, not being "too accessible."
But a new breed of women leaders like Ms. Zirinsky is upending those old rules, embracing traits like empathy and collaboration to get things done, and refusing to suppress the qualities that make them who they are. (Some may call these "feminine" qualities, but others prefer to call them the traits of well-rounded leaders.)
Think Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand (and one of the few world leaders to give birth while in office), who spoke onstage at the first New Rules Summit last year.
Ms. Ardern drew international praise for her ability to mix compassion with concrete action in the wake of a recent mass shooting in her country, in which dozens of worshipers at two mosques were killed. In the hours after, Ms. Ardern, the youngest female leader in the world at 38, wore a black head scarf and grieved alongside victims' families. "We are one, they are us," she said of her country's Muslims.
She also took swift action, banning military-style semiautomatic weapons within days of the shooting.
"It takes strength to be an empathetic leader," she said.
But that can also be a tricky line to walk for women.
Research has found that when women exhibit character traits typically associated with male leadership -- traits like decisiveness, authority or assertion -- they are likely to be viewed as bossy, pushy or too aggressive, and some people reel at their behavior.
And yet when women turn around and exhibit the qualities traditionally expected of women -- like niceness, nurturing and warmth -- they tend to be perceived as pushovers, too soft or not "tough enough" to do the job.
It's a double bind, as sociologists have put it -- a situation where you're "damned if you do, damned if you don't," as Joan C. Williams, a law professor and workplace scholar has said.
And yet there is also a body of work, including research by a Harvard Business School professor, Amy Cuddy, and colleagues, which found that women can offset that bias by combining these characteristics -- essentially, conveying warmth along with competence.
You might believe that women shouldn't have to do that. (Is anyone else exhausted just thinking about it?) But it's what Ms. Williams has described as "gender judo" -- or combining stereotypically "feminine" behaviors, like friendliness, humor and empathy, with those behaviors still associated with men, like aggression or ambition.
Many of the world's leaders have mastered this art: They may be tough, but they are known for their grace and humor, too.
And the good news is, there are simply more styles of leadership on display these days. Of more than 200 men fired in the wake of #MeToo, according to an analysis by The Times last year, nearly half were replaced by women -- including Jennifer Salke at Amazon Studios, Christiane Amanpour at PBS and Ms. Zirinsky at CBS.
Today, for the first time, women hold the top jobs at the New York Stock Exchange and at Nasdaq. There is a female speaker of the House who is a mother of five and grandmother of nine. There are a record number of women in Congress, including young rule breakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are leading with a level of camaraderie and transparency perhaps never before seen. (As a Times reporter, Maya Salam, recently put it: The Democratic newcomers have a message for you: "We're cool, we're transparent and we've got each other's backs." And, of course, more women than ever are running for the Democratic nomination for president.
None of which is to say that women are innately better leaders. "That's not necessarily the case," said Marianne Cooper, a sociologist at Stanford University who studies gender and leadership. But there are certain things that women learn from a lifetime of operating in male-dominated spaces -- things like patience, compassion and calm -- that may be assets.
Think of the CBS anchor Gayle King, sitting calmly in her chair, as her interview subject, R. Kelly, who is charged with multiple counts of sexual assault, screamed, flailed and cried.
"Women's experiences at work are undeniably different," Ms. Cooper, the sociologist, said. "As a result, they may develop a lens on the world that can lead to different thoughts about leadership, different priorities, different ways of interacting. I think certainly all these women in power can open up definitions of who's a leader."
There's a theory in social science, coined by Michelle K. Ryan and S. Alexander Haslam as the "Glass Cliff," that explains how women are more likely to be put into leadership roles during times of crisis. This can end up well if they are successful, but be damaging if they are not -- because the failure tends to be viewed not as indicative of the circumstances, but as indicative of the person's race or gender. (Think of prominent female C.E.O.s like Campbell's Denise Morrison, or Irene Rosenfeld of Mondelez. Each faced tough restructuring and challenges from investors -- and were replaced by men.)
The way to break that cycle, researchers say, is to have more women in power -- so that one woman's experience does not represent that of all women. (Having more women in decision-making roles has also been found to generate stronger market returns and superior profits for companies. And having more women employees, particularly in leadership roles, can reduce the incidence of sexual harassment, too.)
"When there are so few women, any single one's success or failure represents all other women," Ms. Cooper said. "But once there's, you know, 30 or 40 percent women, then the variety among women is able to be seen."
If you're Ms. Zirinsky, perhaps you take that as a challenge. As she said onstage on Thursday, speaking to David Gelles, a Times business reporter: "I've always had something in the back of my mind: that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste." (She noted that she also decided to keep the title of executive producer "just in case it doesn't work out.")
She could well end up nurturing a few more future leaders in the process.

Texto completo: A quick note for New York readers: I'd like to invite you to come hang out with Smarter Living in real life! On June 25, three of your favorite Smarter Living writers -- Jen Doll, Jolie Kerr and Kristin Wong -- will join me for an evening of life advice and revelry. Tickets are available here. See you there!
Whoopsie: You completely bombed that career-making presentation, missed that deadline you could not miss or said something you absolutely should not have said. The world is going to crumble! Your life is over! Everyone will remember this mistake for the rest of your life!
Right?
No, of course we all know that isn't true. Everyone messes up all the time, and it's going to happen again. Our mistakes are rarely as big as we imagine them to be, and everyone else has more important things to do than think about your errors. And while it's true that some mistakes are more significant than others -- realizing you chose the wrong career path or romantic partner, for example -- they don't have to be the world-ending disasters we make them out to be. So let's all take a deep breath and realize that everything is fine and the world is not going to crumble, then figure out how to get through it.
One of the reasons we sometimes stick with things we know aren't working is the commitment bias, which is our tendency to let our past decisions and actions dictate how we behave now and in the future -- even if we know we're being irrational. (Think of people who are miserable in their jobs and fully aware of it.) According to the Decision Lab, a behavioral design think tank, we "tend to interpret evidence in a way that makes our past idea seem better." We want to be seen as someone who is consistent, and recognizing that a major decision we've made was a mistake shatters that image. Our brains are working against change here on multiple levels, compounding the difficulty to fix a major life mistake.
"The embarrassment and blow to your self-worth can manifest in unlimited ways -- and sometimes it feels like it's manifesting in all ways -- and our bodies' response to failure can even mimic that of physical pain," Oset Babur wrote last year in a New York Times article about learning from failure.
So, yes: The first step to correcting a monumental blunder is to be honest and critical with yourself and to acknowledge that it was indeed a mistake. This is much easier said than done, but unless we're nakedly candid with ourselves about the mistake itself, there's no way to move past it.
[Like what you're reading? Sign up here for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning.]
The second step is even more crucial: Accept that it was a mistake, but don't allow it to define you or your self-worth.
"Being overly critical of ourselves can increase anxiety about a setback. But overthinking, or ruminating on what happened, is like agonizing self-criticism on repeat," Rachel Simmons wrote in The Times's guide to overcoming failure. "Studies have found that overthinking -- asking questions like, 'How could I (or they) have said that?' or, 'Why am I so anxious?' -- can damage a person's motivation and problem-solving skills, and increase the likelihood of depression. It's more common in women."
After coming to terms with your gaffe and accepting that you've erred, the real work begins. Of course, no two mistakes are identical, but there are some practical ways to find a path forward.
If it's possible, stop digging. If this happens to be a mistake you continue to make (a position I have been in many times), do whatever is in your power to stop making the situation worse.
From there, the way out doesn't come in huge, life-altering adjustments and decisions all at once, but in "low-risk baby steps," according to Dr. Marty Nemko. Say you have realized and accepted you made a wrong career choice. Don't think of it in terms of just up and quitting tomorrow, but rather try to think of the smallest ways you could nudge yourself toward a career path that is better suited to you. Test the waters in other areas to see what interests you and that you could see yourself building a life around, then slowly work backward to figure out how you can get there. We want to avoid diving into something headfirst; that might be why we're in this situation in the first place. Instead, we want to gradually and methodically build a plan to get where we want to go, step by step.
Recovering from major mistakes is never easy, and there are both internal and external forces working against us, including the biases that make us want to stick with bad decisions and the social pressures that make us afraid to strive for change. But being aware of the obstacles in your way is the only path to getting around them.
How did you get around a major mistake? Tell me on Twitter @timherrera.
Have a great week!

Tip of the Week
This week I've invited the writer Danielle Sepulveres to tell us why we shouldn't mix business and friendship.
I knew I had made a mistake as soon as he answered, "Sure, but you don't have to pay me."
My question: "Can I pay you to create a graphic?"
What followed was weeks of my asking if there was a proof I could look at, and his apologizing for the delay, followed by a promise that he'd make time soon and no, it wasn't necessary for me to find someone else.
These are tricky waters many of us have tried to navigate: asking a friend for a business-related favor. Favors from friends, though often asked for and promised with the best intentions, can be a surefire way to both sour a friendship and get work that doesn't quite live up to standards but that you don't feel comfortable nitpicking.
The solution? Just don't do it. Paying someone, rather than calling in a favor, lets you dictate your timetable, make specifications in explicit (and annoying) detail, nitpick the work to death and keep at it until you're completely satisfied -- all guilt-free, because the person is being compensated for the effort. When there are deadlines, contracts and, most important, payments, the relationship is clear, direct and uncomplicated.
An unpaid favor, while having the veneer of a generous helpful offer, opens the door to a multitude of uncomfortable scenarios. And it's just as irritating with roles reversed. Before I learned to set boundaries, I was often asked to edit writing for friends and falsely assured that "it will only take you five minutes!" And because I felt compelled to do a thorough job, I would spend an hour or more and feel resentful about it.
If you need something done, shell out the money or learn how to do it yourself. A free favor never pays off.

Texto completo: Economic workshop inBahrain is first step inrollout of U.S. peace plan
NEW YORK - Israel's foreign minister on Sunday said the country would have a "key role" to play in an upcoming economic summit in Bahrain, organized by the White House as the first step in its plan to make peace between Israelis and Palestinians. But it remains unclear whether Israeli officials are invited.
With just over a week to go before the June 25-26 conference, Israeli Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has yet to be formally invited, but he is expected to represent Israel "if an Israeli delegation is present," said one Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.
Israel Katz, the foreign minister, clearly believes Israel should have a seat at the table.
"Israel, with its experience and capabilities, can participate in these efforts and contribute in different fields of interest," Katz said Sunday in a speech at a New York conference organized by the Jerusalem Post.
A White House official did not immediately respond to questions on Israeli participation.
The economic workshop in Bahrain is the first step in the rollout of the White House's long-awaited peace plan, with delegations from across the region set to attend. Explaining the purpose of the summit on Sunday, U.S. Middle East peace envoy Jason Greenblatt said the intention is to highlight what the Palestinian economy could look like if there was a peace agreement.
Palestinian officials, who are refusing to attend, accuse the Trump administration of trying to buy off their political demands for a state and an end to Israeli occupation. They say the Trump administration cannot act as an honest peace broker after moves such as cutting aid and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Israeli officials, however, are keen to attend. Katz said that Israel will be represented in a "way that will be decided later on."
"Israel has the ability to contribute to the development of the region," he said.
A person involved with the conference organization, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss invitees, said no Israeli government delegation has been invited but that business people have been.
Also in question is whether Israeli media coverage will be allowed.
"It seems that we are not wanted," said Itamar Eichner, the head of the Israeli diplomatic journalists association, who has been pushing for Israeli reporters to be able to attend, with the registration process for all international press still unclear. "In the past, a peace conference was a celebration of peace," he said.
Israeli delegates were largely forced to cancel a visit to Bahrain for an entrepreneurship meeting this year after a local backlash.
In an interview in New York, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said he "appreciated" the efforts of the U.S. administration.
Danon said that the U.S. rejection of the Iran nuclear deal has brought Arab countries and Israel closer together. "Everybody understands Iran is not only talking about chaos, it's bringing chaos," he said.
He said it was "worthwhile" to look at the U.S. peace plans. "We need fresh ideas, we need to think out of the box," he said. While previous thinking was that normalization with Arab countries would come after a peace deal, today Israel feels there is a "different equation" and that cooperation can lead to a peace process, he said.
"Today we have very good, quiet relations with many of those countries," he said. "It's definitely brought us together."
Greenblatt on Sunday said that it was a "milestone achievement" to hold the summit in Bahrain.
He dismissed criticism that the White House is simply focused on "economic peace" and said that the fact that Israel is holding an unprecedented second election, after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government, had complicated the rollout of the political portion of the plan.
"It's no secret that the Israeli elections have certainly put a new thought into our head," he said. "Had the elections not been called again, perhaps we would have released it this summer."
Now the plan's unveiling will probably be delayed until Nov. 6, he said. The fact that 2020 election campaigns in the United States will then be getting into full swing would not necessarily be problematic, he said. "We don't think an election campaign would stop progress on something we want to move along with."
When asked whether the plan could be difficult for members of a right-wing Israeli government to accept, Greenblatt said that "both sides are going to have to make compromises."
Greenblatt also said that he supported recent comments by David M. Friedman, Washington's ambassador to Jerusalem, on Israel's right to annex part of the West Bank.
In an interview with the New York Times this month, Friedman said he thought that Israel has the right to retain some but "unlikely all" of the West Bank.
Greenblatt's remarks on Sunday are likely to strengthen the voices of those in Netanyahu's right-wing coalition pushing for Israel to annex parts of the territory, occupied since the 1967 war.

Waiting for new lungs, advocating for others Constable: She is

Texto completo: Nineteen-year-old Maddi Bertrand of Glen Ellyn is a leading voice in a somber new video by The New York Times, which notes that 11,000 Americans will die this year while waiting for organ transplants. Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital will give Maddi a Hope and Courage award Wednesday for her wide range of contributions, including her advocacy efforts that helped lead to a change in the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21 in Illinois as of July 1.
She’s been raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation since she staged Maddi’s Marvelous Mayfair fundraiser at the age of 7. She’s successfully lobbied for smoke-free bike paths and parks. She never turns down a chance as a speaker to raise funds and awareness on behalf of people with cystic fibrosis.
"And I will for the rest of my life until a cure is found," Maddi says. Then she coughs a dozen times into a paper towel, grimaces, removes the oxygen tubes from her nose to blow into a tissue, and pauses for nearly a minute to give her body time to catch up. CF is a life-shortening, progressive, genetic disease that affects the pancreas and causes a thick mucus to form in the lungs.
"I’m definitely sicker than I was a month ago," she says. The attention and awards are nice, but what she really wants is a new set of lungs.
Born in Pennsylvania, one of the few states at the time that tested newborns for cystic fibrosis, Maddi got diagnosed and started treatment earlier than many CF patients, says her mother, Linda Bertrand.
"When I was in elementary school and middle school, I could do sports," Maddi says, noting that she even played the rough game of lacrosse. "Whenever I’d join a team, I’d get sick, end up in the hospital, and then the season would wind down."
She plays the flute and piano, did martial arts with her brother, and was healthy enough to be a section leader in the marching band and take on roles in a couple of plays during high school.
"I’ve gone from this tiny backpack to a tank because I’ve been needing more oxygen," says Maddi, whose senior photos featured one with the oxygen tubes and one without. She takes a couple dozen pills each day, and undergoes three or four daily lung treatments. In spite of missing weeks of school, she made it to prom and graduated from Glenbard West High School in 2018 with the rest of her class. On Feb. 2, 2018, she went on the lung transplant waiting list.
"She’s a very smart, determined and wonderful young woman," says Lisa Mulvaney, coordinator of the creative arts program at Lurie Children’s, and the person who recruited Maddi for the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board in 2013. "From Day One, she was really invested in this group of kids and about making the hospital even better. She never wants to miss a meeting."
Maddi dragged her oxygen tank onto a Metra train and ordered a ride service once she got into Chicago to make one board meeting. Because CF patients can get sick when near other CF patients, Maddi is the only representative of that disease on the board, which has members aged 12 to 19.
"She really displays such hope and such courage," Mulvaney says. "She wants to give as much as she can."
As a freshman in high school, Maddie became the first CF patient to complete the Xtreme Hike: a one-day, 21-mile hike with her mom through the hills of the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. Maddi has helped host three proms for the inpatients at Lurie Children’s. She attended the first International Children’s Advisory Network summit in Washington, D.C. Her mother recalls how Maddi didn’t get a chance to meet with then-U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. "But I recognized his wheelchair at the airport," says Maddi, who walked up, introduced herself, and had a nice chat about the importance of funding research for CF and other diseases that affect children.
The New York Times video featuring Maddi was produced by Kendall Ciesemier, an original member of the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board from Wheaton, and a member of the 2010-11 Daily Herald Leadership Team. At age 11, Ciesemier founded Kids Caring 4 Kids, which helps children in Africa impacted by AIDS. Her work was recognized by then-President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Born with a rare liver disorder, Ciesemier was the recipient of two liver transplants.
"I want people to know that donating organs is so important and that I wouldn’t be alive without the generosity of a stranger," Ciesemier says via email. "I take the gift that someone gave me very seriously and I focus a lot on paying it forward. … I like to believe that I can give people hope."
Maddi says she maintains her hope.
"Of course, I want new lungs, but I’ll wait as long as it takes. I’m happy," says Maddi, who notes the transplant wait is tricky. "I have to be really sick to be at the top of the list, but I have to be healthy enough for the surgery. This is so crazy."
She gets support from her brother Zach, 16, and sisters Grace, 13, and Gabbi, 11, but Maddi says her strength comes from her Christian faith. "God’s in control," she says. "Whenever I’m down and don’t know if I can do this, I lean on God. I know He will get me the right pair of lungs."
She’s learning to play a new religious song on the piano, with the lyric, "I will fight for you." Transplanted lungs would be free of CF, but recovery from the surgery can be grueling, and requires lifelong medications and care. Imagining her life with new lungs and the ability to breathe, Maddi sees herself going to college and becoming a trainer who works with dolphins at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the Florida not-for-profit whose care of sick and injured marine animals was made into two "Dolphin Tale" movies. Anchored close to home while she waits for her transplant, Maddi also dreams of traveling to Florida, New York, Hawaii and California, and doing some of those things that CF denied her.
"When I get these new lungs," Maddi says, breaking into a sly grin, "I want to live a little first."

Texto completo: SEATTLE - Hundreds of Seattleites are projected to die in severe heat waves as the globe warms.
How much humans limit greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant impact on just how many people perish, according to a new study published in the journal Science Advances.
Researchers used climate-warming scenarios and heat-mortality data to predict the severity of future heat waves for 15 U.S. cities, including Seattle.
Here, about 725 people are projected to die in each extreme heat event if global temperatures rise about 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times. In that scenario, Seattle could see daily mean temperatures (averaging day and night measures) of about 97 degrees Fahrenheit at their highest.
If countries meet the greenhouse-gas reduction levels they pledged in the 2016 Paris Agreement, global temperatures could reach or approach that mark by about 2100, according to previous research cited in the study.
President Donald Trump vowed in 2017 to withdraw from that deal. Meanwhile, global carbon dioxide emissions hit record highs last year, according to scientists' projections. Washington state's most recent tally of its greenhouse gas emissions showed a rise.
Scientists have warned for years that climate change would cause killer heat waves, but the Science Advances paper estimates specific impacts for individual cities like Seattle and makes clear how many lives are at stake.
"These are the first estimates of what that increased burden from extreme heat waves would be if we don't cut emissions," said Kristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington who was one of the study's authors.
That could help clarify the climate threat to the public, scientists said.
"This puts numbers on it to communicate that risk a little better to people," said Karin Bumbaco, Washington's assistant state climatologist, who was not involved in the paper.
Heat waves would increase in frequency as well as severity, Ebi said.
The researchers studied the impacts of one-in-30-year heat waves, or events that would have a 3.3% chance of happening each year. But as the world warms, the odds shift.
"In an average lifetime, this is the kind of heat wave you'd expect to experience maybe two to three times," Ebi said. "Of course, with warming, that one-in-30 event becomes much more frequent."
Limiting warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit would save 279 lives in each extreme Seattle heat wave. Keeping temperatures to an increase of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit would avoid another 105 deaths.
The highest mean temperature (averaging day and night measures) in Seattle for a single day was about 83.5 degrees Fahrenheit from 1987 to 2000, according to the study data. But, if global temperatures rise 5.4 degrees, models predict Seattle could see that figure rise to about 97 degrees Fahrenheit.
By that time, mean temperatures are expected to exceed 83.5 degrees more than five days a year, on average.
"No one needs to die in a heat wave. All those deaths are preventable," Ebi said. "Rapidly reducing our greenhouse-gas emissions will save lives in Seattle."
The numbers reflect averages and estimates. The study also did not consider adaptations people might make, like increased use of air conditioning. Nor do they consider population or demographic changes.
"There would be the same number living in Seattle and they'd all be the same age as they are today," Ebi said of the scientists' models. "There are ways the study is overestimating risk and ways the study is underestimating risk. It's not possible to tell how that would balance out."
About as many people in Seattle would die in each severe heat wave as in Houston, a much warmer city with a population more than double Seattle's.
"Seattle doesn't get very many heat waves. Houston gets more heat waves but they're better prepared for them - everything from air conditioning to how the city is built," Ebi said.
Of the 15 cities studied, Seattle ranked fourth-highest in the number of deaths projected from heat waves for every 100,000 residents.
"We're not a city that's adapted well to higher temperatures," Ebi said. "We need to take more action intermediately to adapt."
Heat kills by myriad methods.
People can simply overheat, which can progress, if not treated, to heat stroke, said Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health - Seattle & King County.
"When temperature regulation of the body can't cope, organs basically start to fry," Duchin said. Heat can also exacerbate symptoms from underlying ailments like cardiac disease, diabetes or kidney problems.
The elderly, the very young and pregnant women are most at risk, Duchin said.
Wealth can also be a factor, said Mark Stephan, an associate professor in political science at Washington State University Vancouver.
"Heat waves have a bias in terms of who is affected, partly based on age, but also based on income," he said. "Climate change only exacerbates this, arguably."
People's ability to afford air conditioning, live in a home with effective air circulation, or leave town for places where it's cooler, gives them advantages.
"Think about suburban single-family homes with a lot of leafy coverage of trees, houses with flow of air, versus someone who lives in an apartment complex," he said.
Heat often brings other threats.
"Heat waves are just one part of the package of health threats we're going to see with climate change," Duchin said. "It comes along with extreme weather events, wildfires, poor air quality and the cascading effects those events cause. It's hard to look at it in isolation."
Heat waves around the world have claimed thousands of victims.
Europe in 2003 experienced a record heat wave. Wildfires burned in Portugal and Spain, according to the New York Times. Britain canceled trains and reduced speeds on busy routes for fear high temperatures would buckle the tracks. In London, Trafalgar Square fountains became wading pools.
By summer's end, about 70,000 deaths were associated with the heat. A study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that climate change was responsible for some of those deaths.
In 1995, hundreds died when a heat wave caught Chicago off-guard. On the worst day, refrigerated trucks were called to help after the county morgue was full, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Seattle has not seen "a large epidemic heat wave" like Chicago's, Duchin said, but "when we have heat waves, we have increased EMS calls, hospitalizations, increased mortality rates."
According to the Seattle Emergency Management office's Seattle Hazard Identification and Vulnerability Analysis, "Since the mid-1970s, an average of three or four heat-related fatalities has occurred each summer in Seattle. During excessively warm summers, such as the summer of 1992, up to 60 deaths have occurred."
In the Northwest, nighttime temperatures are of particular concern.
"One of the characteristics of our heat events in Washington: We usually are able to cool off at night," Bumbaco said.
But that relief has been increasingly fleeting. In the Pacific Northwest, "our nighttime temperatures are warming faster than our daytime temperatures," she said.
Washington's minimum temperatures in summer have warmed about 3 degrees Fahrenheit between 1895 and 2018, according to an interactive data tool provided by the climatology office. Over that same period, Seattle's minimum summer temperatures are up nearly 3.9 degrees.
Government officials are planning for heat in the short and long term.
When the National Weather Service issues a heat warning, Seattle's emergency management office convenes city departments.
Officials coordinate public warning messages, limit city employees' time outside and exposure to heat and open public spaces to give people access to air conditioning, said Barb Graff, the department's emergency director.
Duchin said King County and Seattle are mapping "heat islands," or areas that get excessively hot, perhaps because they lack trees or parks. The county in 2015 committed to plant a million trees, which could help reduce local temperatures.
Still, "the adaptation solutions are very unsatisfying," Duchin said. "If we don't get the emissions piece under control, we're going to suffer and have preventable death happen. We'll be stuck minimizing preventable death, which is a frustrating and sad place to be."

Texto completo: Do you want to avoid dying early? If so, it’s time to rethink retirement.
Early retirement is a popular dream with a whole movement devoted to it: FIRE, or financial independence, retire early. Advice abounds for retiring at 60, 50 even 35. Soon, people will push for 25, I’m sure. But be careful. Recent research shows early retirement kills. Literally.
For years, conventional wisdom – plus research – supported FIRE’s momentum. Studies showed early retirees living longer and were happier. Newer research disagrees.
A December 2017 paper by Professors Maria D. Fitzpatrick and Timothy J. Moore for the National Bureau of Economic Research showed male mortality rates rose 2% starting the month men turn 62. After analyzing data deeper, they blamed heightened mortality risk on “retirement from the labor force and associated lifestyle changes. ”
Smart stock picking: 3 things to watch when you're buying stocks for the long term
Space car: First-ever Lexus space jet idea has specs you've never heard of, until now
Those changes included less physical activity, mental stimulation and social interaction. Last October, Alice Zulkarnain and Matthew Rutledge, researchers for the Boston College Center for Retirement, documented working longer equals living longer.
These studies may have baked-in biases. Healthier people can probably work longer. So delayed retirement could be an effect, not a cause, of a longer life. Those retiring super early likely want to do other things. They have spirit. Those who keep working past 65 probably like their jobs. They have spirit, too, just a different one.
To me, the lesson isn’t to work longer or shorter. Rather, have spirit. Find something you enjoy doing. Then work at it, whether for money or not. If you like your 9-to-5 gig, and the camaraderie and intellectual stimulation, keep going. But if your job is merely for money, and you’re desperate to quit once you’ve saved enough, turn in your retirement letter and plot your labor of love. You could volunteer, change fields or start a business doing something that jazzes you.
Regardless, the key is to retire from joyless work – and work at something joyful. Being sedentary invites early death. Even if you’re active at home, you risk social isolation, which can cause depression. If you don’t use your brain, cognitive function declines, increasing risks like early dementia. Crosswords and brainteasers, though popular, aren’t enough to replicate the mental challenges our brains undergo at the office.
To maximize your retirement, make a checklist of things you’ll need to stay fit and happy. Social interaction. Physical movement. Challenges for your brain. Then, go get 'em. Crafts? Classes in leatherwork? Ceramics? Jewelry making? OK, but work at it. Maybe start your own Etsy shop. But work at it. Volunteering? Try AARP’s volunteering search engine, Create the Good. Search topic and ZIP code for what’s near you. Then, walk or bike there.
Reverse mortgages: Who should consider one and who shouldn't?
Student loan: Familiar with Sallie Mae? They now offer credit cards.
Are you outdoorsy, like me? Maybe lead hikes at your local nature reserve. Golf lovers can be “rangers” or “starters” – often earning free tee times, too. Plant lovers can start community gardens. Bookworms may like working at local shops or running book clubs. Foodies could start simple neighborhood cafés (but skimp on chomping those calories). Or maybe launch a tech startup in your 60s, as legendary multibillionaire David Duffield did with Workday. As long as you have spirit, vision and dedicated activity, life lingers longer and better.
I’m 68 and simply love working. But, even if you’re decades from retiring, start deliberating this now. If you’re 40 and plan to leave your rat race at 55, starting anew, ramp up your savings now to prepare. And prep for your lifestyle-altered labor of love. Envision your dream work, set goals, get to it, and you will probably get an exhilarated, elongated life, too.

Texto completo: Valley News Sports Editor
When I took my first journalism class back in high school, our teacher occasionally put us future ink-stained wretches through an interesting and thought-provoking exercise.
She’d come to the room carrying copies of that day’s New York Times, New York Daily News and New York Post, and we’d have to find the same story in each paper and compare. She used to say you needed a college-level education to read the Times but only a sixth-grade reading level for the Daily News. That in itself was nothing — she cracked that a first-grader could tackle the Post.
Anyway, the differences were no more evident than in the headlines. The Times wrote for substance; the Daily News, and particularly the Post, wrote for brevity and impact. Say what you will of the latter two — I gravitated toward Newsday during my Long Island college days anyway — but they certainly were creative.
I guess this is a long-form way of saying tabloid journalism influences my headline writing today. I enjoy what we in this biz call a good hammer head: a short, declarative line of as few words as possible to sum up what you’re about to read in a means that catches your eye quickly and make you want to continue. (My amendment: Puns welcome.)
As I’ve posited before, I believe any story — particularly any sports story — can be boiled down to a four-word headline. When last I tried this gimmick, the newsroom editor at the time rolled his eyes and panned it. Still, it ran. And he’s since retired, so nyah.
I’ve accumulated sports news items from the past few weeks, both local and otherwise, and given them the four-word treatment. Remember, kids: Don’t try this at home unless you own a good dictionary, an attraction to bad puns and an aversion for split infinitives. Without that, you may experience a level of ridicule that I wouldn’t want you to be exposed to.

Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has received lots of attention for her detailed policy proposals on everything from a wealth tax to Pentagon contracting. But her surge in the polls also owes something to her ubiquity. Warren has held a parade of well-attended campaign events and she's taken an astounding number of social media-friendly photographs with voters — 30,000 as of last Sunday, she tells The New York Times.

Texto completo: Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, and the Last Trial of Harper Lee
Casey Cep
Knopf: 336 pp., $26.95

--
It was one of the publishing events of the millennium so far: the publication of Harper Lee's seemingly lost book in 2015, more than half a century after "To Kill a Mockingbird." Actually, though it was set two decades after "Mockingbird," "Go Set a Watchman" had been written before the iconic novel -- it was the manuscript that piqued publishers' interest in Lee and introduced Atticus Finch to the world. Lee's intended follow-up to "Mockingbird" was to have staked out bold new ground. Conceived as a work of "In Cold Blood"-like reportage, its subject matter was no less hard-boiled -- six corpses, a suspected serial killer rumored to dabble in voodoo, a vigilante who slew him and a lawyer who represented both. Yet it was also familiar: an Alabama court case intersected by race -- the alleged mass murderer and his avenger were black; their Atticus-like defender white. Moreover, Lee had furnished crucial assistance to her friend Truman Capote in the workup for "In Cold Blood" and gotten within one semester of a law degree before dropping out of college. The project seemed a match of author with subject. But it became an "albatross." She finally abandoned and, with it, any aspiration to a post-"Mockingbird" second act. In "Furious Hours," Casey Cep picks up where Lee left off with a full accounting of a shocking true-crime case and the great literary might-have-been it spawned.
The Rev. Willie Maxwell was nothing if not industrious. Besides preaching, he quarried rock and ran a crew clearing timber for paper mills. And in 1970 he allegedly began cutting a swath through his own family tree, cleaning up on life insurance policies he'd taken out on relatives. Over the next seven years, he lost two wives, a brother, nephew and stepdaughter plus the husband of his second wife whose death permitted that marriage (and another payout) -- all under highly suspicious circumstances. Yet the police seemed unable to touch him.
The truth was more prosaic. Authorities were thwarted by evidence that, pre-DNA testing, didn't quite meet the threshold for making charges stick. That, and a resourceful attorney whose zeal for defending his client was matched only by the alacrity with which he pursued Maxwell's insurance claims -- for which he cut a deal to take half of all he recouped. For ex-Democratic state lawmaker Tom Radney, defending Maxwell was highly remunerative but came at reputational cost. Rehabilitation was at hand though when, at the funeral of Maxwell's stepdaughter, a relative of the girl, Robert Burns, shot Maxwell dead -- Radney lost one client and acquired another.
And Radney was who tipped Lee, an acquaintance, to this real-life Southern Gothic. For Lee it was a literary homecoming. "Mockingbird" wasn't the book she'd intended as "Watchman" attests. In that germinal work, far from being a "moral exemplar," Atticus kvetches about the NAACP and integration. It sought to capture an insidious reality wherein upstanding citizens could "defend a black man in court only to bar him from the ballot box...," writes Cep. "Mockingbird's" simplification was driven by novelistic exigency; her editor found "Watchman" preachy. But it also pandered to Northerners' expectations, Cep adds. Later, Lee reprised "Watchman's" theme in a story commissioned by Esquire about "some white people who were segregationists & at the same time loathed & hated the K.K.K." It was deemed "an axiomatic impossibility" and spiked.
Here was a real-life case true to her lived experience then that was impregnable to an editor's red pen. And Burns' trial, for which Lee decamped south, didn't disappoint: amid fervid legal sparring, Radney's daring insanity defense prevailed -- Burns was consigned to a psychiatric hospital from which within weeks he was discharged. By turning the proceedings into a proxy trial of Maxwell -- calling a witness who testified Maxwell attempted to enlist him in a plot to murder his stepdaughter -- Radney valorized Burns as an agent of retributive justice. He also expiated his own sins.
But it also trod vexed ground -- "moral muddiness concerning black criminality in a criminally racist society." Then there was Radney, for all his progressivism and civil rights activism a troubling figure, supposed redemption or not. While Maxwell kept his liberty and Radney took him to the bank (locals branded the plush office he built himself, "the Maxwell House"), a black community marked by extended kinship ties was terrorized, wondering who'd be next to suffer one of the accidents or premature deaths that uncannily befell many of Maxwell's relatives.
It was knotty and dramatically unwieldy, not to mention the "mountain of rumors and ... molehill of facts," as Lee put it. Then there were her scruples; she didn't hold with the license Capote took to arrange, even invent, facts for a more congenial narrative. She recast her account as fiction but didn't get far.
Cep narrates this saga atmospherically and with empathy. There are lyrical passages -- Alabama "sits like a headstone between Mississippi and Georgia" -- plus judicious detail: police at Maxwell's funeral scan "men's blazers to see if they flapped in the wind or stayed still, held down by the weight of a gun." Excursions into the annals of life insurance fraud and folkways of voodoo are fascinating. Though I wonder if she reckons sufficiently with Radney -- an exhibit here of the insouciance toward "black-on-black crime" she otherwise notes.
Ultimately, Cep conjectures, Lee lost "her nerve." Here, the 17 years since "Mockingbird's" publication during which she'd been blocked before the trial hardly seem an incidental prologue. Lee's complaints about the penal tax bracket into which "Mockingbird's" earnings vaulted her, supposedly proscribing her ability to work, appear to transpose a wider defensive crouch -- a sentiment captured in a remark cited in a New York Times review of a 2006 biography: "When you're at the top, there's only one way to go."
In relinquishing the burden of "expectations," Lee found release. "Somewhere along the line, she stopped doing two things destructive to her own well-being," writes Cep. "One was drinking; the other was writing.... After three dark decades, her letters become more buoyant -- no longer anguished, and absent almost any mention of trying to write."

Texto completo: Eleven years ago this month, a fire ripped through a part of Universal Studios Hollywood.
At the time, the company said that the blaze had destroyed the theme park's "King Kong" attraction and a video vault that contained only copies of old works.
But, according to an article published on Tuesday by The New York Times Magazine, the fire also tore through an archive housing treasured audio recordings, amounting to what the piece described as "the biggest disaster in the history of the music business."
[ Read the full investigation here: "The Day The Music Burned. "]
What happened?
The fire started in the early hours of June 1, 2008.
Overnight, maintenance workers had used blowtorches to repair the roof of a building on the set of New England Street, a group of colonial-style buildings used in scenes for movies and television shows. The workers followed protocol and waited for the shingles they worked on to cool, but the fire broke out soon after they left, just before 5 a.m.
The flames eventually reached Building 6197, known as the video vault, which housed videotapes, film reels and, crucially, a library of master sound recordings owned by Universal Music Group.
Hundreds of firefighters responded to the fire. After trying to douse it with foam retardant and water from a nearby lake, emergency personnel decided to dismantle the warehouse containing the vault to more easily put out the fire.
[Musicians mourned the fiery destruction of their recordings.]
What was lost?
Almost all of the master recordings stored in the vault were destroyed in the fire, including those produced by some of the most famous musicians since the 1940s.
In a confidential report in 2009, Universal Music Group estimated the loss at about 500,000 song titles.
The lost works most likely included masters in the Decca Records collection by Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Judy Garland. The fire probably also claimed some of Chuck Berry's greatest recordings, produced for Chess Records, as well as the masters of some of Aretha Franklin's first appearances on record.
Almost of all of Buddy Holly's masters were lost, as were most of John Coltrane's masters in the Impulse Records collection. The fire also claimed numerous hit singles, likely including Bill Haley and His Comets' "Rock Around the Clock," Etta James's "At Last" and the Kingsmen's "Louie Louie."
The list of artists affected spans decades of popular music. It includes recordings by Ray Charles, B.B. King, the Four Tops, Joan Baez, Neil Diamond, Sonny and Cher, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Al Green, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Buffett, the Eagles, Aerosmith, Rufus and Chaka Khan, Barry White, Patti LaBelle, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Police, Sting, Steve Earle, R.E.M., Janet Jackson, Guns N' Roses, Mary J. Blige, No Doubt, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Nirvana, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Tupac Shakur, Eminem, 50 Cent and the Roots.
What are master recordings, and why do they matter?
A master recording is the one-of-a-kind original recording of a piece of music. It's the source from which other vinyl records, CDs, MP3s and all other recordings are made.
According to the article, documents show that the vault contained masters dating back decades, including multitrack recordings on which individual instruments remained isolated from one another. There were also session masters, including recordings that had never been commercially released. The recordings within the vault came from to some of the most important record labels of all time.
Audiophiles and audio professionals view such recordings with special regard.
"A master is the truest capture of a piece of recorded music," Adam Block, the former president of Legacy Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment's catalog arm, told the magazine. "Sonically, masters can be stunning in their capturing of an event in time. Every copy thereafter is a sonic step away."
Why are we only finding about this now?
At the time, the fire made news around the world, and the vault featured heavily in that coverage. But most articles focused only on the video recordings in the archive and, even then, news outlets largely characterized the disaster as a crisis averted.
Jody Rosen, the writer of the article, described the successful effort to play down the scope of the loss as a "triumph of crisis management" that involved officials working for Universal Music Group on both coasts. Those efforts were undoubtedly aimed at minimizing public embarrassment, but some suggest the company was also particularly worried about a backlash from artists and artist estates whose master recordings had been destroyed.
The real extent of the loss was laid out in litigation and company documents obtained by Mr. Rosen, a contributing writer for the magazine.
How bad is the loss?
Mr. Rosen described the loss as historic, and even Universal Music Group itself -- privately -- viewed what happened in bleak terms: "Lost in the fire was, undoubtedly, a huge musical heritage," reads one 2009 internal assessment.
Record companies have had a troubled history with such recordings and have been known to trash them in bulk. Decades ago, employees of CBS Records reportedly took power saws to multitrack masters to sell the reels as scrap metal. In the 1970s, RCA destroyed masters by Elvis Presley in a broader purge.
Because of that history, industry professionals have long questioned how committed the major music labels are to preserving what they see as priceless artifacts.
Today, most commercial recordings from the past century and beyond are controlled by only three giant record companies: Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and, of course, Universal Music Group.

Rich Lowry: Business CEOs issue statement about abortion

Texto completo: Clarity of thought and expression about moral issues is not a core competency of CEOs.
If anyone had any doubt, look no further than the “historic” pro-abortion statement by nearly 200 CEOs that ran in a full-page ad in The New York Times. It is a festival of absurdity and euphemism, an exercise in perverse virtue-signaling to a progressive audience that believes that maintaining one of the most permissive pro-abortion regimes in the developed world is a virtue.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color.jpg?resize=300%2C293&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="293" data-recalc-dims="1" />
The CEOs define abortion as “equality” (“Don’t Ban Equality”) and, of course, refer to it as “comprehensive reproductive care,” the ubiquitous phrase that has the advantage of sounding like the opposite of what it’s describing.
The CEOs contend that abortion is central to their businesses, which might be true if all of their companies had the same business model as Planned Parenthood, one of the organizers of the effort. But Bloomberg L.P., Amalgamated Bank and H&M, to name three of the companies whose CEOs signed the ad, are hardly dependent on abortion to thrive.
The old saw was, “What’s good for General Motors is good for America.” Now, according to top CEOs, what’s good for abortion is good for American business. They seem to consider abortion a crucial component of GDP just like personal consumption, business investment, government spending and net exports.
They argue that “equality in the workplace” is an important business issue, and it is impossible to achieve without unrestricted access to abortion. Any restriction “threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers.”
The idea that abortion is necessary for the health of women is one of the most misleading pro-abortion cliches. Comprehensive data from Florida last year shows that three-quarters of abortions were elective, and another one-fifth were for social and economic reasons. A small percentage involve a threat to the mother’s life or health, and pro-life laws account for such cases — even the sweeping Alabama law has a health exception.
The contention that restrictions put “the economy at risk” is nonsensical. Are we supposed to believe that the reduction of the abortion rate in the U.S. from its high in 1980 of 29.3 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age to its post-Roe v. Wade low of 14.6 as of 2014 has been a calamity for corporate America? On what grounds? Do these CEOs really lament that we don’t have the abortion rate of Bulgaria, Cuba or Kazakhstan?
By this standard, Utah must be a terrible place to do business since its abortion rate is so low, and the District of Columbia an enticing place to do business since its abortion rate is so high. (To the contrary, Forbes ranks Utah as the second-best state for business in the country.)
The implication is that these CEOs prefer that their employees and customers not become mothers, or if they are mothers, not have more children. It apparently hasn’t occurred to them that unborn children will grow up to buy their products or perhaps work for their firms one day, and indeed all the employees they claim to be protecting were themselves, once, vulnerable in the womb.
At the end of the day, their argument isn’t really about restrictions being “bad for business.” What they care about most is that such policies, as they say, go “against our values.”
The CEO ad is another sign that the debate over abortion has entered a new phase. It isn’t enough to say that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, the old Bill Clinton formulation, because that implies a moral disapproval. Now, abortion is a positive good. A stance that used to be limited to the fringes is mainstream enough that CEOs are willing to sign up for it.
Pro-life laws will have to prevail against this inflamed pro-abortion sentiment — and the swath of big business that shares it.

Texto completo: Nueva York hizo historia ayer al convertirse en la primera ciudad del país en destinar fondos de su presupuesto a la atención del aborto.
La ciudad otorgará $250 mil dólares del presupuesto del año fiscal 2020 al Fondo de Acceso al Aborto de Nueva York (NYAAF), una organización que proporciona recursos y asistencia financiera a las personas que no pueden pagar un aborto y que viven o viajan a este estado, informó The New York Times.
Scott Stringer, contralor de NYC , destacó en un comunicado publicado el viernes en Twitter que aunque el aborto es legal en la ciudad, el acceso no siempre ha sido equitativo.
“Estoy orgulloso de que este año el presupuesto proporcionará una victoria progresiva e histórica para los neoyorquinos, y para nuestro país. Es el camino correcto para que la ciudad de Nueva York lidere a la nación “, escribió Stringer.
La medida se produce cuando varios estados trabajan para aprobar leyes que restringirían el acceso al aborto o lo harían ilegal en casi todos los casos.
También ayer, el tribunal federal de Apelaciones del Distrito de Columbia dictaminó que el gobierno de Trump no puede impedir que las inmigrantes menores de edad y las detenidas por las autoridades tengan acceso a abortos.
Abortion is legal in New York, but access hasn’t been equitable.
Today, we take a step forward by providing direct funding for abortion care in the City budget.
I’m proud to have stood with @AMillerNIRH to make this a reality.

Texto completo: At 3:50 p. m. Friday afternoon, a 29-year-old New York City police officer shot and killed himself outside the Staten Island Police precinct where he worked.
It marked the latest in a troubling trend: Three suicides of New York Police Department officers in 10 days – and the fourth this year.
The situation in New York is part of a national problem. Last year, for the third straight year, cops who died by suicide outnumbered line-of-duty deaths.
New York's string of tragedies prompted NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill to deliver a call for action and to encourage fellow cops to not be afraid to seek help if they need it.
"This is a mental-health crisis," O'Neill tweeted Friday night. "And we – the NYPD and the law enforcement profession as a whole – absolutely must take action. This cannot be allowed to continue. Cops spend so much of their days assisting others. There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department.
"Accepting help is never a sign of weakness," he added. "In fact, it's a sign of great strength. "
The NYPD has not released the name of the latest police officer who died from suicide.
A funeral was held Monday for Steven Silks, a 62-year-old deputy police chief who shot and killed himself in a car on June 5. The New York Times reported that Silks, a 38-year veteran of the department, parked his car on a quiet street just hours after his mandatory retirement was announced. He shot himself near where his retirement ceremony would have taken place.
His death rattled many in the department.
"Steve truly was one of the most capable and most dependable cops this job has ever seen," O'Neill said. "His entire career, much of his adult life in fact, was devoted to New York City, to its police officers and to fighting crime and to protect all the people that we serve. "
The day after Silks's death, June 6, Detective Joseph Calabrese, 58, went missing. A member of the force for 37 years, Calabrese's car was found off Belt Parkway in Brooklyn, the New York Times reported. After a massive search, he was found dead in nearby bushes at Plumb Beach with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
"Det. Joseph Calabrese kept New Yorkers safe for nearly four decades," Police Chief Terance Monahan tweeted following his burial ceremony Wednesday. "Loved by his fellow cops, the loss of Joe is difficult for every member of the NYPD. As he’s laid to rest, our prayers are with his family. Joe’s death has ignited a conversation we must all continue. #StopSuicide"
In 2018, 159 police officers in the U. S. died from suicide, according to the Massachusetts-based nonprofit BlueH. E. L. P. , which tracks officer suicides while also seeking to prevent such tragedies from occurring.
That's 9% more than the 144 line-of-duty deaths in 2018. The latter includes include causes such as felonious assaults, patrol vehicle accidents, heart attacks and duty-related illness.
“As tragic as these duty deaths are, the single greatest cause of death for law enforcement officers each year is suicide,” Jeff McGill, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P, said when the group released the 2018 figures.
The number of suicides last year matched the 159 who took their lives in 2017. In 2016, 140 police officers in the U. S. committed suicide.
Blue H. E. L. P. works to expand police officers’ access to mental health services.
Its organizers say that 151 of the suicides last year were male and eight were female. The average age was 41 years old and the average length of service in the police force was 15 years.
But according to Steven Hough, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P. , the number of police suicides is likely greater.
“The problem is we know there are other tragic deaths by suicide that we don’t know about,” Hough was quoted saying earlier this year. “So as bad a number as we have this year, we’re saddened by the fact that we know in reality the number is higher. ”

People
Nick Cannon is coming to radio.
Meruelo Media on Friday announced the rapper, comedian and actor is joining Los Angeles hip-hop radio station Power 106 as host of its morning show. "Nick Cannon Mornings" launches Monday from 5 to 10 a.m.
In a statement, Cannon says he's honored for the opportunity to "make our community and culture proud."
Cannon hosts Fox's "The Masked Singer" and MTV's "Wild 'N Out."
Meruelo Media president and COO Otto Padron says Cannon's "tremendous success across television, film and music is testimony of his unique talent, work ethic and impeccable reputation."
The 38-year-old married singer Mariah Carey in 2008, and they divorced in 2016. They are parents to fraternal twins.
Gooding attorney: Accuser stalked 'Maguire' star
An attorney for Cuba Gooding Jr. is refuting conclusions some have drawn from a surveillance video showing the actor touching a woman who has accused him of groping her.
The snippet, obtained and published by TMZ on Thursday, appears to show the actor at Manhattan's Magic Hour Rooftop Bar & Lounge putting his hand on or near the woman's leg and breast while they sat with Gooding's girlfriend, Claudine De Niro, between them.
But his longtime attorney, Mark J. Heller, dismissed the website's claims that Gooding touched the woman's thigh and breast.
"He's not alleged to have touched a leg," Heller told the Los Angeles Times over the phone on Friday. "He was sitting with Claudine privately, and this woman was literally stalking them, following them from place to place to place. Cuba is very, very polite, he would never rebuff a fan, but this woman literally sat almost on top of Claudine."
The veteran attorney said that Gooding is alleged to have forcibly squeezed the woman's breast, something Heller did not see happen in the surveillance video. The recording was among the hours of footage he reviewed before the Oscar winner surrendered at a New York Police Department precinct on Thursday.
"There is not a scintilla of criminal conduct revealed on that tape," Heller said.
The "People v. O.J. Simpson" star pleaded not guilty on Thursday to misdemeanor charges, including one count of forcible touching and one count of sexual abuse in the third degree, according to the complaint filed by the Manhattan district attorney.
At the time, Heller told reporters at the police station and the New York Times that the hours of video they reviewed did not show any inappropriate conduct or anything that could be interpreted as such.
The "Jerry Maguire" star was arraigned Thursday before Judge Herbert Moses, who released him without bail. Attorney Peter Toumbekis served as Gooding's defense counsel in court.

Bankrolling the man behind FBI's Bigfoot file

Texto completo: The FBI captured the imagination of the nation last week when the bureau released 22 pages of documents concerning the origin of 15 unidentified hairs and tissue sent to the agency by a renowned Bigfoot researcher.
The documents, which date back to the 1970s, include a letter from Peter Byrne, director of the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in Oregon, asking if the FBI would analyze some mysterious samples — “the first that we have obtained in six years which we feel may be of importance" — that he suspected of belonging to a Sasquatch.
The bottom of the type-written note revealed Byrne's sponsor: The Academy of Applied Science, Boston, Massachusetts.
That's right. Boston . Birthplace of the American Revolution. Home of the Celtics, the Red Sox, the Bruins, and apparently, Bigfoot benefactors.
The Academy of Applied Science was founded in 1963 by intellectual property lawyer Robert Rines. A nonprofit dedicated to promoting science and technology, the academy was based out of Rines's home on India Wharf, on Boston's waterfront, at the time, and supplied Byrne with more than $1 million in his quest to prove the existence of the hairy hominid.
The New England lawyer was better known, however, for his fascination with another cryptid: the fabled Loch Ness monster.
Rines, who died in 2009, was a polymath. He held more than 80 patents for his inventions. He founded Franklin Pierce Law Center, the first law school in New Hampshire. He taught patent law at Harvard and MIT, his alma mater. In his spare time, he composed music for Broadway and off-Broadway shows. He even won an Emmy.
But the Loch Ness monster was his obsession. It all started when he was vacationing in Scotland in 1972. Looking through a telescope, he eyed “a large, darkish hump . . . with rough, mottled skin, like the back of an elephant," according to The New Yorker. And so the decades-long chase began.
Rines was relentless in his pursuit of the mythic Scottish monster. In the fall of 1970, as the Globe reported, he tried to lure Nessie to the surface with “sexual stimulants" — tape recordings of the mating and eating rituals of various fish and aquatic mammals — dropped into the depths of her watery lair. Needless to say, Nessie resisted temptation.
For later expeditions, Rines collaborated with MIT's famed Harold “Doc" Edgerton to attempt underwater photographs of the monster. He enlisted a pair of camera-mounted dolphins for another mission, but called it off when one tragically died. In the '90s, he turned to high-powered US Navy sonar technology.
“He brought a lot of respectability to the field," said Loren Coleman, founder of the International Crypto­zoology Museum in Portland, Maine. “He had credibility. He wasn't some crackpot. He wasn't some fly-by-night person that just threw money at it. He was long-term."
Coleman crossed paths with Rines many times throughout their careers. They started corresponding in the '80s over their shared affinity for crypto­zoology. In July 1999, Coleman said, he ran into Rines eating breakfast in the village of Drumnadrochit on the west shore of Loch Ness. The men were in Scotland on separate expeditions.
Rines must have been impressed with Byrne's Bigfoot credentials, Coleman said.
Byrne was one of the so-called Four Horsemen of Sasquatchery, known for their pioneering research of the Bigfoot phenomenon between the '50s and '70s.
A former serviceman for the British Royal Air Force, Byrne made a name for himself as a successful big-game hunter in Nepal before embarking on his career as an international Sasquatch researcher. (“Hunter" is a common misnomer for Byrne, who stood firmly in the “no-kill" camp of Bigfoot seekers.)
Rines was just one of the wealthy financiers bankrolling Byrne's pricey Bigfoot expeditions across the Pacific Northwest and the Himalayas. On one such trip to Nepal in 1958, financed by Texas oilman Tom Slick, Byrne swiped a finger from the “Pangboche hand," the supposed mummified remains of a yeti, from a Buddhist monastery. With help from actor Jimmy Stewart and his wife, Gloria, the finger was smuggled to the United Kingdom. (Scientists analyzed the finger's DNA in 2011. The results? Human.)
With Rines's backing, Byrne founded the Bigfoot Information Center and Exhibition in The Dalles, Ore. By 1976, the center had logged 94 “credible" Bigfoot sightings, The New York Times reported at the time.
That same year, the newly released FBI documents show, Byrne wrote to the bureau asking if it would examine the hairs and tissue he was unable to identify. Surprisingly, the FBI agreed.
It turned out that the samples were “of deer family origin," the FBI said.
Byrne didn't give up. With a $1 million, five-year grant from Rines's Academy of Applied Science, Byrne started the Bigfoot Research Project, also in Oregon, in the early 1990s. The money from Rines allowed Byrne to hire two assistants “to help him launch the most high-tech monster search the world has ever seen," as the Chicago Tribune put it in 1995. Byrne even operated a toll-free number, 1-800-BIGFOOT, that callers could use to report possible Sasquatch sightings or unusually large footprints.
Rines “felt there were new animals to be discovered on the land, in the air, and in the sea," Coleman said. “He felt deep down . . . he wanted to support those efforts."
Byrne, who is 93, told The Washington Post last week he's actually never seen a Bigfoot. And Rines never recaptured that moment of joy and wonder when he believed he spotted Nessie on his vacation to Scotland in 1972. Rines died of heart failure at the age of 87. Toward the end of his life, he was convinced all Loch Ness monsters had perished, lamenting in interviews the creatures had gone extinct due to global warming.
Any future quest for the legendary beasts, he believed, would only turn up their bones.

'Good Fighter' Faces Biggest Fight of Her Career in the Crisis in Hong Kong

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Carrie Lam, the embattled chief executive of Hong Kong, is a workaholic who sleeps three to five hours a night. She assiduously reads letters from constituents. Within the Hong Kong civil service, she is labeled a "houdadak," or "good fighter," because she practically never backs down in a bureaucratic battle.
The question is whether Mrs. Lam will back down, or dig in further, in the biggest political fight of her career -- one that could determine how long she stays in office.
Mrs. Lam is trying to push an extradition bill through the Hong Kong Legislative Council that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China, Taiwan and elsewhere for prosecution.
But business executives, seeing this week's violent street protests against the bill and fearful they might someday be extradited themselves to uncertain fates in China's opaque judicial system, are becoming increasingly critical of the plan. This has prompted some of Mrs. Lam's senior advisers to recommend postponing legislative approval.
She put the bill forward in February in response to pleas from the parents of a young woman who was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend while the pair visited Taiwan. The boyfriend is in Hong Kong, which does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan.
For all her stated intentions, Mrs. Lam's plan faces a serious difficulty: Taiwan has said it would not seek his extradition under the proposed arrangement. Many in Hong Kong worry that if the bill is passed, mainland Chinese officials might use it to demand the extradition, for trial on the mainland, of citizens and visitors alike who displease the Communist Party.
As many as a million protesters took to the streets last Sunday. Demonstrations on Wednesday turned into street clashes with the police.
People who know Mrs. Lam describe her as a relentlessly driven civil servant who gets results. After a plan to develop a museum district on West Kowloon peninsula stalled, Mrs. Lam took charge. Now it is opening in stages.
"Carrie is very, very bright, extremely bright, and very, very decisive, stern -- she makes up her mind to do something and does it," said Allan Zeman, a Hong Kong business leader who helped on the museum project and was one of Mrs. Lam's advisers when she campaigned two years ago to be appointed chief executive.
"She is very demanding of her staff, expects perfection," he added, using the term "workaholic" repeatedly to describe her.
Mrs. Lam has spoken publicly of how, as a girl attending a strict Catholic girls' school run by nuns in Hong Kong, she became so accustomed to being the top student in her class that she was once reduced to tears when she came in fourth. She went on to study at the elite Hong Kong University, then embarked on a 39-year career in government, serving in 21 different posts.
Mrs. Lam, 62, prefers the courtesy title "Mrs.," not "Ms." Her husband is a retired Hong Kong mathematician who lives in Britain, as does one of their two sons; the other son works in mainland China.
One of Mrs. Lam's strengths in bureaucratic battles over the years has been her pointed reminders to colleagues that if she did not get her way, she would happily retire and live in Britain with her husband. In an interview with local television on Wednesday, she became teary-eyed while talking about the personal sacrifices she had made to serve as chief executive.
But she also seemed determined not to give in to protesters. She compared the government's response to young protesters to her own experience raising two sons.
If a mother gives in to a child's demands, she said, then years later, "He will ask me, 'Mom, why didn't you remind me back then?' "
The comment antagonized some in Hong Kong. It reminded them of another of her nicknames, "the babysitter," which she acquired for cleaning up political messes created by men in top jobs.
Over the last few years, Mrs. Lam has evolved toward more pro-Beijing positions as Xi Jinping, China's top leader, has demanded ever greater obedience from Hong Kong.
When protesters from the so-called Umbrella Movement occupied downtown Hong Kong in 2014 to demand free elections, Mrs. Lam played a conciliatory role, even as the chief executive at the time, Leung Chun-ying, took a much harder line. She spent many hours in meetings with protest organizers in an unsuccessful effort to reach a compromise.
But she was careful not to encourage expectations that she might pursue greater democracy after taking office.
In an interview two years ago, shortly before taking office as chief executive, Mrs. Lam acknowledged "a certain degree of truth" in the argument that Hong Kong's inability to introduce broad democracy was making it more difficult to address complex social issues like housing, education and infrastructure.
But she added: "If we were to have universal suffrage tomorrow, would all these problems disappear? I don't think so."
She declined to be interviewed again this week.
One question is whether the extradition bill was Mrs. Lam's idea, or if Beijing's leaders urged her to propose it.
She has said the bill was her response to five letters she received from the parents of the murder victim in Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party leaders then strongly endorsed the idea.
Two people with a detailed knowledge of Hong Kong government policymaking, who insisted on anonymity because of the political sensitivities involved, said the legislation was Mrs. Lam's idea. They said she had quickly pushed it forward in response to the letters, with very little consultation either within the Hong Kong government or with Beijing.
Anson Chan, who was Hong Kong's second-highest official before her retirement in 2001, said that although she had initially wondered if Beijing was involved in the bill, she now finds it plausible that Mrs. Lam acted alone.
"She was never a team player, and ever since she took up this post, she has become ever more authoritarian," said Mrs. Chan, who has become an advocate of democracy since her retirement.
Mrs. Lam has a track record of trying to help complete strangers. Throughout her career in the civil service, and even now as chief executive of a territory of seven million people, she has made the time to read personal petitions from the public.
An almost completely paralyzed young Hong Kong woman with a genetic illness wrote an appeal to Mrs. Lam in late 2017, asking for the territory's public health service to pay for an extremely expensive new medicine for the rare medical problem. Mrs. Lam quickly had her staff approve payments for the drug.
Opposition to the extradition bill is so fierce in Hong Kong now that many protesters and pro-democracy lawmakers have called not only for Mrs. Lam to withdraw the legislation but also to resign. A resignation, however, would trigger a long and acrimonious legal process to select her successor -- not something Beijing wants or needs in the middle of a trade war with the United States, and as the Chinese economy slows.
The question is how much more of a political price will Mrs. Lam be willing to pay in order to prevail on the extradition issue.
"Her credibility is now severely dented," Mrs. Chan said. "If she insists on bulldozing this proposal through the Legislative Council, where pro-Beijing parties have a majority, she will find it increasingly difficult to govern Hong Kong in the next three years."

Texto completo: Joe Biden is not Jeb Bush. He's not Mitt Romney, and he is absolutely not Hillary Clinton. Today, Joe Biden is Donald Trump.
Bear with me.
The former vice president's paeans to civility and decency, to democracy and to the system, strike the precise opposite tone to the man in the Oval Office today. Biden, who has been within a heartbeat of that station himself, is the ultimate insider. President Trump's outsider-ness is the basis of his brand.
But despite these differences, and despite all the rally-to-rally sparring between classical American liberalism's last best hope and its top public enemy, Biden now faces something strangely similar to what the current commander in chief faced three years ago: the disapproval of a certain swath of the commentariat, its members lining up behind some candidate, any candidate, other than him.
Remember Never Trump? Welcome to Never Biden.
The writer David Klion brought the term to Twitter this week, albeit facetiously. And the movement, if you can call it that, is far from uniform. The most moderate Democrats, many of them members of yesterday's guard, appreciate the most moderate candidate. And, of course, those Never Trump moderate Republicans, or the onetime Republicans who renounced the label after the last election, may love the guy most of all. The most strident praise for Biden in the New York Times recently, in fact, came from not-so-liberal stalwart Bret Stephens: "Be Proud of Your Crime Bill," he urged the Democratic front- runner.
But good luck with that. Because as long as Biden is connected to his crime bill or any of the other regressive beliefs that have marked his extended career, there's a vocal segment of the Democratic electorate moving in lockstep against him. The leftiest of the left obviously can't abide Biden one bit. But many other progressive pundits and activists are eager to attack him as unacceptable, especially when they are millennials, and especially when they are extremely online.
Before Biden announced his candidacy, op-eds abounded begging him, for the love of God and party, not to run. He didn't listen, and now every past and present transgression sparks column after column about his inability to meet the current moment. Countless inches have been devoted to dismantling the narrative of Biden's supreme electability.
Many of the Internet's most prominent Hillary Clinton aficionados and still-with-her resisters have pivoted toward Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), rolling their eyes - sometimes complete with memes from "Big Little Lies" - at this old man and his old ways. Those who think talking about a "rigged system" is dangerous demagoguery look instead to the optimism of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who still goes on about "hope" but isn't in his 70s. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) seems to offer something in between. Each of their supporters has preferences, but, in many cases, that preference, and the time devoted to expressing it, is first for their candidate and second, against Biden.
The rest of the Democratic field has mostly resisted taking shots at each other. But at Biden, they're ready to take aim, and sometimes they will even fire - though they usually refuse to call him by his name. It's about generational gaps, or it's about the inadequacy of a middle ground, or it's about the silliness of trying to restore a system that was broken before Trump. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, not doing so well for himself at the moment, said explicitly on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" this week that Biden is a return to the past.
Of course, there is a key difference between the backlashes against Biden and Trump. Three years ago, the Republican Party was attempting to save itself from radicalization, which took the form of a racist nativism whose rumblings the Never Trump collective wanted to quell entirely, or at least to keep quiet. Now, much of the Democratic Party is attempting to save itself through radicalization - championing the upheaval of the economic order and foreign policy consensus.
Electing someone who wants to bring back pre-2016 America isn't just unsatisfactory; it's a threat. The leftward lurch in policy positions and priorities happened after Trump's victory, so why would progressives want to turn back the clock? "Best Friends Day" bracelets desperately reminding voters of a long-ago bromance with Barack Obama aren't the comfort Biden wants them to be.
But is the threat enough to spook him into retirement? Never Biden Democrats, after all, may not remain Never Biden. Many Never Trump Republicans did not end up saying never - and the current president is so unpalatable to Democratic voters that it would take a lot to keep them from voting against him. And besides, like last time around, those who dislike the front-runner may be more noisy than numerous. Plenty of people do like Biden, in poll after poll. The Twitter pundits and columnists in left-leaning publications may think they're talking to America when they're actually only talking to each other.
If Joe Biden is Donald Trump, he just might win.

Daily on Healthcare, presented by the Alzheimer’s Association: The ABCs of OTC birth control

THE ABCS OF OTC BIRTH CONTROL: The debate about how to go about selling birth control pills over the counter is making headlines again.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., re-introduced legislation Thursday that would obligate insurers to pay for birth control pills that patients could get without a doctor’s prescription. The move comes after Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tweeted that he would like to co-sponsor legislation to allow birth control to be sold over the counter with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
Both Republicans and Democrats would like to see people have the convenience of having the option to buy the pill directly at the pharmacy. Democrats, however, want to see health insurers cover the medications whether a patient has a prescription or not. Without that feature, they say, patients ultimately will end up paying more.
It wouldn’t be a first: People can already get prescriptions for some drugs that they can also get over the counter, including Plan B, Motrin, smoking cessation gums or patches, allergy medications, and the heartburn-relief drugs Prilosec and Zantac. When people buy these drugs over the counter, however, they’re not also covered by health insurance.
People may pay less if they get the same medication with a prescription instead of over the counter, though they’d have to weigh that against how much they would pay for a doctor’s visit if they need one.
Here’s the catch: Allowing drugs to be sold over the counter is an authority delegated to the Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA doesn’t have the power to obligate insurers to cover it. Selling drugs over the counter starts with pharmaceuticals petitioning the FDA.
How some states get around it: Pharmacists prescribe the drug in Washington, D.C., and the 12 states that already allow it.
Objections that have cropped up in the past: Not every pill has the same side effects for every person, and doctors can help guide patients through their options, especially when they’re first getting started or if they need to switch. Opponents also have raised concerns that women would miss out on other services they get out of visits to the doctor, including screenings for sexually transmitted diseases.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EXPANDS HRAS TO MAKE THEM ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PLANS: The Trump administration announced Thursday that it will let employers use Health Reimbursement Arrangements to let workers buy coverage in the individual market. The administration estimated that 11 million employees could benefit from the provision, which is especially intended to help out small employers and is tax-free to both the worker and the employer.
The Trump administration rulemaking, a follow-up to President Trump’s 2017 executive order promoting “healthcare choice,” reverses an Obama administration rule that blocked workers from using funds in HRAs to buy health insurance plans on the individual market.
MAINE OBLIGATES INSURERS TO COVER ABORTIONS: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed a measure Thursday to require public and private insurers to cover abortions. While the law makes exceptions for religious employers who object to providing coverage for abortions under current Maine law, the new law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide abortion coverage for MaineCare beneficiaries. The Maine Senate approved the bill on Wednesday by a count of 19-16, and the House approved the bill by a vote of 82-59.
DEMOCRAT PRAMILA JAYAPAL WRITES NYT OP-ED ABOUT HER ABORTION: Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., wrote in a New York Times op-ed that she had an abortion 22 years ago after being told by doctors that her pregnancy would be “extremely high risk.” Following the difficult pregnancy of her first child, Janak, who was born prematurely after an emergency C-section, Jayapal was told another pregnancy would be life-threatening and made the decision to terminate her pregnancy. She said it was “a heartbreaking decision, but it was the only one I was capable of making.” She said that while she had not spoken about her abortion before, she felt compelled to do so amid a surge of anti-abortion laws across the country.
HICKENLOOPER DECLINES TO BACK ANY ABORTION RESTRICTIONS: Former Democratic Colorado Governor John Hicklenlooper said he would not back abortion restrictions Thursday. "I look at the woman's right to control what happens to her body as being inalienable," Hickenlooper said in response to a Washington Examiner question about whether there was any scenario in which abortion access could be curtailed. "In other words, that's a right that the government should not take away or infringe upon."
BIDEN’S PAST CENTRIST ABORTION VIEWS RESURFACE: In 1974, a then-31-year-old Senator Joe Biden said the Roe v. Wade decision “went too far” and that a woman does not have “the sole right to say what should happen to her body."
He also struck a more moderate tone in 2006 when he said he is an “odd man out” in his party in believing that abortion is a “tragedy” that should be both “rare and safe.”
NEW YORK OUTLAWS RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS FOR VACCINES: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law Thursday a state-wide ban on religious exemptions for vaccinations as the measles outbreak rages on. New York has seen the largest number of confirmed measles cases. After signing the bill, Cuomo said, “While I understand and respect freedom of religion, our first job is to protect the public health and by signing this measure into law, we will help prevent further transmissions and stop this outbreak right in its tracks.”
CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO REPEAL RULES AGAINST MEDICAL MARIJUANA: The Church of England’s Church Commissioners announced this week it will repeal self-imposed rules against investing in medical marijuana, as it could be a source or revenue for the church. The United Kingdom legalized marijuana for recreational use in November.

Texto completo: KINGWOOD – A new report has named the couple allegedly behind the dog hoarding situation here.
According to a report in the New York Times, the 188 dogs rescued during an animal cruelty investigation were from Rocky Ridge Russells kennel, which is run by the couple and business partners Marcia Knoster and Martin Strozenski.
The 70-year-old Knoster, who lives off of County Route 519 near Stockton, bred a Parson Russell Terrier that went on to win best in breed at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most prestigious dog breed competitions in the world, according to the report.
The dog became No. 2 Parson Russell Terrier in the United States.
"It all just got out of hand," Strozenski told the Times. "This wasn't backyard breeding. Things just went sideways."
On Tuesday, St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center, Somerset Regional Animal Shelter, Monmouth County SPCA, Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office and New Jersey State Police rescued nearly 200 dogs from the property.
The property was in squalor, according to the responders, and most of the dogs, some being pregnant, are thought to not have any veterinary care, including vaccines, microchipping and other standards.
According to the report, there were also several dead dogs found on the property.
The Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office, which has yet to name the people or give the address of the location, said that an animal cruelty investigation is still underway and charges are pending.
Those interested in donating to St. Hubert's can do so by visiting www.sthuberts.org or by calling the organization at 973-377-2295. Somerset Regional Animal Shelter can be reached at www.srasnj.org or at 908-725-0308.

Biel's second shot at vaccine stance

Texto completo: Regrets, Dave Letterman has a few. Chief among them? The 30-plus interviews he did with Donald Trump on his talk shows, NBC's "Late Night" and the "Late Show" on CBS.
The comedian did an interview this week with The Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter podcast in which he looked back on the many sit-down gabs he had over the years with the future president. "I had no sense that he was the soulless bastard that he's turned into," Letterman said on the podcast. "He used to be kind of like the boob of New York that pretended to be wealthy, or we thought was wealthy, and now he's just a psychotic. Is that putting too fine a point on it?"
As our colleague Kyle Swenson reports, the two men havea complicated history. Letterman often needled Trump from his host's chair, sometimes simply joking about his cartoonish, rich-guy persona - but the jokes ultimately gave way to more barbed criticism. Trump's birther claims about then-President Obama prompted the funnyman to label him even calling him a racist, according to the New York Times (he later apologized on air and had Trump back as a guest).
Trump's now in the White House and Letterman no longer finds him funny, but he still would like one more interview. "I would just like to say, 'Don, it's Dave. Remember me? I want to talk to the real Donald Trump,' " Letterman said. "Because I now don't know which is the real Donald Trump, and if the Donald Trump that I was talking to [back then] was the real Donald Trump, how do you get to be the guy he is now?

Texto completo: The documentary " The Serengeti Rules " explores the idea that most complex ecosystems involve a "keystone" species: a critical link in a balanced chain of life on which all the other links depend. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the beautifully shot film has a "tendency toward hyperbole" and suffers from the fact that it takes "quite a while to get to its thesis." Unrated. At the AFI Silver Theatre. 84 minutes.

" Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation " is a documentary about the 1969 music festival on an Upstate New York farm that became a cultural touchstone. Featuring all archival footage and no talking-head interviews - just off-screen commentary by the likes of musician David Crosby - the film examines both what went wrong with the festival and what worked, as when concession food ran out and the farm's neighbors pitched in to feed hungry concertgoers. According to the New York Times, "The 'love thy neighbor' ethos behind that sentiment has been all but choked out of this country's lingua franca. This movie will compel you to think about why that happened." Unrated. At Landmark's E Street Cinema. 106 minutes.

Texto completo: A picture, we all know, is worth a thousand words. But which thousand is often up to the individual viewer.
This can be especially true when it comes to editorial cartoons. As a form of expression, a single cartoon panel can have a unique power to make a viewer laugh in agreement or growl with displeasure. Interestingly, the reaction is immediate — a chuckle, a guffaw, a pounding of the fist on the table — but the effect, at least in the best of cases, is long-lasting, as the viewer naturally is induced to reflect on the meaning and intent of a particular issue’s visual portrayal.
Unfortunately, though, nuance is not usually the editorial cartoonist’s stock in trade, so in many, if not most, cases, an individual cartoon must be examined very narrowly, and in some cases, a lack of depth can leave a cartoon open to vastly different interpretations.
All this makes selecting editorial cartoons for publication an imprecise art, no pun intended, for newspapers like the Daily Herald that value presentation of diverse points of view on their Opinion pages. And it can lead to considerable controversy when readers are stung by an artist’s portrayal that they find offensive, wildly exaggerated or simply wrong.
We at the Daily Herald address this challenge by striving to present a wide range of points of view in the editorial cartoons we publish from day to day. The New York Times has decided to deal with it by ending publication of editorial cartoons altogether in its international editions.
The Times’ decision followed an outcry over an April cartoon that lampooned President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Many critics found the image overtly anti-Semitic. The Times later agreed and apologized.
The artist, it’s worth noting, insisted that he did not mean to promote anti-Semitism but just wanted to make a statement about what he saw as President Trump’s blind loyalty to the Israeli leader. He is finding — as legions of Twitter and social media commentators also learn from time to time — that the inherent power of an arresting image or clever phrase can be abused by clumsy presentation.
The Times has never been particularly fond of editorial cartoons and had already ceased publication of them in its domestic editions. In a blog reacting to his newspaper’s decision to cease publishing traditional editorial cartoons in all its editions, Times cartoonist Patrick Chappatte, who did not draw the offending panel, described cartoons as "visual shortcut(s) with an unmatched capacity to touch the mind" and said that quality is both "their strength, and their vulnerability." He lamented that we live in an age when "moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm" to intimidate publishers and commentators.
In short, combine a moralistic mob and a visual shortcut and you have a formula for trouble. Chappatte thinks the solution is "to stop being afraid of the angry mob," and I’m willing to side with him to a point. But I’ve also found that the degree of people’s objection to the "angry mob" often depends on which angry mob they’re a part of. So, I place my hope and faith in the willingness — even as grudging as it sometimes is — for citizens of a country that values free speech and a free press to, within certain broad boundaries, tolerate views and images they abhor as long as their own views can get a fair hearing.
Or, in the case of editorial cartoons, a fair viewing.
For our part at the Daily Herald, we’re constantly evaluating how we use editorial cartoons and how we select the ones we publish. Like Chappatte, we still think they have a unique capacity to compact a complex idea into an instantaneous picture, as long as we respect the sentiments and diversity of the readers transforming each image into those thousand words.

Rancher featured in HBO film

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — A Gobernador rancher who has emerged as one of the leading local proponents of requiring the capture of methane emissions in the Four Corners region is featured in a new documentary film about climate change airing on HBO.
Don Schreiber, owner of the Devil's Spring Ranch in western Rio Arriba County, said the director and crew members for the film "Ice on Fire" — which made its debut on HBO June 11 — visited his family three times in late 2017 and early 2018 to conduct interviews and shoot footage.
According to hbo.com, the 98-minute film is narrated by Leonard DiCaprio, and produced by him and his father, George DiCaprio, among others. It features locations around the world and focuses on solutions to what it calls the escalating environmental crisis.
Schreiber's ranch was chosen because he has advocated for stricter regulations regarding venting and flaring from natural gas wells. The Four Corners region is home to a sizable "methane cloud" that researchers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology have attributed largely to gas wells, storage tanks, pipelines and processing plants. Industry advocates have responded by linking the emissions to natural sources such as coal formations and have fought increased regulation, which they say will have a negative economic impact.
Schreiber, who served on the transition team for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, said the segment of the film in which he appears deals with the issue of methane emissions in the Four Corners, a topic that he said remains relevant since he was interviewed a year and a half ago by director Leila Conners.
"These things have not lost any currency here and are more timely than ever," he said.
Schreiber said he a cameraman and Conners followed him on a tour of his ranch, where a FLIR thermographic camera was used to capture footage of methane leaking from well sites. Schreiber said Conners peppered him with questions as they walked.
"In this film, there's nothing scripted," Schreiber said, describing the experience of being interviewed by the director. "You have no idea what questions they're going to ask you. They're looking for honest, uncut reactions."
Schreiber has spoken to media outlets ranging from NPR to PBS over the years about the methane cloud, so he is relatively used to being interviewed. He said he always takes care to choose his words carefully, aspiring to be a voice for others in the region who are not on the radar of major media organizations.
"I'm always concerned that I represent in my answers the truth," he said. "I'm always aware that I'm talking for so many people who don't get the call from The New York Times or HBO. ... I feel a great burden every time they turn the camera on me to say something meaningful."
Schreiber was invited to the documentary's Los Angeles premiere at the Bing Theater on June 5 and got to view it then. He said the segment on the Four Corners lasts for approximately seven minutes and features Dr. Gabrielle Petron, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association who has studied the methane cloud for many years.
"It all went by in a flash," Schreiber said. "But I felt we were well represented."
When asked to evaluate his own appearance in the film, Schreiber burst out laughing.
"Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?" he asked rhetorically before turning serious. "Yes, I think that with their editing and their choices, they got a great representation of what it's like to live on the ground with this."
Schreiber attended the premiere with one of his daughters and his sister. He said it was an extremely rewarding experience, one made more memorable by the chance to visit with Conners again and the opportunity to meet Leonardo DiCaprio.
Schreiber admitted to being a little starstruck at the premiere — not just by the Hollywood types that were among the crowd of 700 people, he said, but by some of the nation's more prominent scientific minds. He laughed when he recalled how he realized to his dismay that his phone had run out of photo storage memory and died when he arrived at the event. Schreiber found himself running around with a canapé in one hand and a phone charger in the other, looking for an electrical outlet.
His viewing of the film at the premiere may turn out to be the only opportunity Schreiber has to see the documentary.
"We don't have a TV at the ranch," he said. "We're at the opposite end of the pole from Hollywood."
Nevertheless, he seemed pleased with his decision to participate in the documentary and hopes it sheds some light on the issue of the Four Corners methane cloud.
"I would say the science and the scientists are the stars of this movie, and I'm glad our Four Corners methane problems are getting international attention," he said. "But we really have to be grateful to the DiCaprios for putting science and the scientists at the forefront of the film."

Story time for children in the digital age

Texto completo: "Between the dark and
the daylight,
When the night is beginning
to lower,
Comes a pause in the day's
occupations
That is known as the
Children's Hour."
-Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
For most parents, this means story time: side by side on the sofa; perched on the bed under a blanket; sitting close at the kitchen table.
Whatever the place or whatever the style, this sweet time of sharing a bedtime story with children and grandchildren is one of the gifts of growing up and growing old.
Every June, the American Academy of Pediatrics sends out an advisory to doctors to remind parents at their checkups to be sure and read to their children from birth.
The prescription for reading time, they say, is as important as vaccines and vegetables.
But here's the question.
Does screen-time togetherness count? Is it as worthy to listen or watch, say, "Goodnight Moon" on the iPad, with sound effects and animation, as it is to read the bound print version together?
After all, the same child experts at the American Academy of Pediatrics advise parents to allow no screen time for children under 2 and not more than two hours a day when they get older.
I don't know the answer to the merits of reading electronic books as opposed to book-books, and neither do researchers.
Child psychologists and educators are trying to figure it out, but as of yet this technology is too new to have enough research to back up a firm conclusion.
So far, it seems that book-books are thought to help children learn to read faster and better, but I am not sure that is the goal of the bedtime story.
My 6-year-old grandson and I had some quality "snuggle" time the summer I kept him for several weeks, him in my lap and the both of us playing on my iPad.
He'd make up a sentence to begin a story, then I would add one, the back and forth until we had developed a little plot and brought it to a resolution.
Then we drew illustration for our story and re-read it off the screen.
One of the problems nay-sayers have with screen time rather than book time is that reading from an electronic device means being talked with instead of talked to.
Also, so they say, parents are more apt to abdicate reading time to the device when the child gets old enough to make out the words himself or herself. Being read to even after your child can read, sharing a story and discussing it, is a valuable part of parenting.
We all know that technology will continue to evolve, and print books – some say – eventually will, for the most part, be replaced altogether.
I guess what the specialist in childhood education want to avoid is having the i- and e-stuff become the TV babysitters of coming generations.
When my own children were learning to read, they got a big boost from "Sesame Street."
It presented learning in clever ways, and they got really into it.
Dr. Kyle Snow, a research director at the National Association for the Education of Young Children agrees that it's too early to tell exactly how children will be affected by digital technology, but he is quoted in the New York Times: "We don't want parents to say, 'There's no reason for me to sit here and turn pages and tell my child how to read the word, because the iPad can do it."
As with most things regarding the right way and wrong way to raise kids, it depends on parenting style.
Digital or paper?
It doesn't really matter if bedtime is a time for conversation, affection, and safe-keeping.
There's more than one way to skin a Cat in the Hat.

Not That Park, Not That Play: An Evening Well-Spent

The Game Plan
What to do
Shakespeare in the Park is a rite of summer. What's also great: Shakespeare in a park.
Hudson Warehouse has been staging classical plays in Riverside Park for 16 summers now. This season's lineup features "Antony and Cleopatra" in June, "The Man in the Iron Mask" (Alexandre Dumas) in July, and then in August, the company returns to Shakespeare with an adaptation of "The Merry Wives of Windsor" that's set in a Catskill resort during the '60s.
These intimate productions are decidedly lower key than their Central Park counterparts: Hudson Warehouse uses the north patio of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument at 89th Street and Riverside Drive as a stage and its steps as seating. Admission is pay-what-you're-able, collected in a basket at the end of each show. There are no tickets and no assigned seats; the audience filters in piecemeal and chatters merrily until the production begins.
The players then make the space their own, dashing up and down the stairs through the audience, and using the adjacent lawn as "backstage." And no matter how they set the scene, you can count on trees providing a scenic backdrop and birdsong featuring heavily in the soundtrack.
Hudson Warehouse's performances are plentiful, running Thursday through Sunday each week until August 25. The shows start at 6:30 p.m. Arrive by 6:15 p.m. to secure a spot on a provided cushion, or get there a little earlier if you want to try to grab a spot for your own folding chair. Then sit back and enjoy the drama until the sun fades, the play wraps and the theater becomes a park again.
Pro tip: Rain cancellations are announced on Hudson Warehouse's Twitter and Facebook accounts.
Get directions to Hudson Warehouse's Summer Stage in Riverside Park.
Where to eat
Malecon is open until 11 p.m. -- perfect for a post-show meal, especially when you order a heap of caramelized sweet plantains and the restaurant's famed Dominican roast chicken. A whole bird costs all of $ 15, and leftovers will save you from cooking in the encroaching summer heat, so order one and be sure to nab one of the wings, which glisten with schmaltz and are intensely seasoned with a coat of garlic and herbs along the skin.
Jerusalem, like Malecon, is an unfussy local joint and also open late, and while it may seem like just another falafel counter, pay special attention to the griddle, where the staffers sizzle sliced bits of shawarma with chopped onions for extra flavor and a resounding crispness. This additional step makes for superlative shawarma; the falafel will lift your spirits as well.
See the restaurants on our Google Map.
Where to drink
Caledonia is a whisky bar for people who roll their eyes at whisky bars. Yes, there are dozens of Scottish, Irish, Japanese and American whiskies to sip and a moody aura, thanks to candles and dark exposed brick along the back bar, but the pub's first "House Rule" is clear: "There is no such thing as a best whisky. The best whisky is the one you love the most." And even if your best whisky is a cocktail or beer or wine, Caledonia has you covered.
Broadway Dive is not a dive. The beer and spirits list is too good, and the décor slightly too posh, with twisting twig chandeliers that twinkle above your head. Its neighborly crowd offers a fitting backdrop to swap show notes, though. Order a gin-and-tonic made with Gin Mare, a Spanish number they stock that's distilled with thyme, basil and Arbequina olives, and prepare for your new song of the summer.
See the bars on our Google Map.
What to check out nearby
Zabar's is a necessary stop any time you're on the Upper West Side, and especially when you're in search of theater snacks. On the ground floor, which is stuffed to the gills with edible delights, you can grab some bread and cheese, bagels and lox, or grape leaves to go. If you're just in a browsing mood, head upstairs to poke around a virtual amusement park of housewares. Hmm, maybe you really do need an insulated wine glass.
Westsider Books is a great spot to pick up a book to read while you stake out your spot before the show. Their collection fills every last nook of the compact, lofted space, giving you a great excuse to climb the rolling library ladder to investigate.
Riverside Park is home to a crew of goats this summer, so take a stroll before or after the show to greet them. From approximately 119th to 125th Streets, you'll find the goats hard at work weeding the park. Give them your warmest welcome; they'll be here only through August.
See these nearby spots on our Google Map.

3 Quick Things
Something free or cheap
Catch a free outdoor film at Nowadays in Ridgewood. Tonight's feature is "Babylon," a 1980 portrait of a reggae artist in South London and his daily experiences of marginalization. Future flicks include "Labyrinth," "The Wall," "Babe" and "Best in Show." The venue has a small food menu and a nice selection of drinks, both alcoholic and non. In brief, it's a one-stop shop for all your Wednesday needs. See more free outdoor movie listings in New York City.
Something for the weeknight
Visit the Brooklyn Botanic Garden after hours. Every week through September, the garden stays open late for Twilight Tuesdays. You can take a guided tour, or check out Adrienne Adar's living sound installation, "Sonic Succulents." And if you go this Tuesday, June 18 (and buy tickets for a time slot), you can hear the entirety of "Plantasia," Mort Garson's electronic album composed for plants, while surrounded by vegetation in the conservatory.
Something from a listener
Dine outdoors(ish). Adam, a WNYC listener who called in during a recent Summer in the City segment on "All of It With Alison Stewart," shared the simple summer joy that is restaurants opening "garage doors or any door they can," so that you get "a little bit of the outdoor experience, but a little bit of the air-conditioning too." One restaurant, he noted, that does this well: Las Ramblas on West 4th Street. It's "a tiny little spot, with not many tables, delicious tapas, and really good European beers," Adam said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON D.C. - In case you missed it, PoliticoPro reported that a Congressional Research Services (CRS) report found that the GOP Tax Bill signed into law last year has had little economic impact during its first year of implementation. And according to the CRS report, ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates.
Just last month, the New York Times reported that an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy report found that Brown's Working Families Tax Relief Act would cost significantly less than the Republican Tax Bill that was signed into law last year. Brown's bill would cut taxes for workers and families by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC), benefitting 4 million Ohioans, including 1.7 million children in the state.
The PoliticoPro article can be read below.
PoliticoPro:TCJA had little effect on growth, government agency says.
A new government report is throwing cold Water on Republicans' claims that their 2017 tax cuts are responsible for the strong economy.
The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says the law, H.R. 1 (115), had little impact during its first year on either growth, wages or business investment.
"On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy," the nonpartisan agency says, noting the gross domestic product grew last year by 2.9 percent, which was about what budget forecasters had anticipated before the cuts.
"Ordinary workers had very little growth in wage rates," said the report, entitled "The Economic Effects of the 2017 Tax Revision: Preliminary Observations."
Business investment went up, though it wasn't out of line with previous fluctuations, the report said.
Some of the most dramatic effects came with so-called repatriation, with multinationals bringing home $664 billion in 2018, four times as much as was typically seen in previous years. Still, that did not lead to a "surge" in investment, CRS said, with companies using much of the money to buy back their stock.
The agency said estimates of the law's first-year budgetary cost were close, with the price tag coming in at $9 billion more than anticipated. The cuts had been projected to run $163 billion in 2018. Corporate receipts were lower than forecast, while individual income taxes exceeded projections.

The politics of dystopia

Texto completo: Here is a media story from the week that was. In the Netherlands, a depressed teenager died after seeking euthanasia, and a number of outlets reported that she had been euthanized by a clinic that accedes to suicide requests from people suffering from mental illness.
This was false; in fact, the teenager committed suicide at home, starving herself while parents and doctors offered palliative care. And so the media narrative shifted, becoming about the problem of sensationalism and ideologically motivated fake news.
The initial narrative was indeed bad reporting. However, contrary to the tone of some of the correctives, the underlying facts remain shocking even after the correction. It remains shocking that a young woman's parents and doctors would give up on treating her at 17 and let her kill herself. And it remains shocking that Western nations are normalizing euthanasia for mental illness among otherwise healthy adults.
But are you shocked, reader, or merely troubled? Since the Benelux countries began their experiments with euthanasia, there has been a lot of mainstream-media coverage that's skeptical of the new system, critical, concerned. But concern is not the same as outrage, of the kind that reliably greets policies pursued by governments seen as populist. If Viktor Orban pushes a university out of Hungary, it's the Crisis of the Liberal Order. If depressed people are euthanized in Belgium, it's just ... troubling, and the only overt outrage is on the religious right.
But suppose you believe a legal and medical system that colludes in the suicides of the depressed is as grave an evil as any populist policy to date. When such a system emerges as a seemingly organic feature of the liberal order, what then should be your attitude toward liberalism itself? This problem, the possibility that liberalism could through the working of its own principles lead to something truly evil, connects to a somewhat-baffling argument among pundits this past week about whether American conservatism is becoming "post-liberal," whether the post-Trump right might leave liberal democracy itself behind.
A lot of this talk is overstated. Just as the argument about "socialism" among Democrats is more about whether to back "Medicare for All" than about whether to go #fullMarxist, many conservatives supposedly debating "post-liberalism" are really just debating the balance between libertarianism and economic populism, not preparing to give up on the Constitution. And both debates are taking place in a context defined more by stalemate and stagnation than by a 1930s-style crisis.
On the right, that imagining extrapolates from examples like the Low Countries' euthanizers toward a future society that remains formally liberal but resembles Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" - dominated by virtual reality and eugenics and mood-stabilizing drugs, post-familial and post-religious and functionally post-human. Would such a society deserve the political loyalty of (let us say) a traditional Christian or Muslim, just because it still affords them some First Amendment protections? It is reasonable to say that it might not.
On the left that imagining takes the form of a dire ecological extrapolation - a fear that climate catastrophe isn't inevitable despite liberalism but because of it, that the combination of governments with limited powers, publics with limited knowledge and corporations with capitalist incentives might be responsible for civilizational disaster. Does this scenario (or other equivalents involving AI) call liberal proceduralism into question? For some Carl Schmitts (or Ted Kaczynskis) of the left, it might. Versions of these imaginings are familiar from past critiques of liberalism. But without being necessarily persuasive, they are more plausible now than 20 years ago, and they explain as much of the flirtation with post-liberalism as xenophobia or millennial ingratitude.
Which means that the liberal order's defenders need to take them seriously. Liberalism has never done as well as it thinks at resolving its own crises. America's gravest moral evil, chattel slavery, was defeated by an authoritarian president in a religious civil war, not by proceduralism or constitutional debate. The crisis of the 1930s ended happily for liberalism because a reactionary imperialist withstood Adolf Hitler and a revolutionary Bolshevik crushed him. The liberal peace that followed may depend on fear of the atomic bomb.
All of which hints that a genuinely post-liberal politics might, indeed, someday be required - to save liberal civilization from dystopia or disaster. The post-liberalisms presently on offer are not as serious as either their advocates hope or their critics fear. But if you cannot imagine - ever - being a post-liberal, left or right, you are not being serious either.

Texto completo: "The Queen" by Josh Levin Little, Brown, 432 pages, $29, out now: While on the presidential campaign trail in 1976, Ronald Reagan sought to illustrate welfare fraud by referencing a Chicago woman who "held the record" in collecting ill-gotten government checks. The actual woman behind the stereotype, Linda Taylor, was first called "welfare queen" by the Chicago Tribune, but her story is far more complex, ignored by the press and politicians who borrowed aspects of her image to vilify poor people of color. In re-examining the myth, Slate's Josh Levin explores racism in America and oversimplified narratives that still dominate political discourse.
"On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" by Ocean Vuong Penguin, 256 pages, $26, out now: It's a big summer for debut novels, and this one by poet Ocean Vuong may be the most widely hyped of them all. "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous" is a letter from a man in his late 20s addressed to a mother who can't read it. Examining race, class, loss, masculinity and the power of story, Vuong's work is already being hailed as "brilliant," "shattering" and "an epistolary masterpiece."
"In West Mills" by De'Shawn Charles Winslow Bloomsbury, 272 pages, $26, out now: Set in a rural black neighborhood in North Carolina, De'Shawn Charles Winslow's first novel follows a headstrong woman, Azalea "Knot" Centre, determined to live life on her own terms. Over nearly five decades, she and other residents of her tightly knit community grapple with interpersonal drama and long-buried secrets. Early reviews applaud the book's "warmth," and Rebecca Makkai, author of "The Great Believers," calls Winslow's voice "arresting and important and new."
"Recursion" by Blake Crouch Crown, 336 pages, $27, out now: Last fall, Netflix scooped up the rights to Blake Crouch's "Recursion," which will be developed into a feature film and TV series - and the book isn't out until mid-June. The latest novel from the author of the Wayward Pines trilogy is part sci-fi thriller and part police procedural, with a little romance thrown in for good measure. Starring New York City cop Barry Sutton and brilliant neuroscientist Helena Smith, it explores the lengths people will go to preserve their most precious memories - or, given the chance, reinvent them entirely.
"Fleishman Is in Trouble" by Taffy Brodesser-Akner Random House, 384 pages, $27, June 18: Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, tackles marriage, divorce, ambition and identity in her debut novel. When Toby Fleishman and his wife of more than 14 years, Rachel, decide to separate, the Manhattan hepatologist assumes he knows what he's in for: co-parenting their preteen kids, a chance to put himself out there on dating apps, etc. His assumptions are upended when Rachel drops off their children at his place and ghosts.
"The Vagabonds" by Jeff Guinn Simon & Schuster, 320 pages, $28, July 9: Summer road trips weren't always the popular American pastime they are today. Back when cars were unreliable and roads barely passable, they were downright impractical. So it was a big deal when Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and tire-maker Harvey Firestone decided to spend a series of summers from 1915 to 1925 road tripping around the country. Though the self-described "Vagabonds" traveled with chefs, butlers and other personnel (not exactly roughing it), their ultimate mission was to assess American roadways and drive the automobile straight into ubiquity.
"The Need" by Helen Phillips Simon & Schuster, 272 pages, $26, July 9: The author of "The Beautiful Bureaucrat" returns with an existential thriller that unearths truths about modern motherhood. Molly is a paleobotanist at a fossil quarry and mom to two young children whose life turns upside down when an intruder wearing a deer mask confronts her in her home.
"On the Clock" by Emily Guendelsberger Little, Brown, 352 pages, $28, July 16: In a timely and important look at the harsh realities of the modern American workplace, journalist Emily Guendelsberger recounts her experiences doing hourly labor all over the country. Threatened by automation, low-wage jobs have become all about efficiency but at the cost of humanity. Her question: How can we make such work more humane?
"The Nickel Boys" by Colson Whitehead Doubleday, 224 pages, $24.95, July 16: A great deal of buzz surrounds Colson Whitehead's follow-up to "The Underground Railroad," his searing 2016 novel that won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, the National Book Award and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Literary Prize. Set in Jim Crow-era Florida, his new book centers on two boys sentenced to a juvenile reformatory where abuse, assault and corruption run rampant. Whitehead based the nightmarish Nickel Academy on a real reform school that used to operate in Florida.
"Three Women" by Lisa Taddeo Avid Reader, 320 pages, $27, July 27: For this impressive feat of narrative nonfiction, Lisa Taddeo spent nearly a decade with a high school student in North Dakota, an entrepreneur in Seattle and a homemaker in suburban Indiana to write an immersive account of the sex lives of ordinary American women. Critics are already raving about this carefully crafted portrait of female desire.
"Trick Mirror" by Jia Tolentino Random House, 304 pages, $27, Aug. 6: Jia Tolentino's incisive cultural commentary has graced the pages of The New Yorker, the NPR airwaves and even the recent "Fyre Fraud" documentary. Soon, her deft insights arrive in book form with "Trick Mirror," an essay collection that probes these precarious times - scams, the devolution of the internet, our optimization fixation - to consider how a near-constant focus on self warps our vision.
"Coventry" by Rachel Cusk FSG, 256 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Rachel Cusk is admired for her heady autofiction, particularly the much-talked-about Outline trilogy. Now a new collection of nonfiction - covering everything from art and family life to feminism and politics - allows Cusk fans a chance to jump back inside her brilliant brain.
"How to Be an Antiracist" by Ibram X. Kendi One World, 320 pages, $27, Aug. 20: Ibram X. Kendi - author of "Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America," which won a 2016 National Book Award for Nonfiction - turns his attention toward achieving a more just and equitable future. Blending memoir, social commentary, history and science, "How to Be an Antiracist" seeks to reshape the conversation about racial justice in America: from how not to be racist, to how to be an antiracist.
"Everything Inside" by Edwidge Danticat Knopf, 240 pages, $25.95, Aug. 27: Edwidge Danticat, the acclaimed author of such works as "Brother, I'm Dying" and "Claire of the Sea Light," situates her new story collection in Miami, Port-au-Prince and an unnamed Caribbean country. These eight intimate stories confront everything from birth to death, fractured relationships to unlikely reunions.
"Five Days Gone" by Laura Cumming Scribner, 320 pages, $26, Aug. 27: Every family has its secrets but, as Laura Cumming discovered, some are more unsettling than others. The art critic for The Observer learned, half a century after the fact, that when her mother was 3 years old, she was kidnapped from a beach in England and not found for several days. No one was accused of a crime. Cumming revisits the mystery of her late mother's life.

It is time to protect California’s energy diversity

Texto completo: The benefits of diversity are seemingly everywhere in California. We celebrate different lifestyles, religions, cultures, music, languages, cuisine and geography. The value of diversity can be seen in other ways, too, practical ones such as the popularity of mutual fund investments, eating a balanced diet or making sure an NFL team has a playbook with multiple options.
Everywhere one looks, we see the value of diversifying. If all your eggs are in one basket, you are more vulnerable should something happen to your basket. Diversifying makes obvious sense.
While California needs to harness its sun, wind and water to make us more energy independent, some people are blindly trying to make California 100 percent electric.
Certainly, most people want to continue expanding energy sources that are earth-friendly. But wearing electricity-only blinders is misguided on numerous levels.
Whether transitioning to electric vehicles or “de-carbonizing” buildings, the importance of a multipronged approach to renewable energy has gotten lost or ignored – even energy sources that are renewable, sustainable, and help the environment.
First, relying on a single source of energy is a dangerous proposition. The last time California regulators tried to micromanage the energy market was two decades ago when the state was gripped by a massive energy crisis that brought electrical shortages and skyrocketing consumers prices. Rolling blackouts threw hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses into darkness and zero power.
Second, consider that our electrical grid is computer based. Hackers – inside the U.S. or around the world – pose a serious threat.
Last summer, the New York Times reported that “State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.”
Third, a shift toward a 100-percent electrical society reneges on the promise of building a vibrant and innovative California. There have been incredible innovations involving many different types of energy sources that are already helping California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
Major developments are taking place in the natural gas and propane industries, which has the flexibility to meet the needs of rural Californians. A growing number of California dairy farmers are converting methane into renewable natural gas, which would help California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
An electricity mandate would kill all of these advances.
Fourth, even if demand for electricity explodes, can California realistically provide enough renewable electricity? For the foreseeable future, the answer is no. And according to the Los Angeles Times, new demand will “tax a system already fragile, unstable and increasingly vulnerable to outside forces.”
Fifth, other sources of energy are simply better for the environment and our California lifestyle. Home and professional chefs prefer cooking with gas – as do consumers who grill with propane. Electricity is not exactly portable. How will restaurants and homeowners conveniently provide outdoor heating without tripping over dozens of extension cords?
Consumers also are vehemently opposed to being stripped of energy choice. By a margin of 5 to 1, Californians prefer natural gas for home heating and cooking. And 80 percent of voters oppose laws that would take away their natural gas appliances.
While most people like and appreciate electricity, they cannot and should not have to imagine a world with only one source of energy. Like everything else, energy diversity needs to be celebrated and promoted as a key to a clean and green future.

Texto completo: National security adviser John Bolton named five countries he believes are spreading lies about dysfunction in the Trump administration.
“We have substantial reason to believe that North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China have made a decision to — and you can see it publicly — to try to sow disinformation about the administration, and to say that the president and his advisers are divided, and things like that,” Bolton said Tuesday during a Wall Street Journal event in Washington, D.C.
Asked about reports about President Trump appearing to break with him on North Korea and Iran, Bolton blamed the media in the U.S. for spreading the misinformation. “The stenographers of these regimes in the American press immediately pick it up,” he said.
He also railed against a New York Times report that said Bolton was "noticeably absent" from a banquet in Japan that was attended by Trump, the Japanese emperor, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Bolton said he was sick and that the Times and CNN, which reported his absence, never reached out to ask why he was not in attendance.TweetBolton joined the Trump administration in April 2018, replacing retired Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, whose tenure as national security adviser was marred by constant leaks among his staff.

Resumen: A $19.1 billion disaster aid package won't include much help for Midwestern farmers who can’t plant. Meanwhile a trade war puts farm exports at risk.

Texto completo: Standing a few feet from a pool of water in his field, on a strip of now-crusted mud where no corn plants are shooting up, Scott VanderWal contemplates a question: Which makes farming more uncertain these days: the weather or White House policy?
“That’s a hard question,” says Mr. VanderWal, a farmer and president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, an advocacy group. “I would say they are both about the same.”
Hit with wet weather that has delayed spring planting on a scale not seen in decades, many farmers from here in Volga, South Dakota, to Ohio are making the difficult decision not to plant certain fields this year – to settle for insurance payments worth about half what they would normally receive per acre, rather than plant and risk an early frost.
At the same time, federal policy added a new layer of uncertainty and even alarm among agricultural producers. Slowly, these issues are being resolved – from disaster aid to trade talks – but not before exposing waning patience among many in farm country with the administration’s unpredictability.
“Farmers are grumpy,” says Norman Brugger, a rancher and seed salesman in Albion, Nebraska. “I have listened to people talk, coffee-shop talk ... and I have heard some guys who are changing their minds” about President Donald Trump.
Part of rural dissatisfaction stems from the difficult spring. Normally, this time of year, Corn Belt states like Indiana and Ohio would have all but finished corn planting. Instead, they’ve got two-thirds or less planted, according to the crop progress report the U.S. Department of Agriculture released Monday. South Dakota is in the same boat – 64% planted – but because the risk of frost comes a little earlier here, the window is closing fast.
The silver lining is that, in the quirky economics of agriculture, a poor corn crop could be good for farmers. Already, corn prices have surged to three-year highs. Farm income is likely to rise this year, after several years of decline, says Scott Gerlt, an agricultural economist with the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri. Even farmers with poor yields may do better, because crop insurance provides payments for those who don’t plant at all as well as those who have a reduced yield.
How well they fare will depend in part on a long-delayed $19.1 billion disaster aid package that the president signed Thursday, after trying for months to limit how much would flow to Puerto Rico for recovery from Hurricane Maria. The measure, which includes $3 billion in aid for agriculture, should be of special help to Georgia and Florida farmers who have waited since last October to find out if federal aid would help ease their severe losses from Hurricane Michael. But economists say the money is too little to provide much help for Midwestern farmers who can’t plant. The regulations for distributing the money still haven’t been written.
Farmers breathed another sigh of relief Friday after Mr. Trump announced an immigration deal with Mexico, forestalling his threat of imposing 5% tariffs on imports from America’s largest trading partner. The tariffs would have hit the auto industry hardest, but also would have raised consumer prices on a range of goods from Mexico, including fruits and vegetables.
Farmers also feared U.S. tariffs would trigger Mexican retaliation on imports from the United States. Mexico is the second-biggest export market for U.S. agricultural goods after Canada. But other trade actions are still raising concerns in farm country.
For example, Mr. Trump’s aggressive negotiations with China, which include tariffs on Chinese goods and countertariffs from China, have hurt soybean exports and swelled U.S. stockpiles, which have caused prices to fall. In the short term, most of those soybeans will get sold to other nations if the Chinese market disappears. But the longer the U.S.-China standoff continues, the more other nations will expand production and displace U.S. sales around the world. 
By standing firm against unfair Chinese trade practices, Mr. Trump has gotten a pass from many farmers, says Mr. VanderWal, who is also vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, a conservative farm advocacy group in Washington with strong lines of communication with the administration. “They understand what he’s trying to do. ... Farmers are the best patriots in the country. But there comes a time when we all have to keep our businesses and farm operations together. ... Farmers are getting impatient.”
If the China trade impasse gets grudging acceptance, the president’s sudden shifts on Mexico have not. The U.S. and Mexico had been moving toward ratifying a new North American trade pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), when Mr. Trump suddenly tweeted late last month that he would impose 5% tariffs on Mexican imports – which would eventually rise to 25% – if its government didn’t strengthen border security against migrants making their way to the U.S. Then on Friday Mr. Trump tweeted that the two nations had signed a last-minute deal to avert the tariffs, which he had threatened to impose on Monday.
Subsequent reporting from The New York Times suggests that much of the deal had already been reached in secret negotiations earlier this year, while the administration contends that stronger provisions and an important and unnamed new provision were not reached until the threat of levies had been imposed. He also tweeted Sunday that if there is not cooperation on the border from Mexico “we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs.”
It is this uncertainty – which the president appears to thrive on – that exposes growing concern over some of the president’s tactics. This does not signal a political break with Mr. Trump. Many rural Republicans applaud his whatever-it-takes approach to handling problems, including immigration.
When a country like Mexico isn’t budging on an issue, “we need to get their attention,” says Verlin Janssen, a city councilman for Gothenburg, Nebraska, and a retired businessman.
Others quietly chafe at the uncertainty created by Mr. Trump’s negotiating style. Threatening Mexico with tariffs was “not helpful,” says Mr. VanderWal. “Get USMCA passed. It would give the Trump administration more credibility when negotiating with other countries.”

Mexican official says there's no secret US immigration deal

Texto completo: The Mexican foreign minister said Monday that no secret immigration deal existed between his country and the United States, directly contradicting President Trump's claim on Twitter that a “fully signed and documented" agreement would be revealed soon.
Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's top diplomat, said at a news conference in Mexico City that there was an understanding that both sides would evaluate the flow of migrants in the coming months. And if the number of migrants crossing the US border was not significantly reduced, he said, both sides had agreed to renew discussions about more aggressive changes to regional asylum rules that could make a bigger impact.
Trump has insisted for several days that the agreement reached with Mexico on Friday evening is a strong one, rejecting criticism that it largely called upon the Mexicans to take actions to reduce the flow of immigration that they had already agreed to months earlier.
In a Twitter post Monday morning, he said, “We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico's Legislative body!"
New York Times
Homeland Security watchdog retires early
John Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency's performance after federal disasters.
Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief e-mail Monday morning to hundreds of Homeland Security employees and contractors.
Kelly, who had planned to retire in May, wrote in an e-mail to The Washington Post that he "accelerated my retirement because I feel it's in the best interest of the organization and its employees."
Kelly's announcement follows the Post's report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the response of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to various disasters.
When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed "feel good reports."
The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.
Washington Post
Hard-liner is named to federal immigration post
An outspoken supporter of President Trump's hard-line immigration policies has been named acting director of the agency that manages legal immigration, despite deep opposition from key Senate Republicans.
Ken Cuccinelli will oversee Citizenship and Immigration Services starting Monday, Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin Mc­Aleenan said.
But it's unclear if Trump will nominate Cuccinelli for the permanent position. That would require Senate confirmation, which could be difficult.
Cuccinelli is a former Virginia attorney general who ran for governor of Virginia, but lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe in 2013. It's not just Cuccinelli's views on immigration that would generate unease among senators. As the former head of the Senate Conservatives Fund, Cuccinelli has been highly critical of Senate GOP leadership, including once advocating for the removal of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and his entire leadership team. The group backed conservative candidates for Senate and primary challengers for incumbent Republicans, putting it at odds with the party's chosen candidates.

A sapling from the French president to Trump has died
The Saga of the Tree has a sad ending, it turns out: A sapling given to President Trump by French President Emmanuel Macron to great fanfare has died, according to French news reports — and the symbolism wasn't lost on people who noted the strained relationship between the world leaders.
The roots of the story go back to April 2018, when the Macron-Trump friendship was being described as a "bromance," and the French president and his wife, Brigitte, were feted at the only state dinner the Trumps have hosted. The Macrons presented the Trumps with a tree meant to embody the close ties between their respective countries, and the foursome planted it on the White House lawn with gold-toned shovels in a photo op designed to highlight Franco-American unity.
Things seemed amiss shortly afterward when reporters noticed that it had been removed from its spot. But then-French Ambassador Gerard Araud assured people there was no message behind the uprooting. He tweeted that the young oak had simply been put in a standard-issue quarantine.
It seems that the sapling didn't survive its exile. Le Monde reported the demise, confirmed to the Agence France-Presse by a "diplomatic source." (The French embassy didn't immediately respond to our query.)
The White House did not immediately return a request for comment.
The tree came from Belleau Woods, the site where nearly 2,000 Marines died in World War I. Its passing comes as ties between Trump and Macron appear to be fraying over differences over Iran, trade, and the role of the European Union.

Daughter of 'tiger mom' hired as Kavanaugh clerk
Justice Brett Kavanaugh has hired the daughter of Yale Law School professor and "tiger mom" Amy Chua, who praised Kavanaugh as a mentor to women after his Supreme Court nomination.
The court is confirming that Yale Law graduate Sophia ­Chua-Rubenfeld will work as a clerk for Kavanaugh for a year, beginning this summer.
Shortly after Kavanaugh's nomination, Chua penned a Wall Street Journal essay extolling Kavanaugh "as a mentor for young lawyers, particularly women." Chua is known for her memoir "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother," which describes her tough Chinese-style parenting.
Chua's essay was published before Kavanaugh was publicly accused of sexual assault, which he denied. Critics accused Chua of pandering for a clerkship for her daughter. ­Chua-Rubenfeld responded last year by saying she wouldn't be applying "anytime soon."

Texto completo: With summer on the horizon (and Instagram stories calling), I begrudgingly pulled myself out of bed early one morning in May to get some exercise before work.
I stood before a stark white, freestanding boxing bag weighed down by hundreds of pounds of sand as Andre Huseman, a high-spirited personal trainer, greeted me. “Welcome back to FightCamp,” the jacked fitness professional said, and within seconds he was counting down, “3…2…1. ”
Perplexed as I navigated the workout for my first time, I (along with a room full of boxing enthusiasts) followed Huseman’s two-minute warm-up involving jump ropes and torso twists to an uptempo soundtrack by the rapper Rich Homie Quan.
Only I wasn’t at a kickboxing facility. I was trying out FightCamp’s interactive home workout system, and the trainer and other boxers were built into the app.
Exhausted after using real-time punching metrics to reach ambitious intermediate-level goals, my first thought was, “Gee, how convenient. ”
'Apple Watch or it doesn't count': How tech addiction might be ruining your workout
Feeling mentally exhausted? Burnout is officially a medical condition
In a world where $36 spinning classes have become commonplace and boutique fitness gyms curate specialized experiences for millennials, a new wave of technology is penetrating the deluxe workout market so you don't even have to leave your bedroom, let alone your home.
Connected fitness, which began with apps and leveled-up with wearables, is pedaling toward a new phase with smart home-workout equipment and membership packages that bridge the gap between attending instructor-led classes and flying completely solo.
Imagine being in bed one moment, and the next you’re going for the burn up a hill trail in the stunningly picturesque Hidden Valley Trail in Utah as artificial intelligence pushes you to your limits. Picture yourself standing before a 40-inch mirror one second, and then you’re launched into a live fitness class the next.
Welcome to the future of at-home workouts, where virtual trainers, AI and apps take you further than the recreational gym in your neighborhood, for a premium cost.
“There's this massive innovation happening. You're no longer just watching a Jane Fonda workout through a TV, or a trainer on an app. You’re interacting and engaging with devices,” said tech entrepreneur Ian McCaig, who is a co-founder of Fiit, a mobile app that connects to your TV.
“Whether you’re seeing your metrics or interacting with the instructors, you’re gamifying the experience. You’re getting the real-time feedback and having social experiences, working out with your friends even if you’re not in the same room with each other. ”
FightCamp
After raising about $3. 7 million in seed funding, FightCamp began taking orders for its interactive boxing system in 2018.
The $1,095 home gym comes with a freestanding bag, gloves, quick wraps, a workout mat and access to on-demand instructional classes. The system is elevated by punch-tracking technology housed in the wraps. The tech provides on-demand strike data and real-time performance stats.
The two motion trackers sync with your smartphone through the FightCamp app to capture how many punches are thrown, and you can watch counters go up on your phone or television as you throw punch combinations.
The company says it recently developed motion recognition algorithms that track other training motions, including kicks, pushups, jump rope.
FightCamp offers a library of boxing workouts via subscriptions for $39 a month, and since launching, several thousand users have signed up across the U. S. , the company says.
The connected boxing system is designed for people who want boxing-oriented videos at a more affordable rate than most in-person kickboxing classes over time. The workout is also cheaper than those offered by Peloton, an industry leader in the home fitness technology.
Peloton
Peloton, which is perhaps best known for combining its premium stationary bikes and treadmills with a screen that shows fitness courses, has a million users and has sold over 400,000 bikes, according to CNBC.
The company confirmed with USA TODAY that it submitted papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June with plans to go public.
Some of the company's internet-connected exercise devices sell around $2,500.
A recent study by Second Measure found that the $4 billion fitness brand's ridership eclipsed SoulCycle's over the holiday season, and its membership retention rates are higher than the American luxury fitness company Equinox.
SoulCycle backpedaled away from plans to go public in May citing "market conditions. "
Mirror
Last year, Mirror, an interactive monitor that is disguised as a typical mirror when not in use, completely disrupted the home fitness space. Similar to Peloton, Mirror's subscription service and on-demand content come at an additional cost to members.
Mirror declined to tell USA TODAY how many consumers have purchased the product since its launch. However, The New York Times reported in February that Mirror was selling $1 million worth of the digital screens per month, which equates to about 650 units.
"We're vying to be the next screen in your life, not the next treadmill in your home," Mirror founder and CEO Brynn Putnam said in a statement. " You have your phone for communication, your computer for information, your TV for entertainment and now the Mirror for experiences. "
In-home delivery of the system, which includes resistance bands, and a heart rate monitor costs $250. You’ll have to pay $39 a month to access live and prerecorded workouts like resistance training, yoga, cardio and Pilates. The mirror itself is around $1,500.
Tonal also offers a wall mounted fitness system with on-demand coaching and adaptive resistance training baked in. However, it's even more expensive at $2,995 plus $49 a month for the subscription.
While they work on iOS, neither FightCamp nor Mirror work with Android. Peloton Digital became available for Android in December.
Bowflex
Also taking advantage of the connected home-fitness boom, Bowflex launched an AI platform in 2018 to train customers using artificial intelligence.
Called Max Intelligence, the platform generates custom programs based on how the user is feeling, how much time they have and their fitness capabilities based on a 14-minute performance test.
The platform also offers a library of trainer-led videos and educational content based on the user’s workout history and preferences.
Embedded in the app is access to RunSocial, a range of HD video running routes from around the world. As you use a Bowflex machine, you'll travel through video routes on the screen. Your motion rate controls the video speed.
Available routes include a run through Death Valley National Park in California, a 10K race around the Swiss Alps and a 5K trek through rice fields and villages in the countryside of Japan.
Prices for the Bowflex exerciser start at $2,299.
'It saved my life': Apple Watch, Fitbit are notifying users of medical emergencies
With ubiquitous 4G connectivity and the mass adoption of 5G on the horizon, experts say manufacturers of smart gym equipment will soon have the bandwidth to take immersive workouts to the next level.
“We’re seeing how wearable technology can disrupt the home fitness experience, and there’s no reason why VR and AR won’t take things even further,” McCaig said. “You’ll have the processing power to be able to create super-immersive experiences in the home. ”
As time progresses, smart gyms could become an extension of smart homes and apps might one day be able to make workout suggestions based on how tired your body feels, thanks to data gathered from wearables, McCaig said.
In a blog post on LinkedIn, the investor and former personal trainer said that connected home fitness is poised to overtake the recreational gym market within the next 10 years.
To workout at a neighborhood gym, "you have to pack your bag, get in your car or take the train, change clothes, feel like you have to work out for an hour then travel back," McCaig said.
"The reality is, the one thing we're all running out of is time. That's what makes being able to log on to a hyper-interactive class with other people from home appealing. "

Texto completo: Asked about his memories of playing Pittsburgh in a 2014 interview, the one that came to mind for Dr. John was a night that didn't go so well.
"I remember a guitar player quit the band in Pittsburgh," he said.
It had nothing to do with the pay or with creative differences, unless you consider traveling with an organ a creative difference.
"We were lugging Lonnie Liston Smith's organ up two flights of stairs," he recalled, although he didn't remember the venue. "After he lugged that organ up two flights of stairs, he said, 'I quit. That's enough for me.'"
We can assume that Dr. John, who died Thursday at 77 of a heart attack, lugged many an organ in his day.
John, who was born Mac Rebennack, was a flamboyant disciple of such greats as Professor Longhair and Huey (Piano) Smith, a growling New Orleans legend aptly nicknamed the Night Tripper.
In that 2014 interview, Rebennack talked about being from the same New Orleans neighborhood as Louis Armstrong.
"Every time my pa would pass his pad, he would say, 'That's where Louis Armstrong was born.' He wouldn't say 'Satch' or anything. He would say 'Louis Armstrong,' and that meant a lot to me as a kid."
His greatest exposure to that music was the records that his dad sold in his general store.
"I remember when my pa was selling records - traditional jazz, bebop and Afro-Cuban music - and that was the three forms of jazz at the time. I can remember lots of Louis Armstrong."
In his early years, Rebennack gravitated to guitar, tutored by Walter (Papoose) Nelson, who played with Fats Domino, and by the time he was a teenager, he was doing clubs and studio work.
In 1961, while intervening in a fight, he was shot in the finger, forcing a switch to piano and organ. A few years later, in 1965, he headed to prison for heroin possession, after which he settled in L.A.
Absorbing some of that West Coast sound, his first solo venture was 1968's "Gris-Gris," a trippy album that put a Voodoo tinge on psychedelic rock. It ranked at No. 143 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
Five albums later, in 1973, he had his commercial breakthrough with "In the Right Place," which featured two of his signature songs, "Right Place Wrong Time" and "Such a Night," the latter of which he performed at The Band's landmark 1976 farewell "The Last Waltz."
Over the years, Pittsburghers got their share of Dr. John, at the Civic Arena in 1975, when he opened for Frank Zappa and the Mothers, and at such clubs as Graffiti and the Upstage, which certainly had some steps. Pittsburgh guitarist Duane Jones posted on Thursday that when Dr. John played Mancini's, he asked where he could find the best barbecue in Pittsburgh, so they rode the bus together from McKees Rocks to Homewood.
Along with making records at a rapid pace, he was a popular session musician for everyone from Sonny&Cher to Canned Heat, and he did jingles for Popeyes chicken, Scott tissue and Oreo cookies along with theme songs for the shows "Blossom" and "Curious George."
He would win six Grammys and earn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.
When asked in that 2014 interview about the enduring tradition of New Orleans music in the culture, he had a hard take on it.
"I just know that New Orleans is a place where a lot of people get ripped off," he growled. "When I talk to my partner Huey Smith, he's not getting his money, and he wrote a ton of hits: 'Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu,' 'Sea Cruise,' just tons of hits. If he ain't getting paid for that, you gotta think about it a minute because that's my old partner, and most of my partners have passed away, but he is still on the planet, and he's not doing that great. That makes me feel weird. When I call him and talk to him, it's like 'Wow.'"
When asked about young musicians there coming through the ranks, he said, "There's a lot of people that are doing a lot of stuff that's good. I ain't gonna mention nobody because you'll hear them when you hear them. You tell me what you think."
That show at Hartwood Acres in 2014, like many June nights, was a stormy one, marred by delays. But Dr. John didn't bail. He finished his set for the small crowd that stuck around. That was the last time we saw The Night Tripper in Pittsburgh.

Texto completo: The world is a polarized place these days.
But not at Gretna Music, which begins its 44th season on June 22.
"There seems to be so much discord in society. Everything is polarized in one extreme or the other," says Carl Kane, Gretna Music's artistic director. "We wanted to put a season out there that had something for everyone. We want the best and the most beautiful music because we are all in it together. It's our shared humanity. We can create beautiful things and share them."
Gretna Music's season runs through Sept. 7.
Here's the schedule, with some comments from Kane along the way. All events are held at the Mount Gretna Playhouse, unless otherwise noted. Prices vary according to age. Most range from $1 for children to $29 or $30 for adults.
Ahn Trio, June 22
The first concert of the series is also the first Gretna Music 4 Kids show.
The Ahn sisters teach the basic elements of music, including rhythm, melody, tempo and dynamics. They will encourage kids to create a drawing or a poem while they listen to the music.
"They are not traditional - their music is more eclectic," Kane says. "They try to be more inclusive, reaching out to a younger audience."
The concert begins at 11 a.m.
Ahn Trio with the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, June 23
The trio returns (Lucia on the piano, Angella on the violin, and Maria on the cello) in collaboration with Nai-Ni-Chen Dance Company for "A Quest for Freedom," which tells the story of Nai-Ni Chen's journey from Taiwan to New York.

"The first time rap will be on the Gretna stage," Kane says.
The concert begins at 11 a.m.
George Cables Trio, July 13
The trio includes Cables on piano, Victor Lewis on drums and Ed Howard on bass. Cables has performed with a number of jazz legends. Art Pepper called him "Mr. Beautiful" for the way he played.

The concert begins at 7:30 p.m.
Wister Quartet with Julian Bliss on clarinet and Bradley Moore on piano, July 14
"The Wister Quartet has been here every year for more than 20 years," Kane says. "Julian Bliss is the featured artist of the evening. He is perhaps the world's leading clarinet virtuoso."
The evening will include pieces by Brahms, Prokoviev and Mozart.
The concert begins at 7:30 p.m.

Amjad Ali Khan Ensemble, July 28
The dinner is in anticipation of this concert.

Kane describes a sarod as an Indian guitar, with the strings plucked.
The concert begins at 7:30 p.m.

The concert begins at 7:30 p.m.
Jeremy Denk, Sept. 1
"He's appeared here twice in the early 2000s, before he hit the big time," Kane says. "The stars have aligned and we are able to have him back for a solo recital."
The pianist won a MacArthur Genius Grant and the New York Times wrote, "Mr. Denk, clearly, is a pianist you want to hear no matter what he performs, in whatever combination - both for his penetrating intellectual engagement with the music and for the generosity of his playing."

Schumer: Trump’s Mexico deal 'warmed-up leftovers'

Texto completo: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday refused to credit President Trump for reaching a deal to get Mexico to stop illegal immigration.
Schumer called the accord “nothing more than warmed-up leftovers,” and said Trump had simply backed down on a threat to impose new tariffs on Mexican imports because that is how he normally operates.
“The president stakes out a maximalist position but never clearly defines his objectives,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.

“That way, after he backs himself into a corner, he can use a deal of any kind, even if it’s merely a fig leaf, to justify retreating from whatever misguided policy he’s threatened," Schumer continued. "Then he declares victory, having done little or nothing to solve the problem.”
Schumer cited news reports claiming Mexico denies having signed a deal with Trump to rein in illegal immigration through Mexico from Central America.
“It’s amazing how this president will just make stuff up,” Schumer said. “He just makes it up and then it’s refuted.”
Trump said the deal with Mexico “will be revealed in the not too distant future.”
Trump criticized a New York Times story reporting there is no signed deal to make any new changes to Mexico’s policy for dealing with the migrants, who are approaching the U.S. border at numbers topping 100,000 per month.
Mexico has agreed to do more to stop the flow of migrants by following a previously negotiated deal with the United States. But any change to asylum laws that the United States is seeking would have to be approved by the Mexican Senate, according to the Times story.
“The agreement that President Trump reached with Mexico contains policies negotiated months ago,” Schumer said. “Nothing more than warmed-up leftovers.”

Trump rips “sleazebag” Watergate figure John Dean as he prepares to testify to Congress

Texto completo: President Trump attacked Watergate figure John Dean on Twitter on Sunday evening, calling the former Nixon White House counsel a “sleazebag” as Dean prepares to testify in front of the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee on Monday.
Over the weekend, Dean, who was President Richard Nixon's White house counsel from July 1970 to April 1973 and was later jailed, had tweeted “would someone get Trump a dog” saying that Trump “needs a friend so he won’t endlessly vent on Twitter.”

Dean, 80, was embroiled d in the Watergate scandal during the early 1970’s but turned on his co-conspirators in exchange for a plea deal and a short prison stint.
Considered by some to be the “hero of Watergate" and by others to be a shameless opportunist, the man known by the FBI as “the master manipulator of the cover-up” has spent the subsequent decades calling scandals in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump worse than Watergate.

Democrats have scheduled a number of congressional hearings this week in an effort to highlight the findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which was released in April. Later this week, the House Intelligence Committee will be holding a hearing meant to highlight the counterintelligence findings in Volume One of Mueller’s report, but Monday’s hearing featuring Dean will focus on Volume Two — possible obstruction of justice.

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., defended his decision to bring in a convicted felon and disbarred lawyer by saying last week that Dean’s role in the Watergate scandal could help him shed light on the special counsel’s findings in the Trump-Russia probe.
“Remember, he was the one who broke the back of Nixon’s obstruction of justice, who testified truthfully,” Nadler said last week. “He knows how a White House does it, and he can testify with respect to some of the evidence in the Mueller report and how that relates to his experience with obstruction of justice.”

Mueller's report did not establish that anyone on the Trump campaign — or any Americans for that matter — criminally coordinated or conspired with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election. And Mueller did not reach a conclusion either way on whether or not Trump had carried out obstruction of justice, but Attorney General Barr and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein controversially determined that obstruction had not occurred.

Congressional Democrats hotly disagree with Barr, and this week’s hearings are widely considered part of an effort that could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump. Democrats previously brought Dean in to testify against now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination in September 2018.

Trump tweeted Sunday evening that Democrats were “devastated” by the results of the Mueller report, calling its findings a “disaster for them” and claiming that “they want a re-do or do-over.”

“They are even bringing in CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean,” Trump said. “Sorry, no do-overs — Go back to work!”

At the time of the Watergate scandal, the FBI was scathing in its assessment of Dean, describing him as a very shady figure. “The actions of John W. Dean at the White House… were purposefully designed to mislead and thwart the Bureau’s legitimate line of inquiry,” an FBI report from 1974 read. “At every stage of the investigation there were contrived covers placed in order to mislead the investigators.”

The FBI said that Dean “plan[ned] a course of action to thwart the FBI’s investigation and grand jury inquiry” and that his scheming resulted in a “subversion of our [the FBI’s] investigation.”

Dean has described other Republican presidents that Dean as worse than Nixon. In 1987 he said that Reagan’s Iran-Contra scandal was worse than Watergate, describing the two scandals as “major league matters vs. little league.
He wrote a 2004 book about George W. Bush titled “Worse Than Watergate.” And, since at least 2018, Dean has been calling Trump worse than Nixon too, saying that “Trump is Nixon on steroids and stilts” and claiming that Trump “has already exceeded everything that Nixon did.” He opposed the impeachment of Bill Clinton.

The current war of words between Trump and Dean is their latest dust-up. In August 2018, Trump had tweeted: “The failing New York Times wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel [sic], he must be a John Dean type ‘RAT.’ But I allowed him and all others to testify — I didn’t have to. I have nothing to hide.”

Dean responded by going on CNN, where he is a contributor, to defend his Watergate actions: “I didn't snitch. I advised them [the Nixon administration] what I was going to do. I did that and to encourage them to do likewise, we had to end this cover-up. That it was going to be a cancer on the presidency. I had told the President [Nixon] that.”

The original context of Dean’s “cancer” comment in 1973 shows that it was more complicated than he makes it seem in 2019. When top Nixon officials — including Dean — were on the verge of potentially being charged with obstruction of justice, he held a March 21, 1973 meeting with Nixon.

When Nixon asked Dean for his judgment on the Watergate scandal investigations, a recording shows that Dean said that “there's no doubt about the seriousness of the problem we've got." Dean continued: “We have a cancer within — close to the presidency, that's growing… It's growing daily. It's compounding. It grows geometrically now, because it compounds itself.” And Dean said that they were “being blackmailed” and that “people are going to start perjuring themselves very quickly” as the truth might come out.
Dean also described to Nixon the role that he had played in the Watergate scandal: “How did it all start? Where did it start? It started with an instruction to me from [H. R.] Bob Haldeman to see if we couldn't set up a perfectly legitimate campaign intelligence operation over at the Re-Election Committee [Committee to Re-Elect the President ].”
He claimed that the Watergate plan spiraled from there: “[Nixon operative G. Gordon] Liddy laid out a million-dollar plan that was the most incredible thing I have ever laid my eyes on: all in codes, and involved black-bag operations, kidnapping, providing prostitutes to weaken the opposition, bugging, mugging teams. It was just an incredible thing.”
Dean was fired by Nixon, pleaded guilty to one felony count of obstruction of justice, and became a star witness for Watergate prosecutors, where his bombshell Senate testimony proved key in bringing media and public attention to the scandal.
Now, more than four decades on, he will attempt to reprise that role.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and his acting Homeland Security secretary on Sunday defended their new agreement with the Mexican government to curb migration at the southern border, striking back at Democratic critics - including accusations that at least some parts of the deal predated Trump's recent tariff threats.
In a series of tweets, Trump said Mexico "was not being cooperative on the Border" before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, "I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done."
He also said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn't follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced - "one in particular," he said, "will be announced at the appropriate time."
Meanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan credited Trump's tariff threats - which would have placed a 5% levy on Mexican goods starting Monday, ratcheting up over several months to as much as 25% - with producing a breakthrough.
"The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table," McAleenan said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, noting that Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard "arrived within hours" to begin talks.
Mexico announced it would implement "strong measures" to slow the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to wait in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
On Sunday, two Democratic presidential candidates said Trump had exaggerated what his tariff threats against Mexico had accomplished. They echoed a New York Times report alleging that the Mexican government had already agreed to several terms of the deal before Trump publicly floated the prospect of tariffs.
"These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago," former congressman Beto O'Rourke said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."
During an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also said Trump had repackaged earlier agreements with Mexico to declare success in the trade standoff.
"I think what the world is tired of, and what I am tired of, is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies," Sanders said, adding that Trump should focus on achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump, in his tweets, lashed out at The New York Times for suggesting the deal was not entirely new and also pointed out that tariffs could be back on the table if the Mexican government does not honor its end of the deal.
"There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades," he said. "However, if for some unknown reason ... there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."
McAleenan echoed that sentiment, saying the dangling threat of tariffs amounted to "a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there's an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those (migrant) numbers."
Republican lawmakers appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, had voiced anxiety about the tariffs before the deal was reached. On Sunday, he had nothing but praise for Trump.
"Republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on American consumers, and we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does, either," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaking on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," defended Trump.
"Republicans need to provide the president with a lot of leeway," Tillis said, adding that if lawmakers give Trump some "unorthodox" options for negotiating trade agreements, "then America wins."
Top congressional Democrats on Saturday delivered dual attacks on the deal, saying that the agreement amounted to less than meets the eye while also arguing that the tariff threat that prompted it was reckless.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the deal was "likely to be one of the president's typical, bogus solutions" to justify retreat from the tariffs, which had prompted a fierce backlash from business interests and many Republicans.

Favorite resistance doctor of Democrats still questioning Trump’s mental fitness, still unethical

Texto completo: Democrats plan to join forces again with a “resistance” psychiatrist to prove that they can be just as immoral and unethical as President Trump.
That ought to show him.
The Washington Examiner’s Kimberly Leonard reports:
Democrats are planning to host a Capitol Hill event featuring psychiatrists who will warn that President Trump is unfit for office based on his mental health. The event will be led by Dr. Bandy Lee, a Yale School of Medicine psychiatrist and editor of The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a book that argues psychiatrists have a responsibility to warn the public when a president is dangerous. The position is controversial because psychiatric associations urge members never to diagnose patients they haven't personally evaluated, saying it undermines the scientific rigor of the profession. […] The date for the town hall hasn't been set but would be held 'imminently soon within the next couple of weeks,' said Lee, who said the event was meant to be bipartisan. Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., who has called for Trump's impeachment, confirmed the event was in the works, but said it would be more likely to occur in July because lawmakers have a full plate in June with spending bills.
The name “Bandy Lee” should be familiar by now. She has worked hard these past few years securing a top spot in the competitive world of "resistance" mental health professionals, many of whom have discarded decades of ethical standards and practices in return for book deals and speaking time on the anti-Trump circuit.
In February 2017, 33 mental health experts sent a signed letter to the New York Times warning of the president's "emotional instability." Later, in October 2017, 125 health professionals marched on Broadway, demanding that the president be declared mentally unsound and removed immediately from the White House. Not a single one of these professionals had performed an in-person diagnosis on the president.
In January 2018, more than 100 medical professionals signed a statement urging lawmakers to “take urgent steps to restrain [Trump’s] behavior and head off the potential nuclear catastrophe” with North Korea. At around the same time as the statement’s release, congressional Democrats summoned a mental health expert to Capitol Hill to discuss the president's possible instability.
Again, neither the signatories nor the summoned expert had ever met with Trump to perform a firsthand evaluation.
Lee is one of the top signatories on the statement released in January. Lee is also the medical expert summoned by Democrats.
This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the codes of conduct championed by both the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association, which state that it is extremely unethical for mental health professionals to perform armchair analyses on persons with whom they have never met to conduct an in-person evaluation.
Lee, of course, does not see what she is doing as unethical or detrimental to broader attempts to destigmatize mental disorders.
“The president's condition has been visibly deteriorating to the point where there's a lot of talk right now about his mental state beyond mental health professionals," she said. "It no longer takes a mental health professional to recognize the seriousness of the current presidency."
I'm sure this isn't just about selling books.

Texto completo: El acuerdo para evitar los aranceles que el presidente Donald Trump anunció consiste, principalmente, en acciones que el Gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador ya había prometido tomar en conversaciones anteriores con los Estados Unidos durante los últimos meses.
Así lo afirmaron funcionarios de ambos países familiarizados con el negociaciones, reveló The New York Times.
La declaración conjunta del acuerdo del viernes dice que México aceptó el “despliegue de su Guardia Nacional en todo México, dando prioridad a su frontera sur”.
Sin embargo, el Gobierno mexicano ya se había comprometido a hacerlo en marzo durante conversaciones secretas en Miami entre la entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , y la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez .
El Times afirma que la expansión del programa para que solicitantes de asilo permanezcan en México mientras continúan sus casos en Estados Unido era un acuerdo desde diciembre.
El análisis y reporte con fuentes anónimas del diario neoyorquino no deja claro si los acuerdos suponen una ampliación de aquellas negociaciones, pero el presidente Trump calificó las afirmaciones de “falsas”.
La Administración mexicana defendió como un éxito el acuerdo entre ambas naciones para evitar los aranceles a México hasta del 25 por ciento.
Organizaciones en defensa de los inmigrantes critican el acuerdo, acusando que es en detrimento de quienes buscan una vida mejor en los Estados Unidos.
Hay una parte de las negociaciones que el mandatario republicano afirma que no se ha revelado y se dará a conocer en “su debido momento” .

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump tuiteó desde temprana hora acerca el acuerdo con el Gobierno mexicano sobre inmigración, seguridad y materia comercial para evitar aplicar las tarifas de hasta 25% a productos de ese país; destacó que hay un elemento importante que se dará a conocer más adelante.
Los comentarios del mandatario formaron parte de la respuesta al reporte de The New York Times, sobre que los puntos que integran el pacto entre su Administración y la de Andrés Manuel López Obrador fueron cerrados en marzo por la entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , y la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez Cordero .
El mandatario republicano dijo que México no había cooperado con los Estados Unidos adecuadamente, pero ahora tiene completa confianza, especialmente luego de hablar con su homólogo López Obrador.
“Hay algunas cosas importantes que no se mencionaron ayer en el comunicado de prensa, una en particular, sobre la que acordamos” , indicó el presidente en un tuit. “Será anunciada en su debido momento” .
Agregó que ahora existe una gran cooperación entre ambas naciones y recalcó que era algo que no existía “en décadas” por razones desconocidas.
…..not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time. There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn’t exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019
Las críticas sobre el acuerdo se desataron en ambos países, incluso en voz de la lideresa de la Cámara, Nancy Pelosi .
“Las amenazas y las rabietas no son una forma de negociar la política exterior”, dijo Pelosi en un comunicado el sábado.
Grupos de activistas, como Families Belong Together México consideraron que poner a inmigrantes como un elemento de negociación entre países los coloca en una posición más vulnerable.
“La celebración del acuerdo migratorio entre México y los Estados Unidos en Tijuana no toma en cuenta la desesperación y el sufrimiento de los miles de migrantes que son afectados por las políticas migratorias de Trump. Hemos deshumanizado la migración” , afirmó Soraya Vázquez , directora de Families Belong Together México. “Nos hemos vuelto insensibles frente a una realidad lacerante de miles de niños y familias que deben esperar su proceso de asilo en Tijuana sin seguridad, comida o refugio adecuado”.
El presidente Trump afirmó que México se había comprometido a aumentar la adquisición de productos agrícolas de los Estados Unidos.
Cuestionada al respecto, al Embajadora mexicana, Martha Bárcena , evitó desmentir o reafirmar dicha revelación, aunque destacó que en los últimos cuatro meses el país vecino del sur se convirtió en el socio comercial número uno de EEUU.
En entrevista en el programa Face The Nation de CBS, la Embajadora destacó que con la aprobación del Acuerdo Estados Unidos-México-Canadá (USMCA o T-MEC ) habrá ese incremento.
“Hará un incremento de productos agrículos y manufactureros”, apuntó, pero la entrevistadora Margaret Brennan insistió sobre el mensaje tuiteado por el presidente Trump acerca del incremento en productos agrícolas.
“Ahora somos el segundo comprador de los Estados Unidos en ese sector” , dijo Bárcena. “Tenemos una economía integrada en el sector agrícola”.

El canciller mexicano, Marcelo Ebrard , afirmó que el acuerdo evitó la pérdida hasta de 900,000 empleos en México en forma inmediata, sí como la cancelación del T-MEC.
Sobre los inmigrantes que se enviará a México señaló que se les dará asistencia legal y orientación para laborar en el país, además de registrar todos los extranjeros que busquen llegar a EEUU.
“Necesitamos saber quiénes son, si no, no los podemos proteger” , afirmó.

Texto completo: No han pasado dos días desde que se llego a un acuerdo entre México y Estados Unidos para suspender la imposición de los aranceles a los productos mexicanos para que el presidente Donald Trump volviera a amenzar a López Obrador.
“Sin embargo, si por alguna razón desconocida no hay (cooperación por parte de México), siempre podemos volver a nuestra posición anterior, y muy lucrativa, de (amenazar con) Aranceles; pero no creo que eso vaya a ser necesario” , dijo Trump en Twitter al defender el acuerdo pero sin dejar sus amenazas contra el gobierno de AMLO.
En una serie de tuits, Trump defendió el pacto migratorio logrado este viernes con México, por el que él accedió a suspender los aranceles que planeaba imponer a todas las importaciones mexicanas, después de que el diario The New York Times afirmara que algunos puntos se acordaron hace meses.
“Antes, México no estaba cooperando en la frontera, y ahora tengo una confianza completa, especialmente después de hablar ayer con su presidente (Andrés Manuel López Obrador), en que cooperarán mucho y en que quieren hacer bien el trabajo”, escribió Trump.
El mandatario aseguró que “se acordaron algunas cosas que no se anunciaron en el comunicado” del viernes, “una en particular”, y que eso “se anunciará en el momento adecuado”.
La Casa Blanca no dio más detalles sobre cuál podría ser ese acuerdo inédito, y el secretario en funciones de seguridad nacional, Kevin McAleenan, se limitó a recordar que, como se anunció el viernes, está previsto que siga habiendo negociaciones durante los próximos 90 días.
“Hay un mecanismo para asegurarnos de que ellos (México) hacen lo que prometieron hacer, de que hay un resultado y vemos una reducción grande en los números” de inmigrantes que llegan a EEUU, dijo este domingo McAleenan a la cadena de televisión Fox News.
La embajadora de México en Estados Unidos, Martha Bárcena, precisó después que las conversaciones entre los equipos técnicos continuarán “casi semanalmente”, por lo que en el plazo de 90 días podría haber nuevos anuncios.
“(Lo anunciado el viernes) es una declaración conjunta de principios, que nos da una base para la hoja de ruta que tenemos que seguir en los próximos meses en cuanto a migración” , explicó Bárcena en una entrevista con la cadena televisiva CBS News.
Bárcena apuntó que el objetivo es devolver las cifras de migrantes que llegan a EEUU a los niveles de 2018, y pronosticó que habrá “resultados en un plazo relativamente corto, de un mes o mes y medio”, gracias al despliegue de unos 6.000 efectivos de la Guardia Nacional de México en la frontera de ese país con Guatemala.
Pero la embajadora no confirmó que, como parte del acuerdo alcanzado el viernes, México haya “accedido a empezar inmediatamente a comprar grandes cantidades de productos agrícolas” a EE.UU., como aseguró Trump en un tuit este sábado.
“Estoy absolutamente segura de que el comercio en bienes agrícolas podría aumentar drásticamente en los próximos meses”, debido a la combinación de la suspensión de los aranceles y “la ratificación del (acuerdo comercial) T-MEC” en EE.UU., México y Canadá, subrayó Bárcena.
Su entrevistadora le pidió entonces aclarar si estaba hablando de un acuerdo paralelo logrado durante las negociaciones de esta semana, o si simplemente se refería a tendencias comerciales, y Bárcena respondió: “Estoy hablando sobre comercio”.
El pacto anunciado el viernes permitirá la ampliación a toda la frontera común de un programa que el Gobierno ha aplicado hasta ahora solo en tres puntos de entrada en la zona limítrofe, y que obliga a los solicitantes de asilo a esperar en el país vecino mientras se tramitan sus casos en territorio estadounidense.
Ese proceso puede durar meses o incluso años, y este año ya se ha enviado a México a 10,393 solicitantes de asilo en EEUU, según fuentes oficiales mexicanas.
La oposición demócrata ha criticado a Trump por usar la amenaza de aranceles para extraer compromisos de México sobre inmigración, y dos aspirantes presidenciales, Bernie Sanders y Beto O’Rourke, arremetieron este domingo contra el mandatario por su aviso de que, si no hay avances migratorios, volverá a amenazar con aranceles.
“Necesitamos una relación decente con México. Son nuestros aliados, como Canadá. No deberíamos estar enfrentándonos a ellos cada día”, dijo Sanders a la cadena CNN.

Texto completo: It all started on a dusty wooden floor of a used book store. Ruth Reichl was 8 years old when she plopped herself down and started reading an old issue of Gourmet magazine, becoming fascinated with a recipe for Roast Suckling Pig Parisienne. Her mother called it "that ridiculous magazine." It would one day be her daughter's empire: Reluctantly, Reichl accepted the job as editor in chief when she was 51.

The "ridiculous" magazine wanted to teach her to cook eels, bears, woodchucks, and snipe. Pig was what she, ummm, cut her chops on, and it was superb, proclaimed her mother.

As a child, Reichl and her father explored New York City by going to places where foods were known for their specialty, starting with the German enclave, Yorkville, Upper 80s, East Side. Food was more than a passion. "(It) became my own private way of looking at the world." When she was 22, she wrote "Mmmm: A Festiary" and rose to fame as a professional food writer.

What was the most exciting thing she ever tasted? Tom yum goong, a Thai soup. It propelled her to pitch an article on Thai cuisine to a Gourmet editor when she was in her 20s. Alas, the editor threw her out, saying that Thai cuisine wouldn't interest Gourmet readers, but in the same breath, the woman said they had run such a piece a few years back. Reichl rejected the magazine from her thoughts for 25 years and wrote copiously for less stuffy publications.

Cut to 1998: she agreed to meet for tea with James Truman, editorial director of Conde Nast. at New York's Algonquin Hotel and railed at the man about all the things wrong with the magazine. She told him the latest Gourmet put her to sleep. And then he asked her to be editor in chief for Gourmet and manager of 60 employees. She dropped her spoon! She had been a noted food critic for the New York Times and, before that, the Los Angeles Times. A writer, yes, not a manager.

Truman did not give up. Time to engage the top gun. Si Newhouse, owner/billionaire of Conde Nast, was sent in to win her over. She told him he needed someone with experience. And on it went, back and forth. An interminable meal. She was very comfortable writing restaurant reviews, thank you very much, and enjoyed her friendships with other food writers. But maybe she was too comfortable. His offer was tempting. Before meeting Newhouse, an astrologer told her she was going "to learn a great deal." And that it "will completely alter your life."

Reichl and dozens of editors tried to breathe life into Gourmet for a decade. She gives us an inside look at the magazine and describes her initial angst, feeling demoralized and "like an idiot." It was a frantic time for her. This was a helm she didn't want; she knew nothing about magazines, but she was making six times what she made at the Times, along with being given incredible perks.

When she traveled with other food editors, notably to Paris, it was a luxurious ride from start to finish. Money was no object.

Reichl does an outstanding job of describing what it's like dealing with motherhood, learning about the tricky world of magazine publishing, and ultimately relishing it after a rocky start. Throughout, she writes this memoir with panache. It is a joyful read, but the ending was not an easy one, written with heartbreak in every paragraph.

Other books by Reichl to consider: "Garlic and Sapphires," "Tender at the Bone" and "Comfort Me With Apples." They are all delicious.

Texto completo: LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with the annual Trooping the Colours parade, a traditional display of British pageantry. About 1,400 soldiers in scarlet coats and bearskin hats marched past in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade in Westminster.
Royals taking part included Prince Charles, Prince William and his wife, Kate, and Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan - who appeared in her first public outing since giving birth to their son, Archie, to watch the birthday flyby of military aircraft.
Baby Archie did not appear, but another young royal almost stole the queen's limelight when he made his debut on Buckingham Palace's balcony. Prince Louis, 1, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, waved frantically at the first sight of helicopters.
The queen marks her birthday twice a year - an official ceremony is always held in June, in hopes of holding the parade in good weather. Her actual birthday, April 21, is usually celebrated with close family only. She turned 93.
Thousands of spectators lined the parade ground and gathered in nearby St. James's park to watch the spectacle in sparkling sunshine. They then walked down the road leading to Buckingham Palace, gathering at the gates to honor the monarch ahead of the fly-past.
The queen waved and smiled as she emerged on the balcony and the crowd roared.
The ceremony originated from traditional preparations for battle. The colors - or flags - were "trooped," or carried down the lines of soldiers, so they could be seen and recognized in battle.
London police arrest 5 teens in alleged attack of women on bus
LONDON- Five teen boys were under arrest Saturday in connection with an alleged assault on two women who refused to kiss as they were surrounded on a London bus and taunted as lesbians, according to an account by one of the women.
The alleged attack was revealed in social media posts by one of the women, Melania Geymonat.
The Metropolitan Police announced that four teens had been arrested Friday and said another boy, 16, was arrested Saturday. Police were reviewing footage of the attack.
Geymonat, an Uruguayan flight attendant, said she and her U.S. girlfriend were traveling home on the top deck of a bus to Camden Town, a neighborhood busy with nightlife, on May 30 when they were attacked.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the incident "a disgusting, misogynistic attack."
US ambassador says Israel can retain parts of the West Bank
JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday come about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.
Albania president cites tense climate in canceling elections
TIRANA, Albania - Albanian President Ilir Meta on Saturday canceled upcoming municipal elections, citing the need to reduce political tensions in the country. Meta said he would clarify his decision Monday.
Thousands of Albanians who support the political opposition assembled for an anti-government protest Saturday. The Albanian opposition accuses the government of links to organized crime and vote rigging. The government denies the allegations and said protests that started in February have hurt the country's image as the European Union is set to decide this month whether to launch negotiations to include Albania as a member.
The U.S. and EU urged the opposition to disavow violence and sit with government representatives to resolve the crisis.
Hillary Clinton says youngest brother has died
NEW YORK - Hillary Clinton's youngest brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The former U.S. senator, secretary of state, first lady and Democratic presidential candidate announced the death Saturday on Twitter.
Clinton remembered her brother as a generous person who could walk into a room and "light it up with laughter."
"It's hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today," she tweeted.
He was survived by his wife, Megan, and three children, Zach, Simon and Fiona. Tony Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham. He was raised in the Chicago suburbs along with his older siblings, Hillary and Hugh.
The youngest Rodham held a variety of jobs, including stints as a prison guard, insurance salesman, repo man, private detective and business investor.
Pickup truck hits Amish carriage, killing 2 kids
ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Authorities say a pickup rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
State police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.
Rebel soccer icon: A Syrian soccer goalkeeper who became an icon of the rebellion against President Bashar Assad has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces, the rebels said Saturday.
Abdelbaset Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a player for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Assad in 2011, Sarout led rallies and became known as the "singer of the revolution" for his songs and ballads.
Following the arc of the Syrian uprising, Sarout later took up arms as the country slid into civil war. Many activists and rebels came to refer to him as the "guardian of freedom," a play on the Arabic word for goalkeeper.

Rising conservatives as hostile to freedom as leftists

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Delegates to the California Democratic Party convention last weekend drew national attention after they booed a presidential candidate, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, for saying that “socialism is not the answer.” Conservative writers were aghast. Look at those crazy California Democrats, they insisted, who get upset at a few jabs at an ideology that’s long been associated with collectivism and misery.
Yes, there’s a deep rift within the Democratic Party between its traditional-liberal and progressive wings, with the latter moving in some troubling ideological directions. But Republicans, who have gleefully warned the public about Democratic flirtations with socialism, shouldn’t be quick to gloat given the emergence of an anti-freedom movement on the right.
While Democrats were airing their internal strife in San Francisco, Republicans were having a knock-down, drag-out ideological battle in a couple of journals read mostly by intellectuals. The fault lines are strikingly similar. Two factions are fighting for the soul of the party, with one side proposing that the GOP scuttle — or strongly soften — its historic support for pluralism, freedom and markets.
The first volley was lobbed by Sohrab Ahmari, in a May 29 column in First Things called “Against David French-ism.” Few people know that obscure religious journal and even fewer have heard of “French-ism.” Even French, the target of the piece, seemed bemused by the term. Both are conservatives. Both are pro-life Christians. French is a lawyer who has filed religious-liberty cases. Yet Ahmari, an editor at the New York Post, tarred him as an ideological softy who is too interested in “individual autonomy” to fight the culture war with sufficient zeal.
French fired back at Ahmari, arguing that “there is no political ‘emergency’ that justifies abandoning” a political order that goes back to our nation’s founding. He found it odd that Ahmari would tout the libertine Trump as the key to restoring traditional values.
This looked like some insider blog debate, but it garnered wide attention among conservatives. Even mainstream media writers in The New York Times and Vox wrote about the dust-up. That’s because the argument wasn’t really about two conservative writers, but about the future of the conservative movement and the visions each of them represent.
French holds to the classical tradition that champions liberty, market economics, civility and decency in the public square. I disagree with him on many issues (foreign policy, for instance), but agree strongly with the traditional American idea that government should try to neutrally protect individual rights — rather than be used to advance cultural preferences.
Ahmari believes Americans are fighting a “cultural civil war” and that the “only way is through — that is to say, to fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.” It’s a bizarre argument given that cultural conservatives lose every culture war that they fight.
Ahmari essentially complains that the left is doing to the right (re-ordering the public square) exactly what the right would like to be doing to the left. That makes me more committed than ever to this neutrality thing. Maybe neither side should be using the government to force its culture on others?
Ahmari never specifies what policies he would endorse once his allies grab control of the levers of power — perhaps because such policies might seem authoritarian to the average American. But one needn’t take too many leaps to see where this populist-religious conservatism is headed.
“Government intervention will not be the answer to every social ill,” Ahmari writes. “In many instances, free markets and individual enterprise can best serve the common good, albeit indirectly.” So, Ahmari won’t use big government to control everything. He might allow some individual enterprise provided, of course, the rulers believe that it conforms to the “common good.” Well, that’s a relief.
That nebulous term “common goo,” drives me crazy. It means whatever people in charge of the government say it means. Those of us in the classical-liberal and libertarian camps believe that each individual can figure that out on their own without government mandate. They can do as they please even if we might not personally approve of their decisions. But Ahmari wants “to enforce our order and our orthodoxy” on society. Creepy, no?
Even creepier is this reality: Many influential conservatives no longer value liberty or the marketplace. Fox News host Tucker Carlson recently praised some of leftist Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s economic agenda and blasted Republicans as “libertarian zealots” controlled by banks who yammer about entrepreneurship. Conservatives might have a problem if some of their thought leaders start channeling Warren and Huey Long.
The Democrats are dealing with a socialist-friendly left that despises economic freedom, but Republicans are facing a resurgent nationalist right that shares many of the same hostilities. There’s a clear and present danger on both horizons.

Mexico: Tariff deal with US struck 'fair balance'

Texto completo: Mexican negotiators hailed the new tariff-averting immigration deal with the United States as a “fair balance” between their priorities and the more “drastic” proposals that President Trump initially demanded.
"I think it's a fair balance because they had more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point," Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said of the deal, which Trump announced Friday night.
Ebrard was particularly determined to avoid an agreement that would designate Mexico as a “safe third country,” which would require the government to take responsibility for Central American migrants who entered Mexico on their way to the United States. The compromise agreement averted Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico, as Ebrad’s team agreed to speed up a plan to deploy 6,000 members of the National Guard to the Latin American country’s southern border.
“Just as I predicted, the president backed off,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday afternoon. “It is likely to have only a small impact on solving the root causes of Central American migration because many of the components are things Mexico is already doing.”
Schumer’s jab followed a report that the key components of the final deal were agreed to during discussions that have been conducted over the past several months. The National Guard deployment was promised in March, according to the New York Times, while Mexico’s agreement to retain custody of Central American migrants who seek asylum in the United States while officials review their cases was negotiated in December.
“President Trump ought to stop acting like a showman and start working with Democrats on our serious proposals to address the nation’s most pressing needs,” Schumer added.
The joint declaration released Friday night foreshadowed a renewal of tensions if the surge of migrants crossing the southwest border into the United States does not slow over the next three months.
“Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions,” the text of the agreement affirmed.

Texto completo: Bill Maher asked the panel on his HBO television show to hypothesize what would happen if President Trump killed his team of advisers negotiating with North Korea.
On Friday's episode of "Real Time with Bill Maher," the comedian was joined by New York Times columnist Charles Blow, Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, and national security analyst Clint Watts. Maher posed the hypothetical in light of reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un killed or imprisoned members of his own negotiating team.
"Reported last week, Kim Jong Un had his entire negotiating team killed. What if Trump killed his negotiating team?" Maher asked the panelists at the start of the segment. "What if he killed [Secretary of State] Mike Pompeo and [national security adviser] John Bolton? What would [Sen. Majority Leader] Mitch McConell say or do?"
"Is this a real question?" Blow responded, laughing.
"Yes it is. What would [GOP Sen.] Lindsey Graham do? What would [Fox News host] Sean Hannity do?" Maher said, before ending the line of questioning.

In May, a South Korean newspaper reported that North Korea had executed Kim Hyok Chol, the North Korean leader's chief nuclear negotiator, after talks broke down at the U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi.
The report was partially debunked when Kim Hyok Chol appeared in several photos with Chairman Kim and Kim Hyok Chol's name appeared on a list of officials that attended a theater production with the chairman.

Texto completo: One year from the 2020 elections, presidential candidates face legal roadblocks to acquiring the tools and assistance necessary to defend against the cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns that plagued the 2016 presidential campaign.
Federal laws prohibit corporations from offering free or discounted cybersecurity services to federal candidates. The same law also blocks political parties from offering candidates cybersecurity assistance because it is considered an "in-kind donation."
The issue took on added urgency this week after lawyers for the Federal Election Commission advised the commission to block a request by a Silicon Valley company, Area 1 Security, which sought to provide services to 2020 presidential candidates at a discount. The commission is expected to decide on Area l's request at a public meeting Thursday.
Cybersecurity and election experts say time is running out for campaigns to develop tough protections.
Christopher Wray, the FBI director, warned in April that Russian election interference continued to pose a "significant counterintelligence threat" and that Russian efforts in the 2016 and 2018 elections were "a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020."
A bill introduced last month by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would have allowed political parties to provide greater cybersecurity assistance to candidates. But it stalled in the Senate after the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would not bring any election security bills to the floor for a vote.
The 2020 campaigns themselves are unlikely to have the expertise to track disinformation campaigns or to build sophisticated defenses needed to ward off hackers. In most cases, they cannot afford to pay outside experts market rates for such services, as required by federal election laws.
To thwart digital threats and phishing attacks, multinational corporations spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, at minimum, on security. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has said the bank spends nearly $600 million a year on security. Bank of America's chief executive has said the bank has a "blank check" when it comes to cybersecurity. Security experts note that - despite significantly smaller head counts - presidential candidates and their campaigns are among the most targeted organizations in the world.
"Expecting campaigns to do this on their own is asking for failure," said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a group that seeks to track and expose efforts by authoritarian regimes to undermine democratic elections.
Rosenberger knows the risks faced by campaigns. As a foreign policy adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2016, she saw firsthand the real-world effects of these attacks. In what is called a spearphishing attack, Russian hackers compromised emails belonging to John Podesta, then Clinton's campaign chairman, and employees at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
"If we're putting campaigns on the front lines alone, and they're having to defend themselves alone, then we've lost," she said.
But guarding against Russia is just one of the challenges, officials and experts said.
"Russia drafted a play-book that other international actors can use," said Nathaniel Persily, co-director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center and a law professor at Stanford Law School. "We should not be surprised if other nation-states and stateless entities try to take a page from the Russian playbook in the next election."
Last month, the FEC ruled that a nonprofit organization, Defending Digital Campaigns, could provide free cybersecurity services to political campaigns. But the ruling was narrow, and applied only to nonpartisan, nonprofit groups that offer the same services to all campaigns. Defending Digital Campaigns was founded by Robbie Mook, who ran Clinton's 2016 campaign, and Matt Rhoades, who managed Mitt Romney's campaign in 2012.
But nonprofits can only do so much, experts said, and in many cases there are private companies with better technology for fending off hackers.
The case being heard this week by the FEC involves Area 1, which says it has developed tools to block spearphishing attacks.
In anticipation of future attacks, a number of candidates running for office in 2020 contacted Area 1 to ask for its anti-phishing services, said Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency who helped found the company.
Area 1 works with a number of large corporations and assists smaller firms and nonprofits, charging a rate lower than what it charges big clients, Falkowitz said. He noted that the pricing model was fairly standard. Other tech companies like Dropbox and Slack give away many of their services to individuals and smaller organizations, but charge larger businesses to use their products.
Lawyers for three of the 2020 candidates that contacted Area 1, who could not be named because of confidentiality agreements, told the company that they worried that by using Area l's services, the campaigns might run afoul of campaign finance laws.
Area 1 made a formal request to the FEC to ask for an advisory opinion in April. As part of its request, Area 1 asked the commission to grant the company the same exemption the FEC granted to Microsoft last year.
The FEC ruled that Microsoft could offer "enhanced online account security services to its election-sensitive customers at no additional cost" because Microsoft would be shoring up defenses for its existing customers, not seeking to curry favor with political candidates, and would be acting on a nonpartisan basis out of business interests.
But on Monday, lawyers for the FEC said Area l's request did not meet the same bar as Microsoft and the company's services looked too much like a political contribution.
The commission has been sensitive to the influx of so-called dark money into campaigns and maintains a high bar for granting exemptions because of concerns that an exemption could create a loophole for corporations looking to influence an election.

YouTube bans neo-Nazi, white supremacy videos

Texto completo: YouTube announced plans Wednesday to remove thousands of videos and channels that advocate for neo-Nazism, white supremacy and other bigoted ideologies in an attempt to clean up extremism and hate speech on its popular service.
The new policy will ban "videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion," the company said in a blog post. The prohibition will also cover videos denying that violent incidents took place, like the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.
YouTube did not name any specific channels or videos that would be banned.
"It's our responsibility to protect that, and prevent our platform from being used to incite hatred, harassment, discrimination and violence," the company said in the blog post.
The decision by YouTube, which is owned by Google, is the latest action by a Silicon Valley company to stem the spread of hate speech and disinformation on its site. A month ago, Facebook evicted seven of its most controversial users, including Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of InfoWars. Twitter banned Jones last year.
The companies have come under intense criticism for their delayed reaction to the spread of hateful and false content. At the same time, President Donald Trump and others argue that the giant tech platforms censor right-wing opinions, and the new policies put in place by the companies have inflamed those debates.
The tension was evident Tuesday, when YouTube said a prominent right-wing creator who used racial language and homophobic slurs to harass a journalist in videos on YouTube did not violate its policies. The decision set off a firestorm online, including accusations that YouTube was giving a free pass to some of its popular creators.
In the videos, that creator, Steven Crowder, a conservative commentator with nearly 4 million YouTube subscribers, repeatedly insulted Carlos Maza, a journalist from Vox. Crowder used slurs about Maza's Cuban-American ethnicity and sexual orientation. Crowder said his comments were harmless, and YouTube determined they did not break its rules.
"Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don't violate our policies, they'll remain on our site," YouTube said in a statement about its decision on Crowder.
The back-to-back decisions illustrated the struggles of social media companies: Making rules is often easier than enforcing them.
"This is an important and long-overdue change," Becca Lewis, a research affiliate at the nonprofit organization Data & Society, said about the new policy. "However, YouTube has often executed its community guidelines unevenly, so it remains to be seen how effective these updates will be."
YouTube's scale - more than 500 hours of new videos are uploaded every minute - has made it difficult for the company to track rule violations. And the company's historically lax approach to moderating extreme videos has led to a drumbeat of scandals, including accusations that the site has promoted disturbing videos to children and allowed extremist groups to organize on its platform. YouTube's automated advertising system has paired offensive videos with ads from major corporations, prompting several advertisers to abandon the site.
The kind of content that will be prohibited under YouTube's new hate speech policies include videos that claim Jews secretly control the world, those that say women are intellectually inferior to men and therefore should be denied certain rights, or that suggest that the white race is superior to another race, a YouTube spokesman said.
Channels that post some hateful content, but that do not violate YouTube's rules with the majority of their videos, may receive strikes under YouTube's three-strike enforcement system, but would not be immediately banned.

George Will: The College Board tries to solve a social problem that it's unsuited to solve

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the SAT, should ponder Abraham Maslow's law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said essentially this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an "environmental context" bonus. Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an "adversity index." But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors (e.g., poverty or food-stamp eligibility, crime rates, disorderly schools, broken families, families with education deficits, etc.) where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to The New York Times: "This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they've been given."
Perhaps the board's evident discomfort with the label "adversity score" is because their more benign-sounding "environmental context" gives a social-science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of "privilege." By whatever name, however, the SAT's new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes (e.g., "legacies" — the children of alumni). And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges. Most importantly, they were used to disfavor certain groups, particularly Jews.
By making an objective — meaning standardized — test one component of schools' assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools' prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as "diversity" (understood in various ways) becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social "context," however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring — guessing, actually — the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character. Physicists speak of the "escape velocity" of particles circling in an orbit. Perhaps the adversity index can indicate individuals who, by their resilience, have achieved velocity out of challenging social environments.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children, advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf "adversity" bonuses. As Andrew Ferguson, author of the grimly hilarious "Crazy U: One Dad's Crash Course in Getting His Kid into College," says, America's least diverse classes are SAT prep classes.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the "secret-sauce" of the SAT's adversity score — schools will know it, applicants will not — will "breed more public mistrust" of colleges' admissions processes. But calling, as the Tribune does, for more "transparency" implies that the more admissions' criteria are made public, the better. However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants' privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of — and the inevitable shrinking of — schools' discretion in shaping their student bodies, and ensuring that some cohorts are not largely excluded.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia's fluctuating "diversity" obsessions, some of which contravene common understandings of equity and perhaps civil rights laws and norms. Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard's "holistic" metrics, beyond "objective" ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for — it is alleged — the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans. They, like the Jews whose academic proficiency was a "problem" eight decades ago, often come from family cultures that stress academic attainments.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent (and, which is much the same thing, unconservative) objective.

'Hamilton' wows Louisville crowd

Texto completo: Buckle up. This isn't just any history lesson.
"Hamilton," which opened this week (finally!) for its three-week run at the Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts, is the story of America's Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, an immigrant from the West Indies who became George Washington's right-hand man during the Revolutionary War and was the new nation's first treasury secretary.
Sounds boring, right?
Wrong.
This Tony Award-winning musical phenomenon is raw, edgy, full of cuss words, a dash of sex and is unlike anything you've seen on stage before. Truly. How many other productions can say they feature a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&B and Broadway? None.
Composer Lin-Manuel Miranda, the mastermind behind "Hamilton" who also originated the title role on Broadway, is a modern day musical genius, and the touring cast, for the most part, lives up the challenge of staging a musical so wildly popular it has a life of its own.
In 2015, New York Times chief theater critic Ben Brantley summed up the show, simply saying, "Yes, it really is that good."
Almost four years later, he's still not wrong. And while this version of the show is traveling the country instead of being anchored in New York, the city where it all happens, "Hamilton" is still the same, raw story about young rebels shaping and forming a new country.
Edred Utomi has the unenviable task of portraying Alexander Hamilton, a character brimming with self-confidence and insecurity at the same time. Luckily for audiences, Utomi does Hamilton justice, playing him with just the slightest amount of unpolished bravado that makes you like him almost immediately.
Utomi plays opposite a host of equally talented actors, including Paul Oakley Stovall as George Washington and Josh Tower as his friend, rival and nemesis Aaron Burr, who also serves as a narrator throughout the story.
Utomi's vocals first shine in "My Shot," the second song in Act I that lays out Hamilton's mission in life — "Hey yo, I'm just like my country // I'm young, scrappy and hungry // And I'm not throwing away my shot."
And while "Hamilton" is the lead character, he's certainly not the only star. Oakley Stovall portrays Washington as a stoic commander — the ideal man in charge. And Tower, who gives an emotional, often rash performance as Burr, is the perfect counterpart to Utomi's earnest Hamilton.
You're immediately brought along on Hamilton's journey to become "a new man" with the songs "The Story of Tonight" and "Right Hand Man," which feature Utomi et al. formulating their first version of a plan to gain independence from England.
The full ensemble shines in the first act, as does the set, which is the living, breathing embodiment of the rawness of the characters. (Speaking of, did you know the ensemble is on stage for two hours and 45 minutes of the three-hour production?) Also, the choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler, is raw, edgy and emotional and a serious story driver for the entire production.
I would be remiss without mentioning the sparkling performance by Peter Matthew Smith as King George.
King George III, you'll remember from history classes, was the regent in charge when the American Revolution broke out, and Smith's character is watching Hamilton and his cohorts from across the sea. His song "You'll Be Back" sounds like a scorned lover who declares "And when push comes to shove // I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!"
His performance felt a tad over the top, but then again, wouldn't you be over the top if you were the king of England?
One of the most visually stunning moments of the production occurred in Act I in "Satisfied," when Angelica Schuyler, played by Stephanie Umoh, "rewinds" her first meeting with Hamilton, telling audiences she first fell in love with him before introducing him to her sister, Eliza, played by Hannah Cruz, whom he ultimately marries.
The number, which perhaps has the best use of the circular, revolving stage, takes the entire cast of characters back in time to relive that first meeting while repeating the movements of each character. This is some of the best choreography in the entire production.
At times the vocals felt a bit pitchy for both Cruz and Umoh, but the emotional portrayal Cruz gives to Eliza's character after tragedy repeatedly befalls her family in Act II redeems any misgivings about her vocal prowess from Act I.
And it's in Act II where most of the powerhouse vocals take place. First, you have the almost so-absurd-they-can't-possibly-be-true-but-you-really-wish-they-were rap battles between Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, played perfectly by Bryson Bruce. He also takes a turn as "everyone's favorite fighting Frenchman" in the first act as the one and only Marquis de Lafayette.
The chemistry between Utomi and Bruce is palpable in each interaction between themen, who play off each other perfectly. Their relationship is easily one of the best in the show. ("How can it not be when this line is lobbed out: A civics lesson from a slaver, hey neighbor // Your debts are paid 'cause you don't pay for labor.")
Bruce, also, is hilarious and dances his way straight into your heart with his charm and "Southern (expletive) Democratic-Republican" attitude.
Things get a little sexy and plenty sad in Act II, which features an affair, a public acknowledgment of said affair, Eliza telling the audience she hopes her husband burns, (she means it, too), two duels, as many deaths and Washington's retirement from public service.
Sheesh.
It's hard to pick a favorite moment in the second half of the show, but it's between Washington as he steps out of the limelight in "One Last Time" or Burr as he laments being a political outsider in "The Room Where it Happens." I'd go see this production over and over again in the next three weeks just to relive the chills I got hearing these two larger-than-life performances.
If there's one moment that almost made me cry, though, it's Utomi's soliloquy in "The World Was Wide Enough." For a character who speaks sometimes in almost breathless paragraphs, these final moments for Hamilton take you deep inside his psyche in a visually stunning manner.
The show, in short, is worth every penny you'll pay to see it — and throw in a sixpence while you're at it. It's more than a show. It's the new definition of Broadway.
Scratch that. Hamilton himself might say it best — "this is not a moment, it's the movement."

Texto completo: A 17-year-old Freehold native has pulled off a shocker at Roland Garros on Thursday.
Amanda Anisimova stunned third-ranked Simona Halep in the quarterfinals at the French Open, cruising in straight sets to a 6-2, 6-4 victory. The win was Anisimova's first against a top-five player, and it secures her first trip to the semifinals at a major championship.
The 17-year-old will next face Australian Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals.
But just who is this young American, who beat the defending French Open champion before her 18th birthday?
Here's a quick look at Anisimova, and how she got to this point.
New Jersey born, Florida raised Anisimova is the daughter of Russian immigrants Konstanin and Olga, who moved to the United States in 1998 in order to provide more tennis-related opportunities for the oldest daughter, Maria, according to The New York Times.
Maria went on to play tennis collegiately at the University of Pennsylvania — but Amanda quickly grew into a star.
Born in Freehold Township, New Jersey, in 2001, Amanda later moved to Florida, where many professional tennis players live and train. She now lives in Aventura, Florida.
Why tennis? Anisimova told WTA's website that she was inspired to pick up the sport by her aforementioned older sister. But she also loves the individual nature of the sport.
"In tennis, you don't have to depend on anyone," she told WTA's website. "I did gymnastics as a kid, and I liked that too, because I only had to depend on myself.
"It's not like it's all about me, but at the end of the day, if I won or lost, I knew what I had to improve, and couldn't rely on a team."
A rapid ascent Anisimova actually made her French Open debut two years ago, earning a wild-card spot when she was just 15. She also won one title that year on the ITF Women's Circuit, which is a developmental level below the WTA.
Last year, in her first professional season, she climbed to No. 95 in the world with a handful of solid performances, including a runner-up finish at the Hana-Cupid Japan Women's Open in Hiroshima and a run to the fourth round at Indian Wells.
Anisimova then reached the Round of 16 at the Australian Open in January, where she lost to Petra Kvitova. She was ranked No. 51 in the world entering play at Roland Garros.
Russian roots Anisimova speaks Russian with her parents, including her father, Konstanin, who served as her coach earlier in her career. But she told The New York Times in 2017 that she has never visited Russia and never considered representing her parents' home country on the court.
"I do plan on going, though," she told the newspaper in 2017. "I really want to visit and see what it's like and see the culture more."
Anisimova is one of two Russian-American players who have made waves at Roland Garros this week. Another young American of Russian descent, Sofia Kenin, upset Serena Williams on Saturday.
Backup plan? Anisimova said in the 2017 article that she would like to become a surgeon if the whole tennis thing doesn't work out.
"Actually what I want to do is go to online college while I'm in my pro career and then go to med school after I finish," she told The New York Times in 2017.
In a similar vein, WTA's website reported two years ago that Anisimova "spends her free time reading books and watching Youtube videos about science and chemistry."
"I've always been curious about it, and I think it's pretty cool," she said at the time.

Symphony Space presents A Day of John Coltrane

Texto completo: Ask even the uninitiated who the titans of jazz are and the name John Coltrane is likely one of the first mentioned. It thus makes perfect sense that one of New York City's premiere cultural destinations, Symphony Space, has decided to honor the music great as part of its highly anticipated annual Wall to Wall festival series.
The Wall to Wall series, in fact, is how Symphony Space got its start as a cultural institution in the first place. Explains Darren Critz, director of performing arts programs, "It was both the first event for Symphony Space, and it launched Symphony Space back when it was just a closedoff movie theater. Isaiah Sheffer and Allan Miller, the founders of Symphony Space, wanted to come in and do a marathon of Bach's music. They were just gonna throw open the doors and for 12 hours they were going to have performances of many different elements of Bach music and it was a very community oriented event."
This was back in 1978 and, since then, Wall to Wall has become an annual New York City cultural staple. The New York Times, Crits states, has termed Wall to Wall Symphony Space's "annual gift to the city of New York."
John Coltrane was chosen as the subject of this year's Wall To Wall event, Critz says, because "John Coltrane is sort of the perfect exploration for a Wall to Wall. In his early years, no one really knew what type of a performer he was going to be."
Indeed, Coltrane is known for being quite solidly mediocre when he started out, and was thrown out of both Miles Davis' and Dizzy Gillespie's bands. "Yet," states Critz, "he grew into this artist that is now legendary. He worked so hard he overcame a bad heroin addiction and his life was all about becoming tire best artist that he could become. The evolution of hbis work from his early days playing bebop to this avant garde form of jazz, he was constantly moving artistically, never content with staying in one place."
Wall To Wall John Coltrane lasts all day June 9 and is free and open to the public. "It's a fully free event and a daylong exploration-this year it's eight hours-of one particular tiring. Sometimes it's a genre like Broadway musicals or it's one particular artist. This year, it's John Coltrane."
The audience they are trying to reach is a broad one. Critz says, "They can come in as a fan or they can come in not knowing anything. The idea is that they get a really good cultural experience."
The format for the festival is very open and flexible. Wall To Wall John Coltrane begins at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and ends at 11. Attendees can show up and leave at whatever time they wish.
It is split into three distinct segments. The first, says Critz, lasts from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. "There will be some early Coltrane, a multigenre exploration of Coltrane and his world and discussion of his lost album which was a big thing in the media earlier this year." The first section will also feature Brooklyn-based music and multimedia duo Soul Science Lab. "They will be doing a longer set of Coltrane's music through the lens of many different genres rather than just straight jazz."
There will also be a performance of Coltrane's elegy "Alabama," which he wrote in reaction to the 1963 Klu Klux Klan church bombing of a Birmingham, Alabama church that killed four young girls.
The second section, which will run from approximately 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., will be, Crits explains, "More classic Coltrane interpreted through music, dance and discussion." Dance Theater of Harlem's Da'von Doane and his dance group, The Shift/Dance Theater of Harlem, will premiere a dance to three of Coltrane's pieces.
The third and final segments is wehat Critz describes as "Living legends going deep into Coltrane through some of his more transcendent music and some spoken word. Performers will include MIles Davis porotege Wallace Roney and Davis' contemporary Fary Bartz.
Of course, the piece de la resistance, which will begin at about 10 p.m., is a performance of Coltrane's perhaps most famous work, "A Love Supreme." "The collective Brooklyn Raga Massive, who plays cross-cultural music through the lens of Indian classical Raga music, will be playing A Love Supreme' along with Reggie Workman, who was part of John Coltrane's Quartet." Harpist Brandi Younger will also be performing on "A Love Supreme." Says Critz, "It's probably one of the things I'm most excited about having worked here as long as I have."
This iteration of "A Love Supreme" being performed by this collaboration of artists will also be a first, and promises to be a performance not to be missed.

10 Thought-Provoking Summer Reads
Some of you reading this may be extroverted and energetic, in which case this summer book guide is not necessarily for you. But for those beachgoers who prefer to sit under an umbrella with a shirt on, shunning the big blue ocean in favor of a deep dive into literature, we've got just the thing. Here, for your reading pleasure, are the 10 books you should keep an eye out for in summer 2019.
The Nickel Boys
Agrande esta imagen.

Colson Whitehead (July 16)
The newest novel from the Pulitzer Prizewinner tells the story of Elwood Curtis, who is about to enroll in the local black college in the early '60s, buoyed by the strength he derives from the civil rights movement. But a misstep lands him instead in a juvenile reformatory called the Nickel Academy, where he's subject to physical and spiritual torture at the hands of the staff. Based on the story of a real institution, The Nickel Boys is another ghastly strand of American history Whitehead holds up to the light.
Trick Mirror Reflections on Self-Pelusion
Agrande esta imagen.

Jia Tolentino (Aug. 6)
According to press for this collection of essays from Jia Tolentino, a staff writer at The New Yorker, this book about millennial life and the deception it requires is "for readers who've wondered what Susan Sontag would have been like if she had brain damage from the internet." What more do you need?
The Testaments
Agrande esta imagen.

Margaret Atwood (Sept. 10)
Atwood's follow-up to her immensely popular The Handmaid's Tale picks up 15 years after the action of the original (and is being published 34 years after, too).
Fleishman Is in Trouble
Agrande esta imagen.

Taffy Brodesser-Akner (June 18)
Brodesser-Akner, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, turns her masterful skill for profiles to characters she's created herself. Fleishman Is in Trouble is the tale of a recently divorced New York doctor who gets a new lease on his life - sexual, professional, familial, you name it. However, Brodesser-Akner approaches her characters in the same way she approaches her subjects at her day job, with a critical, if understanding, eye. However revealing it is to see what people choose to reveal about themselves to you, there's no substitute for a simple change in perspective.
Say Nothing- A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland
Agrande esta imagen.

Patrick Radden Keefe (Feb. 26)
Yes, technically, this book came out in February. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a more engrossing, thrilling read than journalist Patrick Radden Keefe's account of the reverberations from one murder that took place during Northern Ireland's "troubles," the resolution of which comes with consequences for the living and the dead. Keefe's skills as both a writer and reporter shine.
Now to Po Nothing* Resisting the Attention Economy
Agrande esta imagen.

Jenny Odell (April 9)
This one, too, came out before the summer. But what better time to think about the virtue of unproductive time and the ways in which our phones and computers can take over our lives than when we've plopped down on the beach? Weaving academic research and personal reflection, Odell explains the ways in which doing nothing can be a salve to the soul.
I Like to watch= Arguing My way Through the TV Revolution

Emily Nussbaum (June 25)
There is much to argue about with regards to television. Is it better than it used to be? Is it more culturally relevant than movies? What has Netflix done to the way we consume it? Just about the only thing we can agree upon is that there's a ton of it. The New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum, who has been writing about TV during another of its Golden Ages, assesses the most interesting shows of the last decade and a half in this collection of her essays.
Orange World and Other Stories
Agrande esta imagen.

Karen Russell (May 14)
Russell's bizarre stories suck you in from the first sentence, and her 2011 novel, Swamplandia, remains an absolute mustread. Readers of Russell often debate which of her skills rises victorious over the other - novelist or short story writer - so read Orange World and then Swamplandia so you can throw your hat in the ring on one side.
Coventry
Agrande esta imagen.

Rachel Cusk (Aug. 20)
Rachel Cusk's Outline Trilogy was beloved by those who read it {The Washington Post called them "literary masterpieces"), and her skill as a novelist is unquestionable. If you just can't get enough, this collection of her essays on motherhood, feminism and more are sure to satiate.
Inland
Agrande esta imagen.

Tea Obreht (Aug. 13)
Obreht's follow-up to The Tiger's Wife is the story of two intertwined lives on the Arizona frontier in 1893, a brutal, arid place. Inland is "an epic journey across an unforgettable landscape of magic and myth."

Despite deferments, Trump says Vietnam service would have been an honor

Texto completo: Donald Trump, Selective Service registrant No. 50-63-46-580, never served in the military during the Vietnam War. Neither did 15 million other young American men who won student deferments or were otherwise disqualified.
But 9 million Americans did serve during the 11-year conflict, and the cultural and political gulf that opened between them and those who avoided involvement in a bloody, unpopular and losing war remains a festering national wound half a century later.
On Wednesday, as world leaders gathered to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day, an epic battle in a war that defined national consensus, President Donald Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that he would have been "honored" to serve in Vietnam.
"I would not have minded that at all," Trump said to British broadcaster Piers Morgan. "I would have been honored . . . But I think I make up for it right now . . . because we're rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before."
The contradiction between Trump's actions in the 1960s and his latest statement has reignited the long-simmering debate over how and why he avoided service. And the question of how he - like two of his 2020 rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden - managed to avoid the war is now being raised by a new generation of presidential contenders who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Trump steered himself around service in Vietnam by obtaining four student deferments and one medical disqualification - something to do with a bone spur in one or both of his heels - between 1964 and 1972.
In the past, Trump has presented his avoidance of service as an accident of timing - his college years and his draft eligibility coincided with a period when the military was generous with student deferments.
"I was never a fan of that war, I'll be honest with you," he told Morgan. "I thought it was a terrible war; I thought it was very far away. You're talking about Vietnam at that time - nobody ever heard of the country." Trump has long said he was against the war, but did not take part in any of the antiwar protests that were regular events on the University of Pennsylvania campus when he was a student.
"The bell rang and Donald Trump was hiding," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University who has written often on Vietnam. "Many people are proud that they didn't serve, saying it was an immoral war. But it's embarrassing that President Trump is in Great Britain honoring the 75th anniversary of D-Day and pretending to be a wannabe service member in Vietnam. If he wanted to, he could have easily served like John Kerry or John McCain," the former Democratic senator from Massachusetts and Republican senator from Arizona, respectively, whose Vietnam experiences defined their later political careers.
McCain, who spent five years in captivity by the North Vietnamese after his plane was shot down, said in 2017 that the inequities of the war had always gnawed at him. "I will never countenance . . . that we drafted the lowest-income level of America and the highest-income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur. That is wrong."
Trump until now has presented his avoidance of the draft as a stroke of fortune. "I actually got lucky because I had a very high draft number," he said in a 2011 TV interview. He has said that he felt he had military experience because he went to a high school with a military focus.
This year, some of Trump's younger Democratic opponents have slammed him for avoiding service. Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who is seeking the Democratic nomination, last week called Trump "somebody who, I think it's fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was a child of a multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place." Buttigieg, 37, was an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013.
Another presidential candidate, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., last week said he'd "like to meet the American hero who went in Donald Trump's place to Vietnam. I hope he's still alive." Moulton, 40, served in Iraq as a Marine Corps captain.
With septuagenarians Trump, Sanders, I-Vt., and Biden in the race, this is likely to be the last presidential election in which candidates' decisions about serving in Vietnam will be a political issue. Sanders, 77, a vocal opponent of the war while he was at the University of Chicago, applied for conscientious objector status but aged out of draft eligibility before his application was processed. Biden, 76, got student deferments when he was at the University of Delaware and was then reclassified as disqualified for service because he had asthma.
"We used to elect presidents on the basis of their service, from George Washington to Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and JFK's PT-109," Brinkley said. "But starting with Bill Clinton, what the Vietnam generation did became a litmus test. How did you deal with that era? It tells us a lot about somebody's character."
Politicians close to Trump's age have struggled to explain why they did not serve. President George W. Bush, who like Trump is 72, avoided the draft by signing up for Texas's National Guard.
President Bill Clinton, also 72, got student deferments while he was at Georgetown University from 1964 to 1968, after which a family friend in Arkansas arranged for him to enlist in the Navy Reserve to avoid the draft. Clinton later wrote a thank-you note to an Army ROTC officer for "saving me from the draft." The fact-checking service Snopes concluded that the fact "that Clinton went to great lengths to avoid the Vietnam-era draft [is] beyond dispute."
Trump got four student deferments while he was enrolled at Fordham University in New York and then as a transfer student at Penn. As a student at New York Military Academy and in college, he was an active athlete, playing baseball, basketball, golf and football. He was 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, lean and strong. He described himself as "the best baseball player in New York."
After he graduated from the Wharton School at Penn in spring 1968, he was reclassified 1-A - prime eligibility for the draft. He had an Armed Forces physical in September; records of that exam show only that he was declared "DISQ" for "disqualified."
During the 2016 campaign, when Trump was asked what had held him back from serving, he said he could not recall which heel had the spur.
"You'll have to look it up," he told reporters. His campaign later issued a statement saying it was both heels. On the draft registration card he filled out in 1964, Trump listed his only "obvious physical characteristic" that might aid in identifying his body as "birthmark on both heels."
Trump acknowledged during the 2016 campaign that he got out of the draft by providing Selective Service officials with "a very strong letter on the heels."
The New York Times reported last year that the Queens podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with bone spurs did so as a favor to the doctor's landlord - the president's father, real estate magnate Fred Trump.
In 2016, Trump's campaign said his medical deferment was temporary and when his name was entered into the draft lottery in 1969, he drew a 356 out of 365, making it exceedingly unlikely that he would be drafted.
In 1998, Trump said on Howard Stern's radio show that sex in the 1980s New York dating scene was his version of Vietnam.
"It is a dangerous world out there," he said. "It's like Vietnam. It's my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier."

Madonna trashes New York Times profile, defends using the term 'raped'

Texto completo: Madonna is speaking out strongly against a new profile about her published in the New York Times Magazine, claiming that the publication "Is one of the founding fathers of the Patriarchy. "
Titled "Madonna at Sixty," Wednesday's Times profile was written by Vanessa Grigoriadis, a journalist and the author of a 2017 book examining sexual assault on college campuses, "Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power, and Consent on Campus. "
One of the most eye-popping quotes in the story comes when Madonna tells Grigoriadis that she "felt raped" when her 2015 album "Rebel Heart" leaked online before its release date. Grigoriadis goes on to question the 60-year-old star's word choice, writing, "It didn’t feel right to explain that women these days were trying not to use that word metaphorically. "
In an Instagram post Thursday, Madonna stood by her words, claiming that her own experiences with sexual assault qualified her use of the wording.
"To say that I was disappointed in the article would be an understatement - It seems. You cant fix society And its endless need to diminish, Disparage or degrade that which they know is good," she wrote in the caption. "Especially (strong) independent women. "
Madonna lamented how she spent "days and hours and months" with Grigoriadis and regretted giving the journalist access to her intimate world "which many people dont get to see. "
"Im sorry i spent 5 minutes with her," she wrote about Grigoriadis. "It makes me feel raped. And yes I’m allowed to use that analogy having been raped at the age of 19. "
The 60-year-old pop superstar ripped the writer saying she focused the piece on "trivial and superficial matters such as the ethnicity of my stand in or the fabric of my curtains and never ending comments about my age which would never have been mentioned had I been a MAN!"
"Women have a really hard time being the champions of other women even if. they are posing as intellectual feminists. "
Madonna ended her Instagram post by declaring "DEATH TO THE PATRIARCHY" and vowing to continue fighting for women.
The majority of Grigoriadis' profile is sympathetic towards the star, as she writes, "It was depressing that the younger generation didn’t seem to have an understanding of the way Madonna had used her iron will to forge a particular type of highly autobiographical, uber-empowered, hypersexualized female pop star who became the dominant model of femininity across the nation. Without Madonna, we don’t have Britney Spears, Lady Gaga and maybe even Janelle Monae. "
The Times profile previews the release of Madonna's 14th album "Madame X," out June 14.

Texto completo: Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson, business mogul from England, founder of multinational conglomerate Virgin Group, with a net worth of $4 billion (give or take), has a question for South Dakotans:
Why won't you get on my boat?
No, it is not a joke. Representatives from Branson contacted reporters at the Argus Leader on Wednesday to let them know Branson would be calling out the state's residents via billboards across the state and in a "open letter" advertisement in the New York Times on Thursday.
Branson's Virgin Voyages is launching a new cruise ship next year it has dubbed the Scarlet Lady. Reportedly passengers from 49 states have signed up, but not anyone from South Dakota.
Branson's reps shared photos of cheeky billboards in Rapid City and Sioux Falls ("Sioux...Ya gonna book or what?") asking the state's residents to, quite literally, get on board.
"Ahoy South Dakota – Richard Branson here. Where are you?" This was the opening line in Branson's advertisement in the New York Times.
"We hope to sea you soon," Branson concluded.
There is a perk for the first South Dakotan to sign up, his reps said. That person will get a prize package that includes plane tickets, a hotel stay, a limo ride to the ship and $605 in "Sailor Loot" for use on board the cruise ship.
There was no word as of Friday whether Branson's gambit to woo South Dakota has resulted in him booking another passenger.

Colts knew of Okereke's assault allegation

Texto completo: The Indianapolis Colts reviewed a Title IX case of alleged sexual assault involving 2019 draft pick Bobby Okereke during his time at Stanford, and citing the fact that Okereke was never charged by the university or authorities, felt comfortable taking him 89th overall in April.
It was Okereke who initially made the team aware of the alleged incident during an interview at the Senior Bowl in late January. Okereke, practicing with the Colts on Wednesday, was not available to comment.
"He was very honest about his side of the story and what occurred," GM Chris Ballard said Wednesday.
The team vetted Okereke's background further, interviewing him at length about the incident as well as several sources from Stanford. The Colts also reviewed the Title IX investigation, but, citing the fact that no charges were ever filed, and no discipline was ever brought by the university, did not speak with the complainant.
"We talked it through, and look, at the end of the day, it falls on me," Ballard said. "I've been fortunate here that (coach) Frank (Reich) and (team owner) Mr. Irsay have great trust in our process and what we do. Ultimately, this falls on me, whether we're right or wrong at the end of the day."
Ballard did say that Irsay was made aware of the allegation before the Colts drafted Okereke. He also added that the Colts did not divulge the information publicly because Okereke was never charged.
According to The Fountain Hopper, an independent student-run website at Stanford University, Okereke was found guilty of sexual assault for a February 2015 incident by a majority of Title IX panelists at the school; the New York Times reported in 2016 that the board voted 3-2 on two occasions in favor of the complainant, but because Stanford required at least a 4-1 decision, Okereke was exonerated and allowed to continue as a member of the Cardinal football team.
The complainant's appeal for a third hearing, according to The Times, was denied.
Stanford was empowered to handle the case internally by Title IX, and the U.S. Education Department's interpretation of the law, which requires universities to carry out investigations of alleged sex crimes on campus. The woman, according to The Times, declined to file formal charges with the police, hoping to avoid the trauma of a legal investigation.
Therefore, Okereke was never charged and never convicted.
Both Fountain Hopper and The Times also reported that the woman, angry at the decision, later left the school to avoid the player. Stanford has since changed its policy regarding alleged sex crimes on campus, and now only requires a unanimous three-person vote.
Calling the situation a "he said, she said incident," Ballard added that, "I don't want to sit here and act like we don't have sympathy for both sides. It happened four years ago, and because there were no charges and no disciplinary action taken by the university, and because of his track record since, we felt comfortable drafting him."
After grabbing Okereke 89th overall in April, the Colts raved about his character. Okereke, an Eagle Scout, was a team captain at Stanford as a senior and was named the Watkins Award winner in 2014, given to the top African-American high school football player in the country for excellence on and off the field. At Stanford, he majored in management, science and engineering with a track in finance and decision-analysis, and also spent a summer interning for former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, assisting in a program that aided underprivileged children.
"Really great kid," the Colts' area scout who tracked Okereke, Chris McGaha, said after the draft. "Personality-wise, just a solid kid ... gonna look you in the eye when you talk to him. Stanford through and through. He's awesome."
Okereke is not expected to be investigated by the NFL; since the incident occurred years before he entered the league, it is not subject to the commissioner's personal conduct policy.

Texto completo: A small group of organizers say they're gearing up to host what they've dubbed the “Straight Pride Parade" through Boston this summer, a claim that has set off a visceral reaction nationwide and drawn criticism on social media from the likes of actor Chris Evans and many others as Pride Month gets underway.
But as reports made the rounds on social media Tuesday, landing the“Straight Pride Parade" among the tops trends on Twitter, the city clarified that the proposal isn't exactly set in stone.
While the group has filed a permit application to put together the August parade, the needed permits for such an event have not yet been secured, officials said.
So — is this thing actually happening? Here's what we know so far:
OK, what's this alleged “Straight Pride Parade" all about?
News of the event seems to have stemmed from a tweet this week from Carolyn Ryan, assistant managing editor at the New York Times.
On Tuesday morning, Ryan shared a screenshot of a Facebook post by one of the proposed event's organizers, which detailed the parade route and claimed the city “is now working with us on the parade."
“'Straight Pride' parade planned in Boston. With floats," Ryan tweeted.
According to the screenshot of the Facebook announcement, the so-called Straight Pride Parade would tentatively take place on Aug. 31 — a prime move-in day for returning students, mind you — and follow the same route of the city's annualLGBTQ Pride Parade that's happening in Boston this weekend.
The event celebrating heterosexuality would include floats and other props and be a “chance to have a patriotic parade in Boston as we celebrate straight pride," one of the organizers said.
According to a “public event permit" filed with the city, organizers say they expect up to 2,000 people to attend. Twenty security personnel would be on hand, the application states, and there would be dancing, live music, and amplified sound.
Who's behind the plan to host the “Straight Pride Parade"?
One of the lead organizers pushing for the parade is Mark Sahady. If that name sounds familiar, it's because he's the same person from the controversial Resist Marxism group, which hosted the Rally for the Republic on Boston Common in 2017 that attracted swarms of counterprotesters.
Sahady posted last week on Facebook that it looks like the proposed parade “will happen," but his announcement didn't get much traction on social media until Tuesday.
A group called Super Happy Fun America — of which Sahady is apparently the vice president — is taking ownership of the parade plans.
In a section on the group's website about the proposed parade, organizers say the one-day event will “be held to achieve inclusivity and spread awareness of issues impacting straights in Greater Boston and beyond."
The Globe reached out to Sahady, but did not immediately receive a request for comment. An e-mail sent to an address for him that's listed on the group's website bounced back.
However, John Hugo, who bills himself as the president of Super Happy Fun America, told the Globe Wednesday that his group is “not anti-gay, we're pro-straight."
“We're for traditional American values, and there's nothing wrong with that," said Hugo, who ran as a Republican for the state's Fifth Congressional District in November, but lost to Democratic incumbent Katherine Clark.
Where does the city stand on the issue?
According to officials from Mayor Martin J. Walsh's office, the group planning the “Straight Pride Parade" has been in contact with the city.
Despite some people claiming online that it's “official," organizers have yet to receive the necessary permits to hold a parade, the city said. Like any other group, they need to go through the permitting process.
As for Walsh, at first he didn't directly address the parade, and instead issued a statement Tuesday about the city's annual Pride Parade and Pride Week celebrations.
“Every year Boston hosts our annual Pride Week, where our city comes together to celebrate the diversity, strength, and acceptance of our LGBTQ community," Walsh said. “This is a special week that represents Boston's values of love and inclusion, which are unwavering. I encourage everyone to join us in celebration this Saturday for the Pride Parade and in the fight for progress and equality for all."
On Wednesday, however, as pushback about the event continued to build, Walsh told reporters that the issues and controversy it's created ahead of Saturday's Pride Parade “is unfortunate."
Walsh said he was at a lighting ceremony in the South End Tuesday, for Pride, when he told people “'don't even worry about it, there will probably be 10 people at the parade, if he has one."'
“I'm not going to focus on it," Walsh added. “Probably the most I'm ever going to say about it is what I said right now."
What's next?
For now, it's wait-and-see.
To hold a public event, applicants may need to get permitted through several departments, according to the city's website. Currently, they're still going through the process with the city, officials said.
But Hugo maintains that if the city denies them a permit, the group will file a lawsuit and hold the march.
“We're going to have to see where this goes. We don't want to," he said of potentially suing the city. “We're not looking for a payday. We just want to have a peaceful, one-day event."
Walsh admitted Wednesday at a public event that “You can't really stop a permit, it's very difficult to stop a permit."

Texto completo: is taking on the controversial Central park Five case for her latest Netflix project. The miniseries "When They See Us," explores the explosive moment five young boys of color who were accused of brutally assaulting and raping a while woman in New York City in 1989
The crime divided the city and sparked real estate mogul Donald Trump to proclaim through racially charged rhetoric that the boys were guilty. As it turned out, he was wrong. And so was everyone else who accused Raymond Santana, 14; Kevin Richardson, 15; Antron McCray, 15; Yusef Salaam, 15 and 16-year-old Korey Wise.
Trump's comments about the Central Park Five is spotlighted in "When They See Us," out Friday. DuVernay opted not to hire an actor to play Trump. Instead, she used authentic media coverage of the hysteria surrounding the case, which appears throughout the four-episode project.
Trump even paid $85,000 for four full-page ads in several newspapers in NYC, demanding the execution of the five teens.
On Monday, Trump appeared to applaud himself for his criminal justice reform efforts., specifically the First Step Act he signed at the end of 201. He then slammed candidates associated with the 1994 Crime Bill, namely Joe Biden, who is running for president in the 2C20 election.
"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected," Trump asserts. "In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!"
DuVernay was quick to point out his hypocrisy, by noting that the reason the 1994 bill was enacted was because of the actions of folks like Trump who waged war on Black and Brown men.
"The story people know is the lie that you fed them," DuVernay replied to Trump on Twitter. "Your violent rhetoric fed tensions that led to the bill you pretend to distance yourself from. But you can't hide from what you did to The Central Park Five. They were innocent. And they will have the last word."
DuVernay included a clip from her new mini-series that shows real news footage of Trump telling NBC reporter Bryant Gumbel that he would "love to be a well-educated Black."
Trump's ads about the Central Park Five appeared in the New York Times, New York Daily News, New York Post and New York Newsday - with the bold headline, "BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY BRING BACK OUR POLICE."

Texto completo: A federal judge denied a defense motion to dismiss three felony charges against Scott Warren, a humanitarian aid volunteer, after prosecutors finished presenting all their witnesses and evidence in trial on Tuesday.
Human decency can get you jailed
By Laurie Roberts
Is there any room in President Donald Trump's America for people to act like human beings? Or are we now to do unto others only if we first determine that those others have proper documentation?
Jurors in Pima County will answer those questions later this month as they determine the fate of a 37-year-old Arizona man caught helping a pair of migrants.
For his crimes — basically offering food, water and shelter and later pointing to some mountains — Scott Warren could be facing 20 years in prison.
This, in America.
Warren's trial, which got underway last week in U. S. District Court in Tucson, is capturing nationwide attention, as it should.
Talker: Joe Biden's climate plan hinges on a lazy governing tactic
It says something, I think, about who we are. Or perhaps who we are becoming.
Warren is a longtime volunteer with No More Deaths, a ministry of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Tucson.
He contends that he arrived at “the Barn,” a ramshackle house on the outskirts of Ajo, Arizona, that is used as a staging area by the nonprofit, to find two Central American migrants. They were thirsty and hungry, he said, and one of them had blisters on his feet from two days of walking through the desert. So he gave them food and water and a place to stay and called a doctor, who advised they should rest for a few days and be watched for signs of dehydration.
Various volunteers would be in and out of the house over the next few days, seeing to the men's needs. Warren was there again on the third day, when the Border Patrol was watching the place.
Border Patrol agents testified they saw Warren emerge from the house with the two migrants, pointing toward mountains north of town. They took that to mean Warren was showing them how to avoid a Border Patrol checkpoint on state Route 85.
The officers, who said they staked out the place after receiving reports that migrants were in the area, arrested the two for crossing into the country illegally. Then they arrested Warren for helping them.
He was charged with one count of conspiracy to transport and harbor the men and two counts of harboring undocumented immigrants.
His arrest, by the way, came just hours after No More Deaths released a video showing Border Patrol agents destroying water jugs in the desert.
Mere coincidence, I'm sure.
Warren’s attorney, Greg Kuykendall, told jurors last week that his client knows where the line is between legal and illegal behavior and "never gave them anything besides basic human kindness. "
"Scott is a law-abiding, life-giving good Samaritan," he said.
Prosecutors see it more as a felonious behavior.
It’ll be up to a jury to decide whether Scott Warren crossed the line by providing two men with food, water and shelter.
Whatever the motive, it seems clear that amnesty is over.
Amnesty, that is, for church-going people who are following their conscience and lending a hand to their fellow man.
In today's America, good Samaritans rate 20 years in the slammer.
Laurie Roberts is a columnist at The Arizona Republic, where this column first appeared. You can follow her on Twitter: @LaurieRoberts.
What others are saying
Scott Warren, The Washington Post: "My case in particular may set a dangerous precedent, as the government expands its definitions of 'transportation' and 'harboring. ' The smuggling and harboring laws have always been applied selectively: with aggressive prosecutions of 'criminal' networks but leniency for big agriculture and other politically powerful industries that employ scores of undocumented laborers. Now, the law may be applied to not only humanitarian aid workers but also to the millions of mixed-status families in the United States. "
No More Deaths, statement: "The prosecution of humanitarian aid workers is an escalation in the government’s war on undocumented people. Ultimately, we here at No More Deaths are fighting for a world in which our organization no longer exists because there will no longer be people dying in our backyards from murderous border policies. The government is fighting for a world in which we no longer exist because it has become criminal activity to provide care for migrants.
Leah Varjacques and Jessia Ma, The New York Times: "The strategy was for Border Patrol to concentrate its resources — agents, technology and fencing — at the most heavily crossed points. Tighter security at those urban points would shift migrant traffic into remote areas where migrants would not only be easier to spot but also be forced to traverse terrain so brutal that they would simply stop trying. The strategy document was explicit about the dangers these remote areas posed to migrants. A follow-up report even listed 'death of aliens' as an indicator of the plan’s effectiveness. "
What our readers are saying
Scott Warren's case shows the distancing of real Christian values that America is showing lately. We are not great again; we are becoming deplorable again.
— Gregory Navazo
I don't disagree with Warren offering border crossers food and water, but hiding them out and helping them avoid immigration laws is wrong. The vetting process is put there for a reason. He could have helped them become citizens, but helped them become fugitives, instead. There should definitely be consequences for these actions.
— Cecilia Edwards
This guy was helping two undocumented immigrants with food, water and shelter. I guess those who help undocumented immigrants by giving them jobs should also face the legal system, right?
— Claudia Vanessa
I'm pretty sure these laws at the U. S. -Mexico border were there before President Donald Trump got into office. Headlines of this story should read: Trump administration is enforcing the laws Congress created.

Texto completo: Dog owners are about four times more likely than other people to meet today’s physical activity guidelines, according to a large-scale new study of dogs and exercise.
The study, which involved hundreds of British households, suggests that having a dog can strongly influence how much people exercise. But it also raises questions about why some dog owners never walk their pets or otherwise work out and whether any of us should acquire a dog just to encourage us to move.
Most people who live with dogs, including me, are familiar with their joy at ambling along paths, trails and sidewalks. We also have to deal with their jowly dejection when our work deadlines or other issues interfere with walks.
Few of us would be surprised that past studies have found links between dog ownership and frequent walking. But many of those studies have been small and relied solely on people’s sometimes-unreliable recall of their exercise routines. They also have not looked at whether walking a dog might displace other kinds of physical activity, which would mean that dog owners were not exercising more, in total, than other people; only that they were exercising more often with a dog.
Those issues prompted exercise scientists from the University of Liverpool and other institutions to undertake one of the most comprehensive comparisons yet of how often, whether and in what ways dog owners and their dog-less neighbors exercise.
So, for the new study, published in April in Scientific Reports, they first turned to a neighborhood near Liverpool and began asking families in the area about their lives and pets. The researchers focused on a single community, so that everyone involved should share approximately the same local environment with similar access to sidewalks, parks or other amenities that might affect their exercise routines.
They wound up with almost 700 participants from 385 neighboring households, half of them women and most middle-aged, although about 70 children also participated. About a third of these people owned a dog.
The scientists asked everyone in these households, including the children, to complete lengthy questionnaires about how much and in what ways they moved each week. They also provided activity monitors to a few of the families and asked the members to wear them for a week while exercising as usual.
Then they collected and compared data.
It was immediately apparent that people who owned dogs walked far more often than those without dogs, said Carri Westgarth, lecturer in human-animal interaction at the University of Liverpool, who led the new study.
In general, according to both the questionnaires and activity monitors, most dog owners spent close to 300 minutes each week walking with their dogs, which was about 200 more minutes of walking per week than people without dogs.
Due primarily to these walks, most dog owners met or exceeded the standard guidelines for exercising for health, which call for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise every week.
More unexpected, dog owners also spent slightly more time than other people jogging, cycling and visiting the gym solo, without their dogs, indicating that walking Fido had not bumped other activities from their lives.
The influence of dogs extended also to the young, the scientists found. Children whose families owned dogs walked for about 100 minutes each week and played and romped with their pets for another 200 minutes, making them substantially more active than children in homes without dogs.
At the same time, though, and to the puzzlement of the researchers, a small portion of dog owners never walked their dogs, and those owners almost all were young, healthy and female.
Taken as a whole, the results suggest that people with dogs are more physically active than those without, Westgarth says.
But the findings also show that dog owners can remain sedentary and their reasons should be investigated, she said. The women in this study who did not walk their pets might have worried about controlling their animals or their safety on the streets, or they might simply have disliked walking.
Such concerns need to be acknowledged, understood and addressed if having a dog is to be promoted as a way of increasing exercise, she said.
Of course, this kind of observational study cannot tell us whether dog ownership actually causes people to move more, or if active people also own dogs. The study also did not account for differences in pets’ sizes, breeds, temperament or training and whether those affect owners’ willingness to walk, although the researchers plan to look at those issues in future studies.

Pastor says aim was not 'to endorse' president

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — When David Platt concluded his sermon Sunday during an afternoon service at McLean Bible Church in suburban Virginia, he thought he would have a few minutes to himself for quiet reflection.
Instead, he was whisked backstage and given a message: "the president of the United States was on his way to the church, would be there in a matter of minutes, and would like for us to pray for him."
Unlike other pastors who have fiercely supported President Trump, Platt, known for his nonpartisan approach to preaching, found himself facing a tough decision.
After ultimately choosing to bring Trump onstage and fulfill the president's request, Platt felt he owed his congregation a lengthy explanation for his reasoning, even acknowledging that "some within our church . . . are hurt that I made this decision."
In a detailed letter posted on the nondenominational megachurch's website Sunday evening and shared by Platt to social media on Monday, the pastor wrote, "My aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies, or his party, but to obey God's command to pray for our president and other leaders . . ."
The letter, which was addressed to Platt's "church family," comes at a time when evangelicals across the nation are becoming increasingly divided over supporting a president whose personal actions and policies, some critics say, fail to align with Christianity's core beliefs.
Platt, who has been a pastor at McLean Bible Church for two years, is best known for authoring the New York Times best-selling book, "Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream," in which he calls out materialism.
On Sunday, Trump caught Platt, churchgoers, and reporters by surprise when he made the unscheduled 15-minute stop on his way back to the White House after spending the morning at Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Va.

Trump firm faces tax evasion allegations in Panama
NEW YORK — The majority owner of a former Trump-branded hotel in Panama alleged in a court filing on Monday that the president's company misrepresented finances of the building to evade taxes in the country. A filing in New York federal court by property owner Orestes Fintiklis alleges that President Trump's hotel management firm evaded income and Social Security taxes when it managed the former Trump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower. The new accusations are part of a bitter dispute between Trump's company and Fintiklis, the majority owner of the 70-story, seaside, sail-shaped building.
The filing said Trump's company misrepresented salaries paid to employees and other financial records to cut its tax bill on fees it was collecting for managing the hotel, slash its Social Security payments and hand over less to owner Fintiklis. The Trump Organization said that it did not evade any taxes and, if anything, Fintiklis is to blame on tax matters.
The dispute started in October 2017 after Fintiklis' company, Ithaca Capital Group, took control of 202 of the hotel's condos. Fintiklis then pushed to terminate Trump's 20-year contract managing the building, alleging "gross negligence and potentially fraudulent conduct," including "looted" bank accounts.

New ICE chief looking to increase family deportations
WASHINGTON — The new top immigration official signaled Tuesday his agency is looking to step up deportations of families who are in the United States illegally, actions that would likely run into logistical hurdles and face strong public opposition.
Mark Morgan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency would continue to prioritize deportations of people who have criminal histories, but that no one should be exempt from enforcement. "That will include families," he said to ICE officials and reporters.

Texto completo: A small group of organizers say they're gearing up to host what they've dubbed the “Straight Pride Parade" through Boston this summer, a claim that has set off a visceral reaction nationwide and drawn criticism on social media from the likes of Chris Evans and many others as Pride Month gets underway.
But as reports made the rounds on social media Tuesday, landing the “Straight Pride Parade" among the top trends on Twitter, the city clarified that the proposal isn't exactly set in stone.
While the group has filed a permit application to put together the August parade, the needed permits for such an event have not yet been secured, officials said.
So — is this thing actually happening? Here's what we know so far:
Ok, what's this alleged “Straight Pride Parade" all about?
News of the event seems to have stemmed from a tweet this week from Carolyn Ryan, assistant managing editor at the New York Times.
On Tuesday morning, Ryan shared a screenshot of a Facebook post by one of the proposed event's organizers, which detailed the parade route and claimed the city “is now working with us on the parade."
“'Straight Pride' parade planned in Boston. With floats," Ryan tweeted.
According to the screenshot of the Facebook announcement, the so-called Straight Pride Parade would tentatively take place on Aug. 31 — a prime move-in day for returning students, mind you — and follow the same route of the city's annual LGBTQ Pride Parade that's happening in Boston this weekend.
The event celebrating heterosexuality would include floats and other props and be a “chance to have a patriotic parade in Boston as we celebrate straight pride," one of the organizers said.
According to a “public event permit" filed with the city, organizers say they expect up to 2,000 people to attend. Twenty security personnel would be on hand, the application states, and there would be dancing, live music, and amplified sound.
Who's behind the plan to host the “Straight Pride Parade"?
One of the lead organizers pushing for the parade is Mark Sahady. If that name sounds familiar, it's because he's the same person from the controversial Resist Marxism group, which hosted the Rally for the Republic on Boston Common in 2017 that attracted swarms of counterprotesters.
Sahady posted last week on Facebook that it looks like the proposed parade “will happen," but his announcement didn't get much traction on social media until Tuesday.
A group called Super Happy Fun America — of which Sahady is apparently the vice president — is taking ownership of the parade plans.
In a section on the group's website about the proposed parade, organizers say the one-day event will “be held to achieve inclusivity and spread awareness of issues impacting straights in Greater Boston and beyond."
The Globe reached out to Sahady, but did not immediately receive a request for comment. An e-mail sent to an address for him that's listed on the group's website bounced back.
However, John Hugo, who bills himself as the president of Super Happy Fun America, told the Globe Wednesday that his group is “not anti-gay, we're pro-straight."
“We're for traditional American values, and there's nothing wrong with that," said Hugo, who ran as a Republican for the state's Fifth Congressional District in November, but lost to Democratic incumbent Katherine Clark.
Where does the city stand on the issue?
According to officials from Mayor Martin J. Walsh's office, the group planning the “Straight Pride Parade" has been in contact with the city.
Despite some people claiming online that it's “official," organizers have yet to receive the necessary permits to hold a parade, the city said. Like any other group, they need to go through the permitting process.
As for Walsh, at first he didn't directly address the parade, and instead issued a statement Tuesday about the city's annual Pride Parade and Pride Week celebrations.
“Every year Boston hosts our annual Pride Week, where our city comes together to celebrate the diversity, strength, and acceptance of our LGBTQ community," Walsh said. “This is a special week that represents Boston's values of love and inclusion, which are unwavering. I encourage everyone to join us in celebration this Saturday for the Pride Parade and in the fight for progress and equality for all."
On Wednesday, however, as pushback about the event continued to build, Walsh told reporters that the issues and controversy it has created ahead of Saturday's Pride Parade “is unfortunate."
Walsh said he was at a lighting ceremony in the South End Tuesday, for Pride, when he told people “'don't even worry about it, there will probably be 10 people at the parade, if he has one."'
“I'm not going to focus on it," Walsh added. “Probably the most I'm ever going to say about it is what I said right now."
What's next?
For now, it's wait-and-see.
To hold a public event, applicants may need to get permitted through several departments, according to the city's website. Currently, they're still going through the process with the city, officials said.
But Hugo maintains that if the city denies them a permit, the group will file a lawsuit and hold the march.
“We're going to have to see where this goes. We don't want to," he said of potentially suing the city. “We're not looking for a payday. We just want to have a peaceful, one-day event."
Walsh admitted Wednesday at a public event that “You can't really stop a permit, it's very difficult to stop a permit."
What are people saying about the “Straight Pride Parade"?
The idea of a parade of people walking through the streets of Boston to celebrate being straight set off a flurry of jokes online as the national media picked up on the proposal.
By Tuesday evening, everyone from George Takei to US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were weighing in on it, with many making light of what a Straight Pride Parade would actually look like if it happened.
“Will 'Straight Pride' be a Freaky Friday type situation where all of our history books, movies, stories, media, news, etc feature mostly LGBTQ+ people & perspectives? Will people have to come out as straight?," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “What would folks march in? Socks w/ sandals on? Dad jeans?"
Others posted a tongue-and-cheek parade route that would lead the group into the harbor — instead of through Boston's neighborhoods — or pointed out that every day is essentially “Straight Pride" day.
Among the critics of the parade plans was actor Chris Evans (aka Captain America), who issued a scathing rebuke of event organizers on Twitter.
What's more, the late-90s rock group Smash Mouth even had a take on the plan. The band issued a statement on Twitter Tuesday that garnered significant praise for its generous use of exclamation points and a bit of profanity.
For his part, Hugo, one of the main organizers, said he thought it was “really funny" that Hollywood actors have been attacking him and his organization, adding that one of the members of his group is gay.

Texto completo: BOSTON – June is Pride Month, a time to celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer history.
A group in Boston sparked outrage by announcing plans to host a “Straight Pride Parade" this summer, although it's unclear whether the city will allow the event.
Mark Sahady, vice president of Super Happy Fun America, a group organized by three men who claim to advocate “on behalf of the straight community,” announced that the parade is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 31. Sahady included a proposed parade route that mirrors the path of the LGBT Pride Parade set for Saturday.
“We will have the streets closed and be allowed floats and vehicles,” Sahady wrote in a Facebook post. “This is our chance to have a patriotic parade in Boston as we celebrate straight pride. ”
Sahady said that he filed a discrimination complaint with the city and that officials are working with the group on the event. City officials confirmed the group contacted them, but it hasn't received the permits required to host a parade.
'Straight pride is every day': Why we have LGBTQ Pride and not 'Straight Pride'
Pride Month: Why is LGBT Pride Month in June?
Boston, known for its liberal politics, is a historically LGBT-friendly city, and Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2004.
Sahady, a member of the right-wing group Resist Marxism, has organized several controversial demonstrations, Boston magazine reported, including a Rally for the Republic in 2017 that drew less than 100 right-wing demonstrators and a pro-gun protest in response to the March for Our Lives in 2018.
Super Happy Fun America's president is John Hugo, a Republican candidate for Massachusetts' 5th Congressional District in 2018. He lost to U. S. Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass. , by 76%-24%, for the suburban Boston seat.
The group says on its website that Brad Pitt is its mascot, calling him "a hero to straight men all around the world. " Hugo is quoted as calling straight people an "oppressed majority. "
"We will fight for the right of straights everywhere to express pride in themselves without fear of judgement and hate," he said.
Organizers said they are "committed to creating spaces for people of all identities to embrace the vibrancy of the straight community. "
This year, the group applied for permits to raise the "straight pride flag" outside Boston City Hall, but organizers said they were denied in April.
Their announcement about a parade drew ridicule on social media after New York Times assistant managing editor Carolyn Ryan tweeted about the event.
Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, issued a statement in support of the city’s LGBT community and its coming Pride Month events when asked whether he supports the "Straight Pride" Parade being able to take place.
“Every year, Boston hosts our annual Pride Week, where our city comes together to celebrate the diversity, strength and acceptance of our LGBTQ community,” Walsh said. “This is a special week that represents Boston’s values of love and inclusion, which are unwavering. I encourage everyone to join us in celebration this Saturday for the Pride Parade and in the fight for progress and equality for all. ”

Stepping out

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences on a more personal level.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing. It captures all of the different emotions.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better, elevate and make the best show possible for these audiences.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Texto completo: MIAMI - The Florida deputy who knew a gunman was loose at the Parkland high school but refused to go inside to confront the assailant was arrested Tuesday on 11 criminal charges related to his inaction during the massacre that killed 17 people.
Scot Peterson was on duty as the resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on the day of the February 2018 shooting but never entered the building while bullets flew. He was charged with child neglect, culpable negligence and perjury - allegations that carry a maximum prison sentence of nearly 100 years.
Mr. Peterson was seen on surveillance video rushing with two staff members toward the building where the shooting happened. When they arrived, he pulled his weapon and went forward but then retreated and took up a position outside, where he stood with his gun drawn.
Mr. Peterson, 56, was jailed on $102,000 bail. His lawyer, Joseph DiRuzzo III, said in a statement that Mr. Peterson is merely a scapegoat.
Manafort to Rikers?
NEW YORK - Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, who is already behind bars in Pennsylvania on a federal conviction, is close to being transferred into custody in New York City to face state fraud charges, two people familiar with the matter said Tuesday.
Manafort could be arraigned on the state charges as early as next week and then begin a stay at the city's notorious jail complex on Rikers Island until the case is resolved, the people said.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. made a request for his office to pick up Manafort at the federal lockup using a law providing for the transfer of prisoners under indictment in another jurisdiction, they added.
The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the case. The transfer request was first reported Tuesday by The New York Times.
Governor denies parole
Leslie Van Houten, a Charles Manson follower convicted in a 1969 killing spree, was denied parole for the third time in three years Monday.
The California parole board in January recommended parole for Van Houten. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a parole release review that despite Van Houten's productive time in prison - she earned bachelor's and master's degrees and completed "extensive" self-help programming - the negative factors of her involvement in the murders outweighed the positive factors.
Van Houten, 69, was 19 years old when she met Charles Manson and became part of his murderous cult that came to be called the "Manson Family," according to parole documents.
On Aug. 10, 1969, she and other members of the Manson Family stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death at their home in Los Angeles.
Maine suicide bill passes
AUGUSTA, Maine - The Maine Legislature voted Tuesday to legalize assisted suicide, with supporters declaring it in line with the state's tradition of individualism and opponents insisting the practice tempts fate.
The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who has 10 days to act on the bill and has not indicated whether she will let it become law.
The proposal had failed once in a statewide vote and at least seven previous times in the Legislature.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Following a report by the Daily Caller that the Biden campaign website appeared to have plagiarized passages in its newly released climate policy proposal from advocacy groups, the U. S. government, and a river conservation nonprofit, Joe Biden's campaign website has added attribution for several statements relating to climate change.
On Tuesday morning, the Biden campaign released an ambitious 22-page climate plan that pledged to go "beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform" on climate.
"As President, I will lead America — and the world — not only to confront the crisis in front of us — but to seize the opportunity it presents," said Biden in a video released along with the plan.
After the release of the climate plan, the campaign was hit with allegations that it had plagiarized some of the talking points in a 22-page document. And late Tuesday afternoon, the campaign sought to clear up the matter, issuing a statement that said several citations in its plan "were inadvertently left out of the final version. "
Josh Nelson, Vice President of CREDO, a liberal advocacy group, tweeted Tuesday morning that Biden's climate plan looked "remarkably similar to items" published by two other climate advocacy groups, the Blue Green Alliance and the Carbon Capture Coalition.
Nelson, who has a background in environmental advocacy, told USA TODAY that the language in the sections on carbon capture did not look like typical presidential campaign language. Instead, "It looked like the type of thing the coal industry, trade groups, and coal companies themselves say about carbon capture and sequestration," he told USA TODAY.
"So I grabbed a couple phrases of that language, and copied and pasted directly into Google," he said, and then found that sections of the proposal were the same as previously posted sources.
The Daily Caller first published a story at 1:51 p. m. on Tuesday reporting on Nelson's tweet and highlighting three other instances of "similarly phrased excerpts. "
The Biden campaign issued a statement Tuesday responding to questions of plagiarism: "Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22 page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations. "
USA TODAY has confirmed at least five instances in which the Biden campaign has updated parts of its climate change platform to add attribution. The campaign added attribution, but USA TODAY accessed thte original version of the climate proposal through the Internet WayBack machine.
The allegations of plagiarism
Biden website: "Carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) is a rapidly growing technology that has the potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide emission. "
September 26, 2017 letter from the Blue Green Alliance to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works: "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is a rapidly growing technology that has potential to create economic benefits for multiple industries while significantly reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. "
Biden website: "Biden’s goal is to make CCUS a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals. "
Carbon Capture Coalition website: "The Carbon Capture Coalition brings together energy and industrial technology companies, labor unions, and energy and environmental policy organizations. Its goal is to make carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) a widely available, cost-effective, and rapidly scalable solution to reduce carbon emissions to meet mid-century climate goals. "
Biden website: "The average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years. "
American Rivers website : "As a result, the average American sewage pipe is 33 years old, with many pipes dating back 50 or even 100 years. "
Biden website: "And 40%of the 567 federally recognized tribes in U. S. live in Alaska where the rapid pace of rising temperatures and melting sea ice and glaciers threaten the critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state. "
U. S. Climate Resilience Toolkit: "Of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States, 40 percent (229 tribes) live in Alaska Native communities. The rapid pace of rising temperatures, melting sea ice and glaciers, and thawing permafrost in Alaska is having a significant negative impact on critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods in the state. "
Joe Biden withdrew from his first campaign for president in 1987 after it was revealed that he had plagiarized lines of a debate speech from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.
At the time, New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd noted the similarities between Biden's speech and Kinnock's, observing how Biden "lifted Mr. Kinnock's closing speech with phrases, gestures and lyrical Welsh syntax intact for his own closing speech at a debate at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 23 - without crediting Mr. Kinnock.

Texto completo: Crossword puzzles expect solvers to have a good grasp of general knowledge, but sometimes certain facts just aren't in our personal wheelhouses.
That's O.K. We're here to help you solve and to help you expand those wheelhouses. Sam Ezersky
TERI (GARR, HATCHER, POLO) The name TERI frequently finds its way into the New York Times Crossword, often clued to these three actresses:
a. Teri Garr, who was nominated for an Academy Award for 1982's "Tootsie."
b. Teri Hatcher, the Bond girl in "Tomorrow Never Dies" (1997) and one of the housewives on "Desperate Housewives" (2004-12).
c. Teri Polo, who co-starred alongside Ben Stiller in 2000's "Meet the Parents" and its sequels.
Possible clues: "Actress Hatcher," "Actress Polo," "Actress Garr," "Garr of 'Tootsie'," "Actress Polo of 'Meet the Parents'," "Hatcher who was a Bond girl," "Hatcher of a 'desperate' plot?"
UMA (THURMAN) UMA Thurman (pictured above), is an actress well-known for her starring role in the Quentin Tarantino-directed "Kill Bill" films of the 2000s. Ms. Thurman was also nominated for an Oscar for playing Mia Wallace in the 1994 cult classic "Pulp Fiction."
Ms. Thurman also emerged as a prominent figure in the #MeToo movement after detailing her experiences of sexual harassment and assault by Harvey Weinstein.
In 2015, the modern rock band Fall Out Boy released the song "Uma Thurman," which charted as a top 25 Billboard hit.
Possible clues: "Actress Thurman," "Thurman of 'Pulp Fiction'," "Thurman of the 'Kill Bill' films," "Thurman of 'Even Cowgirls Get the Blues'," "'___ Thurman' (Fall Out Boy song)"
UTA (HAGEN) UTA Hagen, an acclaimed Broadway actress, starred in the 1950 Clifford Odets play "The Country Girl," as well as the 1962 premiere of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" by Edward Albee. She received Tony Awards for both performances. Ms. Hagen won an additional Tony for Lifetime Achievement in 1999.
UTA has appeared in more than 200 puzzles for The New York Times, and the full name UTA HAGEN has appeared 10 times. Occasionally, the former will be clued with respect to the Utah Jazz: UTA is the team's scoreboard abbreviation.
Possible clues: "Actress Hagen," "Tony winner Hagen," "Hagen of Broadway," "The Jazz, on scoreboards"

Texto completo: Spoiler alert: The following contains the outcome of Monday's episode of "Jeopardy!"
And that’s a wrap.
“Jeopardy!” contestant James Holzhauer lost on Monday, ending his 33-day run on the game show, during which he took home a total of $2,464,216, including $2,000 for his second-place finish to new champ Emma Boettcher. He came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings for non-tournament play.
“Nobody likes to lose,” Holzhauer said in an interview with the New York Times published Monday. “But I’m very proud of how I did, and I really exceeded my own expectations for the show. So I don’t feel bad about it. ”
In a statement released by Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, Holzhauer credited Boettcher, who "dominated her warmup games that day, and I knew she would make an extremely tough challenger. I’m proud that it took a top-level player at her absolute best to eliminate me. ” He said he "never really believed I could win 75 shows, but I definitely thought I had a great shot at Ken’s cash winnings record. ”
Holzhauer, 34, made a splash during his winning streak on the show by taking the board by storm, going for the highest-dollar questions first and hunting for Daily Doubles. Then, he bet big. The professional sports gambler from Las Vegas explained to the Times that his huge advantage on the trivia show was that he wasn’t afraid to risk his winnings.

"The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money," he said.
Except on Monday, when he didn't. Holzhauer, along with his two rivals, gave the correct response ("Who is Marlowe"?) to the clue in the category Shakespeare's Time: The line “A great reckoning in a little room” in “As You Like It” is usually taken to refer to this author’s premature death. But with $23,400 going into the round – $3,200 below Emma's total – he wagered only $1,399, a "modest (bet) for the first time," as host Alex Trebek termed it, and finished with $24,799.
Boettcher, who led going into the round, bet big, wagering $20,201, and finished the victor with $46,801. Holzhauer immediately approached her with a high-five.
Overall, it was a remarkably competitive game, as the three contestants collectively got only one incorrect response.
During his nearly seven-week run on the show, Holzhauer crossed the $1 million mark on Day 15 and the $2 million mark on Day 27, becoming only the second person in the game show's 35-year history (excluding an earlier NBC version) to reach the feat in regular-season play. He first appeared on April 4, and was absent only for a two-week Teachers Tournament that aired in mid-May. But his final episodes were taped in early April.

He also playfully teased early word of his exit on Twitter, with a reference to the "Drake Curse," a reference to the singer as bad-luck omen: "Knew I shouldn't have invited @Drake to the @Jeopardy taping. "
Computer programmer-turned-author Jennings made off with $2,520,700 over 74 games in 2004, one year after the show stopped limiting champions to five-day reigns and allowed them to compete until they lost.
Holzhauer’s financial haul is even more impressive given the pace of his winnings. He holds the top 15 daily money totals, including the one-day record of $131,127 set April 17. Jennings averaged $34,064 during his 74-game run.
In a recent Q&A with Wired, Jennings said he was "gobsmacked" by Holzhauer's hot streak.
"I thought I had seen everything on 'Jeopardy!' And this is something I would have thought was just impossible," Jennings said. "He’s maximizing money. He can make two or three times what any other player ever has with that same level of play, which again is top-shelf. He’s as good as anybody. "
But this is not the last we've seen on Holzhauer: He'll be back on the show's next tournament of champions.

Hill says he's victim of 'social media lynching'

Texto completo: State Rep. Mill Hill, R-Pensacola, is calling the bipartisan call for him to apologize for his response to a suggestion that gay people should face the death penalty during a talk to a Pensacola group by calling it a "social media lynching" on Twitter.
House Speaker Jose Oliva and Rules Chairman Chris Sprowls, both Republicans, put out a joint statement Friday condemning Hill's response to a suggestion from a member of the audience that he enact legislation that would enforce the death penalty for homosexuality.
"Such callous indifference to an outrageous question is unacceptable, runs contrary to our founding principles, and in no way reflects the beliefs of the Florida House," Oliva and Sprowls' statement said. "Representative Hill would do well to remember that the only story in the New Testament involving stoning involved Jesus putting a stop to it and saying, 'let he who is without sin cast the first stone.' I believe he owes his colleagues an apology and he owes the Republican caucus a better example of political courage."
As more condemnation poured in from other Republicans and Democrats across Florida, Hill took to Twitter to defend himself.
"Absurd to ask me to apologize for a statement that I did not make and that no one took seriously," Hill wrote on Twitter. "This is a social media lynching!"
In another Tweet, Hill said he did not remember laughing until he heard the audio recording.
"This event happened a week ago Thursday," Hill wrote on Twitter. "I laughed at the nonsense of running legislation that the gentleman in the audience suggested. And you know it. Don't join the #FakeNewsMedia."
Hill did not return the News Journal's request for comment and Friday and when reached by Twitter direct message Saturday, Hill declined to comment saying he had spoken with other media.
"Let's see if they do a fair and accurate story," Hill said. "Unlike the PNJ."
Hill spoke about the 2019 legislative session during a meeting of the Women for Responsible Legislation on May 23 when he was asked about why Rep. Alex Andrade co-sponsored the proposed Florida Competitive Workforce Act, which would bring Florida's discrimination protection for LGBTQ people in line with federal rules. Although it didn't pass, the proposal drew bipartisan support during the legislative session.
Hill responded he didn't know why Andrade or any Republican would co-sponsor such a bill, but the legislation didn't represent the values of Northwest Florida. He added that he thought being gay was a choice.
"Someone's sexual orientation, their proclivity to want to do something, that is your business," Hill said. "It's a behavior, and it's a choice. You can say I was born that way. OK, well fine, but nobody is forcing you to engage in that relationship even if you were born that way. It doesn't meet the qualifications of being a protected status."
Moments later a member of the audience spoke up.
"In 1 Corinthians, it says that a man who has an affair with another man will be put to death," a man in the audience says to Hill.
Hill responded by saying, "It says that in the Old Testament, too." Another person asked if he would introduce that legislation (to put gay people to death). The suggestion drew laughter from the room and from Hill.
"I wonder how that would go over," Hill said.
Responding on Twitter to a story from Florida Politics on Saturday afternoon, Hill said he didn't laugh at a joke about killing gays.
"Your social media lynching is despicable," Hill wrote on Twitter. "I never laughed at a joke about killing gays, and you know it. Your trash media has a history of attacking me."
The Florida Democratic Party issued a statement Friday evening calling Hill's Twitter account "a homophobic dumpster fire."
In one 2016 tweet, Hill responds to a story about the European Union reducing coal usage that has a photo of what appear to be EU leaders sitting on a stage with their legs crossed.
"They all cross their legs like they are gay," Hill wrote.
In at least two tweets, Hill says that abortion and homosexuality are a "judgement" from God.
"America is already being judged," Hill wrote in 2015. "Witness the homosexual movement and abortion."
In a 2017 tweet, Hill said that "transgender is a made up concept."
In a 2014 tweet, Hill retweeted a story about the Rose Parade being subverted to "promote gay agenda" from an account called Right Wing News.
The account was removed from Twitter this year after the New York Times reported the account's owner John Hawkins was using the account and several others on Facebook and Twitter to spread false news stories in conservative circles.
Rep. Matt Gaetz weighed in when asked about it by the News Journal following a town hall in Pensacola.
Gaetz said Hill needs to come forward publicly and clarify what happened at the meeting.
"I have not been able to hear those comments in full context," Gaetz said Saturday. "What I heard was someone ask a deeply offensive question that reflected bigotry in my mind. What I hope I heard in response was a nervous and uncomfortable laugh from Mike Hill and a sincere desire to move away from that discussion and onto a more productive discussion.
"I think it would be very helpful for Rep. Hill to clarify that in no point was he agreeing with or supporting or embracing a viewpoint that was so hate filled, but that he was uncomfortable and that he was desirous of moving on. I hope that was what he was doing, and I don't want to judge what's in someone's heart out of a 30-second clip."

Texto completo: Moments after the special counsel, Robert Mueller, wrapped up his appearance at the Justice Department on Wednesday, Rep. Dwight Evans stepped out of his district office in a Black working-class neighborhood here to visit with local business owners. They had one question on their minds: Why is President Donald Trump still in office?
Evans, a Democrat who began calling for Trump to be impeached long before Mueller issued his report, was not surprised: "The issue that I hear constantly here is, 'We sent you for one reason only: to get rid of the president, right? Why haven't you gotten rid of him yet?'"
In cities around the country, Black Democrats like Evans - and other House members who represent majority-Black districts - are hearing much the same from their constituents. Those views are translating into action on Capitol Hill, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi is under increasing pressure from her rank and file to hurry up her time frame for what many see as an inevitable impeachment inquiry.
A number of prominent African-American lawmakers, including Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the powerful chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, are leading the charge to impeach the president. On Wednesday, after Mueller declined to clear Trump, three more signed on: Reps. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who ischairman of the Homeland Security Committee, and Danny Davis and Bobby Rush of Illinois. All are veteran Democrats.
Others, mindful of Pelosi's call for caution, are pushing back on their own constituents and struggling to explain House Democrats' go-slow approach.
"It's probably safe to say that there are no Americans more ardently opposed to Trump than African Americans," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia, who argues that it is pointless to impeach Trump when the Republican-led Senate will not convict him. "There is such a huge dislike for this president that the first thing I get from them is to impeach him."
Their "ardor is so great," Norton said, that she wrote a Facebook post last month explaining the nuances of the impeachment process. She sees her Democratic colleagues getting "carried away by what their constituents are saying."
"I remind them that we impeached a Democratic president, and he was more popular than ever," she said, referring to Bill Clinton.
Here in Philadelphia, where African Americans account for about 55% of Evans' district, Trump evokes both fear and loathing in West Oak Lane, a leafy neighborhood of brick and stone houses in the northwest part of the city. This year, Evans brought Tom Steyer, the billionaire liberal activist who is pressing for impeachment, to the commercial strip of Black-owned businesses along Ogontz Avenue.
"I agreed with everything he said," exclaimed Paulette Beale-Harris, 60, who owns a florist shop, referring to Steyer. "It's time for Congress to do something. It's time for them to stop being afraid to do what has to be done for the country."
Seated in the back of the shop, Beale-Harris' mother and sister nodded in agreement. But her father, Paul Beale, 91, worried that impeaching the president would energize Trump's base and help re-elect him.
"Pelosi doesn't think it's a good idea, and I have a lot of confidence in her," Paul Beale said. "If it's going to hurt in the long run, I don't think they should do it."
Still, in one conversation after the next, the story was the same. "They've got to get him out of the way before he destroys this country," said James Gaines, 66, a barber.
Sabriya Bilal, 64, a school bus driver, asked, "I don't think he's mentally stable, do you?"
So strong is the sentiment against Trump that Art Haywood, an African-American state senator who represents this area, has introduced a resolution in the Pennsylvania General Assembly calling for the president's impeachment. Last week, he held a town hall-style meeting to rally public support; in an interview, Haywood compared House Democrats to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who sought to avoid war with Hitler.
"This appeasement policy of Nancy Pelosi is a tremendous mistake," Haywood said. "The risks to our nation are bigger than the risks to the Democratic Party."
African Americans are a critical component of the Democratic base; they make up slightly more than 13% of the population but account for nearly one-quarter of Democratic voters, according to Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. They are also an outsize force in the House Democratic caucus, which has more than 50 African Americans; there is only, one Black Republican in the House, Will Hurd of Texas.
Black voters turned out in droves to help elect Barack Obama, and younger African-American voters were part of "a huge surge group for Democrats" in the 2018 midterms, motivated by their antipathy toward the president, said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster and expert in the African American vote. A recent poll by Quinnipiac University found that 87% of African Americans disapproved of Trump's performance as president, compared with 63% of Hispanics and 48% of whites.
Their disdain goes far beyond his policies; they view him as a racist and an "existential threat," Belcher said. Many still mock his 2016 plea for their support: "What the hell do you have to lose?"
And those voters' representatives are taking up their cause - not only African-American House members like Evans but others who represent substantial Black populations, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is of Puerto Rican descent, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who is Palestinian American, and Steve Cohen of Tennessee, who is white but whose Memphis district is two-thirds Black.
Belcher said the kitchen-table issues that Pelosi likes to talk about - jobs, health care and the high cost of prescription drugs - remain more important than impeachment.
"Among activists, the chattering class, it's a real priority," Belcher said. "Among Joe Blow African American voter who does vote regularly but is not a political activist, does he want Donald Trump removed from office? Yes. Is he for impeachment? Sure he is. Is it his top priority? No."
The Congressional Black Caucus has taken no official position on impeachment; its chairwoman, Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said she was organizing a formal "educational session" for its members once they returned from Memorial Day recess next week.
Last week, another caucus member, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, introduced a resolution that would authorize the House Judiciary Committee to "investigate whether sufficient grounds exist" to open an impeachment inquiry. That is one step short of an outright call for impeachment. But last year, Jackson Lee voted in favor of an impeachment resolution introduced by another Black lawmaker, Rep. Al Green of Texas, and she said her view had not changed.
Evans, 65, who served in the state legislature for 36 years before being elected to Congress in 2016, also voted for the Green resolution; he believes Trump abused his power when he fired both Sally Yates, the acting . attorney general, and James Comey, the FBI director, early in his term.
If Black voters are passionate about getting rid of Trump, liberal whites "are even more rabid," he said. That was evident in another corner of his district, the gentrifying bohemian neighborhood of Cedar Park, where Sandy DeVito, 31, a fiction writer and barista, was shopping Wednesday for a lemon-ginger echinacea drink at a food co-op.
"The media made such a big deal of it, and Washington made such a big deal of it," she said of the Mueller report. "And then nothing happened."
Evans said the report, which detailed at least 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president, "only confirmed what I already knew." In the weeks since its release, as Trump has instructed government officials to refuse Congress' requests for witnesses and documents, Evans' outrage has only grown. And as a Black man, he takes particular umbrage at what he regards as the hypocrisy of the criminal justice system as it relates to the president.
"If anybody in this district were to see a subpoena and act the way he acts," Evans said, "they'd be in jail."

Is Trump making the Democrats moderate again?

Texto completo: Pundits have long believed that public disdain for the Trump presidency would usher in an equally radical leftist to the Oval Office. Thomas Edsall, of the New York Times, has suggested that since “Trump threw out conventional wisdom,” Democrats may be in the position to “gamble on a similar strategy.” But somehow, Trump may prove them wrong yet again. In fact, the ascent of Joe Biden shows that Trump may just be helping moderate the Democratic primary.
Commentators on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly labeled Trump the ultimate harbinger of political extremism. Like Edsall, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., in his recent book Them, calls out Trump for stoking extremism and “political tribalism.” In other words, Trump’s unapologetic radicalism will send the pendulum in the opposite direction, setting the stage for a radical socialist to make political headway in unprecedented fashion.
On the surface, there is evidence to suggest that this phenomenon is true. Recent European Union parliamentary elections have shown that the center is folding. In France, President Emmanuel Macron’s party lost to the far more conservative Marine Le Pen; in Belgium, the extremist anti-immigrant and Green parties doubled their votes, ranking among the top political parties. In the United States, we’ve seen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former New York City bartender and self-proclaimed socialist, displace the third highest ranking Democrat in the House in one of the biggest upsets of 2016.
But if Trump has delivered the death knell of moderate politics, how do we account for the success of Joe Biden, a moderate Democrat? Unlike many in the field, Biden has disavowed progressive proposals like “Medicare for all” and the “Green New Deal,” and has branded himself as a continuation of the Obama years, rather than a "lurch to the left" as have his cohorts. He’s currently polling around 35% in national polls, twice the level of support earned by socialist Sen Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the next runner-up, out of a field of 24 candidates. All this, despite sexual harassment accusations, a penchant for hair-sniffing, and more baggage than he can carry on the Amtrak. Something is working for him.
The magic word is electability. Many believe “Uncle Joe” from Scranton has sufficient rapport with middle America to steal away enough of Trump’s base. A recent poll shows that 56% of Democratic voters believe that Biden has what it takes beat Trump, as compared with 12% who believe that of Bernie Sanders, the next runner-up. Even young, radical Democrats, desperate to be rid of Trump, are willing to back old, white, un-P.C. Joe if they believe he has the best chance to win (even though they might prefer gay, women or minority candidates).
Other candidates have likewise tried to tout their ability to beat Trump, with Pete Buttigieg presenting his young, intellectual persona as a foil to Trump, while Elizabeth Warren has opted to inundate voters with unrealistic, socialist policy proposals. But none have been as successful as the proudly un-woke Biden.
Were Hillary Clinton to have won, or even a more conventional Republican, it would be difficult to imagine that someone so removed from today’s progressive culture as Biden would be leading the race. Polling suggests that far more Democrats today are open to socialism, and are concerned with identity politics, than during the Obama years. Without Trump’s looming shadow, the Democratic primary would likely center around these issues, and Biden would find himself on opposite ends from most Democratic voters on healthcare, criminal justice reform, reparations, the environment, and much more. However, in the lead-up to 2020, it seems most Democrats outside the Twitter sphere are willing to compromise on Biden if it means kicking Trump out of office.
While Joe Biden would surely perform better in places like Pennsylvania, he risks alienating the far leftists who failed to turn out for Clinton after Sanders dropped out back in 2016. It seems many Democratic primary voters are gambling that Trump is so universally despised that even the most socialist among them will be willing to turn out for the “lesser of evils.”
Only time can tell whether that cynical ploy works in their favor. But it seems that even this early on, one thing is for certain: This election is bound to be a referendum on Trump. And as long as our loud and proud tweeter in chief commands the conversation, Democrats seem willing to run anyone they believe has the best chance of taking back the White House.

Assange espionage indictment: classified hypocrisy and a prosecutorial Trojan horse

Texto completo: The May 23 Espionage Act indictment of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange evoked justified outrage and condemnation from media organizations and free speech advocates. Federal prosecutors claim in the indictment that Assange illegally received classified U.S. government information on United States military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, State Department cables involving U.S. foreign relations and the identities of human sources helping American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Carrie DeCell of the Knight Institute at Columbia University observed on Twitter that the “government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information. That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”
Masha Gessen at The New Yorker addressed an equally weighty issue when she observed, “The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist.”
I’m going to take that analogy one step further: the last thing we want is executive branch departments and agencies unilaterally and selectively asserting what should or should not be considered legitimately classified information.
The very law being used to charge Assange was passed over 100 years ago at the beginning of America’s entry into World War I. The Espionage Act of 1917 was used by the Justice Department and Postal Service to cow, investigate, shut down and even prosecute news outlets that challenged the Wilson administration’s wartime policies.
One of the most prominent targets was former Rep. Victor Berger of Wisconsin and his newspaper, the Milwaukee Leader. For publishing editorials critical of the war, Berger was charged and convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919. Though the conviction was overturned two years later, in the interim, Berger won reelection to the House twice but his colleagues refused to seat him.
In Assange’s case, he and Wikileaks did exactly what newspapers have done for decades — seek information about U.S. government policies and actions that were either questionable or outright illegal and publish information accordingly.
In 1971 for the New York Times it was the Pentagon Papers — the classified history of the Vietnam War leaked by then-RAND Corporation analyst and former Marine Corps infantry captain Daniel Ellsberg.
For the Washington Post, it was Watergate, including then-Attorney General John Mitchell’s illegal, secret surveillance slush fund used to target Democratic politicians. For Assange and his then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst accomplice, Chelsea Manning, it was about exposing U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In the Assange Espionage Act indictment, federal prosecutors specifically invoke Manning’s sharing and Assange’s receipt of classified information as also involving violations of Executive Order 13526, National Security Information, which states (Sec. 1.4(a)) that “military plans, weapons systems, or operations” are considered classified under the executive order.
But the Army officials who classified the 2007 Apache helicopter video released by Assange showing the killing of Iraqi civilians misused the classification system to conceal criminal conduct — something expressly forbidden by Sec. 1.7(a) of the very same Executive Order federal prosecutors cited in the Assange indictment.
So where are the indictments against Pentagon or CIA officials who knowingly and deliberately misused the classification system to conceal acts of torture or other war crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere? The hypocrisy and selective application of federal laws, regulations and executive orders in matters of national security is on full display in the Assange indictment. And there is another deeply troubling thing about the latest Assange indictment: the Justice Department’s attempt to criminalize the digital transfer of government information to third parties.
The 18th count against Assange focuses on alleged violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), namely that Assange (via Manning) sought to “knowingly access a computer … to obtain information that has been determined by the United States Government … to require protection against unauthorized disclosure” and to “willfully communicate, deliver, transmit, and cause to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted the same, to any person not entitled to receive it.”
The indictment also mentions three times Assange and Manning using “a cloud drop box” for the exchange of the purloined documents. In effect, prosecutors are arguing that the entire chain of digital exchanges between Wikileaks and Manning were illegal, and that the use of a “cloud storage” mechanism was a key feature of the crime.
Multiple news organizations utilize the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s encrypted SecureDrop system for receiving sensitive, including classified, documents from sources seeking to expose illegal or questionable government activities. If federal prosecutors prevail on Count 18 of the Assange indictment, it would open up every news organization in the world utilizing SecureDrop or a similar system to a CFAA prosecution — whether a whistleblower was digitally passing along Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports of immigrant abuse, Pentagon documents showing contracting irregularities, etc.
Prosecutors are attempting to overturn the Supreme Court decision in the Pentagon Papers case through a statutory Trojan Horse (the CFAA) all while deliberately ignoring the real crime in this episode — the deliberate misuse of federal classified information statutes and executive orders to conceal American government war crimes.

Texto completo: Dem presidential hopefuls flock to Calif. state party
SAN FRANCISCO - More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
Harris has a deep connection to California voters; she has won statewide office three times, once to the U.S. Senate and twice as the state's attorney general. Before that, she was elected as San Francisco's district attorney. In her remarks, she reminded the crowd of their long history together, then brought the crowd to its feet with her call for impeachment hearings for Trump.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.

Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE - U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.

Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW - Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.

Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary - A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail - subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest - but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.

In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.

Lunch with Buffett: An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million. An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night with a winning bid of $4,567,888. It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner the chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years. The winning bidder and up to seven friends get to dine with Buffett.

Texto completo: The climbing season at Mount Everest may be coming to a close, but the past few weeks have been historic for the world's tallest mountain.
Avid Everest blogger Alan Arnette wrote Thursday that one of the last known teams on the mountain turned around during their summit attempt because of bad weather.
According to the count by Arnette, a Colorado climber who summited Mount Everest on his fourth attempt in 2011 and who keeps track of its climbing seasons, more than 825 climbers and Sherpas reached the summit this year, a record-breaking number.
The number of permits from the Nepalese government also broke records this year, with 381 issued.
And deaths were at a four-year high, with 11 fatalities, most blamed on a combination of overcrowding, inexperience and poor weather limiting the number of days climbers were able to attempt to summit.
Here's a look back at the recent stories from Mount Everest:
Utah climber dies after reaching Seven Summits
Don Cash, 55, an experienced American climber, was among the first fatalities widely reported in U. S. media from this year's Everest season.
The Sandy, Utah, father collapsed and died last Wednesday as he was descending the summit, likely due to complications from altitude sickness, his family said.
More: He climbed the tallest mountain on each continent, then died as he descended Mount Everest
Cash had just completed his goal of joining the Seven Summits Club, earned when a climber reaches the top of the tallest mountain on each continent.
"The last message he sent to me personally was, 'I'm so blessed to be on the mountain I have read about for 40 years!'" his son, Tanner Cash, told "Today. "
Overcrowding atop Everest
A photo taken the same day Cash died showed what appeared to be a single line of climbers waiting to reach the summit.
Veteran climber Nirmal Purja captured the photo while descending the summit, and it quickly became the poster for the overcrowding issue this season.
"I've seen traffic, but not this crazy," Purja, who has reached the top of Everest four times, told the Washington Post.
Video on social media also appeared to show the packed peaks on the mountain.
Many other experienced climbers began to blame to growing death toll on the increased number of climbers on the mountain.
At 29,035 feet, the air atop Everest has such low oxygen levels that just being in the area near the summit, let alone climbing, proves lethal for those who cannot reach extra oxygen supplies fast enough.
'Every minute counts': Another climber dies on Everest as world's tallest peak overcrowds
Others say that it was the inexperience of many of the climbers on the cliffs this year.
"You have to qualify to do the Ironman," Arnette told The New York Times. "But you don’t have to qualify to climb the highest mountain in the world? What’s wrong with this picture?"
Government officials in Nepal, though, faulted poor weather, which narrowed the window in which reaching the summit was even possible to just a few days.
What's behind Everest's deadly season?: Overcrowding, inexperience and a long line to the top
Tourism officials said earlier this week that the country has no plans to limit the number of permits it issues next year. Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, charges $11,000 per permit and earned $300 million a year from its climbing industry.
Another American dies
Christopher Kulish, 62, a Boulder, Colorado, attorney, died Monday at a camp after summiting the mountain, his family said.
After he stood atop Everest, Kulish also joined the elusive "Seven Summit Club. "
"He saw his last sunrise from the highest peak on Earth," brother Mark Kulish said in a statement. "He passed away doing what he loved, after returning to the next camp below the peak. "
'Passed away doing what he loved': Second American dies on Mount Everest in crowded year
Kulish's death marked the 11th fatality on the mountain this year.
Mandy Moore reaches Base Camp
"This Is Us" actress Mandy Moore was also among the adventurers around Everest this year.
While she wasn't attempting a summit, Moore completed the impressive feat of hiking to Mount Everest's Base Camp, which sits 17,600 feet above sea level.
'Inner mountain girl': Mandy Moore completes trek to Mount Everest base camp amid deadly climbing season
"Breathing at altitude, for instance, is not easy," she wrote on social media. "Besides hydration and staying nourished, breathing is THE vital key in the fight against altitude sickness. It’s also a major takeaway that I will be employing back to the real world whether I’m in the midst of a tough workout or a weird day. Mind blown. "

Texto completo: Julie Brown Neu sat at her sewing machine, meticulously embroidering letters onto fabric. The finished material poured out of the other side, forming a puddle of names on the ground: Ryan Clark, Ross Alameddine, Jocelyne Couture-Nowak. They were the names of victims in the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech.
Neu had to take a breather at that point. The weight of all those interrupted lives was simply too much. She shut off her machine and walked away. But she'd be back — she had a project to complete.
For almost three years, Neu has created quilts to commemorate the victims of mass shootings in the United States, as well as “protest" quilts to call attention to the issue of gun violence. The exhibit, “Disarming: Memorial Quilts for Mass Shooting Victims," is on display at the Arlington Center for the Arts until June 10.
“It's my hope that seeing the quilts all hanging together will help sort of show the scale of the violence," Neu said. “That it will be difficult to look at 14 quilts with 309 names on them without feeling impacted by the number of people affected."
Neu, an Arlington resident, 43, began her project in the months after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. Requests spread through her quilting community for blankets to comfort the victims' families and loved ones. Neu had a different idea.
“Any time there is any sort of catastrophe, quilters start sending quilts. It's something quilters have done since the Civil War," she said. “I decided instead to make quilts for the victims of the shooting."
There are 16 pieces on display in the final exhibit. Fourteen of the quilts are part of Neu's “Victims" collection, which represents the victims of mass shootings during which 10 or more people were killed. Each block on the “Victims" quilts represents a person killed. The colors of the pieces reflect the state flag of the location where the shooting took place (except for the Virginia Tech quilt, which is outfitted in the university's colors).
“Quilts are a particularly effective medium for addressing this topic. Quilts come imbued with a very specific meaning of home and family and motherhood," Neu said. “Because they are a comfortable medium, people interact with them as art in a different way. They draw viewers in deeper."
The other two quilts in the exhibit are from Neu's “Protest" series, a collection of pieces that reflect social and political issues. One of the quilts, “Bullet Holes," has strips of fabric for each year between 1990 and 2020. For each strip, there are a number of holes representing each individual killed in a mass shooting that year.
There are 809 holes in “Bullet Holes," which is updated as of February this year. Neu will add more holes if there are any more mass shootings in 2019 and 2020.
The second “protest" quilt, “In Our Sights," is crafted from real New York Times newspapers from the week of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. The papers are sandwiched between two swaths of mesh black fabric, and a neon green gun sight is appliqued over the top.
“I chose to use the actual pages because I wanted the quilt to show the passage of time. As the quilt gets handled more, the pages tear a bit and wrinkle," Neu said. “Time continues to pass without us really making any changes to our gun control laws in this country. Without those changes, nothing is going to change in this epidemic of gun violence we have."
The pieces in the exhibit were not easy for Neu to create. Tears were frequently shed during the process. She saved creating the quilt for the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting until last, trying to build up the willpower to face the names of the 20 children, ages 6 and 7, and six educators who were killed.
“I've probably touched each name half a dozen times. I've found they have sort of imprinted themselves in my heart in a way," Neu said. “At the exhibit reception, I met the mother of a victim from the Virginia Tech shooting. She walked up and introduced herself as Ross's mother. I knew exactly who she was talking about."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- When I was a political reporter at The Times, I had an editor who told me never to give anyone a Homeric epithet.
Such epithets denote a permanent trait, the editor explained, and people in the caldron of politics were mutable. So if I called that Republican strategist "savvy" this week, the man might do something dumb the following week. (And that is exactly what happened.)
But I might have to make an exception for William Barr. Homer had a couple of epithets that would suit our attorney general: "crooked-counseling" and "devious-devising" come to mind.
In an interview in Alaska for "CBS This Morning," Jan Crawford asked Barr -- who was doing his best Cheneyesque dour-jowly-outdoorsman under the Big Sky routine -- if he was worried about his reputation.
Barr came into the job, Crawford said, with a good reputation on the right and the left and now he stands "accused of protecting the president, enabling the president, lying to Congress."
In Homer's epic poems, reputation is more exalted than life itself. But in Donald Trump's epic reign as the hotheaded, ammonia-haired, serpent-tongued destroyer of worlds, political survival is paramount, no matter the venality involved or the cost to your reputation.
Barr responded to Crawford with fatalism, saying "everyone dies" and he doesn't believe in "the Homeric idea" that immortality comes by "having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?"
It's a good thing, too, because no one will be singing odes about this general being lionhearted in the rosy-fingered dawn.
The twisty saga of Robert Mueller and Bill Barr is a case of an imperfect hero and a perfect villain.
Barr is not so much the attorney general as the minister of information. His interview with Crawford was tactically brilliant. Barr once more deftly took advantage of the fact that Mueller, with his impenetrable legalese and double negatives, has handcuffed himself.
Even when the reclusive and mute Mueller finally stepped up to the lectern on Wednesday, he was still hiding.
"If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," said Mueller, sounding like Odysseus struggling to navigate between Scylla and Charybdis. "We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime."
Mueller is as elliptical as Barr is diabolical. The special counsel is clearly frustrated that we don't understand his reasoning. But his reasoning is nonsensical.
Adding insult to injury, the man whose whole career has been about asking the tough questions wouldn't even take questions. And he doesn't want to deign to testify about his $ 35 million report.
Mueller was trying to let himself off the hook by insisting that he couldn't reach a conclusion on the president's obstruction because he was bound by a Department of Justice opinion stating that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Plus, he layered on some extra "principles of fairness."
But talking to Crawford, Barr took the knife he had already stuck in his old friend and twisted it, using St. Mueller's prestige against him. He said Mueller, in fact, was not barred from reaching a conclusion, and this is why a "surprised" Barr and his former deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had to step in and reach a conclusion on obstruction, one ending up favoring Trump.
After indicating that Mueller was derelict and misguided, Barr went ahead and belittled him and his dream team as inept.
Dismissively noting he and Rosenstein did not agree with a lot of the legal analysis in the Mueller report, Barr said he applied what he considered to be "the right law," though he confusingly said he didn't rely on that when pronouncing Mueller's evidence "deficient" on the 11 instances of potential obstruction laid out in the report.
When Barr moved on to his investigation of the investigators who worked on the case of possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, he really bared his claws.
About the F.B.I. team that did the investigating, Barr backed up all of Trump's deep-state rants, saying: "Republics have fallen because of Praetorian Guard mentality where government officials get very arrogant, they identify the national interest with their own political preferences and they feel that anyone who has a different opinion, you know, is somehow an enemy of the state." He added, ominously, "Things are just not jiving."
Just as Barr enables Trump, Mueller enabled Barr.
Mueller's argument seems to be that he can't report on what his facts mean because the president has immunity from prosecution. But that doesn't follow. If you believe Trump committed a crime, even if you can't indict him now, why not say so? Otherwise, what was the point of the investigation? All Mueller was asked to do was to describe what he found and give his conclusions; then the Justice Department and Congress could do what they wanted.
As Walter Dellinger, an acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, tweeted: "Everyone agrees a president can be indicted once he is out of office. That (in addition to impeachment) is a reason to gather the evidence now while docs are available and memories fresh."
But, tangled up in some overweening idea of fairness, the ultimate straight arrow decided to remain agnostic even though his job did not require agnosticism. And that made him weirdly complicit in Barr's whitewashing of Trump.
Mueller colored inside the lines and Barr seized the narrative. Rectitude was Mueller's Achilles' heel.
Sometimes it's hard to know who is worse: devils or saints.

Texto completo: Neymar, the soccer star who is one of the world's best-paid and well-known athletes, has been accused of rape by a woman in São Paulo, Brazil. The woman filed a complaint with the Brazilian police over the incident, which she said happened in a Paris hotel room.
The details of the accusation are contained in a police report seen by The New York Times and first reported by news media outlets in Neymar's native Brazil.
In comments to the Brazilian television channel Band, Neymar's father, Neymar Santos Sr., strongly denied the rape allegation, contending that his son had engaged in consensual sex with the woman.
"This is a tough moment," Neymar Santos said. "If we can't show the truth quickly it will be a snowball. If we have to show Neymar's WhatsApp messages and the conversations with this lady, we will."
A spokesman for Neymar's French club side, Paris St.-Germain, said the team was not aware of the allegations.
The accusation comes as Neymar prepares to lead Brazil's national team at the Copa América, South America's most important national team tournament, later this month. Neymar was replaced as Brazil's captain in recent days after a difficult club season in which he was banned and fined for an altercation with a rival fan.
According to the police report, the woman said Neymar paid for her to fly from Brazil to Paris, then attacked her in a hotel in Paris on the evening of May 15.
The police report states that the woman, who was not identified by name, said she exchanged messages with Neymar on the social media platform Instagram before accepting an invitation to travel to Paris, where she met with him in a suite at Sofitel Paris Arc de Triomphe in May. According to the report, the two spoke and "exchanged caresses" before, the woman said, Neymar "turned aggressive" and forced her to have sex against her will.
The woman stayed in Paris before returning to Brazil two days later. She filed the complaint in São Paulo, where she lives, according to the police report. She did not register the accusation in France, the woman said, because she was too emotionally shaken to do so in a foreign country.
São Paulo's civil police confirmed in a statement that a case had been filed but did not elaborate. A spokesman for the Paris prosecutor's office said that he was not aware of any complaint or investigation in that city.
The case will be followed intensely in Brazil, where Neymar burst to nationwide acclaim as a teenager with the club Santos, the club where the Brazilian legend Pelé made his name. Neymar's stunning early performances as a teenager turned him into an instant millionaire, with sponsors clambering to sign him to their brands.
He was the figurehead of Brazil's World Cup team in 2014, the year before he joined Spanish club Barcelona. Neymar played four seasons in Spain before his blockbuster sale to P.S.G. for a world-record fee of almost $ 250 million.
The French team, backed by the seemingly bottomless funds of its Gulf owners, paid a transfer fee that was more than double the previous record. Recent media reports have linked Neymar with a return to Spain, however, either with his former team Barcelona or its bitter (and similarly deep-pocketed) league rival Real Madrid.
The first news reports of the rape accusations against Neymar emerged on Saturday in the middle of the Champions League final, the biggest club game in global soccer.
For all his success, Neymar has also proved to be a lightning rod. At the 2018 World Cup in Russia last summer, he was ridiculed widely for regularly flopping and rolling on the turf after seemingly innocuous contact from his opponents.
Neymar also has expressed frustration at persistent criticism of his party-loving lifestyle and general behavior. Earlier this year, he was photographed at Rio's Carnival while on crutches as he recovered from an injury that had kept him out of crucial games, including P.S.G.'s Champions League elimination by Manchester United.
Neymar responded to that defeat by insulting match officials on social media. That led to a three-game suspension by European soccer's governing body, UEFA, that he will serve at the start of next season's Champions League.
Neymar is not the only major soccer player facing a rape inquiry. Cristiano Ronaldo, who has for much of the past decade vied with Lionel Messi to be acclaimed as the sport's best player, is being investigated by authorities in Las Vegas.
Last year, the police reopened an investigation into an American woman's 2009 rape accusation against Ronaldo after the German news weekly Der Spiegel published details of the case obtained through a leak of emails belonging to Ronaldo's attorneys. Ronaldo has denied the accusation.

Texto completo: Por un precio inicial de $3.4 millones de dólares, los fanáticos de la exitosa serie de HBO “The Sopranos” (1999-2007) pueden soñar con comprar la casa del mafioso principal, Tony (James Gandolfini).
Según The New York Times, la propiedad de aproximadamente 5,600 pies cuadrados, ubicada en 14 Aspen Drive en North Caldwell (NJ), ha sido colocada en el mercado.
La casa aparecía en los créditos de apertura del programa, cuando Tony se detiene en el camino curvo. Otras partes, como la cocina y un patio al aire libre, también aparecieron en el programa piloto. Más tarde se reprodujo para filmar escenas de interiores en un estudio en Queens.
Durante las seis temporadas del programa, la casa original se usó entre 30 y 50 veces. Las diversas escenas están bien documentadas en una guía en línea de los lugares de rodaje de “Los Sopranos”.
Muchos fanáticos se acercan para hacer fotos. Los propietarios son Victor y Patti Recchia, quienes se negaron a comentar cuánto les pagó HBO por usar su casa.
Victor, quien dirige Fourth Generation Construction, construyó en 1987 la casa de cuatro habitaciones y 4 baños y medio (con más de 20 en las cercanías).
La pareja le dijo al Times que ya no necesitan tanto espacio desde que su hijo adulto se mudó. Piensan quedarse en Nueva Jersey después de la venta.
Debido a que no están utilizando un corredor inmobiliario, la pareja les pide a los compradores calificados que envíen ofertas y comprobantes de fondos antes del 21 de junio al correo electrónico sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com

DEMOCRATS, THANK TRUMP THE PRESIDENT SPRUNG YOU FROM A TRAP ON INFRASTRUCTURE

Texto completo: I gotta say, it was very clever of Nancy Pelosi to steal Donald Trump's strawberries, pushing him over the edge into self-evident lunacy. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="850" data-css-regions-fragment-source="2137" data-css-regions-cloning="true">
As everyone knows, Mr. Trump stormed out of a meeting on infrastructure, apparently out of uncontrollable rage over Ms. Pelosi's remarks pointing out that the administration's stonewalling on all fronts, including raw defiance of the law requiring that it provide the president's tax returns, obviously amount to a coverup of something (and maybe multiple things.) And Democrats should be grateful.
And I don't just mean that they should be grateful to see Mr. Trump displaying his unfitness for office, which has long been clear to close observers, in such a dramatically unhinged way that only cultists can fail to see it. He's also helped them with a political dilemma.
You see, a major infrastructure push is a very good idea, one that Democrats would find it hard to oppose in good conscience. Yet it would also be politically good for Mr. Trump, helping the economy, giving the public a sense of progress and also making him seem more like a normal president. And Democrats would have had a hard time avoiding making him this gift.
True, Republicans seem able to get away with blatant economic sabotage when a Democrat is in the White House. But Democrats, in part because they don't have Fox News to insist that black is white and up is down, are much less able to pull this off. Luckily, Mr. Trump has solved their problem.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="855" data-css-regions-fragment-source="2142" data-css-regions-cloning="true">
First things first: Why is an infrastructure push such a good idea? Partly because we have been underinvesting for years. The state of our roads, rail lines, water systems and so on speaks for itself. Beyond that, private investment demand remains weak, leading to low government borrowing costs; investors are effectively begging the government to take some of their money and do something useful with it.
On top of these considerations, infrastructure spending is especially desirable in a depressed economy, when it puts idle resources to work in a way that promotes long-run growth. But, you may argue, the U.S. economy isn't depressed right now. Indeed it isn't; but it's more fragile than many realize. When the next recession comes - and there is always a next recession - the conventional response, cutting interest rates, will almost surely be inadequate. On average, when recession strikes, the Federal Reserve cuts rates by 5 percentage points. Currently, however, rates are only half that high, so the Fed doesn't have enough room to cut.
And when recession does strike, it will be too late to get a major infrastructure program going. Better to have it underway.
So a big infrastructure push makes a lot of sense economically, and it would also be good politics for Mr. Trump. Yet 2½ years after Mr. Trump took office, and after a series of "infrastructure weeks" that seem to come almost as often as the president's golfing trips, nothing has happened. Why not?
One answer is that Republicans in Congress have no interest in infrastructure spending. They see any form of public expenditure, no matter how justified in terms of narrow economics, as problematic because it may seem to legitimize a larger role for government in general.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="861" data-css-regions-fragment-source="2148" data-css-regions-cloning="true">
Another answer is that until now, Trump officials have been completely unwilling to consider a traditional, clean infrastructure program - you know, just build stuff. Instead, they have proposed complex public-private partnerships that would in effect subsidize the privatization of public assets. It has been easy for Democrats to reject such ideas, as not really being about infrastructure at all.
After the 2018 midterms, however, it began to look as if Mr. Trump, wanting a policy win, might finally be willing to talk about a genuine infrastructure plan. And this had the potential of becoming a trap for Democrats, who would have trouble denying him that policy win.
But it was not to be. Let's not try to pretend that there was any clever political strategy in Mr. Trump's walkout; it was just his immaturity and insecurity, but even more obvious than usual. And the attempt to portray Ms. Pelosi as out of control is so ludicrous that only totally deluded people - i.e., around a third of the country - could possibly believe it.
So if I were House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, I would be quietly expressing thanks to Mr. Trump for throwing a tantrum and extricating them from a potential political trap.

Texto completo: North Carolina's secretary of health on Friday called for an investigation into a hospital where doctors had suspected children with complex heart conditions had been dying at higher than expected rates after undergoing heart surgery.
Dr. Mandy Cohen, the secretary, said in a statement that a team from the state's division of health service regulation would work with federal regulators to conduct a "thorough investigation" into events that occurred in 2016 and 2017 at North Carolina Children's Hospital, part of the University of North Carolina medical center in Chapel Hill.
"As a mother and a doctor my heart goes out to any family that loses a child," Dr. Cohen said in the statement. "Patient safety, particularly for the most vulnerable children, is paramount."
The investigation is in response to an article published by The New York Times on Thursday, which gave a detailed look inside the medical institution as cardiologists grappled with whether to keep sending their young patients there for surgery.
The article included discussions among doctors that were captured on secret audio recordings provided to The Times, in which the physicians talked openly about their concerns, including that some might not feel comfortable allowing their own children to have surgery at the hospital. The physicians also discussed unexpected complications with lower-risk patients.
While the doctors could not pinpoint what might be going wrong, they considered everything from inadequate resources to misgivings about the chief pediatric cardiac surgeon to whether the hospital was taking on patients it was not equipped to handle.
"It's a nightmare right now," Dr. Tim Hoffman, the hospital's chief of pediatric cardiology, said in a 2016 meeting. "We are in crisis, and everyone is aware of that."
In a later meeting, Dr. Kevin Kelly, the head of the hospital at the time, told cardiologists to "do what your conscience says" when considering where to refer patients, according to one of the recordings.
But, he warned, performing fewer surgeries at UNC could hurt revenues and could cost the cardiologists their jobs. "If it reduces the volume of things," he said, "I'll just ---- we'll just reduce the number of people that we have."
On Thursday, Dr. Wesley Burks, the chief executive of UNC Health Care, which runs the state-owned hospital, emailed employees about The Times's article.
"While this program faced culture challenges in the 2016-2017 time frame, we believe the Times' criticism is overstated and does not consider the quality improvements we've made within this program over many years," he said.
A local newspaper, The News & Observer in Raleigh, posted an editorial Thursday evening in response to The Times article that said "it will take leaders outside of the self-serving ranks of UNC's leadership to crack its culture of arrogant denial and bring it back to being a servant of the people."
UNC Health Care has defended its surgery program, describing it as "very strong" while denying any past problems affecting patient care. Administrators said there was "a dysfunctional group" in 2016 that sowed mistrust, creating "team culture issues," and they maintain that there is a different team at the hospital today.
Administrators told The Times it had conducted a "thorough internal investigation" of its heart surgery program in 2016 and had determined "criticism of the program was found to be unsubstantiated."
The Times is suing the hospital for mortality data related to pediatric heart surgeries that the hospital has refused to provide under the state's open records law.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: This modest rowhouse in LeDroit Park was once home to Duke Ellington, one of several houses he lived in during his time in Washington.
Described as "one of America's most important composers as well as its most influential jazz musician" in The Washington Post's May 1974 obituary, Ellington led one of the most popular orchestras of the Big Band era. He was an inventive and prolific composer. The New York Times obituary stated that he wrote more than 6,000 pieces, and The Post declared that he had 1,500 works to his credit. His official website claims he composed 3,000 songs, including "It Don't Mean a Thing if It Ain't Got That Swing," "Sophisticated Lady" and "Mood Indigo."
The man who became one of the kings of swing was born Edward Kennedy Ellington in 1899 at his grandparents' house on Ward Place NW. His father was a blueprint maker for the Navy and occasionally worked as a butler, sometimes at the White House. The musician was given the nickname Duke by childhood friends because of his elegant attire and courtly manner.
The Ellingtons rented the three-story Elm Street house circa 1906. It was one of a series of LeDroit Park homes where the family resided.
According to LeDroit Park Historic District information, the neighborhood was established in 1873 by Amzi L. Barber, one of the founders of Howard University. Barber, who married the daughter of a successful real estate broker, LeDroit Langdon, named the enclave after his father-in-law. It was developed as an exclusively white residential area, with a fence and guards to restrict access. The fence gate remains to this day.
The first African American resident moved into LeDroit Park in 1893. By the beginning of World War I, the white families had moved out, and LeDroit Park had become an enclave of the black elite.
The 1892 rowhouse, with its brick and stone facade, is part of a cluster of homes built on this block by J.W. Serrin for developer A.B. Hines. It has remained in the same family since 1953.
The home has been updated for today's living. An exposed brick wall runs the length of the main level. Hardwood floors warm to the space. Leaded glass interior shutters adorn the windows in the second-floor family room.
A fence surrounds a brick patio behind the house, providing private outdoor space.
The four-bedroom, two-bathroom, 1,620-square-foot house is listed at $1.2 million.
