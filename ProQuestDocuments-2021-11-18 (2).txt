Texto completo: Claus von Bulow
LONDON- Danish-born socialite Claus von Bulow, who was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill his wealthy wife in two trials that drew intense international attention in the 1980s, has died. He was 92.
Von Bulow, who moved to London after he was cleared, died at his home there on Saturday, his son-in-law, Riccardo Pavoncelli, told The New York Times.
The tall, aristocratic von Bulow was charged with putting his wife, Martha "Sunny" von Bulow, into an irreversible coma to gain her fortune so he could live with his mistress, a raven-haired soap opera actress. He was convicted of attempted murder in 1982 at a trial in Newport, Rhode Island, that was widely followed with its high society overtones about possible attempted murder by insulin injection.
The conviction was overturned on appeal and he was acquitted at his second trial in 1985.
Thad Cochran
JACKSON, Miss. - Republican former U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, who served 45 years in Washington and used seniority to steer billions of dollars to his home state of Mississippi, has died. He was 81.
Known as the "Quiet Persuader" for his gentlemanly manner, Cochran cultivated loyalty and respect from his staff and from politicians inside and outside his home state.
His final chief of staff, Brad White, said Cochran died Thursday at a veterans' nursing home in Oxford, Miss.
"I've never known a more powerful man, nor a more humble man - a true Southern gentleman that loved the great state of Mississippi," White said.
President Donald Trump said on Twitter, "He was a real Senator with incredible values - even flew back to Senate from Mississippi for important Healthcare Vote when he was desperately ill."
Cochran was elected to the U.S. House in 1972. Winning a Senate seat in 1978, he became the first Republican since Reconstruction to win statewide office in Mississippi.
Leon Redbone
NEW YORK - Leon Redbone, the acclaimed singer and guitarist who performed jazz, ragtime and Tin Pan Alley-style songs, died Thursday, according to a statement released by his family.
No details about his death were provided.
Redbone's career got a boost in the early 1970s when Bob Dylan met him at the Mariposa Folk Festival in Ontario, Canada, and praised his performance. Dylan said that if he ever started a label, he would have signed Redbone.
"Leon interests me," Dylan said in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1974. "I've heard he's anywhere from 25 to 60, I've been (a foot and a half from him) and I can't tell, but you gotta see him. He does old Jimmie Rodgers, then turns around and does a Robert Johnson."
Dylan wasn't the only one who didn't know Redbone's real age since the performer never directly answered questions about his origin or age. The statement announcing his death explained that "Leon Redbone crossed the delta for that beautiful shore at the age of 127. He departed our world with his guitar, his trusty companion Rover, and a simple tip of his hat."

Texto completo: Flying Southwest this summer and like to stash your boarding pass in those colorful paper holders they hand out at the airport?
You'll have to BYOBP holder beginning June 1.
Ticket jackets, as the document holders are called, are going the way of peanuts on Southwest.
The airline, which doles out about 22 million ticketjackets a year, is eliminating them to "reduce waste, protect our environment, use less paper and ultimately become a greener company,'' spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.
Southwest is the last major U. S. airline to ditch the ticket jackets, a relic from an era when airlines issued paper tickets.
Most tickets are now electronic, and boarding passes have moved that way, too. Travelers who don't fly Southwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, may not even know they still exist.
United Airlines said it eliminated ticket jackets in the early 2000s. Delta Air Lines did away with them in 2008. Alaska says it did away with them more than a decade ago. The last time American used them was in 2014. Spirit Airlines eliminated them in late 2016 as mobile boarding passes and self-service check-in kiosks grew in popularity.
Landson said Southwest has seen an increase in the number of travelers using mobile boarding passes and decided now was the time to eliminate the paper holders.
"Through this change in behavior, we feel like we’ve reached a good point to transition away from paper ticket jackets,'' he said.
The look of Southwest's ticket jackets, like other airlines', evolved with the airline's style and slogans over the years. The ticket jackets included gate information, Southwest reservations information and ads for Southwest products including gift cards. In the past, baggage claim checks were stapled to them.
A decade ago, one Southwest frequent flier got his close-up on Southwest's ticket jackets.
Terry Buchen, president of Golf Agronomy International, said he was selected to be on the ticket jacket after he gushed nonstop about Southwest at a party the airline hosted for frequent fliers in Baltimore.
Southwest flew Buchen and his wife to Austin, Texas, for a photo shoot and treated them to a luxury hotel, meals and a new outfit from Nordstrom for the ad. (Yes, he got to keep it. )
Buchen was on the ticket jacket from 2007 to 2009.
He was often recognized at the airport by fellow travelers and Southwest employees, earning the nickname "the ticket jacket guy," he told the New York Times in 2008.
"People used to ask me for autographs,'' Buchen said in a phone interview with USA TODAY. "It was a lot of fun. I really had fun. ''
Buchen, 72, has a framed copy of the ticket jacket at his home outside Boise, Idaho, and saved about 100 of the ticket jackets with his picture on them.
The last time Buchen used a Southwest ticket jacket was 2016. Not because he's moved to mobile boarding passes — he has but still prints out a hard copy in case his phone dies or malfunctions — but because he doesn't fly Southwest following his move from Virginia to Idaho.
Delta has better flight options from Boise, he said. But no ticket jackets.
Buchen said he folds his backup Delta boarding pass in half and sticks it in the back left pocket of his pants.
He said he will always fondly remember ticket jackets.
"It was such a tradition for so many years,'' he said. "It just made you feel good, sort of like you were carrying a passport. And you'd open it up like a book and there was a boarding pass and a receipt. ''
Travelers nostalgic for ticket jackets, including Southwest's current version, can find plenty for sale on eBay.

Texto completo: Here are a couple of reactions to my column last week, where I explained why the Orlando Sentinel stopped posting comments at the end of news articles. They, in general, represent the two sides of the argument from readers who emailed or posted their thoughts to my Twitter and Facebook accounts.
From the "I'm glad they are gone" group: "They were rarely a source of enlightenment, thoughtfulness or civil discourse. More often than not, they merely gave a platform to racists, trolls and fools."
From the "I should be able to comment" group: "I was an avid participant ... and miss the comments section terribly."
Readers fall broadly into these two camps, although more were against their return than for it.
But an important thread runs through all the reactions I heard. Readers want to be able to have their say. They want to be heard.
Even the readers who miss the comment forums acknowledge they were a messy place that made it hard to have a reasonable conversation. To those readers, there should be some way to control the volume - to allow passion without prejudice, to foster discussion without denigration.
To me, both sides are right.
I say good riddance to our comment areas, which went away last summer. The Orlando Sentinel used a mix of software filters to try and catch curse words and web producers to check for flagged comments that they could remove. It was a losing battle.
But I also say discussion is important to what we do in journalism, so we should continue to work on a way to bring back commenting - but ONLY if we devote the people to review comments before posting and find better software that identifies trolls.
Some organizations, including the New York Times, only allow comments on certain articles and sometimes for only a certain period of time or time of day when journalists are available to review them.
As with many things we do - or don't do - it comes down to people. To have comment forums that don't devolve into schoolyard brawls, we need more resources. If we don't commit to creating a space for conversation, then we shouldn't have them.
For now, remember you can comment on our Facebook and Twitter accounts and always send a letter to the editor at insight@orlandosentinel.com. Emails for writers are at the end of their articles online and we are bringing them back at the end of articles in print, based on reader feedback.
'Do you hate history?'
We had to redesign the print page where the Today in History column runs in Local & State to handle a new layout for our syndicated features Ask Amy and the Horoscopes.
The result was fewer history items, which resulted in pushback from readers who questioned whether I hated history. (The redesign also is why we moved Ticked Off under the TV grid - something a few of you didn't like, either.)
Since the changes started on May 20, the column only displays about two history items instead of the usual five or six.
I've gotten several emails and a call or two since the change - all from readers who want more items.
Fair enough. I agree - the items are fun to read and spur discussion at the breakfast table, so we should have more.
So what should I do?
No, we don't have the option to go back to the old format or mess with the crossword area. A newspaper is like a puzzle in some ways, and the pieces need to fit together in certain places and certain spaces.
So time to vote. Should we:
*Leave Today in History as it is, with two or three items a day.
*Move it to the A section, where other national and world news publishes.
That's how some other papers in our group handle it, and it would get us the full list back.
*Move it under the TV grid - accepting that this means it runs in a different place on Fridays, when TV runs in Calendar. Again, this would get us more items.
I'm sure you can come up with 10 other ways I could or should change the design. Sorry, our options are down to these three.
So let me know. My email is below.

Texto completo: CAMBRIDGE, England -- Robert Macfarlane was partway up a mountain in Scotland when a fellow climber decided to lighten the mood by reciting some William Carlos Williams: "The descent beckons / as the ascent beckoned."
At the time, "the descent very much beckoned," said Macfarlane, who then recalled the couplet when he began work on his latest book, "Underland: A Deep Time Journey."
"There is a logic that I began on the mountaintops with my first book," he said in an interview earlier this month, "and that I've ended up as far below ground as I could with this one."
Macfarlane's 2003 debut "Mountains of the Mind" was an inquiry into why people would be willing to die for love of rock and ice. Since then his output has included "The Old Ways" (2012), about routes and trails around the world, and "Holloway" (2013), about walking sunken paths.
In "Underland," set to be released in the United States by Norton on June 4, Macfarlane turns his attention to the subterranean world. He explores an underground laboratory in Yorkshire where scientists attempt to study the dark matter formed at the universe's birth, and an icy hiding place in Olkiluoto, Finland, where preparations are underway to store nuclear waste. "Much of the underland is massively regulated space," he said. "It's where states and individuals and corporations have gone to put things that are most precious and dangerous to them."
But in some of these spaces, climate change is leading to what he calls "unburials." "We are seeing it yield the bodies of 50,000-year-old wolf pups," he said, "perfectly preserved."
All of this seems far removed from the airy, book-lined office at Emmanuel College where we met a few weeks ago. But Macfarlane, 42, who has taught literature here since 2001, has grown adept at combining his activities.
"My books take five, six or seven years to write and tend to become pretty consuming," he said. "They become the ways I organize my time and also part of the conversation I have with my students when I teach."
Macfarlane, who won the E.M. Forster Award for Literature in 2017, is primarily known as a nature writer, but it is not a term he is altogether comfortable with, especially regarding "Underland." "The nature here is rock and ice and time and nuclear waste and human activity," he said. "So if it is nature writing, then it is a dark kind of nature writing, but I'm quite happy for it not to sit easily in a genre."
In "Underland," as in his previous books, he insists on experiencing things for himself. He navigates precarious underground passageways in the Paris catacombs or ancient burial tombs in the Mendips of Somerset. Gradually he became fascinated by "the idea that claustrophobia might possess this vicarious power to move people, grip them," he said. "The body comes to know places in ways that can't be known by reading or remote-sensing."
When he was younger, he was an avid rock climber, though he qualifies this with self-deprecation: "I was very bad at it, but I was quite bold, and that's a bad combination." After an aborted Alps expedition -- "I just reached a point on a knife edge at a ridge where it was impossible to proceed" -- he has dialed back. He also has his wife, the writer and China scholar Julia Lovell, and their three children, Lily, Tom and Will, to consider.
Macfarlane grew up in rural Nottinghamshire, but his love of nature and landscape bloomed when his parents began taking the family on walking holidays in Scotland. "That was the country that's drawn me back and back as a writer and as a walker and a climber," he said. "'Underland' is the first book I've ever written that has no Scotland in it."
Altogether there have been nine books. To his surprise the one that has had the most impact is a children's title, "The Lost Words."
Published in 2017, it began when Macfarlane and the British artist Jackie Morris were told that the latest edition of the Oxford Junior Dictionary had dropped nature words like "acorn," "dandelion" and "kingfisher" in favor of technological terms. Together they created "The Lost Words" as a book of poetry or "spells," with his writing and her illustrations.
Morris, who lives in Pembrokeshire, Wales, said that Macfarlane's writing challenged her to alter some of the work that she had already done for "The Lost Words." "I thought that nothing he could write would change the way I saw a raven," she said in an email. "They fly over my studio, so close that I can hear the air pass through their feathers. So I painted. And even though the raven I had painted was O.K., I knew that I had to begin again and put an egg in the raven's mouth."
The book has since become a cultural phenomenon in Britain, selling over 100,000 copies according to Nielsen BookScan. It is widely distributed in Scottish and English schools and will be set to music in August as part of the BBC's Proms series in London.
"Like a lot of the work I've done up to this point, 'The Lost Words' has been about re-wilding or reanimating an available language for place and for nature," Macfarlane said. "I only wrote 800 words for it, and I'll probably never write another 800 words that live in the world so much."
Macfarlane and Morris are now working on a follow-up called "The Book of Birds," which is scheduled to come out in the U.K. in 2022. This time he plans to use prose, not poetry, to describe the turtle dove, cuckoo, lapwing, curlew and other endangered birds in Britain.
Everything Macfarlane has published begins with a notebook in which he keeps fragments of literature and samples of mica, feather, rock, sand and mud. "I tend to see and think in little imagistic shards which provide a basis," he said. "I'm an absolutely obsessive reviser and editor. All of the sentences in 'Underland' have been rewritten 20, 30 or 40 times." What he found hardest with "Underland" was trying to come up with a language for a book which is about "what we can't see and don't know."
This is especially evident in a chapter exploring the meltwater of the Knud Rasmussen Glacier in Greenland in which he describes the aftermath of a glacier's breakage.
"Right to the summit of the calving face itself," he writes, is "a black shining pyramid, sharp at its prow, thrusting and glistening, made of a substance that has to be ice but looks like no ice we have seen before, something that resembles what I imagine meteorite metal to be, something that has come from so deep down in time that it has lost all color."
It is both an appalling and exciting vision, one that Macfarlane was glad to have witnessed for himself.
"It's difficult to get a sense of catastrophe happening immediately," he said. "There's a deferral of the problem to an unspecified future, but actually it's happening all around us now."

Losing the Amazon HQ bid may have been very good for Minnesota’s fiscal health

Texto completo: In a bid to lure Amazon’s second headquarters to the Land of 10,000 Lakes, Minnesota pledged to give the company a bustling business community, lots of smart workers and a great quality of life for them.
Oh, and subsidies. The state suggested it could award Amazon $3 million to $5 million in subsidies, in addition to potential local incentives. (We know this because the state just released the bid which, despite a media lawsuit, was only made public after Amazon gave the go-ahead.)
Maybe it was our winters, maybe it was our taxes, or maybe it was that our incentive package was paltry compared to other locations’. But after being rebuffed in New York, Amazon ultimately chose to go to northern Virginia, which offered $573 million in performance-based incentives, and Nashville, which offered $102 million in city and state funding.
Hell hath no fury like a Minnesotan scorned, but being overlooked by Amazon might not have been a bad thing, suggests new research out of North Carolina State University.
By analyzing data on state tax breaks offered to companies in 32 states from 1990 to 2015, the forthcoming study found the financial incentives U.S. states give businesses have a detrimental effect on states’ financial health.
Tax breaks
There are lots of different packages these types of incentives come in: property tax breaks; research and development tax breaks, which reduce taxes to companies working on technological innovations; investment tax breaks, which give businesses deductions based on investments made; and breaks for job training grants and job creation.
Incentives like these have been around in some form or another for about as long as the U.S. has, said Timothy Bartik, senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, who compiled the database used in the NC State analysis.
The current wave started in the ’30s, with Southern states luring northern manufacturers by helping them build factories and buy equipment.
The trend ramped up after WWII as air conditioning made working in a factory in the sweltering heat more palatable, Bartik said. As northern states started feeling the competition, they jumped in with incentives.
States’ use of incentives to lure companies tripled in dollars between 1990 and 2001, after which their expansion slowed on the whole, but some states increased them while others cut back, Bartik said.
But even as their use has become widespread, deployment of incentives often ruffles feathers. Proponents see them as a way to to lure good jobs to a given area. Detractors see them as handouts to corporations.
Bruce McDonald, associate professor of public budgeting and finance at North Carolina State University and an author of the NC State study, got into the business of studying them after Raleigh, home to NC State, was named one of 20 finalists for the second Amazon headquarters.
“Everyone assumes financial incentives would have a positive effect because you’re bringing new business,” he said. But, “surprisingly little research definitively shows that. Most of the research has been on a case-by-case basis.”
So, the team set out to determine the effects of incentives on states’ fiscal health on-the-whole, attempting to account for different political characteristics, economic conditions, demographics and the structure of state governments and other factors that could affect fiscal health.
“Generally, financial incentives do a pretty bad job of impacting fiscal health, that is they’re going to move the state into a worse financial situation,” McDonald said. “The money that would have been coming into the government in some way is no longer coming in, but at the same time there’s an expectation of increased expenditures: more roads to pave, more public services to offer, more people you’re having to deal with.”
Use with caution
Not all incentives were created equal, though, they found: the study’s authors were surprised to find research and development tax credits hurt states’ fiscal health the most.
“That surprised everybody. We’re used to thinking about how much R&D has had such a positive impact,” he said. But R&D costs a lot, and many new technologies fail, he said.
Next came investment tax credits and property tax abatements.
Property tax breaks can go a couple different ways, McDonald said: if a business gets a tax abatement to revitalize an area, there’s a potential for positive benefit because it can increase the tax base in the long-run. That’s especially the case for places not generating much in property taxes from the get-go.
But these instances are few and far-between, he said.
“Most of the time, somebody comes in and they’re being attracted to a certain area not because it needs revitalization but because that’s where they want to move to,” McDonald said.
Job training grants tend to foster dependence on the federal government, since the federal government often funds part of them , McDonald found.
Only job creation credits tended to have no significant effect, on average, on states’ fiscal health, according to the study.
McDonald and his colleagues concluded that incentives can bring a return on investment, but also put the state’s financial health at risk.
“As such, they are a financial tool that should only be used with caution,” the study finds.
Some states appear to use them more than others.
Average the annual subsidies out over ten years, from 2006 to 2015, and Minnesota ranks 28th among the 32 states in the study in terms of incentives relative to the size of the value added by its industries, at 0.4 percent, according to the study. New York ranked first, at 4.7 percent, while Washington comes in last at 0.2 percent.
Average annual state tax incentives, 2006-2015
Minnesota’s tax incentives also tended to have a larger return on investment than other states’, the study found.
In recent years, Minnesota spent the largest share of its incentives on jobs subsidies, followed by investment subsidies, training and then R&D subsidies, per the study.
A 2012 New York Times investigation found Minnesota’s state and local governments spend $45 per capita on subsidies each year. Its agriculture, finance and telecommunications sectors were the biggest beneficiaries. Alaska, the heaviest per-capita subsidizer, spent $991 per capita, while Nevada, the lightest, spent $12 per capita.
Some of Minnesota’s biggest recent subsidies include $585 million in infrastructure funding to Rochester’s Destination Medical Center, contingent on private investment; $250 million in tax breaks for infrastructure approved by the Legislature in 2013 for Triple Five Group, the Mall of America’s owner, to help expand the mall. Also of note: the Minnesota Vikings Stadium, which the state helped fund directly, at $348 million.
Finding a strategy
Bartik, who has studied the effects of incentives extensively, has a list of reforms states could enact to get more bang for their buck when they offer them.
He suggests incentives should be target firms that benefit from clustering in a given area, which tends to increase their cost-benefit ratio.
Incentives to big businesses can be balanced with programs to help small businesses. Bartik suggests expanding states’ manufacturing extensions (similar to agricultural extensions, public agencies that do research on ag and advise farmers, but for manufacturing), and spending on customized job training.
He also suggests states set caps on incentives, making sure abatements for businesses don’t diminish budgets in areas like education and infrastructure, which also help grow business.
Bartik also thinks governments should limit one-time deals to lure companies, which often don’t actually influence their decision to locate.
When it comes to business incentives, “You need an economic development strategy, but you need to have one that’s affordable and that’s cost-effective,” he said.

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA - One minute, Cre'Von LeBlanc was out of work. The next, the journeyman cornerback was headed to his fourth team in two years and wondering what would come next.
The Philadelphia Eagles claimed him last November off waivers from the Detroit Lions, who had picked him up after he spent two seasons with the Chicago Bears. He'd landed in Chicago after things didn't work out in New England, which originally signed him in 2016 as an undrafted free agent out of Florida Atlantic.
That his new defensive coordinator, Jim Schwartz, hadn't heard of him didn't bode well, either.
Soon, though, LeBlanc would prove not only to be an important cog on a defending Super Bowl champion but also a key player for the Eagles, who knocked the team that discarded him the previous season - the Bears - out of the playoffs.
And he certainly wasn't done. After helping the Eagles get past Chicago in the wild-card round, he intercepted a deep Drew Brees pass on the first play from scrimmage to set up a touchdown that gave his team a 7-0 lead over the New Orleans Saints, who would eventually fight their way back for a 20-14 victory.
But the point was made. LeBlanc's ability to pick up the system quickly opened Schwartz's eyes just as fast.
So now LeBlanc returns with the same grit and figures to fit in with a fully healthy secondary that he never would have joined last season if it hadn't been decimated by injuries.
Funny how things work out when you don't doubt your destiny.
"You've got to focus on your job, which is the playbook," LeBlanc said Tuesday after practice at the team's organized team activities. "I learned fast. When your number is called, you've got to go in and perform. That's what they bring you in to do, anyway. So for me, it was just me putting my head down, keep working day by day, and [studying] the playbook from sunup to sundown and just working my tail off. And my hard work paid off."
Said Schwartz: "It doesn't take long to be around that guy to know that he's competitive and he's tough. It took a little bit. He wasn't a rookie, so a lot of times with those guys, it's just a matter of getting his terminology up to date and things like that. So it was sort of by necessity. He needed to get up to speed quickly, but he was up for the task.
"He's played some outside corner for us, too. I don't know that we win that Giants game if he can't step in and play outside corner, which was a position that he had hardly ever played and he had not practiced for us. But competitiveness and toughness go a long way, and he brings both of those."
LeBlanc, 24, has literally fought through the muck, growing up in Belle Glade on the banks of Lake Okeechobee in Florida, to make it to where he is today, and he'll never lose that perspective. Belle Glade is often referred to as "Muck City" for its nutrient-rich soil in which sugarcane grows. It is a model of depression and poverty. Per The New York Times, as recently as nine years ago, the Palm Beach County sheriff's office estimated that half of all Belle Glade males between 18 and 25 had felony convictions.
The 5-10, 190-pounder won't allow himself to be overpowered by bigger receivers down the field or by backs in plays that are run right at him.
That Giants game Schwartz referred to was highlighted by LeBlanc's denying receiver Odell Beckham a pass in the final minute.
So it should come as no surprise that LeBlanc plans to spend part of his free time between next month's mandatory minicamp and the start of training camp back home.
In the muck.
"It's always good to go back home and see the circumstances of where I came from," he said. "That kind of motivates me. Check on my mom and pretty much just come in new and improved, working on my speed, working on my fitness, working on my strength, getting faster, quicker.
"Come back ready for training camp."
And ready to find a long-term home away from home, ending the journeyman's portion of this noteworthy journey.

Bret Stephens: Conservatives would have demanded Obama be impeached if he sided with Kim Jong Un

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Bret Stephens took a swipe at his fellow conservatives for giving President Trump a pass when he appeared to side with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over Joe Biden.
Trump said on Twitter Sunday he was amused after North Korean state media called the former vice president “reckless” and “a fool of low IQ.” At the same time, he also said he had confidence Kim Jong Un would follow through and denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
Stephens argued it was appalling that the president chose to side with a “psychotic or certainly murderous dictator against an honorable opponent.”
“It is a stunning repudiation of two centuries of American foreign policy tradition,” Stephens said during an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday.
Stephens then said he didn’t believe conservatives would be so forgiving of the remarks if a Democratic president made the same comments.
“It is amazing to me as someone who identifies as a conservative that so many of my fellow conservatives are just mum on the subject,” Stephens said. “Can you imagine for one second where Sean Hannity, where the crowd at Fox News would be, if any Democratic predecessor, President Obama or President Clinton, had uttered anything like this. They would be demanding impeachment on the spot. Here they are as silent and compliant as any group of ideologues and partisans have ever been.”
Amid backlash for his tweet, Trump said he was actually defending Biden for not calling him an “idiot.”
"I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a 'low IQ idiot,' and many other things, whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer 'low IQ individual.' Who could possibly be upset with that?" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Biden’s campaign broke its silence on the matter Tuesday.
"It’s part of a pattern of embracing autocrats at the expense of our institutions — whether taking Putin’s word at face value in Helsinki or exchanging ‘love letters’ with Kim Jong Un," deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.

'Jeopardy' champ James Holzhauer earns 28th win, pulls within $325K of Jennings' record

Texto completo: On Memorial Day, James Holzhauer was busy defended his reign on "Jeopardy!" And he didn't exactly take it easy.
On Monday's episode, Holzhauer notched his 28th consecutive win with $130,222, building on the $74,400 that put him over the $2 million mark on Friday. Monday's tally was just shy of his one-day record of $131,127, set April 9.
And he did it in commanding fashion. By the end of Double Jeopardy, Holzhauer was miles ahead of his competitors, who finished the round with $6,600 and $6,200.
That made the Final Jeopardy clue about "Games" – presumably an easy subject for the champ – all but a formality. And the question, which all of the contestants knew – "What is Life?" – summed up everything.
When you're competing against a professional gambler with $72,022 in his pot, a usually tidy $13,195 just isn't going to win the day.
Holzhauer is just the second contestant to pass the $2 million mark in regular game play, joining Ken Jennings, who piled up $2,520,700 by the time his 74-win run ended in 2004.
Astoundingly, Holzhauer, a Las Vegas-based professional sports gambler, reached the $2 million threshold in just 27 episodes. His total after Monday's game now sits at $2,195,557.
Holzhauer explained his aggressive clue selection and wagering approach to The New York Times last month.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy. "There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Jennings, for one, is impressed with the 34-year-old's bold strategy, telling Wired that he is "gobsmacked" by Holzhauer.
"I thought I had seen everything on 'Jeopardy!' And this is something I would have thought was just impossible, these numbers," he marveled. "He’s maximizing money. He can make two or three times what any other player ever has with that same level of play, which again is top-shelf. "
Jennings said he loves Holzhauer's ambitious approach.
"I’ve always wanted to see somebody play that way, you know? I remember as a kid doing the math and figuring out how much somebody could win on 'Jeopardy!,' if they got every question, and got all the Daily Doubles last, and they bet everything on them," Jennings told Wired. "Like, wow, look at that number. Did I actually think we would see someone try that? No, I did not. "

Texto completo: President is putting us into time of chaos Mr. Trump is calling on Americans to use the power of prayer to end violence. I find this quite humorous since as the top official of the United States, he does more to incite violence than anyone else.
The hatred and violence that is erupting in our country, and the inequality in our justice system is appalling. Mr. Trump says he has done more than any other president. Hmmm, he has managed to introduce white nationalism into the White House and is quite vocal about it; has managed to bring our country down in the eyes of our patriotic citizens and our allies; is managing to bring our country back in time rather than going forward and is ignoring all scientific research on climate change because he knows more than any of the scientists.
He has absolutely no interest in saving our planet for future generations. He wants to bypass congress and go to war with Iran. Now he has the audacity to say he wants to bring those that "spied" on his campaign up for treason and sent to jail. This coming from someone who values Putin’s input over his own advisers.
I cannot think of anyone else that has committed so many acts of obstruction of justice and is getting away with it. We want Congress to act, but then how can they when McConnell, Trump and Barr cut them down every time they can, including telling folks to just ignore the subpoenas they receive?
How is this even possible!
I now realize we are under a dictator who wants nothing more than chaos. If we don’t stop this at the polls, prayer will not help. We are living in very frightening times. Every time I see him raise his right hand in a fist all I can think of is Hitler. Scary folks, very scary.
Sandra Alter Hoffman Estates Barr’s curious comments about judges It was interesting to read William Barr’s comments regarding federal judges and some of their rulings in cases where Trump’s commands were blocked. He took umbrage at the fact that a single judge could block the president’s policies.
I guess it never occurred to Mr. Barr that the president could have proposed policies that addressed the concerns of all Americans. And it didn’t seem to occur to Mr. Barr that he took it upon himself to shape public opinion regarding the Mueller investigation without even a second thought as to what it would do to the public’s confidence in the judiciary system.
Mr. Barr should just accept the fact that once all the arguments were made in the cases, the "baby" then belonged to the judges. It was heartening, though, to see that Mr. Barr is very intelligent when he figured out that the 37 blocked attempts since Trump took office were more than one a month.
Tom Frampton Streamwood Commentaries seek to set up Democrats Taking credit when things go well and blaming someone else when things go poorly isn’t new to Donald Trump. It has long been a part of the conservative playbook, long enough to be honed into an art.
Recently the Daily Herald had a conservative columnist, Byron York, who wrote, "Amid good news can Democrats talk down the economy" and on May 14, the paper published a cartoon that shows the Democratic national headquarters talking about hiring the 3.6% unemployed to trash talk the economy.
Putting aside the stupidity of the concept of creating full employment to trash an economy, it is obvious that they are both setting the stage to blame Democrats when the economy turns down.
In Mr. York’s column he quotes an economic reporter, a columnist, an economic adviser, a financial reporter, and two Republican strategists. Nothing from a Democratic politician or official.
Grabbing Mr. York’s lead, the cartoonist feels free to suggest Democratic officials without naming names or indicating a basis for the observation.
There is no doubt that given time, the economy will hit a slump. How fast and how hard will depend on many factors, including fiscal and social policies and legislation. But to suggest that the Democrats are trashing the economy when the Republicans control so much of our government is weak intellectually and lazy artistically.
Mike Vandeleur Bolingbrook Dog-and-pony show The Daily Herald’s May 9 headline "Trump formally blocks report" is quite misleading. According to the New York Times, what was blocked (redacted) from Mueller’s report is: 69% dealing with ongoing investigations, 18% grand jury testimony that cannot legally be released, 8% classified material and 5% that would infringe on personal privacy rights.
The Justice Department offered 12 congressional leaders — party leaders and the heads of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees — and a staff member each the ability to view a version of the Mueller report that only contained redactions of grand jury material, which the Justice Department has argued it is prohibited by law from sharing without a court order.
While no Democrat has taken the opportunity, six Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham have taken up the offer, along with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Doug Collins, Need more proof that Nadler is running a dog-and-pony show?
Joan Baillie Volo Testing teachers I am a retired teacher. I had contact with teachers who should not have been in a classroom. Now the state is looking to eliminate the Basic Skills test for certification. A fourth grader could pass that test. If a person cannot pass a basic skills test, do you want that person teaching your child?
Doris Aussin Lake in the Hills Vigilance needed to control spending With one week left in Springfield’s regular legislative session, the wheels are spinning. Madigan’s supermajority wants new gas, gambling and pot taxes; will increase property taxes through unfunded local school mandates; and will escalate fees. Notwithstanding the May 31 budget deadline, no proposed budget bill exists, because proposed new spending requires billions of new taxes.
The proposed "graduated" income tax amendment to eliminate the Illinois Constitution’s equal tax treatment has an army of tax lobbyists salivating over opportunities to grease connected insiders’ wheels.
Utterly missing from the debate are bipartisan proposals to amend the Illinois Constitution to reform and restructure what drives the structural deficits: the Illinois pension system.
There is some hope — federal reforms improved our state tax base, generating $1.5 billion dollars in extra revenue for this fiscal year. The governor was rightly pressured by stakeholders on both sides of the aisle to abandon his plan to short the teacher, police and firefighter pensions this year. That doesn’t mean he won’t try again next year.
Illinois’ Department of Revenue estimates $800 million more will arrive in the next fiscal year.
I urged fellow legislators to try something new under the dome: control spending, not raise taxes; and encourage natural economic growth to help balance our budget.
We know the way; we just need the will. We must be vigilant to advocate and insist that the state use all newfound revenues to dig Illinois out of its fiscal hole. Please call our office to learn how you can help.
Rep. Deanne M. Mazzochi Elmhurst

Texto completo: Australian actor Geoffrey Rush was awarded a record-breaking $2 million Thursday in a defamation suit against a Sydney journalist and Rupert Murdoch's Nationwide News.
It's the largest ever payout for an Australian defamation case. The Oscar winner and star of "The King's Speech" sued the tabloid The Daily Telegraph, which is published by Nationwide News, two articles from late 2017, one of which was titled "King Leer."
The reports alleged Rush (photo), 67, "had inappropriately touched his co-star's breasts and back, followed her into a bathroom and sent her an inappropriate text message" as the pair worked on a stage production of "King Lear" between 2015 and 2016. The actor denied the allegations.
The co-star was Eryn Jean Norvill, who made a private workplace complaint about the alleged incidents prior to testifying on behalf of the paper. She stands by the allegations.
Rush's payout is meant to compensate him for financial losses due to defamation.
Another actress, Australian native Yael Stone, in a December interview with The New York Times, also alleged Rush had been inappropriate with her when they worked on the 2010 to 2011 stage production of "The Diary of a Madman." Stone, 34, appears in "Orange is the New Black."
Stone accused her co-star of having "danced naked in front of her in their dressing room, used a mirror to watch her while she showered and sent her occasionally erotic text messages." The alleged incidents took place when Stone was 25 and Rush was 59 and "many aspects of her story" were corroborated to The Times by at least three other individuals who also worked on the production.
In a statement, Rush dismissed her claims as "incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context." He added that he (regretted) if I have caused her any distress" and cited that the pair had "engaged in a journey as artistic comrades."
"I abhor any behavior that might be considered as harassment or intimidation to anyone - whether in the workplace or any other environment," Rush added.
Earlier this month, Stone was revealed as "witness X," who, during the two-week trial that took place in late 2018, was called to provide evidence on behalf of Nationwide News. Justice Michael Wigney "rejected the last-minute bid and ordered [her] identity suppressed," according to The Times.
Wigney ruled against The Daily Telegraph in April, citing the two articles as "extravagant and reckless." Following last month's ruling, Rush won over $600,000 in damages.

Esquire's Editor for 3 Years Bows Out as Hearst Reshuffles

Texto completo: Jay Fielden is leaving his position as Esquire's editor in chief, a job he held for three years, Hearst Magazines announced Thursday. The change at the venerable men's publication, which started in 1933, is part of a reshuffling under Troy Young, who became president of the publisher in July.
"I have felt the lure of new possibilities," Mr. Fielden said in a statement.
His successor has not been named. Mr. Fielden added that he would stay at the company to complete the rollout of Esquire's new issue, which features several stars of the next Quentin Tarantino movie on its cover, but on Thursday morning he posted a portrait on his Instagram account that showed him stepping out of Hearst Tower in Manhattan. Dressed in a summery get-up and sunglasses in the photo, he carried a Gucci suitcase and various totes.
Mr. Fielden, 49, had a tough act to follow. His immediate predecessor, David Granger, won 17 National Magazine Awards during his 19 years in charge. But the magazine failed to win an Ellie statuette while Mr. Fielden held the top job.
Esquire also lost out on a high-profile story -- an investigative article on accusations of sexual misconduct against the Hollywood director Bryan Singer -- in a very public way during Mr. Fielden's tenure.
Reported over the course of a year by two of the magazine's regular contributors, Maximillian Potter and Alex French, the story went through a thorough editing and legal-vetting process at Esquire, the writers said, before Hearst executives "killed" it. It ended up published by The Atlantic in January.
One of its authors said the loss of the story to another publication hadn't sat well with Mr. Fielden. "That weighed on him," Mr. Potter said.
A Hearst spokeswoman said, "We do not discuss our editorial process, but we stand by the decision we made based on our editorial standards."
Mr. Fielden, born and raised in Texas, worked at a Ralph Lauren boutique in San Antonio before going into journalism. He got his training at Condé Nast, filling various posts at The New Yorker before becoming an arts editor at Vogue and the top editor of Men's Vogue, which folded in 2008.
In 2011, he decamped to Hearst as the editor in chief of Town & Country. Since taking the Esquire job, he has remained on the Town & Country masthead as editorial director. He will also lose that title as part of his departure from the company.
Hearst Magazines said in a statement that Mr. Fielden would continue to contribute to both publications. "We thank him for his leadership and contributions to Hearst Magazines over the years and wish him the best with his future plans," the statement said.
For decades, Esquire was a bible for the sporty American male with a taste for bourbon and literary heavyweights like Truman Capote, Raymond Carver, John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, David Foster Wallace and Tom Wolfe, all of whom appeared in its pages.
Mr. Fielden set out to update the magazine's sensibility. "There's no cigar smoke wafting through the pages," he told The New York Times a few months after taking the job, "and the obligatory three B's are gone, too: brown liquor, boxing and bullfighting."
The editor circulated easily during fashion weeks in Milan and Paris among the top designers and fashion-industry moguls whose brands provided Esquire with much of its ad revenue.
As the editor of a men's title during the rise of sexual fluidity and the #MeToo movement, he navigated sexual politics in a manner different from that of his predecessors. The last edition of Esquire's "Women We Love" issue, an annual package featuring a cover photo of a scantily clad actress, appeared under Mr. Fielden's predecessor.
That franchise has continued to appear on the Esquire website -- the most recent installment was headlined "25 Hot Videos From the Women We Love" -- but Mr. Fielden's purview did not include oversight of Esquire.com.
With online media on the rise and print going out of style, he was left with the challenge of managing a product in decline. Under Mr. Fielden, the number of yearly Esquire issues dropped to eight from 10.
When Mr. Young, the Hearst Magazines president, joined the company in 2013 as the head of its digital media division, he created a structure wherein the editors of the magazines' websites reported to him, rather than to the editors of the individual publications. Since becoming president, Mr. Young has tried to find editors to run both the print and digital operations at each title.
After Mr. Young had settled into his new job, Hearst Magazines named Jessica Pels the new editor of Cosmopolitan and Joanna Saltz the new editor of House Beautiful. In their previous jobs, both had been in charge of the magazines' websites; after their promotions, they were handed responsibility for print and digital content.
In a related move at the time, Richard Dorment, the editor of Men's Health (and a former articles editor at Esquire), was given responsibility for that magazine's digital content.
Those editors report to Kate Lewis, the chief content officer of Hearst Magazines. Ms. Lewis took the place of the veteran editor and publishing executive Joanna Coles, who left the publisher shortly after Mr. Young's promotion last summer.
The exit of Mr. Fielden seems in keeping with the earlier changes made under Mr. Young. An editor with a fondness for literature and high fashion may no longer be the Esquire man.

Batali Faces Accusation Of Assault From 2017

Texto completo: The celebrity chef Mario Batali, who built a formidable restaurant empire before retreating amid accusations of sexual harassment by several women, has been charged with indecent assault and battery stemming from an allegation that he groped and kissed a woman at a Boston restaurant in 2017.
Mr. Batali, 58, is to be arraigned in Boston on Friday, according to court documents. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and be required to register as a sex offender.
The criminal complaint was filed last month, and it said that a woman had told the police that Mr. Batali kissed her and groped her chest and groin at a Boston restaurant two years ago.
According to the complaint, the woman was eating dinner with a friend at Towne Stove and Spirits, a bar in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood that has since closed, when she spotted Mr. Batali sitting nearby.
Mr. Batali had observed her taking a photo of him with her phone, and told her to "come here right now," the complaint said. She went over to apologize and to tell him she would erase it, she told the police, but instead, he offered to take a selfie with her -- and grabbed her as they posed.
The complaint matched an allegation made by Natali Tene, who filed a lawsuit against Mr. Batali in August.
In a statement on Thursday, Ms. Tene's lawyers said that she was grateful that the charge had been filed. The lawyers, Eric M. Baum and Matthew J. Fogelman, said that Mr. Batali should be held accountable "criminally and civilly" for his actions.
A lawyer for Mr. Batali, Anthony E. Fuller, disputed Ms. Tene's account.
"Mr. Batali denies the allegations in both this criminal complaint and the civil complaint filed last August," Mr. Fuller said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday. "The charges, brought by the same individual without any new basis, are without merit. He intends to fight the allegations vigorously and we expect the outcome to fully vindicate Mr. Batali."
Last year, three other women also told the police in New York that Mr. Batali had sexually assaulted them years earlier at two Manhattan restaurants where he was an owner or an investor. But a New York Police Department official confirmed in January that it had closed those investigations because of a lack of evidence and limits imposed by the statute of limitations.
Of the several famous chefs and restaurateurs to have been accused of sexual harassment, Mr. Batali was the first to surrender all of his restaurants; his former business partners bought the shares he used to own at his hospitality company in March. Mr. Batali also sold his shares in Eataly, the fast-growing global chain of luxury Italian supermarkets.
That came more than a year after Mr. Batali had stepped away from the daily operations of his restaurants, and from "The Chew," a daytime television show he co-hosted on ABC.
At its peak, Mr. Batali's empire encompassed dozens of restaurants and food businesses in the United States, Singapore, Italy and Hong Kong. Splashy restaurants like Babbo and Del Posto made celebrities of Mr. Batali and the Bastianich family of restaurateurs he often partnered with.
But in December 2017, a report was published on Eater, the food website, that said four women had alleged that Mr. Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that seemed to span decades. Three of the women had worked for Mr. Batali, and the fourth worked in the restaurant industry, Eater reported.
In response, Mr. Batali apologized. "Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted," he said. "That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses."

Defamation Settlement Sets Australian Record for Payout

Texto completo: MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Oscar-winning Australian actor Geoffrey Rush will be awarded 2.9 million Australian dollars in his defamation case against Rupert Murdoch's Nationwide News, a court said on Thursday, the largest such payout to a single person in Australia's history.
Mr. Rush was awarded 850,000 dollars, or about $ 600,000, in initial damages in April after winning his defamation case, in which he accused a tabloid newspaper of wrongly portraying him as having behaved inappropriately toward a female co-star.
On Thursday, he was awarded an additional 1.98 million Australian dollars for past and future economic losses and 42,000 dollars in interest. That brought the total award to 2.9 million Australian dollars, or nearly $ 2 million.
"Geoffrey Rush obviously has won the battle -- he is a spectacular winner in the context of litigation," said Matt Collins, an Australian lawyer who is an expert in defamation law. "But you would query whether he has ultimately won the war. You would query whether any sum of money would be sufficient to restore his reputation."
Mr. Rush's lawyer, Sue Chrysanthou, declined to comment.
The actor's defamation case involved two front-page articles published in late 2017 by The Daily Telegraph, a Sydney newspaper.
The articles alleged unseemly conduct by Mr. Rush toward an unidentified female actress in a Sydney Theater Company production of "King Lear" from 2015 to 2016. One of the articles was accompanied by a photo of Mr. Rush in costume under the headline "King Leer." The actress was later revealed to be Eryn Jean Norvill.
In a much-publicized trial, Mr. Rush, 67, a star of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" series and other films, argued that the articles incorrectly depicted him as a "pervert" and a "sexual predator."
Mr. Rush's lawyer said in court on Thursday that the actor had offered earlier to settle the case, asking Nationwide News to pay him 50,000 dollars as well as cover his legal costs and issue an apology. He also asked for the articles to be removed. Nationwide News declined.
The April verdict was seen as a blow for the #MeToo movement in Australia; advocates say the country's strict defamation laws have helped keep it from gaining steam. The case was closely watched in part because it was a test of whether a celebrity of Mr. Rush's stature could fend off #MeToo accusations through a defamation claim.
The record damages awarded on Thursday follow a spate of high-profile defamation cases in Australia.
In 2017, Bauer Media was ordered to pay the Australian actress Rebel Wilson 4.7 million dollars, over a series of magazine articles in 2015 that painted her as a serial liar. That amount was reduced to 600,000 dollars by an appeals court, which found a lack of evidence that she had suffered an economic loss of the magnitude of the original award.
Also in 2017, the police were ordered to pay 2.6 million dollars in damages to a Perth-based lawyer, Lloyd Rayney, after he claimed he had been defamed for being called the "prime" suspect in his wife's murder.
"We had a flight of very high-profile defamation cases in Australia over the last few years, and the trend has been towards increasing damages awarded," said Mr. Collins, the defamation law expert.
In Mr. Rush's case, the amount of the economic losses was agreed to between the parties, rather than imposed by the court. Mr. Rush originally asked for more than 20 million dollars in damages.
Nationwide News is appealing the defamation verdict. If Mr. Rush loses the appeal, Nationwide News will not have to pay any damages.
A cornerstone of the appeal is the evidence of "Witness X," identified this month as the Australian actress Yael Stone, 34, who is best known for her role in the Netflix show "Orange is the New Black."
Midway through the trial last year, Nationwide News called on "Witness X" to provide evidence. Justice Michael Wigney, who presided over the case, rejected the bid and ordered Ms. Stone's identity suppressed.
In an interview published in December, Ms. Stone told The New York Times that Mr. Rush had behaved inappropriately toward her during a 2010-11 Sydney production of "The Diary of a Madman."
She said that Mr. Rush had danced naked in front of her, sent her erotic text messages and used a mirror to watch her shower.
The actor said in a statement at the time that Ms. Stone's allegations were "incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context."
Ms. Norvill, for her part, testified last year that Mr. Rush had sexually harassed her, saying he had made "groping" and "cupping" gestures toward her breasts.
She said he also "deliberately" stroked her breast in front of a theater audience and on a separate occasion traced her lower back along the waistline of her jeans with his fingertips.

Texto completo: Editor's note: This article is a part of a series reviewing Utah history for KSL.com's Historic section.
SALT LAKE CITY — There’s a special reverence the Meditation Chapel brings to Memory Grove. Tucked near the edge of a glen at the center of the park, 375 N Canyon Road, the small pink marble structure is somehow both a busy and quiet spot for a park that’s typically buzzing with families and pets throughout the year.
Inside, there are gorgeous stained glass windows representing all branches of the military and the Francesca Falk Miller poem “Immortality” is etched in gold leaf. There are scores of markers outside of the building bearing the names of the military members who died during World War II and whose bodies were never recovered.
However, its beauty hasn’t always been the case. What started as a touching gesture from two grieving parents of a fallen Utah soldier seven decades ago eventually turned into a forgotten portion of the park’s history. That changed 20 years ago, and it remains a beacon of remembering the ultimate military sacrifice to this day.
The story of the chapel begins in the 1940s. U.S. Air Force Second Lt. Ross Beason, Jr., 22, of Salt Lake City, was declared missing in action on April 15, 1944, when his aircraft was hit in battle and ditched in the Tyrrhenian Sea. His body was never recovered. In all, Beason was one of more than 300 Utahns whose bodies never returned to Utah following World War II.
His father, Ross Beason, Sr., worked in the securities business in Salt Lake City and was “a pioneer in the investment trust field” who had retired by the time his son went missing in action, according to a 1964 Associated Press article archived by the New York Times.
Beason, Sr. also moved to Los Angeles about the same time. However, he and his wife, Elvera Beason, wanted to honor his son as much as they could. They created different projects to honor their only son. They started a scholarship fund at Westminster and funded a recreation hall at the Culver Military Academy in Indiana in their son’s name and the chapel at Memory Grove.
Instead of a memorial for their son, the Beasons wanted the chapel to be a monument for all the Utah families who suffered the unimaginable like them — a way to remember all of Utah’s World War II soldiers who never received a proper burial.
According to a 1948 Deseret News report, the Beasons paid $125,000 out of pocket “to build the finest memorial possible to fighting men.” According to currency inflation calculators, that’d equate to roughly $1.3 million today.
“Anyone who has a relative born in Utah, killed in action with one of the four fighting branches, is entitled to a marker at the Meditation Chapel site,” Beason Sr. said prior to the dedication.
Elvera Beason sadly died before it was dedicated on July 25, 1948. She didn’t get a chance to see the large turnout that day. News reports from the day indicate that dedication service was a major deal. Some of the nation’s top-ranking military leaders were among the some 10,000 who attended the dedication ceremony. One of those, Air Force Gen. Carl Spaatz, spoke on behalf of President Harry Truman. Utah Gov. Herbert Maw also spoke at the event.
“The little chapel gained a soul, a tear of those high in military rank mingled with those of bereaved mothers and wives,” the Provo Daily Herald reported in a July 26, 1948, edition of the newspaper. “Peace and reverence prevailed where thousands of Utahns began assembling long before the first bugle call.”
Gold Star families — four people at a time — were given the first tour inside the chapel after the speakers concluded, according to a July 26, 1948, edition of the Deseret News. The Tabernacle Choir sang to conclude the event.
Given the fanfare that day, it’s hard to believe that the memorial wasn’t well kept over time. Ross Beason, Sr. died in 1964. By the 1970s, vandalism and neglect made the chapel less desirable.
“All the windows were broken — some by bullets — the floor was crumbling, the landscape was running wild. The city finally just boarded up the place,” the Deseret News reported in April 1999.
That same year, the Utah Heritage Foundation oversaw a $30,000 revitalization project that restored the building to its current state. That’s when the stained glass windows were installed and more than 300 granite markers with the names of fallen Utah soldiers were placed there.
In 2012, the Deseret News located Ross Beason III in Arizona. He was just 6 weeks old when his father was listed as Missing in Action.
"I've never understood people saying I was shortchanged because I didn't have a dad,” he told the newspaper. “I felt like I had one because he was always part of the conversation and he was always there in spirit. In a way, I feel like he's still here."
It’s the spirit that’s felt at the Meditation Chapel 71 years after it was first dedicated and after its renovation 20 years ago.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Current and former military officers urged the White House not to pardon service members and security contractors implicated in war crimes, warning that forgiving their offenses would send a dangerous signal to U.S. troops and potential adversaries.
Aides to President Donald Trump have been examining high-profile war crimes cases from Iraq and Afghanistan, preparing paperwork so Trump could issue pardons during Memorial Day commemorations next week, according to two senior U.S. officials.
But the possibility that Trump could issue pardons has brought a flood of opposition from current and former high-ranking officers, who say it would encourage misconduct by showing that violations of laws prohibiting attacks on civilians and prisoners of war will be treated with leniency.
"Absent evidence of innocence or injustice, the wholesale pardon of U.S. service members accused of war crimes signals our troops and allies that we don't take the law of armed conflict seriously," retired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a tweet Tuesday.
He added: "Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us."
Among those under consideration for a pardon is Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL awaiting court-martial on charges that he shot unarmed civilians and stabbed a teenage Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017, according to one of the officials, who discussed the internal deliberations in return for anonymity.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty and commentators on Fox News have lobbied Trump to pardon him.
Other cases being examined by the White House include those of Army Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, who is charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; three Marine snipers prosecuted for urinating on the corpse of a dead Afghan fighter in 2011; and a former security guard for Blackwater Worldwide who was convicted of murder in December for killing unarmed Iraqis in 2007.
Other officers warned that if U.S. personnel accused of such crimes escaped punishment, civilians on foreign battlefields would be less inclined to cooperate with U.S. forces, and U.S. service members taken prisoners would be more likely to be mistreated or even killed when taken captive.
"If President Trump issues indiscriminate pardons of individuals accused - or convicted by their fellow service members - of war crimes, he relinquishes the United States' moral high ground and undermines the good order and discipline critical to winning on the battlefield," said retired Gen. Charles Krulak, a former commandant of the Marine Corps.
Several officials said Trump is not believed to have consulted his senior military advisers about issuing pardons. The possibility of military pardons was first reported by The New York Times.
Senior officers have not spoken out publicly about the possibility Trump could pardon accused war criminals, but many are privately outraged, according to one currently serving at the Pentagon.
Asked about the possibility that Trump would pardon service members, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told reporters Tuesday: "I'm not really going to speculate on any of the pardons, but I would just say we'll leave it to the White House to comment on the situation there."
Trump has repeatedly bypassed normal procedures for issuing pardons and granting clemency, seizing on cases mentioned on Fox News or that resonate with him or his supporters.
This month, he pardoned Army Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted of killing an Iraqi during questioning in 2008.

Explain Iranian endgame

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that's not what we're getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, "I hope not," to a reporter's shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he's not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U.S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran's nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There's no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran "conform to the normal things that normal nations do," Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn't believe this himself. "I just don't see it," the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump's other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn't worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U.S.-led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U.S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a "deal" to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan?
Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can't convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.
If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Chancellor of Austria Faces Prospect of No-Confidence Vote as Coalition Unravels

Texto completo: VIENNA -- Austria's president praised the "elegance" of the country's Constitution on Tuesday, seeking to calm concerns as the crisis that has torn apart Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's right-wing coalition government accelerated on Tuesday, putting his future in doubt.
Mr. Kurz, who had sought an early election in September and is preparing to lead a minority government until then, now faces the prospect of a no-confidence vote that could eject him from power within days. A technocratic administration would then take over until elections could be scheduled, probably in June or early July.
The governing coalition, an alliance between Mr. Kurz's conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party, began to unravel on Saturday, when a video emerged showing the far-right party's leader discussing an exchange of favors with a woman claiming to be a Russian oligarch's niece.
The days since have seen the once stable country rocked by political turmoil that could spell disaster for the ambitious young chancellor, once hailed as a rising star of Europe's conservatives.
The Freedom Party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, resigned as vice chancellor on Saturday, and Mr. Kurz called for early elections the same day. On Monday, he then called for the firing of the Freedom Party interior minister, Herbert Kickl, saying he could not rely on him to properly investigate the scandal surrounding Mr. Strache. In response, the party's three remaining ministers submitted their resignations.
"These are confusing times," President Alexander van der Bellen told reporters on Tuesday after meeting with Mr. Kurz. "We are charting new territory, but there is no reason to be concerned," the president added, "for it is in times like these that the elegance and beauty of our Constitution is evident."
Mr. van der Bellen, a former Green Party leader who narrowly defeated a challenger from the Freedom Party in 2016, said that he had accepted the dismissals and resignations of the far-right members of government, who were expected to be replaced by technocrats and civil servants until a new government could take power.
But that could now happen sooner than expected. Opposition parties have proposed a vote of no confidence against Mr. Kurz. The president of the Austrian Parliament, Wolfgang Sobotka, a member of Mr. Kurz's conservative party, has scheduled a special session for the vote for Monday, the day after the country's European Parliament elections.
Without the support of the Freedom Party, Mr. Kurz's conservatives do not have a majority in Parliament. By appointing technocrats to fill the vacated ministries, the chancellor had said he could ensure the country's stability by continuing to govern in the coming months, when key decisions at the European level are expected, following the election of a new European Parliament in Brussels.
Mr. Kurz is expected to propose experts who could take over the vacated ministries.
In seeking a no-confidence vote, Peter Pilz, the leader of the Jetzt, or Now, party, called for the entire government to be replaced with experts, a move that has the support of Austria's Socialists, the leading opposition party in Parliament.
"In the past two years, Sebastian Kurz has brought down two governments," Mr. Pilz wrote. "Stability in the current situation cannot be achieved through an election cabinet picked by Mr. Kurz, but only by an independent government."
It was not clear whether the Freedom Party would vote against Mr. Kurz, but recent comments from Mr. Kickl may not give the chancellor much hope.
"It would be almost naïve of Kurz to think that after his distrust of us, we in the Freedom Party would not mistrust him," he told the daily newspaper Österreich on Tuesday. "Mistrust is earned by those who mistrust."
One minister associated with the Freedom Party remains in office: Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl, an independent who was appointed by the party and attracted international attention last year for dancing with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
Ms. Kneissl said in a statement: "As an independent expert, I feel obligated to continue the course that I have charted for our country, especially now, and to continue to serve."
The Freedom Party has longstanding ties to Russia and in 2016 signed a cooperation agreement with Mr. Putin's party. Its members, including Mr. Strache, have been visitors to Moscow.
On the video, apparently filmed without Mr. Strache's knowledge, and obtained and published by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, Mr. Strache could be heard praising Russia and Eastern Europe as "normal," compared to what he called the "decadent" West. The New York Times could not independently verify the contents of the entire video.

Texto completo: The streak goes on.
James Holzhauer, whose amazing "Jeopardy!" performance has put the spotlight on the venerable quiz show, added to his legacy Tuesday with his 24th consecutive win.
The 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas pocketed $86,905 with his latest victory, bringing his total winnings to a whopping $1,867,142.
Holzhauer already was firmly entrenched in the No. 2 spot for most "Jeopardy!" victories and prize money before Tuesday's win. He trails only Ken Jennings, who remains in the top spot on both lists: 74 victories and $2,520,700 in prize money.
Monday: 'Jeopardy!' champ James Holzhauer wins again for the 23rd time, pushing winnings to $1. 7M
Holzhauer remains far from Jennings' win total but he's closing in on the money crown based on a playing strategy that features picking higher-dollar clues first and betting aggressively on Daily Doubles.
If anything, the size of Holzhauer's money hauls is even more impressive than his streak. He holds the single-day record for prize money, $131,127 (April 9), having beaten a record he previously set.
Holzhauer's average daily winnings of $77,798 over 24 wins now eclipses the previous one-day high, $77,000, set by Roger Craig in 2010. If he keeps winning and continues at that pace, he will cross the $2 million mark before the end of this week and will be within range of Jennings' money mark with fewer than 10 more victories.
Holzhauer explained his strategy last month in a Q&A with The New York Times.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer" in his analysis of Holzhauer's play.
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first," Timanus says. "Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a Daily Double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big. "
"Jeopardy!" and host Alex Trebek are celebrating their 35th anniversary season. With a weekly audience of 23 million viewers, it's the top-rated quiz show on television.

Texto completo: SPYING ON THE SOUTH: An Odyssey Across the American Divide, by Tony Horwitz. Penguin Press, 476 pp., $30.   
Most people who remember Frederick Law Olmsted credit him with two magnificent accomplishments: his role in the design and construction of both Manhattan's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park. His legacy lives on in dozens of Olmsted-designed or inspired parks throughout the country.
Olmsted was a complicated man; before he settled on creating parks, he was a farmer, a public health worker and, as a young man, a journalist. In the 1850s Olmsted set out to travel the length of the South, in search of the truth of the region and its stubborn embrace of slavery. His dispatches ran in the New-York Daily Times (The New York Times - the newspaper dropped the "Daily" in 1857) and influenced the course of the debate on abolition and, eventually, the war. By the end of his journey he had embraced the abolitionist movement, supporting an effort to settle West Texas with anti-slavery advocates.
Tony Horwitz, an accomplished journalist and author ("Confederates in the Attic," "Blue Latitudes"), set out to retrace Olmsted's journey and record his own 21st century impressions. The result is "Spying on the South: An Odyssey Across the American Divide." Readers will find many parallels between the journeys and perspectives of the two men.
Horwitz follows, as best he can, Olmsted's meandering trajectory. Traveling by train, boat, car and mule through West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, he drops in on a varied group of communities. He visits hollowed-out West Virginia towns devastated by unemployment and the opioid epidemic, where hard times have turned longtime Democrats toward President Donald Trump. He finds the exuberant Cajuns of southern Louisiana following in their ancestors' dance steps; in one of many eerie historic parallels, one local informant offered Olmsted this description of the Cajun temperament: "habitually gay and careless, as well as kind-hearted, hospitable and dissolute." Like Olmsted, Horwitz encounters intractable racism in East Texas.
Along the way, his literary companion, the "long-dead Fred," makes for wonderful reading. Olmsted could write - humorous, opinionated and vivid, dropping gems of description everywhere. But Olmsted's position as a well-situated Northerner occasionally blinkered his vision, and to some degree Horwitz follows suit. Olmsted complained about the tacky villages he passed on his river journeys (it's the frontier, mate), and on a quick visit to Nashville, Horwitz, who calls Martha's Vineyard home, laments that "Music City felt like a themed, blocks-long mall anchored by familiar brands." Fair enough, but he skips the city's beautiful old neighborhoods, its extensive 3,100-acre Warner Parks system and its crown jewel, Vanderbilt University.
Both men are food snobs. Olmsted declaimed at length on his loathing of corn pone, missing the obvious fact that it was the staple of poor people who had nothing else to eat. Horwitz despairs of the unhealthy fare in Southern restaurants, apparently unaware of the regional food renaissance blooming in booming Southern cities like Atlanta and Little Rock, Arkansas.
Horwitz doesn't linger in multicultural Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, because it was "way too big and complicated to get my arms around as a blow-through traveler." There are few young adults in his telling, people in their 20s and 30s using their smarts and imaginations in the fields of politics, business and education. He loves the absurd, and he's willing to venture anywhere in the service of a good story, but when a disaffected traveling companion calls him "the concierge of crap," I couldn't disagree.
Horwitz is a dedicated, imaginative reporter and a great raconteur, but this book is one man's travelogue, not an in-depth report from, as the subtitle puts it, "the other side of the American divide." Read it for its humor, for Horwitz's thorough excavation of Southern history and for the delights of Olmsted's own dispatches. For the truth of today's South, go and see for yourself.

'Pearls Before Swine' on comics page

Texto completo: Since "Pearls Before Swine" debuted two decades ago, cartoonist Stephan Pastis has created a menagerie of characters — though, as far as menageries go, this group is decidedly unexotic.
There is the enraged and egocentric Rat, a pleasant but somewhat dippy Pig, the pragmatic and ruminative Goat, a benevolent Zebra and a fraternity of imbecilic Crocodiles with carnivorous desires.
All of them arrived this week in The Leaf-Chronicle, in a new daily full-color strip.
"Pearls" appears in 750 newspapers worldwide, making Pastis one of the biggest cartoonists still creating comics.
But that might pale in comparison to one of his proudest moments: He once persuaded a comic recluse, "Calvin and Hobbes" creator Bill Watterson, to come out of retirement and draw "Pearls" for a week.
It's the life he's always wanted.
Pastis grew up consuming every comic he could by "Peanuts" creator Charles Schulz and testing out his own creative cynicism with the Pastis Family Gazette — a National Enquirer-style family newspaper that he posted on the fridge with all the scandalous stories about his sisters.
From the start, Pastis wanted to be a syndicated cartoonist. And, yes, specifically "syndicated." He learned the term when he read a "Peanuts" 25th anniversary book. And it stuck.
"That was the spark," he says. "No question."
Flirting with the law But, as with all the best-laid plans of men and, in this case, a Rat, not mice, there was a diversion. Somewhere along the way, Pastis realized the odds of actually becoming a syndicated cartoonist are crazy.
"It's like winning the lottery," he says. "So, if you bet on it, it's like saying my future is buying lottery tickets."
Instead of seeking a scratch-off-filled future, he became a lawyer. He went to Berkeley for undergrad and UCLA law school. He spent nine years as an attorney. All in litigation. All defending big insurance companies. All of which he hated.
Passion on the side But, on the side, he would draw. He came up with Rat — then a less highly evolved being who walked on four legs, not two — while doodling in the notebook margins during a boring law school class on the European economic community.
Eventually, Pastis submitted the made-in-his-spare-time strips to all the big syndicates. After repeated rejections, the work appeared online. It didn't take long for Pastis to earn praise from fellow cartoonists, including "Dilbert" creator Scott Adams. In 2002, "Pearls" made its newspaper debut.
"When I was 10 imaging my dream of life, now I am doing that exact thing," Pastis says. "And I don't know how many people can say that."
Meet the cast Rat: Arrogant, self-centered, fatalistic, philosophical and quick-tempered, Rat is obsessed with fame, immortality and making a quick buck. Spends his time with Pig because it makes him feel superior and, more importantly, no one else will hang out with him.
Pig: Humble (in fact, painfully aware of his limitations), practical, kind and a little slow in the head, Pig has few aspirations in life, other than to spend his days watching TV and doing almost nothing productive. Apparently sees something redeeming in Rat, and is willing to endure Rat's endless barbs and schemes. Kicked out of the Society of Cultured Pigs because he was caught eating a B.L.T.
Zebra: The humanitarian (or, more accurately, "zebratarian"). Focused almost solely on devising ways to protect his fellow zebras on the plains from their numerous, more able predators. Must endure repeated failures in this endeavor, as the lions, tigers and crocodiles always win out.
Goat: The smart one. Would rather spend his time with his snout in a book than talking to any of the other odd characters in this strip, but he nonetheless finds himself in the role of reluctant mentor.
Guard Duck: Pig's loyal, but violent and unstable duck. He sits in a bunker on Pig's front lawn, defending the property against mailmen, Girl Scouts and offensive neighbors.
Jessica Bliss contributed to this report.
Stephan Pastis writes and draws the award-winning comic strip "Pearls Before Swine" and his New York Times bestselling kids book series "Timmy Failure."

TRUMP IS GREAT FOR WISCONSIN AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY; ; GUEST COLUMN

Texto completo: In Wednesday's editorial, "The real problem for Wisconsin Republicans is Trump," the State Journal editorial board argued that Trump is bad for the GOP.
But Trump managed to do something Republicans were unable to do for over 30 years: win Wisconsin in a presidential election.
With growth in the manufacturing sector, Trump's economy is benefiting Wisconsin and the nation, and his politics are helping the Republican Party grow. Trump is great for Wisconsin and the GOP.
The editorial board gets it wrong on Trump and his benefits to the state and party. Trump's policies are particularly great for Wisconsin. The editorial dismisses Trump's "strong economy," but it is important to examine how the economy is benefiting Wisconsinites. For too long, Wisconsin has been ignored as flyover country from Washington elites.
Regulatory reform and tax cuts have the national economy booming. In the third quarter of last year, wages were up 3.1% (the highest jump in a decade).
Since Trump became president, more than 5 million new jobs have been added, with 263,000 jobs added in April alone. The official unemployment rate is now 3.6%, which is the lowest in nearly half a century.
Wisconsin has long had a strong manufacturing sector, and President Barack Obama famously predicted the manufacturing jobs weren't coming back. But Trump has been especially great for manufacturing, as manufacturers added six times more jobs in Trump's first 2 years than under Obama's last two.
Wisconsin wages grew 4.39% from 2016 to 2017 for median household income.
Trump is also growing the Republican Party. The State Journal editorial board claims Trump is "hardly conservative" and purport to give the Republican Party some advice: to distance themselves from President Trump.
The president's conservative accomplishments are impressive though: appointing two conservative Supreme Court justices, passing tax reform, cutting Planned Parenthood funding, slashing $16.4 billion of regulations, and finally starting to renegotiate bad trade deals.
The list goes on and on.
Trump's approval rating among his political party was higher on his 500th day in office than any post-war president (except George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks). So his Republican Party popularity is through the roof.
Trump is in a much better position that he was in 2016, and that is good news for the Republican Party of Wisconsin. In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton while having a 35% favorable rating by the final Marquette Law School Poll of 2016. The best comparison to that favorability rating is the job approval number, and in the same poll he is at 46% approval.
Importantly, Trump is trending up significantly in key areas since 2016: He's up 19% in the Milwaukee market (excluding the city), up 5% in Milwaukee, up 6% in the Green Bay and Appleton market, up 12% in the Madison market, and up 10% in the rest of the state. And 91% of Wisconsin Republicans approve of the job he is doing as president. With Trump's increased popularity, he can help the party reach new voters in rural Wisconsin, as he did in 2016. The New York Times recently did a piece on Trump's re-election prospects in Wisconsin, and they couldn't even find a Democrat who thought Trump would lose Wisconsin in 2020.
President Trump's brand of fighting against the Washington, D.C., bureaucrats and putting America first is strong in Wisconsin. Trump is popular with the Republican Party and can help them gain new voters. With a strong economy and more manufacturing jobs, Trump is delivering for Wisconsin. The Democrats' moves toward socialism will only help Trump make the case that he is great for Wisconsin. CREDIT: MATT BATZEL

Texto completo: Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has lots of student loan debt and received a $75,000 advance for his political memoir, according to a financial document he filed this week.
Those details were part of an annual personal financial disclosure form that candidates must submit within 30 days of filing a president candidacy, which Buttigieg officially announced April 14. IndyStar obtained the document through a records request Wednesday, the day after he filed the form.
Buttigieg, of course, lists his occupation as mayor of South Bend. His annual income for running the state's fourth-largest city is $149,725, according to the document.
That puts him among the highest-paid mayors in Indiana, likely the highest. While the state doesn't keep a list of mayoral salaries by city, IndyStar has reported Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard will make $148,786 in 2019; Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson, $142,000; and Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness, $135,174.
Buttigieg also plays the stock market. He, and his husband, Chasten, have invested as much as $50,000 in Apple, and up to $15,000 in Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. Income on those was between $2,702 and $6,000.
Buttigieg also disclosed somewhere between $4,004 and $62,000 in various other stock funds and listed income of $2,702 to $6,800. Much has been made of Buttigieg's education. After all, he graduated from Harvard and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford.
The document revealed some detail about the price. He listed student loans, somewhere between $140,004 and $360,000 over the next 25 years. The interest rates range from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.
A campaign spokesman said the loans include Chasten Buttigieg's education. He has a master's from DePaul University and a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin.
And about that book deal. The disclosure form includes an attachment that notes Buttigieg agreed to a $75,000 advance from Liveright Publishing Corp., June 15, 2017, on his New York Times-bestselling political memoir, "Shortest Way Home." His working title, abandoned at some point along the way, was "Letters from Flyover Country."
That's not to be confused with an essay he wrote shortly after the 2016 presidential election, "A Letter from Flyover Country," which focused on how Democrats could succeed in Middle America.
He also has the opportunity to make royalties on his book based on sales, but it's unclear when those kick in.
He's received $3,000 for an audio version through Recorded Books Inc. It's unclear how much more, if any, he might make on that portion of the deal.
The disclosure also notes he's on the boards of the South Bend Symphony Orchestra, with which he's known to play piano, the South Bend Education Foundation, Veterans Community Connections and Accelerate Indiana Municipalities, which is Indiana's city and towns advocacy group. He lists no income from those volunteer positions.
The form notes his husband, Chasten, left his job at Montessori Academy in Mishawaka in January, and continues to work part-time at the South Bend Civic Theatre. No income data is provided.

Movie review: ‘The Sun is Also a Star’ aesthetically shines, but it’s dimmed by dialogue

Texto completo: 2.5 out of 4 stars
Cast: Yara Shahidi, Charles Melton, John Leguizamo
Director: Ry Russo-Young
Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes.
Rating: PG-13 (for some suggestive content and language)
Showing at: Capitol 12
Teenagers need melodrama. They always have. It seems its big, sweeping emotions are somehow the only things that can match the high-stakes, hormone-enhanced teenage feelings. Director Ry Russo-Young excels at rendering those emotions with a singular sense of artfulness. In “The Sun is Also a Star,” Russo-Young swirls together sun-dappled selfies, luscious skin, urban grittiness and hip-hop beats, the aesthetics perfectly matched to emotion. She creates a heady, knee-buckling mood that nearly conceals the weaknesses in story and performances.
The film is the feature adaptation of Nicola Yoon’s second novel. Her first, “Everything, Everything,” also went on to success as a movie adaptation, starring Amandla Stenberg and Nick Robinson in a swoony take on a Bubble Boy story. The sick teen genre is a well of deep potential with its heightened stakes and ticking clock. And in the structural sense, “The Sun is Also a Star” is also a sick teen movie – without sickness. But the stakes are high and the clock is ticking – on a mandatory deportation from the United States.
Yara Shahidi (of “black-ish” and “grown-ish”) stars as Natasha, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants but a New Yorker through and through. The day before her family is set to be deported back to Jamaica, she makes a last-ditch attempt to change their fate by pleading their case to an immigration lawyer. She’s spotted in Grand Central Station by Daniel (“Riverdale” star Charles Melton), who notices she’s staring at the starry ceiling, and he interprets her “Deus Ex Machina” jacket as a sign. Daniel is a poet, a dreamer and believer in destiny, and he takes off after her. First he saves her from a speeding BMW in Chinatown, then persuades the science-driven Natasha to spend some time doing the “36 Questions” love study from the New York Times. “Give me a day,” he says, “and you’ll fall in love with me.”
Easy for the easy-on-the-eyes Melton to say! Shahidi and Melton both possess an otherworldly kind of beauty, and combined with Russo-Young’s lush, rhythmic cinematic style, you could just watch them bop around the city for hours, all shiny hair and plush lips. But then, they open their mouths and the spell is broken. The dialogue (the script is by Tracy Oliver) just grinds things to a halt, with speeches that are a bit too on the nose, and too-grand declarations of love. Then again, all those things seem so profound and meaningful at that age.
As pretty as Shahidi and Melton are, they just don’t share a palpable chemistry. Shahidi is undoubtedly a star, and while Melton is charming and gorgeous with a goofy puppy-dog energy, the more dramatic moments demonstrate the upper limitations of his range. Shahidi’s few short scenes with immigration lawyer John Leguizamo are far more riveting.
That’s somewhat covered up by Russo-Young’s impressive filmmaking. A New York City native, she captures the arresting energy of the city while imbuing the film with a sense of lyricism and grace, as if the streets are sprinkled with magical fairy dust. The world looks the way it feels when you’re falling in love, like everything is at its best, and everything makes sense. When you’re looking at the world through love-colored glasses, destiny doesn’t seem so far-fetched, and Russo-Young offers up a glimpse.

TRUMP SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT WAR WITH IRAN HARDLINER ADVISERS RAMPING UP PRESSURE

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has sought to put the brakes on a brewing confrontation with Iran in recent days, telling the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, that he does not want to go to war with Iran, administration officials said, while his senior diplomats began searching for ways to defuse the tensions.
Mr. Trump's statement, during a Wednesday morning meeting in the Situation Room, sent a message to his hawkish aides that he does not want the intensifying American pressure campaign against the Iranians to explode into open conflict.
For now, an administration that had appeared to be girding for conflict seems more determined to find a diplomatic off-ramp.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the leader of Oman, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, on Wednesday to confer about the threat posed by Iran, according to a statement. Long an intermediary between the West and Iran, Oman was a site of a secret channel in 2013 when the Obama administration was negotiating a nuclear agreement with Iran.
Mr. Pompeo also asked European officials for help in persuading Iran to "de-escalate" tensions, which rose after American intelligence indicated that Iran had placed missiles on small boats in the Persian Gulf. The intelligence, which was based on photographs that have not been released but were described to The New York Times, prompted fears that Tehran may strike at United States troops and assets or those of its allies.
Those tensions are already being felt in parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Early Thursday, huge explosions rocked the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, as warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition carried out airstrikes against targets linked to the Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels who control most of northern Yemen.
Concerns about possible conflict have flared after the U.S. dispatched warships and bombers to the region to counter an alleged but unspecified threat from Iran. There also have been allegations that four oil tankers were sabotaged Sunday off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and Houthis claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack on the Saudi pipeline. Also, a state-aligned Saudi newspaper made international headlines for an editorial calling for "surgical" U.S. strikes on Iran in retaliation.
Asked on Thursday whether the United States was going to war with Iran, Mr. Trump replied, "I hope not." And Mr. Trump has said in tweets that he hopes to meet or speak with Iran's leaders, but the country's vice president said Thursday they will talk to the U.S. only if it rejoins the 2015 accord.
The developments cast into sharp relief a president who is instinctively wary of military adventures and a cadre of advisers - led by the national security adviser, John Bolton - who have taken an uncompromising line toward Iran. The internal tensions have prompted fears that the Trump administration is spoiling for a fight, even if the commander in chief may not be.
Those divisions are playing out against a fierce internal debate among administration officials about the gravity of the Iranian threat. While officials and British allies say the intelligence about the threat is valid, lawmakers and some inside the administration accuse Mr. Trump's aides of exaggerating the danger and exploiting the intelligence to justify a military clash with Tehran.
The administration's internal debate over Iran was described by five senior officials who demanded anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations.
Iran dismissed any suggestion of a dialogue with Mr. Trump. "The escalation by the United States is unacceptable," the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Thursday.
Indeed, there was a new potential flash point in Iran's standoff with the United States, stemming from its vow last week to step away from some of the limitations imposed by the nuclear deal, a year after Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the agreement that was negotiated between Tehran and world powers in 2015.
State Department officials, speaking to reporters, set a red line that they warned Iran would cross at its peril: It could not ramp up its nuclear fuel production to the point where it could produce a nuclear weapon in less than one year.
The officials did not specify what kind of reaction - military or otherwise - would come if Iran built up enough of a stockpile of uranium and took other steps to cross that threshold.

Maine author Richard Ford to receive Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction

Texto completo: Boothbay resident Richard Ford, whose novel "Independence Day" was the first to win both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award, will receive the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction.
The honor was announced Thursday by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. Ford will receive the prize Aug. 31 during the 2019 Library of Congress National Book Festival in Washington, D.C.
"He has been called our Babe Ruth of novelists, and there is good reason why," Hayden said in announcing the prize. "He is quintessentially American, profoundly humane, meticulous in his craft, daring on the field, and he hits it consistently out of the park.
Hayden also called Ford "one of the most eloquent writers of his generation."

The annual prize honors an American literary writer whose body of work is distinguished not only for its mastery of the art but also for its originality of thought and imagination. The award seeks to commend strong, unique, enduring voices that -- throughout long, consistently accomplished careers -- have told us something essential about the American experience, according to the Library of Congress.
"The good fortune of being given this prize -- even apart from its private encouragement -- is to be allowed to participate in what I've always taken to be the library's great achievement: to encourage literacy, to advocate for the primacy of the literary arts and to draw closer to the needs of readers," Ford said. "The Library of Congress' Prize for American Fiction makes me feel -- accurately or not -- what most novelists would like to feel, which is useful to our country's conversation with the world."
Ford was born in 1944 in Jackson, Mississippi, and grew up between there and Little Rock, Arkansas. He earned degrees from Michigan State University and the University of California at Irvine, where he studied under 2014 Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction winner E.L. Doctorow.
Ford has written seven novels, as well as the New York Times bestselling novella collection "Let Me Be Frank with You" and a memoir, "Between Them: Remembering My Parents." His books have been translated into 35 foreign languages.
He lives in Boothbay with his wife, Kristina Ford.

Don't Just Sit There. Quit Something.

Texto completo: You don't get to be the editor of the "Smarter Living" section of The New York Times without a great resume and a lot of talent. (You also don't get to be editor with a sketchy resume and a smidgen of talent. I tried and look where I wound up.)
It's a surprise to read that the current editor, Tim Herrera, boasts that one of his "proudest professional accomplishments" was not trying to solve a persistent problem and then nailing it: It was trying to solve a persistent problem and then giving up.
Yet, that's exactly the confession he makes in a recent article, "Why Giving Up Is Sometimes the Best Way to Solve a Problem."
For people like thee and me, this is not exactly a news flash. For us, giving up is not only the best way to solve a problem, but it's the only way. In fact, when a problem first rears its ugly head, we run in the other direction. Fast.
Our refusal to try is not limited to problems, either. We also run away from opportunities, possibilities and, scariest of all, anything that looks like a solution to a problem.
In Herrera's case, his decision to bolt did not come quickly or easily. Describing a recent experience in problem-solving with his staff, he writes, "We must have run through a half-dozen solutions, each more convoluted than the last, essentially trying to figure out how to fit a square peg into a round hole."
(I must interrupt this column to right a wrong. As professional square pegs, you and I are all too aware of the anti-peg prejudice we face. What's so wrong with square pegs? What's so great about round holes? Why aren't round holes castigated for not being square holes into which, I must point out, we square pegs could fit perfectly? Think about it. I now return you to your column, already in progress.)
Whatever problem the Times people were trying to solve -- and since they are Times people, I assume the problem had something to do with over-chilling the chardonnay in the snack room wine vault -- Herrera realized that the best solution was to stop trying to find one and just move on.
Accomplishing this breakthrough required "metacognition." This is the scientific term for "thinking about thinking." Or, maybe, thinking about thinking about thinking, which is not the same thing when you think about it.
According to social scientists, metacognition requires self-awareness, which, it turns out, is a very rare quality. Harvard researchers found that "only 10 percent to 15 percent of the people we studied actually fit the criteria." (And, I suspect, 100% of these self-aware people are not hanging out at Harvard.)
Fortunately, self-awareness is a quality that you have in spades. You are completely aware that beneath that bright, shiny exterior is a lazy, incompetent malcontent. That's why you are always looking for ways you can make yourself look good or, when that fails, invisible.
People who see themselves as competent are too invested in never giving up. It's their "overgeneralization of the 'Don't waste' rule," Herrera writes. They believe that if "don't waste" was appropriate when faced with mashed turnips on their plate as a six-year-old, it's right for spending a month of weekends trying to make sense of the marketing department.
Unfortunately, managers are often part of the group that believes "quitting is a type of failure." This may be the reason they stay on and on and on, no matter how truly useless they are.
Hopefully the power of the Times, when combined with the awesome clout of my 16 readers, will turn the tide on this quitting issue.
Instead of demanding a list of accomplishments for our annual reviews, our managers will ask for a list of all the problems and projects from which we've walked away, without even trying. Big manufacturing companies will proudly announce their refusal to come up with solutions for their product flaws. Hot internet companies will testify in Washington that they recognized the mistakes in their business models, but instead of trying to fix them, they decided to go surfing.
I certainly think Herrera has gotten the message. His column in the Times is awfully short. Did he say all he wanted to say, or did he throw in the towel? I hope it's the latter.
As we always say, "A winner never quits, but a quitter always wins."

Texto completo: CHICAGO – Phoenix can continue evaluating Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and RJ Barrett, but the Suns had a far better chance of winning the NBA draft lottery than they now do of landing any of those NBA prospects in next month's draft.
The Suns fell to the sixth spot after having the best chance to win Tuesday's lottery at 14% along with Cleveland and New York.
The Knicks wound up with the third pick while the Cavaliers landed at fifth.
New Orleans won the lottery in stunning fashion after having a 6.0% chance to do so and Memphis ended up second despite having just a 6.3% chance to land that pick.
Even the Los Angeles Lakers finished higher than Phoenix at fourth as they had a 2.8% chance for that pick.
By the time Phoenix is put on the clock June 20 in Brooklyn, N.Y., Williamson, Morant and Barrett will be long gone as they're projected top-three picks. Williamson is the clear-cut favorite to be taken No. 1.
Williamson and Barrett have elected to not come to Quest Multisport Complex on Thursday or Friday for any court activities or media availability.
Vanderbilt freshman point guard Darius Garland and Virginia redshirt sophomore forward De'Andre Hunter, both projected high lottery picks, aren't on the updated list, either, but Morant is.
So whom should the Suns have their eyes on more at this week's NBA draft combine?
Jarrett Culver Texas Tech sophomore guard, 6-5. The Suns have wings/guards, but may lose Kelly Oubre Jr. to free agency. He's a restricted free agent so the Suns can match any offer, but will they if he lands that mega deal for, say, four years, $80 million?
They may also part ways with Josh Jackson after his recent arrest when, according to an affidavit, tried to run from the police, while handcuffed, after being denied access to an VIP area without a proper pass at a music festival in Miami.
Culver is athletic. Good skill set. Can create his own shot. Plays strong. Defends.
He was clearly the team's best player, but wasn't as aggressive as he could be.
Coby White North Carolina freshman guard, 6-5. White is fast, excels in transition, but had moments when he just looked out of control.
He's fearless, though, and showed a variety of releases around the basket off the bounce.
Brandon Clarke Gonzaga junior forward, 6-8. Explosive leaper. Finishes around the basket strong. Runs the floor well.
Shot 68.7 percent from the field this past season.
Has good size. Plus the Suns' new head of player development, Riccardo Fois, as first reported by the New York Times' Marc Stein, served as coordinator of analytics at Gonzaga.
While point guard and power forward are Phoenix's major needs, the Suns could easily just pick the best player on the board and if that's not a point guard, dive deep into free agency for one.
Then there's trading for one, but that takes two teams to tango and that leads to whom the Suns are willing to give up to get that point guard they need.
Tyler Johnson can play the one or two, but isn't a game-changer at the point.
Texas Tech athletic guard Jarrett Culver is a possible pick at No. 6 for the Suns in the NBA draft.

Texto completo: The developer of New York's Hudson Yards is ready to build another massive office, housing and retail complex -- this time about 3,000 miles to the west.
Related Cos. announced Wednesday that it has started work on a 240-acre site in Silicon Valley for what it says is one of the largest entitled commercial developments in California history. Just north of Levi's Stadium, where the NFL's San Francisco 49ers play, the Santa Clara project will cost roughly $8 billion, replacing a public golf course that sits atop a former landfill.
The development has long been planned -- Related first announced it six years ago -- and the fact that it's just now getting underway speaks to the difficulties of building in a region that's become notorious for its housing shortage and legal wrangling over growth. But it's also a testament to the robust Bay Area tech scene and demand for space that the company is embarking on a lengthy construction process late into an economic boom.

When fully built, the project will have 5.4 million square feet of offices, 700 hotel rooms, more than 1,600 apartments, and a retail, dining and entertainment district, as well as a 30-acre park -- all a short distance from public transit and next to an industrial area that the city is converting to a residential zone with room for as many as 4,500 units of housing. Related named architect Foster + Partners to lead design of the development's first phases.
By creating an urban area rich with amenities, Related is betting that it'll be able to draw the sorts of corporate tenants that increasingly see such perks as a key to attracting and retaining staff. The development, expected to initially open in 2023, will feature a range of office types, including loft-style spaces attractive to startups, and a zone that could accommodate a large company's headquarters.
"Room to grow is a big issue in Silicon Valley," said Steve Eimer, Related's executive vice president in charge of the project. "Most of these companies want to put their flag down in a place where they don't have to move."
Whether a sleek master-planned community becomes more than just a playground for wealthy tech employees remains to be seen. Related's Hudson Yards development -- a $25-billion megaplex of office towers, residences and shopping areas built over former rail yards -- has been met with similar criticism. The New York Times called it "Manhattan's Biggest, Newest, Slickest Gated Community."
In general, creating authentic urban experiences is difficult in an area that's developed all around the same time, said Margaret O'Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who's studied the history of Silicon Valley. Even so, she said, Related's development is clearly "better use of land than a golf course" in a region that's starved for housing.
Some of the residential units at the property will be earmarked for people making less than 120% of the area's median income, Related said. And in a first for Northern California, the developer will be allowed to build housing on a site that used to be a landfill.
Although Related is funding preliminary work at the site, Eimer said the developer will likely bring in some outside capital for the project. The company partnered with Oxford Properties Group, an arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, to help build Hudson Yards.
"You want investors who have the same mentality that you do, which is for a long-term hold," he said. "A large pension fund would be an ideal partner."
Beyond housing, demand for office space is strong, particularly among the tech companies that fuel the Bay Area's economy. Over the last two years, Facebook Inc. went on a real estate binge, leasing space in San Francisco and in the East Bay, while expanding its headquarters in Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet Inc. has been working toward developing a large new campus in San Jose.
All the activity has pushed office-vacancy rates in Silicon Valley down to about 10% in the first quarter, compared with 15% a year earlier, according to data from brokerage Newmark Knight Frank.
"This is almost an unprecedented run of growth," said Newmark Executive Vice Chairman Phil Mahoney, who's worked in Silicon Valley for more than three decades and is helping Related lease the new Santa Clara development. "We're in 10 years-plus of running a strong economy locally."
Resistance to new development in the bedroom communities of Silicon Valley can be fierce, with residents often pushing back on plans to add more density to single-family areas.
Related's project was held in limbo for more than year because of a fight between the city of Santa Clara and neighboring San Jose, which squabbled over the effects on traffic and housing. The cities reached a settlement last year that's allowing work to move forward.
Santa Clara Mayor Lisa Gillmor said Related's project delivers on a longstanding vision to transform the northern part of her city into a "tourist, business and entertainment district." The project is expected to bring in about $17 million a year to local coffers from lease payments, taxes and fees when open.
"I'm really proud of what we've done," Gillmor said. "The money from this project is going to fund our police, our fire department, our parks -- for the next 100 years."

Texto completo: The Florida Department of Environmental Protection and State Water Management Districts regulate wetlands to safeguard our water supply and manage floodplains by ensuring no net loss of wetlands.
Wetlands improve water quality by reducing runoff and rapid flood potential. They also filter water to recharge our aquifers, attenuate discharge into our waterways, and provide habitat for protected species. Wetland function is proportional to its overall contiguous size; the more robust the wetland area, the more beneficial it is. It is important to limit impacts to these prized land features and the ecosystems that thrive in hydric soil.
Some wetlands, however, are relatively small and isolated and cannot sustainably support aquatic life, especially those cut off by surrounding commercial and industrial developments. The proposed amendments to the Lee Plan allow these diminished wetlands to be developed appropriately and mitigated by the restoration and creation of their more valuable counterparts. The result is no net loss in wetland functions and improvement to our significant wetland resources.
I urge Commissioners Hamman, Pendergrass and Manning to approve the wetland amendments and continue their stewardship of responsibly balancing growth and conservation of our natural resources and waterways.

Just paper When a president is guilty, they evoke executive privilege. Executive privilege is nowhere mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. That fact has led some scholars to suggest that executive privilege does not exist and that the congressional power of inquiry is absolute. I guess past Supreme Court justices have legislated executive privilege from the bench.
Where have all those Republican, strict constitutionalists gone? Have they joined Trump's menagerie of lying scoundrels, or are they in hiding?
This and other acts, proves our Constitution is just a piece of paper, to be changed at will.

Considered irrelevant Fixation. I search to find a reason that any newspaper would continue to print articles by a columnist who obvious has problems. There are many derogatory names that apply to an individual who constantly focuses on one group in particular, but name calling will not resolve the problem of people like Mr. Pitts.
He evidently thrives on attention derived from extremism and division. A recent article is the second which more closely focuses on individuals or a small group. I am now sure that he suffers from a fixation involving only whites.
If I were allowed to write an article instead a letter I could cite many arguments and statistics refuting or bring to light the shortcomings of black individuals such as Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson, and I am sure many others of different ethnic groups could be brought to light. I, unlike him, am not the conscience of the white world nor would I want to be. I, unlike him, find that one author or one group does not make up the entire white population. I, unlike him, don't focus on anyone group to the point of fixation.
Mr. Pitts should be considered irrelevant for any of his comments.
Robert Harris, North Fort Myers
Scares me Donald Trump regularly boasts about his degree from the very distinguished Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
The New York Times recently reported that Trump's businesses lost more than a billion dollars in the late '80s-'90s. He has claimed bankruptcy six times over the years, from which he made a pile, but a lot of others got screwed. This leads me to think that although he got a degree from Penn, he may not have gotten an education. (A possibility that I can attest is very real from a 30-year career in academia.) If I have to choose between believing Trump or the Times, there's no contest.
Genuinely successful businessmen don't go bankrupt six times.
This makes me wonder if the reason he is going to such extraordinary measures to keep his more recent tax returns from public scrutiny isn't that they would reveal criminal activities, although that's also likely. It could just be that their revelation would expose the fact that he is really a quite bad businessman, and not nearly as rich as he boasts. With this track record of business failures, his willingness to start trade wars scares the hell out me.

The anti-iran clown show

Texto completo: This week, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two countries closely allied with the U.S. and Israel against Iran, announced that four commercial tankers had been "sabotaged" in Emirati waters. Frankly, I've seen worse damage to a bus in Paris when it sideswiped a Peugeot.
No one died. Nothing sank. No oil was spilled. There were no explosions or fires. There's no attributable proof of attempted sabotage. But curiously, just last week, during a buildup of American military hardware in the region, the U.S. Maritime Administration issued a head-scratching statement that "Iran or its proxies could respond by targeting commercial vessels, including oil tankers, or U.S. military vessels in the Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb Strait or the Persian Gulf."
It's all just a bit too convenient.
Let's not forget who's leading the anti-Iran clown show. U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, has given paid speeches at Iranian opposition rallies. Bolton wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in 2015 headlined, "To Stop Iran's Bomb, Bomb Iran."
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked by an interviewer in Jerusalem earlier this year whether he thought that Trump had been "raised ... to help save the Jewish people from the Iranian menace."
"As a Christian, I certainly believe that's possible," Pompeo said.
Pompeo is busy making eyes roll in Europe and Russia this week by trying to drum up opposition to Iran, while Bolton has ordered up Pentagon plans for war with Iran that could include up to 120,000 American troops.
Only Congress has the constitutional authority to declare war. Why has it failed to explicitly remind the Trump administration of this? And why is Trump, who claims to be anti-interventionist, continuing to indulge the two biggest hawks in the White House?
Last month, Trump designated Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. It was the first time in history that America has labeled another country's military as terrorists. At the time, it seemed like a way to justify another war on terrorism. Those concerns now seem entirely justified.
Bolton released a statement earlier this month that lowered the bar for America to send troops into yet another Middle Eastern quagmire, warning that "any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force. The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces."
Let's break down how much that statement itself increases the likelihood of war. First, it's problematic to suggest that "any attack" on the interests of America's Middle Eastern allies could trigger U.S. military action in the same way that an attack on American interests would. There are U.S. interests and there are foreign interests, which include allied interests. Those two things aren't the same.
Bolton also tries to redefine Iranian forces by including the word "proxy." The reason for using proxies in warfare is plausible deniability. Countries have long used them to reduce their footprint in conflicts. By design, there is often a lack of evidence to connect proxies or their actions to a sponsor country. This also makes it far too easy to attribute the actions of non-state actors to a rival nation.
Pompeo and Bolton are leading America into a dangerous house of mirrors. It's long past time for Congress to close down the attraction.

Texto completo: The Harvard Lampoon, the student-run humor magazine at the Ivy League university, has apologized after imagery featured in the latest issue was condemned as anti-Semitic and misogynistic.
A recent edition included an image of Anne Frank's face placed atop the body of a bikini-clad woman. Above was the text, “Gone Before Her Time: Virtual Aging Technology Shows Us What Anne Frank Would Have Looked Like if She Hadn't Died." Below the image: “Add this to your list of reasons the Holocaust sucked."
“They crossed the line from humor into anti-Semitism," said Robert Trestan, the director of Anti-Defamation League's New England regional office, during a Tuesday phone interview.
Frank's diary is considered to be one of the most powerful Holocaust memoirs. Trestan said the Lampoon's imagery denigrates her memory.
“They're using humor as an excuse to trivialize the Holocaust, and it's deeply offensive," he said. In addition to being anti-Semitic, the image used by the Lampoon is also misogynistic, Trestan said. “They're creating a sexualized image of someone who died as a child in a concentration camp," he said.
In a joint Tuesday statement, the Lampoon's two copresidents and issue editor apologized “for our negligence in allowing this piece to be created for and printed in our latest issue."
“We are sorry for any harm we have caused," the statement said. “Furthermore, we want to both affirm and emphasize that the Lampoon condemns any and all forms of anti-Semitism."
The statement continued, “Moving forward, we will approach the content of our magazine with greater care. We realize that our publishing process lacks sufficient editorial oversight, so we are going to restructure our review process for issues to prevent the publication of content like this."
The Lampoon “has heard from many whom we hurt with content from the latest issue of our magazine," it said.
In a letter to the editors of the Lampoon, Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, the executive director and chaplain for Harvard Hillel, said that by producing and spreading such an imagery, those behind the publication “effectively join yourselves to the obscenity of the Nazis themselves and carry it forward."
“Your depiction of Anne Frank's face grafted to pinup imagery goes far beyond the distastefulness and provocativeness you obviously intend," he wrote. “It is the sexual violation of a child – one who, in life, was subjected to the most hideous of crimes."
Since its founding in 1876, the Lampoon has nurtured many literary and comedic talent, including John Updike and George Plimpton; late night host Conan O'Brien; National Lampoon cofounders Henry Beard and Doug Kenney; Spy magazine cofounder Kurt Andersen; humorist Patricia Marx, the first woman elected to the Lampoon; and writer-producer Lisa Henson, its first female president.
Messages left with Harvard University were not immediately returned on Tuesday.
The Lampoon confirmed the latest issue was distributed to dorms over the weekend.
Of the latest issue, Harvard student Jacob Schwartz, a 22-year-old junior from San Antonio, said, “In terms of Jewish students, this was pretty rattling for us to see."
He added, “We want to use this as a call for people going forward to gather knowledge of what the Holocaust is and overcome the ignorance that exists within the greater community, especially during a time when we've seen anti-Semitism on the rise for the last three years."
The Anti-Defamation League's annual audit of anti-Semitic incidents recorded 1,879 attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions across the country in 2018, the third-highest number in a year since the organization started tracking such data in the 1970s.

Texto completo: All six played a critical role in the gay rights movement. One was a storefront restaurant that New York City officials described as the city's first gay theater and the place where Off Off Broadway got its start. Another was home to a number of lesbian and feminist groups in the 1970s and 1980s.
Now, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission is moving toward considering landmark status for the six sites.
The agency was born in the 1960s in response to the anger over the demolition of the old Pennsylvania Station, which the novelist Thomas Wolfe described as "vast enough to hold the sound of time."
Since then, the commission has conferred landmark status on individual buildings and on neighborhoods based mainly on architectural significance and historical merit.
But over the years the commission has also granted landmark protection based on historical or cultural significance.
The six places under consideration do not include the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village bar and the site of a major turning point in the gay rights movement, because it has already been recognized. The commission gave it landmark status in 2015 because of its significance in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history. In 2016, then-President Barack Obama designated the building and the area around it the Stonewall National Monument.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising and the World Pride celebration will come to New York City for the first time.
[Ahead of World Pride, The New York Times wants to capture the ever-evolving ways in which we describe ourselves. Tell us how you identify yourself .]
Five of the six landmarks-to-be are already in designated historic districts, so the protection afforded by landmark status would be new for only one. But Sarah Carroll, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said the new designations would add "an extra layer of protection" if future owners sought permission for exterior changes.
"We wanted to explicitly recognize the association with LGBT history," she said. "In most cases, the designation of the historic districts in which the buildings already exist did not recognize this history."
Since its start, the commission has expanded its mandate toward recognizing buildings for what happened in them, not just their presence on the landscape, with a number of other designations, among them Louis Armstrong's house in Queens, a landmark since 1988.
A year ago, the commission created a historic district in Harlem, citing the "rich social, cultural and political life" that went on there as well as the architecture. It includes the home of the ragtime composer Scott Joplin and the national headquarters for the March on Washington in 1965.
The six most recent sites were chosen based on their contribution to gay history. Recognizing more than architecture "is really important," said Andrew S. Dolkart, co-director of the LGBT Historic Sites Project, which recommended sites for the LGBT designations.
"In general, it's really important that preservation move beyond just works of architecture, not to denigrate that -- I'm an architectural historian," he said, adding, "We really need to recognize places of cultural and historical significance."
Giving the six buildings landmark status would put documentation about them in the commission's files that would be taken into account if owners sought to make changes to the outside, Ms. Carroll said. That information, she said, "would guide our thinking" and could prove especially important for facades that "might not have been seen as typical or traditional in that particular historic district."
She said that could be a concern for one of the six buildings, at 137 West 71st Street. It was the New York home of the writer and civil rights activist James Baldwin from the mid-1960s on.
For years he mainly lived in France and died at his home there in 1987.
But he described himself as a "commuter," not an expatriate. The landmarks commission noted that he kept an apartment in the 71st Street building "where he worked on plays, screenplays and novels and corresponded with other prominent literary and cultural figures" when he was in New York. His niece Aisha Karefa-Smart wrote in 2013 that the building's "energy and vitality" surged "to a fever pitch as soon as he hit the door."
The building was built as one in a line of four rowhouses in 1890 but was altered in 1961. The original facade was stripped off, replaced with light-colored brick. Stairs leading to the parlor-floor entrance were demolished, the front door was moved down to the street level and glass-brick windows were installed next to it.
Baldwin bought it in 1965. His family sold the building in 1994, according to the current owner, Romeo Salta, who said he was "ambivalent" about a landmark designation.
"Quite frankly, we were contemplating, not in the immediate future but sometime down the line, fixing up the facade because in my opinion, it's not a very good-looking building," Mr. Salta said.
"I've got no problem with honoring Mr. Baldwin," he said, but added, "I think there are other ways of honoring Mr. Baldwin short of declaring his old building a landmark because it has no architectural merit at all."
The commission described another of the six buildings as the birthplace of Off Off Broadway, a four-story tenement-and-store building at 31 Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village.
From 1958 to 1968, the store space was occupied by a restaurant called Caffe Cino. At the time, the commission's staff noted in a report on the building, "portraying homosexuality in theatrical productions was illegal," but Caffe Cino "became a center for gay artists to share their work" as the city's first gay theater.
Playwrights who got their start there included John Guare, who later wrote "Six Degrees of Separation," and Lanford Wilson, who wrote "Fifth of July," according to the commission.
It is in the Greenwich Village Historic District, just as the Baldwin House is in a historic district on the Upper West Side.
The one building not within the boundaries of a historic district is a former firehouse once known as the women's liberation center. The building, at 243 West 20th Street, is still owned by the city and is now rented to a group that trains women for construction and maintenance work.
Ms. Carroll said she and members of the commission's staff worked with the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, and the New York City LGBT Historic Sites Project. She said Mr. Johnson did not suggest specific sites, but he said through a spokesman that the choices "will make excellent additions" to the roster of landmarks.
The commission will decide on Tuesday whether to begin the formal process of landmarking the sites, including holding public hearings and, eventually, votes on official designation.
Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the Historic District Council, a preservation group, called the six potential designations "a terrific step forward to recognizing unrecognized history." But he and William Dobbs, a historically minded advocate, said they wished the commission would designate more landmarks of significance in the gay rights movement.
Mr. Dobbs mentioned a building on the corner of 14th Street and the Avenue of the Americas that was the meeting place of the Gay Liberation Front, the first activist organization formed after the Stonewall rebellion. That building has been sold to a developer and is being demolished.
"The story of these landmarks is they get torn down," he said. "It's especially painful because there aren't very many LGBT landmarks."

Planning for war in Iran is very different from mobilizing for war in Iran

Texto completo: Generals, officers, and policy staffers knocking their heads together in the office and drawing up war plans are nothing new in the Pentagon. The U.S. military has a plan for every contingency you can possibly think of, from an out-of-the-blue Russian incursion in the Baltics to an internal collapse of the Venezuelan government. So, we should all take the latest report in the New York Times about a hypothetical American military attack on Iran with this context in mind.
Mobilization plans are one thing. But acting on those plans and mobilizing for war is quite another. There are no two ways about it: A U.S. military operation in Iran absent a credible and direct national security threat to the United States, its personnel, or citizens in the region is the very definition of recklessness.
It’s not that the U.S. wouldn’t prevail in a conflict with Iran. Conventionally speaking, the regular Iranian military and the more elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps are no match for the U.S. Armed Forces. The concern, rather, is that the costs associated with military action heavily outweigh whatever benefits Washington would receive. The problems Iran poses to the region can’t be resolved through bombing raids or sinking the IRGC’s fleet underneath the Persian Gulf.
Militarily, Tehran has options. It can retaliate through proxies or tactical partners in multiple countries with a certain amount of plausible deniability. Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Palestinian militants in Gaza, Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban in Afghanistan — Tehran would be able to utilize all or at least some of these groups as a form of pressure in the event of a John Bolton-like bombing campaign. In such a scenario, the tens of thousands of U.S. troops stationed in the Middle East actually limit Washington’s flexibility and increase the risk; the more troops the U.S. deploys to the region, the more targets Iran has.
Of course, none of this is new. The Iran-proxy relationship has been studied for decades by regional scholars and intelligence analysts. Tehran may be a weak power compared to the United States, but this doesn’t mean it won’t go down fighting.
What is relatively new, however, is the man who sits in the Oval Office. Unlike previous U.S. presidents, Donald Trump appears reflexively opposed to getting the U.S. deeper into the Middle East. He recoils at the thought of wasting a few more trillion dollars and sacrificing a few thousand additional American lives for the cesspool this region has become — a place with a lot of intractable problems (ethnic conflict, predatory government, jihadists, unaccountable militias, and zero-sum competition between states) and few easy solutions. This is exactly what Trump campaigned against, and it was an issue that resonated with a lot of Americans who were tired of spending so many resources in a theater that seems immune to every dose of medicine.
A preventive attack on Iran would of course be a breaking of this campaign promise from a president who likes to remind Americans that unlike other politicians, he actually does what he says. Strategically, an attack on Iran would be a disaster, dividing the U.S. from its allies and partners and opening a Pandora’s Box that would unfurl a brand new set of crises. But such an action wouldn’t be politically advantageous either; indeed, it would reinforce a belief in the minds of many in the commentariat that Trump doesn’t give orders, but rather follows them from his more hawkish national security advisers.
The best way to prevent this would be to stop whistling past the graveyard. Before the tension with Iran gets any more solidified, President Trump should seriously rethink his course of action. Provoking Iran into a conflict or launching one unilaterally serves the interest of nobody. This is especially true for the United States, a country that should be working to rebalance its force posture after nearly two decades of expensive and counterproductive military commitments in the region.

Texto completo: El Senado de Alabama aprobó el martes una medida que prohibiría casi todos los abortos en el estado, estableciendo un desafío directo a Roe v. Wade, el caso que reconoció el derecho constitucional de una mujer de interrumpir un embarazo, reporta The New York Times.
La legislación prohíbe los abortos en todas las etapas del embarazo y criminaliza el procedimiento para los médicos , que podrían ser acusados de delitos graves y enfrentar hasta 99 años de prisión. Incluye una excepción para los casos en que la vida de la madre corre un grave riesgo , pero no para los casos de violación o incesto, un tema de feroz debate entre los legisladores en los últimos días
Ahora se traslada al escritorio del gobernador Kay Ivey , un republicano. Aunque el gobernador no se ha comprometido públicamente a firmar la legislación, muchos legisladores republicanos esperan su apoyo.
Hasta ahora, no había posibilidad de revertir a Roe “, dijo a NYT Eric Johnston , quien fundó la Coalición Pro-Vida de Alabama y se desempeña como su presidente, y ha pasado más de 30 años tratando de prohibir el aborto.
Johnston, quien redactó el proyecto de ley de Alabama y se considera un purista en el tema del aborto, dijo que no apoyaba la serie de leyes restrictivas que otros estados han promulgado en los últimos meses, incluidas las llamadas cuentas de latidos fetales. Estos proyectos de ley esencialmente prohíben los abortos a partir de las seis semanas posteriores a la concepción, un momento en el que muchas mujeres aún no saben que están embarazadas.
Los demócratas y los defensores de los derechos de aborto dicen que la medida de Alabama conduciría el procedimiento a la clandestinidad, poniendo en peligro las vidas de mujeres y niñas y afectando de manera desproporcionada a los residentes pobres y de minorías de Alabama.

Noncompete clauses trap #MeToo victims in abusive workplaces. The FTC should ban them.

Resumen: One way for women to escape sexual assault or harassment is to get new jobs, even if they pay less. But noncompete clauses rob them of this leverage.

Texto completo: After decades of virtual silence, the #MeToo movement has publicized the epidemic of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The recent New York Times investigation of Sterling Jewelers exposes the depth of the problem and shows how long and hard women’s fight for justice remains. Since women who complain about harassment face retaliation and even termination, often the only way to escape it is to find a new job. Yet for many women, continuing their careers with a new employer turns out to be impossible.
That is because of noncomplete clauses. After they have resigned or even been fired, workers bound by noncompetes cannot accept employment in the same line of work or industry as their former employer for a specified period in a certain city, state or even the entire country. Nearly 30 million working people, including more than 12 million women, are locked into their jobs because of noncompete clauses.
Employers thus prevent their workers from leaving for employers offering higher wages, better benefits and dignity on the job. Incredibly, as a 2013 case in Florida shows, some employers even try to enforce noncompetes in court against workers who left after being subjected to alleged sexual harassment.

Dear interns, we're sorry. We should have warned you about sexual harassment.
R. Kelly victim: I found the strength to leave 'Pied Piper of R&B. ' Why won't his fans?
A federal agency has the power to put a stop to noncompetes. In March, the Open Markets Institute (where we both work), along with 19 labor and public interest organizations and 46 legal advocates and scholars, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to ban noncompetes under federal law. An FTC rule prohibiting noncompetes would help free women from abusive work environments.
Workers bound by a noncompete and looking to leave face three choices: 1) find a job in another line of work or industry, 2) move outside the geographic reach of the noncompete, or 3) accept unemployment for the duration of the noncompete.
Option 1 means accepting work outside one’s experience and skills. Option 2 means uprooting one’s family and severing social ties. Option 3 is possible only for the independently wealthy. As a practical matter, even when employers cannot or do not enforce them in court, noncompetes intimidate workers into staying with their employer.
Trapped to work as . . . a camp counselor?
Amazon warehouse workers, camp counselors, engineers, hair stylists, home health aides, investment managers, sandwich makers and yoga instructors are just some workers who have been bound by noncompete clauses. Amazon’s (now discontinued) noncompete with warehouse staff prohibited these workers from working at effectively any retailer in the entire world for 18 months after leaving Amazon.
The deprivation of exit is especially harmful to women who face a serious threat of sexual assault and harassment on the job. In an economy in which less than 10% of women belong to a union and at-will employment is the norm, women have little bargaining power and can be dismissed for practically any reason or no reason at all.
One of the few sources of leverage for women workers is to leave for employment elsewhere, even if it means a demotion or pay cut. A study by three sociology professors found that in a two-year period, women who were targets of sexual harassment were 6. 5 times more likely to change jobs than women who hadn’t been targeted.
Noncomplete clauses block the exits
By depriving them of outside employment opportunities, noncompetes lock victims of harassment into abusive environments. The stories of noncompetes being weaponized against women who are simply trying to escape harassment are shocking.
In Florida, for example, one employer had the nerve to sue a woman who had left her job because of sexual harassment to work for another company in her industry. According to the employee, her employer failed to stop the harassment and left her with no choice but to leave the hostile work environment. The employer then sued her for violating the noncompete clause in her employment contract, arguing that no Florida court has held that sexual harassment voids the contract. Ultimately, the court dismissed the case because the employer failed to provide evidence to support its claims. One wonders whether the lawsuit was yet another act of retaliation against the employee for daring to speak out.
While Congress can and should ban noncompetes through legislation, the FTC already has the power to outlaw noncompetes for all workers. The need for a decisive regulatory action is clear. And especially for women, the costs of inaction are too high.

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr has assigned a federal prosecutor in Connecticut to examine the origins of the federal Russia investigation.
U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut has been chosen to lead the project, according to the New York Times, making it the third known federal probe dedicated to unearthing information about the genesis of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, which was later wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's effort.
Durham, a Trump nominee who has been a Justice Department lawyer for decades, has prior experience working as a special prosecutor investigating alleged wrongdoing by national security officials.
Durham’s office and the Justice Department declined to comment for the story.
Barr has questioned whether the Justice Department behaved appropriately during the federal Russia investigation. He has also riled up Democrats with his talk about spying.
“I think spying did occur,” Barr said last month before the Senate Appropriations Committee. “The question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I’m not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.”
Barr has said he is working closely with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is investigating alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. U.S. attorney John Huber is also conducting an investigation into the federal Russia probe.
In Congress, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is spearheading a FISA probe.

SPORTS MEDIA; Sportswriting's new angle

Texto completo: Would today's multiplatform, content-driven 24/7 sports news cycle ring true for Ring Lardner, make Damon Runyon run for cover or blanch Grantland Rice?
Just imagine Jim Murray taking direction from a videographer insisting he could punch up his prose with a little more dramatic backlighting and a splash more makeup.
They were the sports gospel writers of their day, energizing a religious following for their newspapers. Still, the recent book release of "The Great American Sports Page: A Century of Classic Columns" compiled by John Schulian (The Library of America, 396 pages, $29.95) shouldn't be set aside as just a dusted-off hymnal.

It's a testament to how effective, energetic and empathetic storytelling can morph ahead. It might even get an app-refreshing readership to pay for a subscription.
Having worked for six newspapers in a 16-year career before working in Hollywood writing scripts, Schulian has faith that sports newspapering will stay relevant if it's "bright, lively, culturally attuned and unafraid of prickly issues." History reinforces that new generations of wordsmiths can progress from typewriters to laptops to dictating stories into iPhones.
"I still read the sports section first every morning mainly because the front page is too damn painful," said Schulian, a 74-year-old Pasadena resident.
"But it must be disheartening for someone to get into sportswriting as I once did. Sports has changed so much, having gone corporate, and athletes becoming more remote. It's harder for writers to do the kind of pieces that used to make sports sections special. There was a time when a columnist could do a real character sketch of someone.
"Sports afforded me the opportunity to write, a stylistic freedom that many in this book were also seeking. There are plenty of good writers today, God knows, who get past this wall and do great work."
Such as Sally Jenkins, who delivered a deadly deadline column for the Washington Post after having watched the confusing conclusion last week at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. It began with an uppercut lead: "If there's a moral to the 145th Kentucky Derby, it's that you can't take the gambling out of gambling. But try telling that to horse people, those incurable lottery addicts."
Jenkins has three entries in Schulian's "The Great American Sports Page." In the 2018 edition of "The Best American Sports Writing" anthology, Jenkins is among the 25 selections from guest editor Jeff Pearlman. One of only five current newspaper writers represented there.
Pearlman writes in his introduction he is drawn to those who "approach things with funk and pizzazz" and veer away from what "far too many of us have been told" -- by editors, by journalism professors, by readers -- "that there is a clear, definitive methodology to storytelling. ... That still infuriates me and is, I believe, a culprit in the ongoing death of the American newspaper."
Expanding on that in a recent email, the Laguna Niguel-based author said he seeks out "must-read writers who are insanely good and/or insanely plugged in." Growing up in New York, Pearlman said his go-to scribes were Mike Lupica and Dave Anderson.
"It's harder nowadays because there are so many options," Pearlman said. "Why do I need any sort of a game story when YouTube clips show me? Now I will seek out Howard Beck [formerly of the New York Times] at Bleacher Report to explain to me what, as a basketball fan, I somehow misunderstood. That genre of writing is what newspapers need."
Schulian agrees with Pearlman in the pro-writer pushback against oversimplifying stories in the sports section "because readers understand more than you give them credit for. [Late syndicated sports columnist ] Jimmy Cannon would also say: 'There's nothing too good for a newspaper.' Cannon was also someone who wrote columns from the head and from his heart."
The L.A. Times' Bill Plaschke did the same with his piece this weekend on the Dodgers' Spanish-language broadcaster Jaime Jarrin returning to the booth as a way of healing from the loss of his wife.
Schulian included a Plaschke column from 2001, "Her Blue Haven," on Dodgers website writer Sarah Morris. It's one Schulian says brings tears to his eyes. Three Murray pieces are also part of the collection that spans nearly 50 writers and 100 stories.
Circling back to the idea of the anachronistic ink-stained wretch wrestling with modern times, Schulian culled columns by former Washington Post stars Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon, providing more context to their current talking-TV roles.
It's also important for Schulian to lean on a particular piece by the Boston Globe's Leigh Montville from 1981, writing about his first encounter with this new thing called ESPN and how it blindsided him.
"Sports is supposed to mirror society, but it seems nobody has fun with what they write," said Schulian. "It's not always life and death. You're covering fun and games.
"A sports section can have a 700-word game story, a 1,000-word column and a 2,500-word feature. Everyone can get along quite nicely, I think."

Tune it in
-- The essence of "What's My Name: Muhammad Ali" as a two-part documentary (HBO, Tuesday, airing back-to-back from 8 p.m. to 10:45 p.m.) is a well-spliced self-narration, culled from a dearth of audio and video interviews that the heavyweight champ did over his 74 years. Most were well before his death in 2016 following a long bout with Parkinson's syndrome.
Nothing really told here is new, but there is a compelling musical and visual presentation that cements the idea of director Antoine Fuqua that likely wouldn't work so well with other sports figures of this media age.
And, yes, LeBron James and Maverick Carter have their fingerprints on this as executive producers when eventual awards are handed out for it.
-- We miss two unique voices in the sports media world this weekend.
The start Sunday of the Tour of California on NBCSN, and as it progresses to the final stage Saturday in Pasadena on Channel 4, won't be the same without cyclist-turned-analyst Phil Sherwin, who died at 62 in December.
While HBO's boxing coverage may have ended, "unofficial judge" Harold Lederman made it to the final broadcast Dec. 8. Having scored more than 100 world title fights over 30 years, Lederman, a full-time working pharmacist by day, died Saturday at 79 from cancer.
Fans "waited for his moments, they were thrilled by his insights, they gloried in imitating his voice," said Jim Lampley, who worked with Lederman since 1986. "No one in the sport had more friends, because no one in the sport was more deserving of friends. Nothing was more important to the legacy of HBO Boxing, so in that we can all take solace. Now his scorecard is complete."
--
Tune it out
-- The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue is still a thing?
No matter how many ways the current publishers -- who are still trying to sell off the fabled magazine -- try to spin this thing after 55 years, the photographic and video visuals tell another truth.
A mixed-message pitch on the publication's website, under a headline telling us how it's "time to rethink everything you thought you knew" about this feature's intent is an impressively crafted public relations mission statement.
This year is about "shattering perceptions" and showing a "new empowerment" of women fighting for equality and inclusion or battling ageism.
It could very well be for some. But we're not sold on it.
At a time when ESPN The Magazine is about to head to the shredder, despite inroads with its own "Body Issue" history, SI will likely turn another profit from this issue. But that's a whole other issue.

Minimize the risk of booking with a budget airline

Texto completo: When the budget airline Wow Air abruptly ceased operations earlier this year, thousands of travelers were left stranded and scrambling, on both sides of the Atlantic, to make alternate travel plans.
The news, after months of speculation that the Icelandic airline was struggling financially, came at a period that has already been particularly difficult for low-cost carriers. Cyprus' Cobalt Air, Pakistan's Shaheen Air, and Primera, based in Denmark and Latvia, collapsed in October. In February, Flybmi and Germania filed for bankruptcy. For most, rising fuel costs and overexpansion led to their demise.
Budget airlines are appealing to travelers because they offer much lower prices than major airlines. A flight to London from New York can cost around $1,000 on American Airlines, British Airways or another major carrier, but the same trip on low-cost Norwegian, for the same dates, can be around $600. Similarly, a flight from Washington to Paris costs around $1,200 on Air France, and just more than $800 on Aer Lingus.
For travelers who are concerned about the risks of booking low-cost, here are some tips to keep in mind.
You don't need to avoid all budget airlines.
Though the Wow Air developments were jarring, aviation experts say that the chances of an airline going under, out of nowhere, are very low.
To protect your travel and itineraries, first conduct some research online. News about Wow Airlines' financial woes had been swirling for months before it canceled its flights. A Google search brings up articles from 2018 mentioning that Wow was "struggling," suffering from "growing pains" and on Trip Advisor, the company had more "Terrible" reviews than "Good" or "Excellent" ones.
Christian Nielsen, the chief legal officer at AirHelp, a site that helps passengers make claims against airlines, recommends travelers consider whether the carrier is well-established.
"If it's someone new in the game, I would be cautious about booking a flight across the Atlantic," he said. "At least not without buying some travel insurance."
Scott Keyes, co-founder and chief executive of Scott's Cheap Flights, a travel site that alerts members on inexpensive flight fares, said he would always read news reports on specific airlines. (Scott's Cheap Flights never suggested flights on Wow Air, because of the airline's high fees for luggage, food, seat upgrades and other additions.)
"If I heard that an airline was potentially going to go under soon, I wouldn't book it," Keyes said. "I wouldn't recommend booking if it seems like this is something that's imminent but I wouldn't be shying away from booking budget airlines altogether."
And if things do go awry?
"There are protections if things go wrong, so there's very little downside risk to booking flights on low-budget airlines," Keyes said.
Book with a credit card, not a debit card.
If your airline goes bankrupt, it's unlikely you'll receive a refund for a canceled flight. But your credit-card company could help, and you can file a dispute with them for a service you paid for, but did not receive.
"A lot of cards nowadays have protections that say 'if your trip is canceled for reasons unrelated to anything you did, then we will reimburse you,'" Keyes said. This protection is quite common, he said, comes with most cards, not simply the premium ones. "It's also not something you need to pay to enroll in."
Debit cards, however, do not offer this cancellation protection, said Zaneilia Harris, president of Harris and Harris Wealth Management in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.
You don't always have to buy travel insurance.
If you have any nonrefundable expenses at stake, insurance is a good idea. Buying travel insurance is trip-specific and often relies on how much risk you're willing to take. If you are concerned about the limitations of an airline's compensation terms, you can book travel insurance from a third party and look for coverage for your entire trip, not just your plane tickets.
"Travel insurance from a third party can help if your airline goes belly up, bags are lost or stolen, your flight is delayed - for a covered reason - or you miss a connection that prevents you from, say, boarding your cruise," said Julie Loffredi, media relations manager for InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site.
And if you're traveling internationally, travel medical insurance is a good idea. Experts recommend "cancel for any reason" travel insurance plans because you can get at least 75% of your nonrefundable trip costs back.
If things do go wrong, act fast.
Of course, some developments arise that no amount of planning can account for, especially when you're traveling. If your airline suddenly cancels flights, your first calls should be to your travel agent or insurance company, then to your credit card company. And if you didn't book with an agent or if you don't have insurance, first try to get a new flight and then contact your credit card company.
"Try to get a flight ticket home as quickly as possible, because you're probably not the only one stranded and there will be high demand," Nielsen said. "The sooner you reach out to the right people, the quicker they can book you on an alternate flight and get you home."

If impeachment comes, it's on Trump and the GOP; op-ed

Texto completo: Our nation does not have to face a constitutional crisis, but we are barreling toward one at breakneck speed. The House should not have to move quickly toward impeachment, but it may now have little choice.
And let's be clear: The prime mover in all this, who is perfectly happy to wreck our institutions to serve his own selfish interests, is President Donald Trump. But we would not be courting chaos if Republicans in the House and Senate had not abandoned their commitments to fact and accountability in their zeal to help the president escape the consequences of his actions.
The week's most important event was thus not Wednesday's House Judiciary Committee vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's craven, reckless partisanship in declaring "case closed" on Trump.
He said this despite special counsel Robert Mueller's report describing so many instances of obstruction of justice that more than 700 former federal prosecutors signed a letter declaring that were Trump not president, the findings would lead to "multiple felony charges." Case closed?
The report also detailed at least 140 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, by Trump and 18 of his associates, as The New York Times reported. We are not supposed to care about this? Case closed?
And in his acidic soliloquy on Tuesday, McConnell had the shameless audacity to blame President Obama for Russia's interference when it was McConnell himself who resisted the intelligence community's findings about Russian meddling before the 2016 election. McConnell also led GOP efforts to block a bipartisan statement Obama sought that would've given the country some warning about what Vladimir Putin's agents were doing. McConnell's only consistency is his party-before-country commitment to protecting Trump.
There are Republicans who purport to care about more than Trump's well-being and comfort. With McConnell clearly all-in on the president's twisting of the law and flouting of Congress' legitimate authority, Republican senators who claim to care about the Constitution need to speak up. And they should do so now, not after they have had weeks or months to put their fingers to the wind. Where are Sens. Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Ben Sasse, Martha McSally, Joni Ernst and Thom Tillis? Any four of them could join with Senate Democrats to begin building a Coalition for Accountability.
And during the House Judiciary debate over the contempt citation for Barr, Republican members spoke in favor of the only infrastructure program they're likely to embrace this year: the construction of an impenetrable stone wall keeping Congress from getting any information out of this administration.
It should be astounding that Republicans want to investigate FBI officials - a goal pressed during the Judiciary Committee debate by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio - for daring to do their jobs investigating the Trump campaign's potential Russian ties. But what's more astonishing is that we are no longer surprised that members of Trump's party would undercut work aimed at protecting our democracy from intrusion by a hostile foreign power in order to aggrandize a scam artist. His latest boast, by the way, is that he avoided taxes for "sport."
With Republicans cheering on Trump's campaign to block Congress' access to witnesses and documents, House Democrats have fewer and fewer options short of impeachment to establish that the rule of law still exists.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been hoping for a more decorous process. Ideally, the House would hold hearings and increase public awareness about the charges against Trump without having to rush the issue of whether the president should be removed. On Wednesday, she voiced her frustration over seeing this option strangled by Trump's witness gag-order. She even introduced a new phrase into the political lexicon during a Washington Post interview, saying the president was "becoming self-impeachable."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., later elucidated Pelosi's linguistic innovation on MSNBC. In its across-the-board resistance, "the administration is not helping their own cause here, unless impeachment is exactly what the president wants." Schiff, who shares Pelosi's caution, acknowledged that "the degree to which the administration is now obstructing Congress ... adds weight to the argument of those who are urging impeachment."
We don't know if Trump longs for impeachment to rally his supporters. What we do know is that he and his party are unwilling to make the substantive accommodations to transparency that would avert an all-out political war. If it comes to an impeachment battle, the president and the GOP will have fired the first shots.

Somerville wary of facial ID programs

Texto completo: Somerville officials have proposed a ban on the use of facial recognition in police investigations and municipal surveillance programs, part of a growing backlash against a rapidly evolving technology that critics fear may lead to false identifications and bias against minorities.
A bill to ban the technology was introduced at the Somerville City Council Thursday, and appears headed for passage later this year. Meanwhile, the state Legislature is considering bills that would enact similar prohibitions statewide. And across the country, cities such as San Francisco and Oakland are moving quickly to ban facial recognition in municipal uses.
In Somerville, the proposed ban already has the backing of nine of 11 city councilors, as well as Mayor Joseph Curtatone. The American Civil Liberties Union, which supports such crackdowns, says Somerville is the first East Coast city to push for a ban.
The lead sponsor of the Somerville measure, Councilor Ben Ewen-Campen, said he could see facial recognition being useful in serious emergencies, such as terrorism cases. But he doesn't think the technology is ready, nor has the public considered its full implications.
“I think large numbers of the public may eventually be convinced that there is a useful need for this kind of thing," he said. “But to use cases like that as the thin edge of a wedge to allow the government to just, in real time, surveil every person in every public space in our community, I think that's where the real danger is."
Ewen-Campen said he does not know of any ongoing surveillance programs in Somerville that would be banned by the measure, but said it is important to discuss the technology before it gets into widespread use.
And Curtatone, too, said he is concerned that “the ease and efficiency of tech can also be so vast and so broad that it can infringe on our right to privacy."
At the state level, similar bills have attracted a significant base of support. One measure, proposed by Senate majority leader Cynthia Stone Creem, also has the support of minority leader Bruce E. Tarr.
That bill would place a moratorium on the state government's use of face recognition and other “remote biometric surveillance systems" until the state has developed a framework for who can collect such information, how the data will be managed, how it will be audited, and what subjects' rights will be.
“I don't think we're arguing that this is something that would never work," Creem said. “I just would argue that at this point . . . it's pretty clear that it's not developed."
Just as facial recognition technology can help social networking services such as Facebook to identify friends in your uploaded pictures, it can also help police and other government agencies look for possible suspects and potential threats in images collected by investigators or taken by the thousands of public cameras in use.
But civil rights advocates say that there are not nearly enough safeguards in place to make sure that the technology is being used ethically, or even whether it works correctly.
For instance, research published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University last year found that commercial facial recognition programs misidentified the gender of dark-skinned women as much as one-third of the time, while they made similar errors on light-skinned men in fewer than 1 percent of cases.
Moreover, alarm over potential misuses of the technology by governments has grown with the disclosures that the Chinese government had used facial recognition as part of its crackdown on the Uighur ethnic minority. The New York Times reported in April that law enforcement in one Chinese city ran 500,000 scans in a single month over surveillance cameras to identify Uighurs.
Kade Crockford, who runs the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said facial recognition should not be used by law enforcement because it is unreliable and the public has not had enough time to consider the implications of its use.
Facial recognition systems are used by some US police departments; Amazon, for example, has been pressured by people in the artificial intelligence field to stop selling its facial recognition system to law enforcement agencies.
Plymouth's Police Department was recently pitched on a facial recognition technology by a Cambridge startup that sells surveillance tools to law enforcement. Suspect Technologies cofounder Jacob Sniff had proposed that Plymouth police install cameras with facial recognition capabilities in public buildings around town, and suggested the department could tap into a statewide database of driver's license photos, according to e-mails the ACLU obtained through public records requests.
However, the company was told the state had denied previous requests to access the photo database. And Plymouth police Chief Michael E. Botieri told the Globe in a phone interview in April the town won't use the Suspect Technologies program as proposed. Instead, Plymouth will test out the company's software — on a free-trial basis — in criminal investigations to compare faces in video evidence against those in the department's booking photos.
The software, Botieri said, is simply “an investigative tool," and even if it registers a match, “you wouldn't just arrest someone based on what the computer says. It just points you in a direction to investigate."
“I totally get the privacy issue," Botieri added. “It's something people feel is intrusive."
In a statement to the Globe Friday, Sniff said his company “strives to provide video analytical solutions that enable public safety authorities to solve crime, improve the quality of life for their local communities, and provide technology that is designed to respect privacy and protect the innocent."
Facial recognition is but one of several new technologies that have extended the surveillance reach of law enforcement, and have raised a host of new privacy questions that governments around the United States are racing to resolve. In Massachusetts, the State Police ran a program for more than three years collecting license plate data of every vehicle that crossed the two Cape Cod bridges — more than 100 million trips — without disclosing its use to drivers.
Ewen-Campen, the Somerville councilor, is pushing another measure that would increase public oversight of surveillance technology in Somerville. But facial recognition, he added, is in a class of its own, “and that's why until we have that conversation about what the regulations are, what the guardrails are, a ban is really the only way that we can go."

Texto completo: Happy Friday!
The escalation of tensions between North Korea and the United States comes even though President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un have each tried to resist hawkish advisers. Kim and Trump have focused on building a personal relationship as they look to forge a historic disarmament accord. “What’s really striking is how in both systems the bureaucracies aren’t always moving in the same direction as the leaders are signaling,” Scott Snyder, a Korea expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said. [WaPost]
Topping the news: Former 4th Congressional District Rep. Mia Love, a Republican, told the Deseret News she hasn’t ruled out another run against Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams. [DNews]

-> South Salt Lake’s mayor has proposed a 31% property tax increase to support firefighters and police. [Trib]
Tweets of the day: @AJentleson: “If politics was just taking positions that are already popular, it’d be easy. In this case that adds up to running against an incumbent president on pocketbook issues while unemployment is at 3-4% while also arguing he doesn’t deserve to be impeached for the crimes he committed.”
-> @NateSilver538: "I’d say Pelosi is being a good leader by knowing that impeaching (but not removing!) Trump *isn’t* important enough for her members to put their seats at risk, as compared to longer-term D priorities such as climate change, health care, voting rights, income equality, etc.”
-> @jimmykimmel: “.@RealDonaldTrump is the BEST at losing money”
Happy Birthday: Aimee Winder Newton, Salt Lake County Council member; Lynn Hemingway, Democrat formerly representing District 40 in the Utah House of Representatives; and Sandra Hollins, Democrat representing District 23 in the House of Representatives.
Behind the Headlines: Salt Lake Tribune senior managing editor Matt Canham, reporter Taylor Stevens and columnist George Pyle joined KCPW’s Marcie Young Cancio to discuss the week’s top news, including the decision to take the Tribune nonprofit.

Nationally: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the United States is in a “constitutional crisis” because of the Trump administration’s lack of cooperation in handing over a copy of the unredacted Mueller report. [NYTimes]
-> U.S. authorities seized a North Korean ship used to illegally sell coal. Justice Department officials said the move was a step in the U.S. effort to tighten sanctions against North Korea. [WaPost]
-> In a New York Times opinion piece, a Facebook co-founder said the company has too much unchecked power and called on the government to break it up. [NYTimes] [Politico]

Texto completo: El caso de Niels Högel, un enfermero alemán que resultó ser un asesino en serie , continúa inquietando a Alemania y a gran parte del mundo. Högel confesó haber matado a 43 pacientes pero las autoridades calculan que al menos 300 personas fueron víctimas de sus crímenes .
La pregunta que ahora se plantean los familiares de las vícitmas y la sociedad alemana en general es cómo este hombre pudo asesinar ininterrumpidamente a tantas personas en cinco años sin que nadie diera la voz de alarma . ¿No se dieron cuenta sus compañeros? ¿Y los supervisores de lo hospitales?
Niels Högel se enfrenta pronto a su tercer juicio desde 2006. En este está acusado de matar a 100 personas . 36 de ellas las mataría en la clínica principal de la pequeña ciudad de Oldenburg y otros 64 en el hospital de Delmenhorst, una zona residencial a 20 millas de Bremen.
Högel se trasladó del hospital de Oldenburg al de Delmenhorst con una carta de recomendación del primero de ellos que destacaba la capacidad del enfermero para trabajar “de manera independiente y concienzuda” y para afrontar situaciones de crisis “atenta y detenidamente” y con “habilidades técnicas correctas” .
La carta no hacía ninguna mención a las sospechas derivadas de la gran cantidad de muertes que habían ocurrido mientras Högel estaba de servicio. L a misiva de recomendación tampoco citaba que habían prohibido al enfermero estar en contacto con los pacientes .
Sin embargo, las mismas sospechas no tartaron en aparecer en el hospital de Delmenhorst, donde -según The New York Times– varios pacientes murieron bajo la supervisión de Högel en sus primeros cuatro meses como enfermero.
Högel, que ahora tiene 42 años, es considerado en Alemania uno de los asesinos en serie con más víctimas en tiempos de paz. Actualmente el hombre cumple cadena perpetua en la cárcel de Oldenburg.
Frank Lauxtermann, el primer compañero en testificar en su contra habla de la cultura alemana de hacer la vista gorda . Aunque al parecer los compañeros de Oldenburg habían hablado de él, ningunó presentó queja a los jefes. Según declaró una de las testigos, no llevaron el tema más allá por miedo o porque pensaban que no era su asunto en un país en el que mucha gente es muy celosa de su privacidad .
De hecho, Sebastian Bührmann, el juez que lleva el caso, ordenó investigar también a ocho de sus compañeros. Bührmann sospecha que los enfermeros podrían haber mentido a la corte u ocultado evidencia en el juicio actual para ocultar sus posibles negligencias . Ahora mismo dos doctores y dos jefes de enfermería del hospital Delmenhorst ya están acusados. Högel tendrá que testificar en sus juicios cuando haya un veredicto sobre su caso.
Otros antiguos compañeros del asesino en serie confeso dicen que se ganó la fama de poder manejar situaciones de vida o muerte. Por su parte, la acusación dice que esa era su estrategia ya que, en realidad, creaba situaciones en las que la vida y la muerte dependían de él.
321 de las 411 muertes que tuvieron lugar mientras Högel trabajó en el hospital de Delmenhorst ocurrieron en sus cambios de turno , según los registros. Un enfermero de este hospital sí que dio la voz de alarma pero, al parecer, los supervisores no hicieron nada al respecto.
Finalmente, en junio de 2005 una enfermera en prácticas fue más allá cuando descubrió que su compañero había desconectado la máquina que mantenía vivo a un paciente y vio en la basura los envoltorios de unos medicamentos no prescritos para él. Desde que descubrieron lo que había hecho hasta el final de su turno ese día, Högel acabó con la vida de su última víctima.
Karl-Heinz Beine, un neurólogo alemán, dijo a NYT que “Niels Högel forma parte de una minoría extrema”. El doctor, que investiga a asesinos en serie en las profesiones médicas desde 1989, dice que le sorprendió la falta de empatía de Högel incluso delante de las familias de las víctimas. Beine cree que el antiguo enfermero está motivado por el narcisismo y la falta de autoestima .

Texto completo: President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani is planning on traveling to Ukraine soon to encourage the incoming government to push forward with investigations that “will benefit” Trump.
Speaking to the New York Times Thursday, Giuliani said he plans to visit Kiev and meet with president-elect Volodymyr Zelensky to ask that Ukraine pursue investigations into two matters: the origin of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the involvement of Joe Biden’s son in an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.
“We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,” Giuliani said.
“There’s nothing illegal about it,” he added. “Somebody could say it’s improper. And this isn’t foreign policy — I’m asking them to do an investigation that they’re doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I’m going to give them reasons why they shouldn’t stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.”
Giuliani hopes to use the push to discredit Mueller’s investigation and potentially cause damage to Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden’s campaign.
Zelensky, 41, is set to take office on June 3. He is a former TV comedian who beat out the incumbent president in a runoff election. Giuliani has reached out for a meeting with Zelensky, but a get-together hasn’t yet been confirmed.
Should the two meet, Giuliani said he is going to tell Zelensky “what I know about the people that are surrounding him, and how important it is to do a full, complete, and fair investigation.”
Last week Giuliani called for Biden to be investigated for a trip he made in 2016 when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss Viktor Shokin, the country’s then-prosecutor general. Biden’s son, Hunter, stood to gain financially from having Shokin removed.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., tweeted about the news Thursday, writing: "Today, Giuliani admitted to seeking political help from a foreign power. Again. His defense: 'We’re not meddling in an election, we’re meddling in an investigation ... Somebody could say it’s improper.' Yes. It is. Immoral, unethical, unpatriotic and, now, standard procedure."

Giuliani said Trump supports his efforts in Ukraine.

Texto completo: OIL
Chevron drops bid for Anadarko Petroleum in face of Occidental offer The energy giant Chevron on Thursday dropped its bid for Anadarko Petroleum, ending the industry's fiercest takeover battle in at least 15 years and leaving Occidental Petroleum, a much smaller rival, poised to become the dominant force in the largest oil field in the United States. Chevron's decision to abandon its $33 billion offer for Anadarko and instead walk away with a $1 billion breakup fee came less than a month after the two companies reached a deal. The agreement was upended when Occidental stepped in a short time later and offered to acquire Anadarko for $38 billion, most of it cash. Its bid was fortified with a commitment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to invest $10 billion in the company. By acquiring Anadarko, Occidental will almost double in size and gain a significant foothold in the Permian Basin, which straddles West Texas and New Mexico and has been the principal driver of the shale-oil revolution that has made the United States a major oil exporter over the past three years. Occidental would also become a major producer in the Gulf of Mexico offshore field. — NEW YORK TIMES
SOCIAL MEDIA
Facebook cofounder says company should be broken up Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes says it's time to break up the social media behemoth. In a New York Times opinion piece published Thursday, Hughes said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has turned Facebook into an innovation-suffocating monopoly. Hughes called Zuckerberg's power "unprecedented and un-American" and said his co-founder's focus on growth "led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks." Hughes roomed with Zuckerberg at Harvard and left Facebook in 2007 to campaign for Barack Obama. Hughes said he no longer has any ownership in Facebook or any other social media company. "I feel a sense of anger and responsibility," he wrote, lamenting the company's "slow response to Russian agents, violent rhetoric and fake news." — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
Fox Sports to include betting predictions in broadcasts Fox Sports viewers tuning in to some broadcasts this fall will not only see the game, but also will get betting predictions. The network announced a partnership Wednesday night with the parent company of the PokerStars online gambling giant. Fox Sports is buying just under 5 percent of The Stars Group for about $236 million. Both companies will offer real-money sports betting this fall in states where it is legal and they are licensed. The Stars Group says it has market access through licensing in 13 states, and is seeking licensing in others. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
SHAVING
Harry's sold to Schick for $1.36 billion Harry's, the upstart shaving company, is being acquired by the owner of Schick razors for $1.37 billion. Harry's has bedeviled brands like Schick and Gillette for years using innovative subscription plans and sleek packaging. Under the agreement announced Thursday, investors in Harry's Inc. will take a stake of about 11 percent of Edgewell Personal Care Co., which manages Schick and other brands. Edgewell gets the Harry's brand and access to the company's prized direct-to-consumer marketing base. The Harry's brand steps on to a much larger stage, a global one, and will be marketed through Edgewell's enormous distribution channels. The company has a footprint in 50 markets. Outside of the United States, Edgewell has operations in Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, and Australia. Edgewell also owns the brands Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic and Wet Ones wipes. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
STREAMING MEDIA
Netflix acquires StoryBots in a challenge to Disney Netflix Inc. acquired the StoryBots children's media brand as the world's largest streaming service prepares to challenge rival Walt Disney Co.'s kid-friendly online platform scheduled to start in November. Under the deal, StoryBots creators Gregg and Evan Spiridellis will produce more original content including series and short-form specials, Netflix said Thursday, without disclosing terms. Buying StoryBots and expanding its programming may help Netflix draw more children and parents, a battleground market as family-focused Disney plans to start offering movies and shows from its Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars franchises online later this year. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
SNEAKERS
Nike to launch foot measuring app this summer Nike wants to meet your feet. The sneaker seller will launch a foot-scanning tool on its app this summer that will measure and remember the length, width, and other dimensions of customers' feet after they point a smartphone camera to their toes. The app will then tell shoppers what size to buy each of its shoes in, which Nike hopes will cut down on costly online returns as it seeks to sell more of its goods through its websites and apps. But Nike will also get something it has never had before: a flood of data on the feet of regular people, a potential goldmine for the shoe maker, which says it will use the information to improve the design of its shoes. Nike mainly relies on the feet of star athletes to build its kicks. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates fall for a second week Long-term mortgage rates declined this week for a second straight week, reversing the upward trend in April as a lure to potential home buyers. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.10 percent from 4.14 percent last week. By contrast, a year ago the benchmark rate stood at 4.55 percent. The average rate for 15-year, fixed-rate home loans eased this week to 3.57 percent from 3.60 percent last week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
INVESTMENTS
Fidelity 401(k) accounts soar in the past decade Investors who've had 401(k) accounts at Fidelity for a decade saw their average balance increase sixfold to almost $300,000 since the market bottomed after the global financial crisis, the company said. Workers saving for retirement saw their 401(k) balances crater in the 2008-to-2009 market meltdown. Ten years ago, in the first quarter of 2009, investors had an average account balance of $52,600, according to a report Thursday by the Boston-based firm. In March of that year, the S&P 500 index hit a low. It has more than quadrupled in value since. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
CREDIT CARDS
Ocasio-Ortez, Sanders want credit card interest rates capped at 15% Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused banks of acting as “modern-day loan sharks" and called on Congress to enact a federal limit of 15 percent on credit card interest rates. The two self-identified democratic-socialists proposed legislation on Thursday capping rates on credit card and other consumer loans and letting post offices offer low-cost basic financial services, such as checking and savings accounts and loans. An outline of the plan released ahead of their formal announcement sharply criticized banks for charging an average 17.17 percent interest on credit card balances while they are able to borrow money at less than 2.5 percent. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A day after being cited for contempt, Attorney General William Barr looked no worse for the rare rebuke.
Barr, in his first public appearance since the House Judiciary Committee took action against the attorney general for refusing to turn over an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report, wore a broad smile as he presided over a farewell ceremony for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Drawing howls of laughter, the attorney general did not hesitate to address the congressional admonishment, suggesting that it "must be a record" for the first 100 days of any attorney general's tenure.
He then called the guest of honor, Rosenstein, to his side to re-enact a much-mocked scene from a Justice Department briefing just prior to last month's release of Mueller's report when Rosenstein stood stone-faced behind his boss, prompting a comic viral surge on Twitter.
"I do my best work at congressional hearings," Barr said, referring to his own combative appearance last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Rod does his best work standing behind the attorney general. "
More: William Barr grilled by Congress after release of Mueller Report
More: Barr vs. Mueller: The attorney general fights his own battle with the special counsel as he stands up for Trump
While Thursday's ceremony was staged to honor Rosenstein's three-decades at the department, it was transformed into a pep rally of sorts where former and current officials offered stirring defenses of an agency thrust into a harsh spotlight since Mueller's report was made public.
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom President Donald Trump ousted largely because of his recusal from the Russia investigation, cited Rosenstein's unswerving leadership during "one of the most difficult times in the history of the department. "
Referring to Mueller by name, Sessions said the special counsel was "given the time and the support" to complete his work.
"At the end, in America, we are committed to a lawful process," Sessions said. "The system worked. What more can a public servant do?"
Sessions, who left the podium to a standing ovation, was only one in a roster of guests drawn to the department's cavernous Great Hall and who played singular roles in the 22-month inquiry that–despite its completion–continues to shake at the highest levels of the department.
Though Barr and Rosenstein, whose tumultuous tenure was defined by Mueller's investigation, were the unquestioned headliners of the event, others included former White House Counsel Don McGahn, perhaps the most quoted witness in the special counsel's scathing 448-page report; Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N. C. , whose committee continues its own inquiry of Russian interference; Matt Whitaker, who briefly served as acting attorney general following Sessions' ouster; and FBI Director Christopher Wray, who replaced James Comey after his abrupt dismissal because of his handling of the Russia inquiry.
Also not to be ignored was the symbolism of the very date of Thursday's ceremony: two years to the day of Comey's dismissal, an act that contributed to broadening Mueller's inquiry into an examination of whether Trump had sought to obstruct the investigation by firing the man who then ran it.
Because Mueller did not make a determination on the question of obstruction, Barr intervened in March, announcing in a summary of the special counsel's findings that there was insufficient evidence to charge the president with criminal obstruction.
Democrats have since seized on Barr's intervention, claiming that the attorney general acted to protect the president.
Outside of Mueller's team, however, the public weight of the past two years of investigation was mostly borne by Rosenstein who spent much that time on the verge of removal or resignation.
His oversight of Mueller's far-flung inquiry into Russian election interference often made him a favorite target of Trump, who once superimposed Rosenstein’s likeness behind prison bars in one of many tweets disparaging the president’s political enemies.
Among his first actions as deputy attorney general, Rosenstein authored a memorandum that Trump used as the basis for firing Comey.
Comey's firing so shook public confidence in the Russia inquiry that just days later, Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, to lead the investigation as a Justice Department special counsel.
Nonetheless, Rosenstein often found himself in the middle of a politically-charged battle in which Trump and congressional allies cast the deputy attorney general as a ringleader in partisan "witch hunt" while Democrats came to view the Republican as an unlikely guard against White House interference.
His tenure nearly came to a premature end last year when he mulled resignation in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that he suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump.
Rosenstein strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
The incident prompted a hastily-called White House meeting where Rosenstein expected to be fired – only to return to Justice later that day with his status unchanged.
His relationship with Trump, while often fraught, appeared in recent months to settle, with Trump claiming in a January interview with the New York Times that the deputy attorney general had assured him that he was not a target of Mueller's probe.
In his resignation letter submitted last month, Rosenstein offered both gratitude to Trump and veiled references to the extraordinary challenges posed by the investigation that shadowed the first two years of Trump's administration.
On Thursday, the outgoing deputy attorney general summoned an unmitigated defense of the department and its handling of Mueller's report.
"The rule of law is not just a talking point for us," Rosenstein told the audience, "it is an operating principle. The rule of law requires us to ignore partisan politics, tune out the news cycle, and base our decisions on credible evidence.
"We stayed the course and we accomplished what we set out to do," he said. "I leave here confident that justice is in good hands; it is in your hands. "

Texto completo: Office Depot will close three stores in South Florida on May 18, the latest contraction at a major employer where sales have plummeted, the future remains uncertain and embarrassing controversies have multiplied.
The company, based in Boca Raton, will close Office Depot stores in Pembroke Pines and Lauderdale Lakes, as well as an OfficeMax store in Boca Raton.
On a conference call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday, CEO Gerry Smith said the company plans to close more stores this year than last year. By the end of 2018, Office Depot had shuttered 154 of the 300 stores it planned to close over three years. It operates 1,350 Office Depot and OfficeMax stores nationwide and employs about 2,000 people at its headquarters in Boca Raton.
Cost-cutting has come in waves as Office Depot and similar retailers try to find their way in a world increasingly dominated by online shopping. One of Smith's prime objectives is to develop Office Depot as a business services company rather than a traditional office-supply retailer.
To that end, Office Depot in 2017 acquired CompuCom, an IT business based in South Carolina, for $1 billion, but the new division has not yet paid off. Smith warned in April that CompuCom would report a $15 million loss in the first quarter. And CompuCom's poor performance was only part of the trouble that has swirled around Office Depot this spring.
The New York Times reported in March that Walmart ended its contract with CompuCom amid accusations that the company - a Walmart contractor - had snooped on the emails of Walmart employees, drawing an FBI investigation.
Office Depot says the incident occurred three years ago, before it acquired the company, and the employees involved are no longer with CompuCom.
The same month, Office Depot agreed to pay $25 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission that it had duped customers out of millions of dollars for nearly a decade by selling them unneeded computer repair and technical services.
According to the FTC, Office Depot offered free computer tune-ups with a program called "PC Check-Up." Although Office Depot claimed the program identified malware, it actually had been configured to identify malware whenever customers answered yes to one of four questions about computer speed, viruses, crashes, popups and other problems, the FTC claimed. Customers were tricked into buying tech-repair services, sometimes for hundreds of dollars, through Support.com, an Office Depot software supplier that reaped tens of millions of dollars, the FTC said.
Support.com agreed to pay $10 million as part of the settlement. Office Depot admitted no wrongdoing.
Office Depot's disappointing financial results for its first quarter were released Wednesday.
Quarterly net income from continuing operations totaled $8 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with $33 million and 6 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018.
Same-store sales - those of stores open more than a year - were down 4 percent in the first quarter, with retail sales down 6 percent. Total company sales, which include business and government contracts, decreased 2 percent to $2.77 million from $2.83 million in the same quarter a year ago. Product sales were down 3 percent and service revenues were flat.
"Our first-quarter results were disappointing, driven primarily by poor performance at our CompuCom division," Smith said.
He said the company will further reduce expenses through "the elimination of certain positions," but he was not specific about layoffs. Smith said the company will get back on target through cost-cutting measures such as restructuring, expansion of technology and automation, and trimming of discretionary spending.
Office Depot's stock closed at $2.21 a share, down 3 cents, or 1.34 percent, in Nasdaq trading.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Trump Tax Figures Show a Decade of Huge Losses" (front page, May 8):
Thanks for continuing to investigate President Trump's tax returns and working to compensate for his fearful refusal to share important information with the American people.
The details you have uncovered continue to demonstrate that his stated reasons for refusing to do what other candidates for president have accepted the need to do are not believable, and that his returns contain ample evidence of huge business failures, together with many practices and schemes for which, in my opinion, "suspect" is far too kind a word.
As you point out, there are a plethora of other issues, including the many years when he failed to pay any taxes.
In "5 Takeaways From 10 Years of Trump Tax Figures" (nytimes.com, May 8), you state that "year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual taxpayer." Mr. Trump rightly should have been the host of the reality TV show called "The Biggest Loser."
If we don't work successfully to prevent his re-election in 2020, though, that name will fit our whole country.

To the Editor:
Objective readers are again in debt to The Times for documenting the deception engaged in by the braggart and narcissist who resides in the White House. So much for the "stable genius" who is the master of "the art of the deal."
It is not easy to lose such a vast sum of money, so it is reasonable to conclude that despite all that was provided to him by his father, Donald Trump frittered it away because he is in reality a business flop.
What is stunning is not the exposure of the emperor with no clothes, but that his loyal base will think nothing of the fact that he has been revealed to be a fraud.
I can hear it now: "Fake news from the failing New York Times."

To the Editor:
Donald Trump's losses were used as legitimate income tax deductions. The president was no different than other real estate developers and entrepreneurs who scrambled to stay afloat in a financial rough-and-tumble atmosphere 30 years ago during the recession.
It's not clear how this tax information was obtained, but this article is not merely unbalanced, but also seeks to inflame with the obvious intention to provoke the duly elected chief executive. That, in turn, only pushes him to digress from focusing on his executive duties.

To the Editor:
Congratulations on your bombshell article on Donald Trump's taxes. This is something that many people in business thought was the case, but we didn't have the background materials to prove it.
I would ask one major question: How did he obtain loans from Deutsche Bank after the earnings record that he amassed over those 10 years of tax returns? I spent 40 years in banking, and I can't see a bank providing significant financing to the Trump empire without a guarantee from a formidable third-party guarantor, a cash account in the same amount with the bank or significant collateral. United States regulators would question loans to an entity with such a bad track record absent the above-mentioned.

New York Times story on Trump's billion-dollar tax write off was told by Trump 15 years ago on 'The Apprentice'

Texto completo: The New York Times led readers to believe it had blown the lid off of President Trump’s massive business failures with its very long report Tuesday night, detailing his $1.17 billion loss between 1985 and 1994.
But the story has been told before, by Trump himself, on NBC’s “The Apprentice.”
On Jan. 8, 2004, at the top of the show’s very first episode, Trump laid out a summarized version of the same story about himself that the Times so proudly ran Tuesday.
Here’s a side by side of what Trump said in the monologue in 2004 with what the Times report said 15 years later.
Trump, 2004: “It wasn’t always so easy. About 13 years ago, I was seriously in trouble. I was billions of dollars in debt.” Times, 2019: “The numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses — largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade.”
Trump, 2004: “But I fought back and I won big league. I used my brain. I used my negotiating skills. And I worked it all out.” Times, 2019: “Mr. Trump’s 2005 returns … showed that by then he had significant sources of income and was paying taxes.”
Trump, 2004: “Now my company’s bigger than it ever was, stronger than it ever was and I’m having more fun than I ever had. I’ve mastered the art of the deal and I’ve turned the name Trump into the highest quality brand.” Times, 2019: “Mr. Trump built a business licensing his name, became a television celebrity and ran for the White House by branding himself a self-made billionaire.
Anyone interested in the specifics of how Trump blew through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and credit loans, or how he sunk bad dollar after bad dollar in failing projects can learn a lot from Trump’s 35-year-old tax information, though history suggests there’s little appetite for it.
The Times certainly had a big Trump story on Tuesday. It’s just that Trump had already told it 15 years ago.

Texto completo: SOFTWARE
Acquia buys Medford startup Acquia, a Boston company that uses open-source software to help clients build websites, applications, and other digital offerings, said on Wednesday it scooped up Mautic, a Medford startup using similar tools to build marketing software. The companies did not disclose the terms of the acquisition, but they said Mautic's staff of more than 40 will be absorbed into the much larger Acquia. Acquia, which has raised $194 million in venture capital, now has about 950 employees globally. Mautic had raised about $9 million before the acquisition, and the company said the deal was a bet on the growth potential for open-source projects. The code for open-source software is maintained by a community of users, and companies that build their business around it often sell services and maintenance for projects built with the software. Acquia cofounder Dries Buytaert also created the open-source content management software Drupal, which is a core part of Acquia's business. — ANDY ROSEN
INDUSTRY
Siemens to cut 10,000 jobs in major structuring German industrial equipment maker Siemens says it will cut some 10,000 jobs in a major restructuring that will involve spinning off its oil, gas, and power generation business and creating new areas of growth. The company said it would spin off its division that makes power turbines to increase its entrepreneurial freedom, while embarking on a sweeping cost-cutting effort at its remaining operations. The gas and power division has been under pressure due to a broader trend toward renewable energy such as sun and wind power. Competitors in the power business such as Boston-headquartered General Electric and Japan's Mitsubishi have struggled as well. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TOBACCO
Walmart to raise age to purchase tobacco products, e-cigarettes to 21 Walmart said Wednesday that it will raise the minimum age for tobacco products and e-cigarettes to 21 in all its US stores in an effort to combat tobacco sales to minors. It will also stop selling solutions and pods for e-cigarettes that are flavored like fruit or desserts. The world's largest retailer said the new rules will take effect in July, and will also include its Sam's Club warehouse stores. Previously, its minimum purchase age was 18, aside from a number of states where the law required a minimum purchase age of 21. Last month, drugstore operator Walgreens also said it would increase the minimum age for tobacco sales to 21 after the Food and Drug Administration accused it of repeatedly selling them to minors. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAXATION
ACLU of Rhode Island sues over tax sales exemption that covers only fiction books The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax "original and creative works" sold by writers, composers, and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state's taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not "original and creative works." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Miniskirts and pillows with photos of Auschwitz draw protests Museum authorities at the Auschwitz-Birkenau former Nazi German death camp in Poland have protested to an online vendor that was selling miniskirts, pillows, and other items bearing photos of the camp, where around 1.1 million people were killed during World War II. On Twitter, the museum addressed the vending site, redbubble, to say that offering such products with images of Auschwitz is "rather disturbing and disrespectful." Australian-based redbubble, which allows artists to create designs for T-shirts and other fabric items and sell them directly to the public, responded that it was taking "immediate action to remove" the items, which it said are not in line with its guidelines. From 1940-45, around 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, but also Poles, Gypsies, Russian prisoners of war, and others, were killed in the gas chambers or died of starvation, hard labor, and disease at Auschwitz-Birkenau, which Nazi Germany operated in occupied Poland. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Britain doesn't burn coal for a week Britain has gone a week without burning coal for electricity for the first time since the 19th century. Power operator National Grid says coal hasn't contributed to the UK electricity mix since the afternoon of May 1. The landmark was reached two years after Britain had its first coal-free day since the Industrial Revolution. Fintan Slye, director of National Grid Electricity System Operator, said Wednesday that coal-free power would become the "new normal" as Britain generates more power from wind, solar, and other renewable sources. The government says Britain will eliminate coal from its power supply by 2025. It has set a deadline of 2050 to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions altogether. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
RETAIL
Carrefour, French retailer, could be latest company to leave China Carrefour, the French retail giant, is weighing options including a sale of its Chinese business, mirroring other international consumer firms that have decided to exit the country in recent years, people familiar with the matter said. Carrefour is working with an adviser and has begun reaching out to potential suitors, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Carrefour could seek about $1 billion for the Chinese business, though it may also opt to divest just a stake or decide against a sale, the people said. No final decisions have been made, they said. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
AGRICULTURE
California to ban pesticide linked to brain development problems in babies The nation's most productive agricultural state moved Wednesday to ban a controversial pesticide widely used to control a range of insects but blamed for harming brain development in babies. The move cheered by environmentalists would outlaw chlorpyrifos after scientists deemed it a toxic air contaminant and discovered it to be more dangerous than previously thought. California's environmental secretary, Jared Blumenfeld, said it's the first time the state has sought to ban a pesticide and the move was overdue. The decision comes after regulators in several states have taken steps in recent years to restrict the pesticide used on about 60 different crops in California, including grapes, almonds, and oranges. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MEDIA
New York Times subscriptions top 4.5 million The New York Times Co. on Wednesday reported first-quarter results that were better than expected, as gains in digital advertising and subscriptions outpaced the inexorable decline of its once-mighty print business. The total number of paid subscriptions, including digital and print, topped 4.5 million, a high. More than 3.5 million people pay for the publisher's online products, with the company adding 223,000 customers for its news, crossword, and cooking apps during the quarter, a 29 percent increase over last year. Revenue generated by online advertising was a bright spot. It rose 19 percent, to $55 million, helped by its podcast business, notably “The Daily." The paper's digital subscription and advertising businesses combined rose 16 percent, to $165.4 million. The future of the company hinges on digital growth as the print newspaper becomes a specialized product for an ever-shrinking base of readers. — NEW YORK TIMES

New York Times Posts Higher Profit, Adds 223,000 Digital Subscribers; Publisher had 4.5 million paying customers at end of first quarter as digital-subscription growth slowed

Texto completo: New York Times Co. added 223,000 digital subscribers in the first quarter as the publisher continued to spend aggressively in pursuit of its goal of reaching 10 million total subscriptions by 2025.
The Times reported a net income of $30.2 million, or 18 cents a share, for the quarter, up 38% from $21.9 million, or 13 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose to 20 cents from 17 cents.
Revenue grew 6.1% to $439.1 million, driven by higher subscription revenue as well as growth in its commercial-printing business and rental revenue from its New York headquarters building.
Analysts polled by FactSet expected adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share on revenue of $437.1 million.
"Subscription revenues made up two-thirds of the company's revenues and for the first time, digital-only subscription revenue was more than a quarter of total company revenue," Chief Executive Mark Thompson said.
Digital-subscription growth slowed in the first quarter. The 223,000 additions—79,000 of which were for the lower-cost cooking and crossword apps—marked a 16% decline from the 265,000 digital subscribers the company added in the fourth quarter of 2018.
The Times said it ended the quarter with 3.58 million paid digital subscribers. Including print subscribers, the Times had 4.5 million paying customers at the end of the quarter.
Subscription revenue rose by 3.9%, with much of the growth coming from digital-only products.
The company's shares were up 3.7% in afternoon trading.
Advertising revenue was about flat at $125.1 million. Revenue from digital advertising rose 19% to $55.5 million, while print advertising revenue fell 12% to $69.5 million.
To boost its digital subscriber totals, the Times spent 50% more on marketing, to $47.5 million, compared with a year ago. As a result, operating costs rose 7% in the quarter to $404.5 million.
The publisher expects operating costs and adjusted operating costs to increase about 8% to 10% in the second quarter from a year earlier, in part reflecting higher marketing costs.
The Times said it expects "seasonally slower growth in the number of paid digital-only subscriptions" in the second quarter.

Texto completo: Back in the golden age of presidential conduct, before Donald Trump wrecked every norm and smashed every guardrail, someone - either in Lyndon Johnson's White House or in Langley, accounts differ - decided to have the CIA spy on Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign.
The agent assigned to lead that illegal operation, in one of history's winks, was E. Howard Hunt, who would later conduct campaign spying in a private capacity for Richard Nixon's re-election. Hunt had subordinates volunteer for the Goldwater campaign and obtain advance copies of speeches and position papers, which were dutifully passed to the Johnson White House, which relied on them to pre-empt and befuddle Goldwater.
Hunt and others would later suggest that Johnson welcomed the intel because he needed a blowout win in 1964 to establish his own legitimacy. This is entirely plausible, but it's also reasonable to connect the spycraft to the larger climate of the '64 election, in which the entire political establishment treated Goldwater as a unique threat to the norms of postwar politics, a dangerous man likely to bring fascism to America or to lead the United States into thermonuclear war. It's a lot easier to justify the abuse of counterintelligence powers when you're convinced that the abnormal nature of a presidential candidacy demands it.
Now, 55 years later, we have an abnormal presidential candidate who actually won, and an FBI that definitely ran a secret investigation into his highly unusual campaign. We can wrangle over whether to use the term "spying" to describe sending informants to meet with a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, under false pretenses and subjecting another aide, Carter Page, to wiretapping. But having the law-enforcement arm of the executive branch surveil a presidential nominee from the opposing party is still the kind of case where, in a non-Trump context, anyone suspicious of our security state would smell a rat.
Of course we are not in a non-Trump context, and as someone who shared the establishment's fears about his candidacy, I've long assumed the combination of the Russian hacking and the shadiness of Trump's campaign associates created a reasonable predicate for investigation - especially since, unlike with LBJ, there is no evidence that it was used for partisan advantage during the campaign itself.
But now that the Mueller investigation has concluded that whatever the FBI thought they saw happening was probably not, in fact, the kind of complex conspiracy suggested by Christopher Steele's infamous dossier and other maximally alarmist theories, it's reasonable to ask some more questions about the don't-call-it-spying carried out against the Trump campaign.
Here are two of mine. First: Were any other entrapping approaches made to Trump campaign officials, and by whom? Throughout this controversy, running in parallel to the Steele/MSNBC theory of Trump-Putin conspiracy, there has been another conspiratorial reading of events, which alleges a pattern of outreach to the Trump campaign by intelligence-community and Clintonworld affiliates masquerading as Russian envoys. "Taken together," wrote Lee Smith last summer, "these efforts could be interpreted not as an investigation but a sting operation intended to dirty a presidential campaign."
I'm generally as skeptical of this counter-conspiracy theory as of the maximalist collusion case. But it would be helpful to know more about some of the ambiguous characters involved. For instance, was Stefan Halper, the Cambridge academic used by the FBI as a confidential informant, doing any outreach to Trumpworld before the FBI investigation formally began, as the counter-conspiracists suggest? And what actually became of Joseph Mifsud, the mysterious Maltese professor whose meetings with Papadopoulos, in which Mifsud claimed to have high-level contacts in Russia, set in motion events leading to the FBI opening its case? The counter-conspiracists suspect Mifsud of being connected to Western intelligence rather than the Kremlin, but nobody can ask him because he has simply disappeared.
Maybe more information on these points would just put the counter-conspiracy to bed. But if so that would be as welcome, and worth having, as Mueller's "no proof of conspiracy" conclusion.
Then equally welcome would be an answer to my second major question: Was any of the Steele dossier's bad intel deliberately crafted by the Russians?
Yes, the dossier did not itself touch off the FBI investigation, as Trump and his allies sometimes claim. But it played a role in the wiretapping of Carter Page, it presumably influenced the FBI's post-election decision to open a counterintelligence investigation into Trump himself, and the sequence that gave us the Comey firing and the Mueller investigation might have played out differently without the circulation of the dossier's more pungent allegations.
If, as seems possible, some of those pungent parts were actually invented in Moscow, then the FBI took unprecedented steps with uncertain constitutional implications while under the influence of bogus information.
You can think the worst of Trump and still find that a troubling conclusion, and one that echoes the lessons of 1964: The fear of abnormality reliably produces abnormality in response.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump cited "write offs," "depreciation," tax shelters and accounting gamesmanship as reasons for business losses in the 1980s and 1990s after The New York Times reported details of his tax returns.
The Times said Trump's businesses lost more than $1 billion from 1985 to 1994 – and he was able to avoid paying taxes in eight of those 10 years. Trump disputed the Times story but did not specify his objections.
"Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases," Trump tweeted early Wednesday.
Democrats questioned how he was able to stay afloat as he pursued his highly publicized business career.
Noting that a congressional committee seeks Trump's tax returns, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , tweeted that the Times story "underscores the importance of the Administration giving the Congress access" to those documents.
Contempt vote: House Judiciary Committee set to vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt
Trump's tax retuns: Trump avoided paying taxes for 8 years after more than $1 billion loss over a decade, report says
The newspaper reported that "year after year," Trump "appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. "
In a pair of tweets, Trump said it was routine for real estate developers to report losses – "sometimes considered 'tax shelter' " – which was done in part to renegotiate loans from banks.
Trump said, "You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes. . . . almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. "
Some financial analysts disputed Trump's analysis, including one of the co-authors of The New York Times report.
"Some fraction of Donald Trump’s losses can be attributed to depreciation. We found most of it was just bad business," tweeted Susanne Craig, a money reporter for the Times.
Trump said, "The very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!"
Trump reported business losses of $46. 1 million in 1985 and a total of $1. 17 billion in losses over a 10-year period beginning that year, the Times article said.
The Times said it obtained the data via "printouts from Mr. Trump’s official Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts, with the figures from his federal tax form, the 1040, for the years 1985 to 1994. "
Unlike presidents since the Watergate era of the early 1970s, Trump has refused to release his tax returns. This week, the Treasury Department refused a request from the House Ways and Means Committee for six years of Trump's returns and some business filings.
The House committee cited a law saying Congress can review individual tax filings to help it develop tax laws.
Trump allies said Democrats want the returns only to look for dirt on the president. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he didn't think the House panel's request has a "legitimate legislative purpose. "
Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, indicated he may sue to get Trump's taxes, saying Mnuchin's objection is not valid.
"He didn’t pay taxes for years and lost over $1 billion dollars – how is that possible?" said Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N. J. , a member of the Ways and Means Committee. "How did he keep getting more money, and where on earth was it all going? We need to know now. "

IRS info: Don was huge loser from 1985-1994

Texto completo: President Trump - who has spent decades crafting an image of himself as a master dealmaker - lost more than $1 billion on sketchy business ventures in the 1980s and '90s, making him one of the biggest financial losers in the country, according to a bombshell report Tuesday.
Copies of Trump's personal 1040 tax transcripts from 1985 to 1994, which were obtained by The New York Times, reveal the president racked up $1.17 billion in losses for the time period, the newspaper said.
The astronomical hit was so severe that Trump avoided paying any income tax for eight of the 10 years, according to The Times. The data, printouts of Trump's official IRS transcripts with figures from his federal 1040 forms, was provided to The Times by someone who had "legal" access to it.
When compared with Internal Revenue Service information on other high-income earners, Trump "appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," The Times reported.
The startling tax details come as the House Ways and Means Committee is pressing the IRS to provide Trump's personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday, however, refused to hand them over, saying the Democrat-controlled panel's request "lacks a legitimate legislative purpose."
Mnuchin's move, though not unexpected, will likely set off legal fireworks; Democrats could either subpoena the IRS for the returns, or file a lawsuit.
Trump is the first president since Watergate to decline to make his tax returns public.
According to The Times, Trump was swimming in red ink while he was peddling his 1987 best-seller "The Art of the Deal." For example, in 1985, his core businesses reported a loss of $46.1 million, and carried over a $5.6 million loss for earlier years.
But that wasn't the only bad news.
From 1986 through 1989, The Times reported, Trump declared $67.3 million in gains from stocks and other assets bought and sold within a year. But the figures show ultimately Trump lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his corporate raider boasts seriously, with The Times noting Trump would talk about a takeover but then quietly sell on the resulting bump in the stock price.
"He has an appetite like a Rocky Mountain vulture," his stockbroker, Alan Greenberg, told The Wall Street Journal in 1987. "He'd like to own the world."
The Times also reported that amid all the figures on 10 years of Trump's tax transcripts, one stood out: $52.9 million in interest income that he reported in 1989. In the three previous years, Trump had reported $460,566, then $5.5 million, then $11.8 million in interest. The source of the starkly higher interest income is unknown, The Times reported.
But the interest income fell about as quickly as it spiked; by 1992, he was reporting only $3.6 million.
The White House declined to comment on the Times report.

Two U.S. senators who lived lives of honor and courage

Texto completo: Let us now praise two almost-famous men who served in the Senate for a combined total of 74 years and died recently within three weeks of each other. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, and Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, both took a bipartisan approach to legislating and left their country a stronger, safer place.
Today, lawmakers who dare to reach across the aisle are branded as heretics and threatened with primary challenges. So it’s important to remember a time when working with political rivals to solve problems was not just possible, but popular.
Lugar was compact and colorless, known for his early-morning runs around Capitol Hill, even in lousy weather. A political ally, William Ruckelshaus, once joked about him, "Dick has maintained that childhood capability of walking into an empty room and blending right in."
Hollings was tall and lanky with a crackling wit that sometimes got him in trouble. When a political opponent challenged him to take a drug test, Hollings fired back, "I’ll take a drug test if you’ll take an IQ test." The New York Times once wrote, "Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important."
In many ways, however, their political lives took similar paths. Both were military veterans. Hollings won a Bronze Star as an artillery officer in World War II. Lugar was too young for the war, but time as an intelligence officer briefing the Navy’s top brass deepened his interest in defense and foreign policy.
Hollings was elected governor of South Carolina at age 36. Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis at 35. Both lost their first tries for the Senate, and ran for president with abysmal results. And both represented vanishing political breeds that are sorely missed in Congress today.
Hollings was a pragmatic Southern Democrat in a state that was rapidly turning Republican, and after he retired in 2004, he was replaced by hard-edged conservative Jim DeMint. Lugar, a dedicated internationalist, was defeated in a GOP primary in 2012 by a doctrinaire right-winger, Richard Mourdock.
But the most important trait they shared was a capacity to change, grow and apply their new knowledge to practical legislative solutions. In 1986, Lugar led 31 Republicans in joining 47 Democrats to override President Reagan’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on South Africa. The Republican’s most enduring success was working with Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to enact legislation that financed the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Washington Post editorialized, "the program ranks as among the most successful congressional foreign policy initiatives in a generation."
One of Lugar’s protÃ©gÃ©s was a young first-term Democrat from Illinois, Barack Obama, who said of his mentor: "In Dick, I saw someone who wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat first, but a problem-solver — an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground."
Hollings grew up in the segregated South, but as governor, he presided over the peaceful integration of Clemson University. "This General Assembly," he told state lawmakers, "must make clear South Carolina’s choice: a government of laws rather than a government of men."
As a senator in the late 1960s, he toured poor areas of his state and became a strong supporter of federal programs like food stamps. "There is hunger in South Carolina," he told a Senate committee. "I know as a public servant I am late to the problem, (but) we’ve got work to do in our own back yard ."
In the 1980s, he worked with Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire to enact the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which placed strict limits on congressional expenditures. It worked for a time, but eventually, clever congressional budget-busters found ways around the restrictions.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of Hollings’ career came in 2015, when he proposed that a federal courthouse named in his honor be renamed for Judge J. Waties Waring, an early and isolated voice for racial equality. "I just got the money for the building, he made history in it," Hollings explained.
The senator was being too modest. Fritz Hollings and Dick Lugar both made history. And today’s lawmakers can learn a lot from their lives of honor and courage. .

When a political opponent challenged him to take a drug test, Hollings fired back, "I’ll take a drug test if you’ll take an IQ test." The New York Times once wrote, "Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important."
In many ways, however, their political lives took similar paths. Both were military veterans. Hollings won a Bronze Star as an artillery officer in World War II. Lugar was too young for the war, but time as an intelligence officer briefing the Navy’s top brass deepened his interest in defense and foreign policy.
Hollings was elected governor of South Carolina at age 36. Lugar became mayor of Indianapolis at 35. Both lost their first tries for the Senate, and ran for president with abysmal results. And both represented vanishing political breeds that are sorely missed in Congress today.
Hollings was a pragmatic Southern Democrat in a state that was rapidly turning Republican, and after he retired in 2004, he was replaced by hard-edged conservative Jim DeMint. Lugar, a dedicated internationalist, was defeated in a GOP primary in 2012 by a doctrinaire right-winger, Richard Mourdock.
But the most important trait they shared was a capacity to change, grow and apply their new knowledge to practical legislative solutions. In 1986, Lugar led 31 Republicans in joining 47 Democrats to override President Reagan’s veto of a bill imposing economic sanctions on South Africa. The Republican’s most enduring success was working with Sen. Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat, to enact legislation that financed the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. The Washington Post editorialized, "the program ranks as among the most successful congressional foreign policy initiatives in a generation."
One of Lugar’s protÃ©gÃ©s was a young first-term Democrat from Illinois, Barack Obama, who said of his mentor: "In Dick, I saw someone who wasn’t a Republican or a Democrat first, but a problem-solver — an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground."
Hollings grew up in the segregated South, but as governor, he presided over the peaceful integration of Clemson University. "This General Assembly," he told state lawmakers, "must make clear South Carolina’s choice: a government of laws rather than a government of men."
As a senator in the late 1960s, he toured poor areas of his state and became a strong supporter of federal programs like food stamps. "There is hunger in South Carolina," he told a Senate committee. "I know as a public servant I am late to the problem, (but) we’ve got work to do in our own back yard ."
In the 1980s, he worked with Republicans Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire to enact the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill, which placed strict limits on congressional expenditures. It worked for a time, but eventually, clever congressional budget-busters found ways around the restrictions.
Perhaps the most memorable moment of Hollings’ career came in 2015, when he proposed that a federal courthouse named in his honor be renamed for Judge J. Waties Waring, an early and isolated voice for racial equality. "I just got the money for the building, he made history in it," Hollings explained.
The senator was being too modest. Fritz Hollings and Dick Lugar both made history. And today’s lawmakers can learn a lot from their lives of honor and courage. .

Texto completo: James Holzhauer snagged his 22nd "Jeopardy!" win on Friday's edition of the quiz show. But fans will have to wait two more weeks to see if his streak continues.
Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, won $82,381 on Friday's show, for a total of $1,691,008. He holds onto a solid second-place title for the most consecutive wins, although reigning champ Ken Jennings has won 74 times, for a $2. 5 million haul. (Champions were limited to five appearances until 2003. )
Monday, the annual "Jeopardy!" Teachers Tournament will sideline Holzhauer for two weeks. He'll return May 20 to compete for his 23rd victory, and more cash.

Holzhauer recently explained his strategy in a Q&A with The New York Times. Unlike most players, he picks the highest-value clues first.
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game, I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said, likening his approach to a poker strategy.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament. You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Eddie Timanus, a five-time "Jeopardy!" winner who compiles the college coaches polls for USA TODAY Sports, describes Holzhauer as "a game-changer. "
Timanus notes Holzhauer's mastery of the signaling buzzer, but says he really stands out in his aggressive bidding.
"While many players, myself included, prefer to play categories from top to bottom and try to stick to them, Holzhauer clears the big-dollar clues first," Timanus says. "Thanks to his ability to ring in first consistently and rarely miss, he usually has a considerable total built up by the time he uncovers a Daily Double. He finds most of them since he’s able to maintain control of the board for long stretches, and, as we've seen, he's not afraid to bet big. "
His overall assessment of Holzhauer the player: "Speed, instinct, confidence and knowledge — pretty SICK, wouldn’t you say?"

Harmful misconceptions about human trafficking survivors sparked by media

Texto completo: CHAPEL HILL - The media's portrayal of human trafficking has often perpetuated the wrong idea of how people are abused and what it means to be a survivor, say advocates and researchers close to the issue.
Anne Johnston and Barbara Friedman of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill started researching media coverage of sex trafficking in 2009. "We found that a lot of people had very strong opinions about how the media was covering sex trafficking, and they weren't very good," Johnston said. "They were criticizing reporters; they were calling the coverage sensationalistic."
Together, the professors created The Irina Project, named after a New York Times profile in the late 1990s that called a trafficking survivor "Irina." The national research project and advocacy group's aim is to correct the public's misconceptions of trafficking by equipping reporters with the tools they need.
The problem
N.C. is eighth in the nation in reported cases of human trafficking. Sex trafficking, a type of human trafficking, is when an adult or child is engaged in a commercial sex act due to force, fraud and/or coercion. This often shows its face in the media as prostitution, a crime that can put the man or woman being trafficked behind bars.
When one survivor of trafficking thought her past was behind her, it was the language of the media that was setting her back, Johnston said. She had started a new business and spoke with reporters about it, but the stories routinely referred to her as a "16year-old prostitute," not the successful survivor she is.
Being labeled that way, years after the fact, was a source of frustration, Johnston said. Language is one of the things The Irina Project has pointed to as a problem with how the media talks about trafficking.
Some media repeats urban legends that trafficking occurs when people are recruited or snatched at sporting events or superstores, Duncan said. "I am not familiar in any situations in which that has actually led to a trafficking situation," Duncan said, "but I've certainly seen the stories."
Trafficking occurs most often when young people seeking a romantic relationship are manipulated by their partner until they are being exploited for sex, Duncan said. The idea that trafficking is a choice, or that it's a glamorous industry with pimps, doesn't inform the public accurately about the character of the people who are trafficked, said Dawn Ferrer from advocacy and restoration nonprofit A Safe Place in Wilmington.
"On the glamorizing part of it, (the media) just need to stop," Ferrer said. "They need to stop making it seem like this is a viable option for a young woman that's struggling to pay her college tuition."
Major highways, a large military presence, gangs and rural areas with a need for cheap labor have kept North Carolina in the top 10 of the trafficking industry, according to the N.C. Department of Administration.
Elizabeth Hunter is the coordinator of Project FIGHT in Raleigh, a Salvation Army program that provides comprehensive case management for human trafficking survivors. The youngest client in this program is only 11 years old, and Project FIGHT has served more than 400 cases in the Carolinas since 2011.
"I feel like there is this population of people who are often invisible and that people don't see," Hunter said. "We walk past them every single day but they are walking very dark, secret lives that they can't reach out for help from."
Who suffers?
One of the most dangerous roles in a trafficking scheme is what's known as the "bottom bitch," Hunter said. The bottom bitch collects money, schedules appointments, even transports girls back and forth. Hunter said when law enforcement comes, she comes off as the trafficker.
"While she may be doing acts that appear to be a crime, she really is a victim," she said. It is her mugshot and name that is being associated with the language and images in media that could follow her all her life.
Trafficking survivors are not the only people who can be affected by media's portrayal of sex trafficking. People at risk for being exploited, like children in the welfare and foster care system or people with low self-esteem, might not recognize their vulnerability if the signs of trafficking aren't explicitly stated by the media.
"Potential victims of trafficking suffer enormously," Mitchell said. "People don't know what to look for, what the signs are. The information's not out there and all you hear is about the random busts that happen."
The public's interpretation of how and why trafficking can happen is also at risk. Young women have always been warned about the danger of being "snatched" from a public place in broad daylight, although the process is much more manipulative than that.
What can be done?
The Irina Project functions as a one-stop shop for advocacy, research and resources for reporters to produce content about trafficking that is accurate and comprehensive. The team at the project works with reporters to check if there is language or imagery that could be improved, and they help link survivors who want to tell their stories with different news outlets.
"The Irina Project is a website, it's a resource, it's training, but it's also advocacy," Johnston said.

Texto completo: And it may only last from day to day or hour to hour, but the memories can last a lifetime, J.P. Devine writes.
Sessions, Haley, Pruitt, Tillerson, Scaramucci, etc., etc. — once full-time “temps” in the West Wing, but now they’re history, unceremoniously pulled from 45’s desktop Rolodex of “temps.”
Sarah Sanders keeps a small travel bag packed at all times. Some say she keeps her car idling in the parking lot.
They’ll all survive. Even the president knows that he or she is just a temp.
Every college grad in the world knows what it’s like to be a temp. Temps are the backbones of every store, firm and political campaign. Lifetime jobs are part of the past.
For 35 years I’ve been “temping” at this paper, waiting for them to get wise and cash me out.
Everybody in the world of entertainment has been a temp at one time or another in their careers.
Before “Rocky,” Sylvester Stallone cleaned the lion cages at the Central Park Zoo.
Dustin Hoffman worked as a janitor in a dance studio, coat checker, dishwasher, and he and I both sold toys at Macy’s, probably not at the same time. I would have remembered.
Danny DeVito was a hairdresser at his his sister’s beauty parlor. Yes, he was.
Nobody dreams of becoming a temp, but there’s the rent, the phone bill, lunch and supper.
In L.A. your Verizon tech, car salesperson and Uber driver is either a screenwriter or actor, each one a temp, all part of the landscape of La La Land, like the swimming pools and palm trees.
She and I are a temp love story.
I met She when we were both struggling actors, temping as sales clerks at Bloomingdale’s in Manhattan.
True story: She was temping as a page at NBC Studios, and backstage each night she played poker with the Perry Como dancers and stage hands. They dropped her because she kept winning.
Her best temp job was as a singing and dancing
waitress at a private East Side Roaring Twenties-themed nightclub.
I would get off work from desk clerking at one or another Manhattan hotel and pick her up at the alley entrance to the club. Every 20 minutes she would appear at the door and hand me a mug of champagne, because Matty, the bartender, couldn’t keep it after it was opened.
If you were down from Maine, sightseeing in Manhattan in the summer of 1957, you might have seen me performing at the famous old Roxy Theatre on West 50th between 6th Avenue and 7th Avenue.
I was the usher in the cape and hat out on the street, shouting,”Immediate seating in the balcony.” The great Roxy was demolished in 1960 just as we drove away to Hollywood.
Some winter days I stood at the cologne counter in Bloomingdale’s department store in a nice tux, smiling and spritzing the latest perfume on passing women, while She was up on the third floor temping in “Better Dresses.”
Comedian Dom DeLuise and I sold intermission drinks in the lobbies of Broadway shows and, on Saturday nights, loaded the Sunday New York Times on the trucks.
In my temp life I have cleaned apartments, sold popcorn at an X-rated movie theater and assembled furniture in new high-rise apartment buildings. All lucrative “temp” jobs.
As you can tell, the life of a professional “temp” can be exhausting. Some temped for years until their luck changed.
Actor Jack Brady, who temped as a waiter at the famous 21 Club in New York, made more money in one night than he had in six months as an actor, as much as a thousand bucks.
The last I heard, he married a famous movie star’s widow he met at the club, and they have a home in Palm Springs. I love it.
Our lives as temps ended when television work began to grow, and She wisely became a teacher.
But we have our memories. On our last visit to Manhattan, a woman stopped us on Park Avenue, put her hand on my arm, squinted at me, and said, “I know you. I remember you. …”
Hoping she had seen me on “The Tonight Show” or “The Bob Newhart Show,” I smiled.
Then she said, “You were the young man in the front of the Roxy Theatre on Saturday nights, telling people in line that there were seats in the balcony. Right? Am I right?”
Once a temp, always a temp.

Texto completo: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- The suicide bombs were packed with ball bearings, iron nails and the explosive TATP, all hallmarks of the way the Islamic State likes to commit mass murder.
One of the bombers had traveled to Syria. Another trained in Turkey. One man arrested hours after the attacks had commuted between Sri Lanka and Syria, leading investigators to identify him as a possible middleman between the Islamic State and Sri Lankan militants.
As Sri Lankan investigators reveal key details from the suicide blasts that killed more than 250 people in churches and hotels across the island on Easter Sunday, more evidence points to a role by the Islamic State in inspiring -- and perhaps directing -- the slaughter.
Even as the Islamic State has been routed from territories in Iraq and Syria where its black flag once flew with impunity, the Sri Lanka attacks show the group is still capable of orchestrating carnage through loyalists in far-flung countries.
Few outside counterterrorism experts believed Sri Lanka was in imminent danger. But many Sri Lankans knew that the Islamic State was eyeing them. And some are furious that multiple warnings went unheeded. They feel their government essentially allowed more than 250 lives to slip between the cracks.
In November 2016, the justice minister told Parliament that more than two dozen Sri Lankans had recently joined the Islamic State, which he said was becoming a "grave problem."
A few months later, a group of moderate Muslims presented police officials with 11 dossiers on local Islamist extremists, including Zaharan Hashim, whom they identified as the "leader of ISIS team in Sri Lanka."
Officials have identified Mr. Zaharan as one of the suicide bombers and possibly the ringleader. For years, moderate Muslims had expressed concern that Mr. Zaharan was tearing at Sri Lanka's delicate fabric that spans its Muslim, Buddhist and Christian communities. They unsuccessfully urged the police to arrest him.
Sri Lankan officials have blamed one another for dismissing detailed warnings about these threats. The fact that no one acted on the information about a growing Islamic State presence, just as no one acted in the weeks before the attacks on specific intelligence about possible suicide bombings, has compounded the grief and anger.
"I'm frustrated, but more than that, I am pained," said Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the former justice minister, who had spoken in Parliament more than two years ago about the Islamic State's foothold. "I was carefully watching their movements. I knew the Islamic State was preparing for an attack here. Nobody listened."
Sri Lankan officials say they are "95 percent finished" with the investigation and feel confident that they have arrested nearlyall the accomplices -- 140 people have been identified as suspects -- and have recovered their explosives, found during several raids.
Many new details of the attacks, including some that suggest a more active role by the Islamic State than just inspiration from afar, were told to The New York Times by a senior official involved in the investigation who has also been briefed about foreign intelligence on the Islamic State. The senior official, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.
All the bombers were identified by officials as Sri Lankan. And investigators said that Achchi Mohamed Mohamadu Hassthun, seen on video footage coolly walking into St. Sebastian's Church on Easter Sunday wearing a large backpack, was the bomb maker.
Investigators said that they had found bomb-making manuals on his computer and that he may have trained in Turkey. According to the senior Sri Lankan official, Mr. Hassthun built 11 TATP bombs in a garage in a suburb south of the capital, Colombo, using ordinary household materials, including huge bottles of glue. Triacetone triperoxide, commonly known as TATP, is the explosive of choice for ISIS bombers, including those behind the deadly attacks in Paris in November 2015.
Another bomber, Abdul Latheef Jamil, had traveled to Syria. But investigators suspect he might have been radicalized earlier in Australia, where he studied aeronautical engineering.
The authorities believe that Inshaf and Ilham Ibrahim, sons of one of Sri Lanka's wealthiest spice traders, possibly financed the whole plot. In a final voice mail to his wife, the authorities said, Inshaf listed the money owed to him from various people, provided advice on which of the couple's cars to sell, and told her, "I am going to God."
Sri Lankans remain puzzled why some of their most privileged young men would do this. But the Islamic State ideology's allure to some of Sri Lanka's most well-to-do families has been known for years.
"These are not individuals from normal Muslim families," Mr. Rajapakshe told Parliament in his 2016 speech.
Mr. Rajapakshe said he had based his claims on detailed information provided by moderate Muslims and government intelligence officers. He and others said it made sense because affluent Sri Lankans had more time and resources to surf the internet and find extremist material than those who had to devote all their energies to making ends meet.
Still, Mr. Rajapakshe said, after he gave his speech, he was ridiculed as an anti-Muslim bigot.
Sri Lankan officials said the first Sri Lankans joined the Islamic State in 2013 or 2014, around the time the group declared its caliphate straddling Syria and Iraq.
Back then, Daya Ratnayake was Sri Lanka's army chief, and he said the military and intelligence establishment was paying close attention.
"We knew what was coming," he said.
He said that the military established special groups to follow radical university students and online postings. He said the government deported more than 100 radical Islamist preachers, many from Pakistan. And he was aware that Mr. Zaharan's group on Sri Lanka's eastern coast was alienating moderates and conservatives alike.
"Our message to the moderates was to keep these radicals with you, don't kick them out, don't isolate them," he said.
But that's exactly what happened. After Mr. Zaharan's followers attacked worshipers of the Sufi sect, he evaded arrest and disappeared.
In 2015, the Sri Lankan government confirmed its first case of a homegrown Islamic State fighter. Mohamed Muhsin Sharhaz Nilam, a well-respected school principal and karate instructor from central Sri Lanka, was killed in a coalition airstrike in Syria.
Around this time, Sri Lanka's politics were in upheaval. Voters threw out President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the strongman who brought Sri Lanka's decades-long civil war to a brutal end in 2009, and elected Maithripala Sirisena, a career politician from humble roots who presented himself as a democratic reformer.
Independent analysts say that Mr. Sirisena was too quick to move Sri Lanka off its military footing and that he sidelined many good intelligence officers.
Experts who track the Islamic State's media operations said they had seen few if any specific mentions of Sri Lanka before the Easter attacks. The Islamic State had said plenty about slaughtering Christians, but its focus was the Middle East, Europe and, more recently, West Africa.
The Islamic State's claim of responsibility for the Sri Lanka attacks, and its release of a video showing Mr. Zaharan pledging allegiance to the group's leader, seemed to prove that they at least had maintained contact.
Further, to make the devastating bombs used in Sri Lanka, most experts believe that experienced Islamic State operatives must have helped.
"You need expertise to make the bomb, expertise for the detonators, expertise for the selection of the sites and how to indoctrinate people to kill themselves," said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, Indonesia.
"All that," she said, "takes face-to-face training."
Sri Lankan investigators say they are still trying to determine how that might have happened.
Officials believe that a Sri Lankan man named Sadiq, who has been arrested, traveled to Syria several times and served as Mr. Zaharan's right-hand man. They also suspect that the Islamic State encouraged or directed the local group to attack churches. Before the Easter attacks, there had been little Muslim-Christian strife in Sri Lanka. Adherents of both religions are small minorities compared with the country's Buddhist majority.
Investigators say that all the bombs in packs worn by the attackers were triggered by pulling a strap. Another bomb had been placed outside one of the churches, timed to explode around 90 minutes after the first explosions, for the purpose of killing the emergency teams and officials who rushed to the scene.
It failed to detonate.

James Comey: No 'accident' Trump tweeted about tapes

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey is still curious about whether President Trump taped their private conversations in the Oval Office.
During a lengthy interview with a Los Angeles radio station, Comey was asked what he would say to Trump if they ever had another private conversation.
"I would ask, 'Did you tape me? Are there tapes?' Because that tweet, that I better hope there aren't tapes, which he tweeted at me shortly after I was fired, didn't strike me as an accident," Comey said on KNX 1070 AM on Friday. "So I'm interested to know whether that is real."
Comey was fired from the FBI nearly two years ago, on May 9, 2017. Three days later, the president tweeted: "James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"
Comey documented his meetings with the president in memos that were leaked to the press, including one alleging that Trump asked him to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
In congressional testimony in June of 2016, Comey said he leaked the memos to prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Robert Mueller was appointed to lead the federal Russia investigation after the New York Times reported the existence of the memo about the Flynn request.
During that same hearing Comey reacted to Trump's tweet, saying, "Lordy, I hope there are tapes."

Through these doors, a path to citizenship

Texto completo: LOWELL -- Five years ago, Jose Christian Rojas Baca left his home near Lima, Peru, to come to the United States.

"My aunt had applied for her family to come to the U.S. over 15 years ago," he said through a translator. "I never thought the opportunity would come."

He attended classes at Middlesex Community College, he works at a grocery store and, soon, the Lowell resident hopes to become a naturalized citizen.

To navigate the process, Rojas Baca attended a help session at the Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association, run by legal experts at Project Citizenship in early April.

Just months ago, this wasn't an option. The walk-in sessions with attorneys and accredited representatives started this year and run every other Friday morning at the CMAA, 465 School St. It's part of the organization's response to an increased interest in citizenship as other means of residing in the United States seem less certain.

"In some communities you have to go out and convince people or advertise why this is a good thing," said Melanie Torres, director of programs and operations at Project Citizenship. "I think here people are coming and they want the services so we're just responding to that need and making sure they know where to find the services."

Though the service is open to anyone, Sovanna Pouv, executive director for CMAA, said the number of citizenship applications among people in the Cambodian community has increased "tremendously" since 2016. The introduction of this drop-in service has increased the number of people coming to the CMAA for assistance in applying for citizenship from 40 to 50 a year to about 20 to 30 a month.

"There have been efforts to stop people from traveling out of the country, really making it difficult for folks to come back after visiting a country, so that fear has really been lingering around our community," he said.

This is compounded by an increased interest in civic engagement like voting, as well as reports that the United States is looking to deport more Cambodians nationwide than in past years, Pouv and Torres said.

"The Cambodian community has been targeted recently with deportations for crimes that happened when they were 15 years old, which at this point was 30, 40 years ago," Torres said. She said many of the clients she sees have not lived in Cambodia since they were 1 or 2 years old and have no memory of the country.

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reports described by the The New York Times, 74 Cambodians were deported in 2016 and 29 in 2017. The head of the Khmer Vulnerability Aid Organization said American officials notified him in December 2017 "to prepare to receive 200 new arrivals each year for the next several years," according to The New York Times.

Pouv said he has heard similar estimates, including the goal of deporting 200 Cambodians nationwide before the end of this summer or early fall.

The partnership between the CMAA and Project Citizenship is funded by a $35,000 grant from the Theodore Edson Parker Foundation, a San Francisco-based organization that funds systemic change in life sciences, global public health and civic engagement.

Torres said the Boston-based Project Citizenship screens candidates applying for citizenship and has a 95 percent success rate. Becoming a citizen typically takes between seven and eight months, but in some cases can take up to a year, she said.

Though the free drop-in service is held at the CMAA, Torres said they serve people of all backgrounds and offer translation assistance in several languages.

Project Citizenship has partnered with the CMAA in varying capacities since 2015, including holding an annual workshop for people interested in becoming citizens. The next workshop is June 15 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Lowell Senior Center.

According to a press release from both organizations, a quarter-million immigrants in Massachusetts are eligible for citizenship, but only 10 percent apply "because of fear, cost and confusion."

Pouv said the CMAA offers services for all steps of the process, from language classes required to become a citizen to application assistance to voter registration to polling-booth help come election season.

In a statement, Veronica Serrato, executive director of Project Citizenship, said 86 percent of new citizens register to vote and 73 percent cast ballots in elections, much higher than the general public.

"New citizens earn higher wages and help build their communities by being able to buy homes, obtain loans and otherwise invest in the U.S. economy," she said. "And when parents become citizens, they pass on citizenship to their minor children who become eligible for educational opportunities available to all Americans, including scholarships and loans."

Texto completo: Slovakia Zuzana Caputova was elected Slovakia’s first woman president on March 30. She campaigned on a platform of anti-corruption and environmental protection. Since the country gained independence in 1993, it has struggled with corruption. Ms. Caputova also says she’ll push back against the rise of nationalist rhetoric that continues to gain ground across Europe. As an environmental activist, Ms. Caputova became popular after she won a battle to shut down a toxic waste site in her hometown. (NPR)
Kenya Conservationists are working to protect sea turtles. Although hunting sea turtles is illegal, people continue to poach them for their valuable meat and oil. Eating turtles has long been a part of Kenyan culture, but many species are now endangered. Founded in 1997, Local Ocean Conservation is Kenya’s only turtle rescue center and has made more than 17,000 rescues. The group’s community-liaison officers work with local fishermen to ensure safe fishing practices. The organization also supports alternative agricultural businesses to reduce the area’s dependence on fishing. The amount of plastic that turtles consume continues to be a serious issue, conservationists say. (Al Jazeera)
Egypt A province alongside the Red Sea has banned single-use plastics.  Items such as straws, water bottles, and disposable bags will no longer be allowed as of June 1. An environmental affairs agency found that Egyptians discard 12 billion plastic bags a year, causing severe damage to the country’s waterways and marine life. The province’s governor, Ahmed Abdallah, says the ban is “a fight against the sea of plastic.” The environmental agency is leading the charge by launching campaigns to clean up the province’s beaches, islands, and diving areas. (The Associated Press)
United States In Indiana, a school system is reducing food waste and fighting food insecurity among low- income children. The nonprofit Cultivate has partnered with schools in Elkhart to provide meals for students who may not be getting enough to eat on weekends when they’re away from school. Every Friday, the program gives students backpacks that contain eight frozen meals. To supply the meals, Cultivate gathers unused food from within the school system and from catering companies. (CBS)
Costa Rica The small nation has bounced back from deforestation by doubling its forest cover in the past 30 years, and now it aims to make itself free of fossil fuels by 2050. The country already has much of its electricity coming from renewable sources. But getting rid of fossil fuels will require a costly overhaul of infrastructure in order to tackle the country’s largest source of pollution: transportation. Another issue: The number of citizens who own cars continues to grow. The first lady, Claudia Dobles, sees the new initiative as having potential to help Costa Rica gain recognition for its handling of climate change. (The New York Times)

Texto completo: CAMDEN — Key South Jersey Democrats blasted Gov. Phil Murphy Thursday in a deepening dispute over a state program that's provided some $1.6billion in tax breaks to city businesses.
The local Democrats, including Camden County's top freeholder and Camden's mayor, said they were "deeply appalled" by the Murphy administration's "relentless, unfounded and disingenuous attacks" on many of the city's largest employers.
The broadside, which described Murphy as a hypocrite and compared him to President Donald Trump, came one day after the governor said he was "deeply troubled" by two media reports on state tax breaks for Camden businesses.
The governor asserted the stories showed the need for "a total revamp of the tax incentive program."
But a subject of both stories, Democratic powerbroker George Norcross III, suggested the publicity was a positive.
Norcross said a joint story by WNYC and ProPublica — headlined "How Companies and Allies of One Powerful Democrat Got $1.1Billion in Tax Breaks" — showed "all of the hard work that went into getting the city on its current path forward."
"I join with other Camden leaders to thank WNYC Radio for its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future," Norcross, the chairman of Cooper University Health Care, said in a statement.
In Murphy's view, that story and a separate New York Times article reinforced his desire to see results from a task force reviewing the Economic Development Authority's incentive programs.
The task force, assailed by the South Jersey Democrats as "blatantly political leaning," held a public hearing Thursday.
It was formed in January after the state Comptroller's Office released an audit critical of the EDA's programs, which were revised in 2013 to steer more money to Camden.
"Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for," the governor said in a statement Wednesday.
"If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable," he said.
Advocates say the generous tax breaks to Camden firms — worth about $1.6billion in all — have attracted economic development that would otherwise have bypassed the city.
"I will stand on top of that dirt pile over there and yell it from the top of my lungs," Mayor Frank Moran said Monday at a ground-breaking in East Camden.
The ceremony was held by ResinTech Inc., a Berlin Township firm that makes water treatment products. It's relocating to a 27-acre tract between River Road and Federal Street with support from nearly $140million in EDA incentives.
In Thursday's statement, the local Democrats said Murphy's "invective has been particularly targeted at Camden companies" and not at North Jersey firms that also received tax breaks.
"Perhaps in the age of Donald Trump, the governor has learned all the wrong lessons of leadership and adherence to the truth," said the statement from Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr., Mayor Frank Moran, Assemblywoman Nilsa Cruz Perez and Camden Council President Curtis Jenkins.
It said Murphy "was fully prepared to give away $5billion to the planet's richest company, Amazon, but has feverishly insinuated without proof that irregularities exist for tax programs that would help Camden."
It claimed Murphy's actions have caused "a chilling effect" on Camden's business community in Camden and have raised "legitimate questions" regarding the governor's intent to honor agreements between companies and the EDA.
"It has occurred to us that the governor may be holding Camden, and the business community, hostage to get his massive tax increases through the legislature," the statement added.
The WNYC/ProPublica story detailed how almost two-thirds of Camden's incentives went to companies with ties to Norcross and to his allies in business and politics.
It noted his brother, Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, had co-sponsored a law revising the EDA's Grow New Jersey program in 2013, when the congressman was a state senator. And it said a law firm run by a third brother, Philip Norcross, collected lucrative fees from firms that received tax credits.
The New York Times story also mentioned the Norcross brothers, but focused primarily on Kevin Sheehan, a real estate attorney who represented several firms that received tax breaks.
According to the Times account, Sheehan added language to the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013 to aid Camden firms.
It contends Sheehan's efforts yielded tax breaks worth $260milllion for Holtec International, which built a technology campus in the port district, and $118million for the Subaru of America's headquarters in the Gateway area.
The Times noted Holtec's tax break, the largest for any Camden firm, is estimated to have a net benefit to the state of just $155,520 over 35 years.
When Holtec was awarded the tax breaks in July 2014, a Courier-Post story noted a critic's assessment that the project would support 160 jobs already in New Jersey and 235 new position at a "sky-high" cost to taxpayers of $658,228 per job.
Sheehan could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
His firm, Parker McCay of Mount Laurel, released a statement to the Times saying it "was asked by policymakers, including those in the Legislature, to review this legislation and offer input and suggestions on ways it could be strengthened."
Philip Norcross is Parker McCay's CEO.
In commenting on the WNYC/ProPublica article, George Norcross noted "much of the story has previously been reported by other outlets."
He offered an upbeat assessment of several points made in the story.
The WNYC/ProPublica story, for instance, noted Camden "reaped more than four times as many tax breaks as the combined amounts of other cities designated as 'growth zones.'"
In Norcross' view, that showed "an unprecedented partnership between residents, government, business and community leaders."
And while the story described Camden's crime rate as "the second highest in New Jersey," Norcross noted it was down almost 59% since 2012.
Norcross also described efforts to craft the 2013 law to help Camden as "legislative back and forth."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for," he said.

Texto completo: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the referees.”
Admittedly, that is not quite how the famous line from Shakespeare’s “Henry VI” goes. As you may recall, it was actually the lawyers whose demise was proposed.
But though no one is known to have uttered the words above, they still neatly encompass the strategy conservatives have long used against the so-called “liberal media.” Namely, undermine them – and thus, their ability to act as arbiters of truth – with relentless attacks on their credibility.
No less an authority than conservative pundit Charlie Sykes admitted as much in a 2016 interview with journalist Oliver Darcy. “We’ve basically eliminated any of the referees, the gatekeepers,” he said of himself and his conservative colleagues.
Sykes spoke during the 2016 campaign when people were still stunned at the barrage of untruths spewing from the Republican candidate.
“We’ve created this monster,” said Sykes, adding that, “At a certain point, you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible [news] outlet out there. And I am feeling, to a certain extent, that we are reaping the whirlwind at that.”
In related news, Donald Trump told the 10,000th lie of his presidency Friday. This, according to The Washington Post, which maintains a database of all the times Trump has exaggerated, distorted or misled.
Ten thousand.
Feels like there ought to be a statue, or something. And what does Trump lie about? Pretty much everything.
He lies about the border wall, claiming it is now being built. It isn’t.
He lies about his tax cut, claiming it was the biggest in history. It wasn’t.
He lies about the Mueller report, claiming it exonerates him. It doesn’t.
Indeed, the very same weekend he notched his dubious milestone, Trump told a particularly gruesome whopper about supposed legislation empowering a new mother and her doctor to “determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
And how did The New York Times respond to this flaming canard? It called it “inaccurate,” which raised something of a stink on Twitter. That’s not surprising. Calling that hogwash “inaccurate” is like saying the Titanic was “delayed.”
The Times is not alone; most news organizations have resisted calling Trump’s lies lies. Their reasoning, it must be conceded, is thoughtful. After all, to call something a lie is to impose judgment. Sometimes, when people are incorrect it’s not a lie, only a mistake.
But 10,000 times in a little over two years? How gullible must you be to believe someone could be that wrong that often by accident? If any other man told you half that many untruths, you’d call him a liar. You wouldn’t hesitate. Yet here, we do.
It sets an extraordinary precedent, yes, for a news organization to brand a president a liar. But these are extraordinary times, and a liar, brazen and inveterate, is precisely what Trump is. In their refusal to call him that, in their insistence upon giving him the benefit of nonexistent doubt, news media compromise their prime directive, which is to present a picture of the world as it is.
That’s something we can ill afford with the very idea of truth under attack and the need for news media to do their jobs arguably more critical than ever.
This is a time for forthrightness, yet too often journalists are anything but, from coverage of race, to climate change to this, as the newspaper of record dubs a grotesque lie merely “inaccurate.”
It makes you wonder if all the effort conservatives put into neutering the referees was not a waste of time.
Seems the referees have done a fair job of neutering themselves.

Texto completo: The Glen Ellyn Children’s Resource Center will welcome award-winning, Chicago-based author Rebecca Makkai to its annual Literary Event fundraiser later this month.
Proceeds from the May 21 gathering at Reserve 22 in Glen Ellyn will support the group’s efforts to empower more than 200 low-income children living in the area to realize their potential through an intensive, five-day-a-week after-school tutoring and mentoring program.
The fundraiser is held in cooperation with The Bookstore of Glen Ellyn, along with sponsors Glen Ellyn Bank & Trust and Kiwanis of Glen Ellyn.
Makkai will share her latest work, "The Great Believers," and the literary journey that got her there. The story weaves 1980s Chicago with contemporary Paris in a novel about loss, friendship, tragedy and redemption.
"The Great Believers" has won numerous awards and accolades, including: * American Library Association’s Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, 2019; * Pulitzer Prize finalist, 2019; * New York Times’ Top Ten Book Award, 2018; * Chicago Review of Books Award, 2018; * and National Book Award Finalist, 2018.
"We are thrilled to offer our community an evening with an author of Rebecca Makkai’s caliber and an event that celebrates literacy, an integral part of our mission," says Judy Cheney, GECRC board member and Literary Event chairwoman.
"GECRC strives to provide our students the opportunity to grow their literacy skills and develop a love of reading. This event raises important funds, moving us closer to that goal."
Glen Ellyn Elementary District 41’s Measure of Academic Progress assessments indicate 93 percent of GECRC students showed growth in reading during the 2017-2018 school year.
Tickets are $60 in advance or $65 at the door and include light appetizers and one drink. A cash bar and raffle items also will be available.
The fundraiser runs from 6:30 to 9 p.m. Tuesday, May 21, at Reserve 22, 485 Winchell Way. Tickets can be purchased directly at is.gd/GECRCtix, www.gecrc.com, or at The Bookstore, 475 N. Main St., Glen Ellyn.

Investigation targets NJ tax breaks

Texto completo: The team of lawyers named by Gov. Phil Murphy to investigate New Jersey's controversial tax breaks will follow up its bombshell inaugural meeting, where a whistleblower said her former company lied to win incentives, with more interviews today.
The task force said it plans to interview "several" witnesses in its mission to determine if tax breaks were properly awarded and whether the agency that administers them, the Economic Development Authority, "applied appropriate scrutiny" to incentive applications.
Those key questions have come to the forefront of debate in Trenton since the task force met for the first time in March. A pair of reports Wednesday raised more questions about the integrity of the incentive programs used heavily under Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and passed by Democrats in the Legislature.
The New York Times found that a lawyer with deep connections to Democratic politicians had a hand in writing the tax incentive legislation, the Economic Opportunity Act. That lawyer, Kevin Sheehan, helped edit portions of the bill that opened "sizable" tax breaks to clients of his law firm, Parker McCay.
Earlier Wednesday, a joint WNYC and ProPublica investigation found that two-thirds of the tax break awards in Camden, or more than $1 billion, went to companies connected to George Norcross, the powerful unelected Democrat who is allies with Senate President Stephen Sweeney, and business partners and clients of his brother's law firm.
One of Norcross' two brothers, Phil Norcross, is chief executive officer of Parker McCay. Phil Norcross told the Wall Street Journal in an earlier interview that he helped write amendments to the tax break bill. Another brother, Donald Norcross, was a union leader who served in the state Legislature and co-sponsored the bill. He is now a U.S. Representative.
Murphy said he was "deeply troubled" by the findings of the two reports.
"Coupled with what we already know about how the tax incentive program operated over the past six years, I believe now more than ever in the importance of the task force I commissioned," Murphy said in a statement. "Until we've taken a good hard look at the entire process, I don't believe we can be sure that all taxpayer money has been properly spent and accounted for. If there was fraud in this program, I expect the task force will uncover it and those individuals will be held accountable."
Norcross issued a lengthy statement Wednesday responding to the WNYC report and even thanked the news outlet for "its lengthy story detailing the massive undertaking to help rebuild Camden's future."
"The fact that private investment is returning to Camden is no accident — it was planned and fought for. As WNYC and other media outlets have reported, the commitment to rebuilding Camden's future began years ago and focused on the city's three biggest challenges: improving public safety, reforming education and bringing jobs and economic investment to the city," Norcross said.
While the Murphy task force and a legislative committee looking into the incentive programs continue their work, Murphy has tried to assert his influence in the debate. He sought the resignation of certain authority board members, but most of them defied him and remain in positions to grant future awards. And Murphy's Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, accused the Democrat of engaging in "political assassination" to gain support for his own incentives.
It does not appear that Murphy plans to apply pressure on the holdout board members, who were named to their seats by Christie.
"They're the government appointees. We approached them, we laid out our case, they made their decision. We have to respect that decision. We don't agree with them," Murphy said last week.
Days later he named Kevin Quinn, a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, where Murphy worked for two decades, the authority's next board chairman. He replaces Laurence Downes, the only person who stepped down at Murphy's request.
The members of the task force are expected to hear from current and former executives of the authority when they meet Thursday in Newark. The witnesses have been subpoenaed by the task force, according to an announcement of the meeting.
Since it is armed with subpoena authority and includes white-collar crime lawyers, the task force poses perhaps the greatest threat to those who may have abused the tax incentives. At its first meeting, a woman testified that her former company lied to win tax breaks.
The panel has also said it has "obtained robust cooperation" from companies who received tax breaks, including one that admitted it was out of compliance and agreed to repay its grant, saving taxpayers $1.5 million. It has also made a criminal referral and said it has uncovered evidence of unregistered lobbying on behalf of special interests.
"As we have said, we are going to follow the facts in a search for the truth," said Ronald Chen, chairman of the task force. "Whether that means recertifying companies, seeking voluntary payments and terminations, or making referrals, we plan to be thorough, objective and efficient."
In the meantime, a group of activists signaled legal trouble for the authority by having its lawyer send a letter requesting that it preserve all documents related to tax incentives from 2010 on. Such letters typically precede a lawsuit.
Sue Altman, a board member of South Jersey Women for Progressive Change, which is one of many groups represented by the law firm Weissman & Mintz, said Tuesday that the potential lawsuit is partly an attempt to obtain documents from the authority and to convince authority board members to leave.
"It would be amazing if the board would resign. Keeping up the pressure on them is a tactic we're trying to use to make it loud and clear," Altman said.

The nature of nurturing

Texto completo: Mothers' Day can be bittersweet. ∙ For those who have lost their mothers, this day can be weighted with emotional memories, both good and bad. ∙ Those who still have their moms and who are blessed with being a mom, know there's nothing like a mother's love. ∙ As we celebrate this upcoming Mother's Day, I want to discuss the positive impact a mother's nurturing has on the outcome of a child. ∙ It's a given, mothers want what's best for their children; though occasionally, what is perceived as "best" in the mother's eyes can also have a reverse impact on the child's emotional and behavioral disposition.
As an example, mothers (and parents in general) focus on the importance of their child's academic performance; though education is extremely important and does set the stage for future opportunities, there's also additional attributes to consider.
A child who is taught to manage their emotions is two times more likely to become successful in life.
In addition, children with good self-control and reduced compulsivity are less likely to have behavioral problems, drink alcohol take drugs or end up in jail.
Furthermore, a mother's tone while speaking to her child also affects the brain's structural development.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Joan Luby from the Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, compared the interaction and development of two separate groups of 3- and 4-year-old children.
The first group hosted extremely nurturing and interactive mothers, while the second group had mothers with less or non-nurturing attributes.
After four years of research, the children who had considerable amounts of nurturing and guidance developed a 10% larger hippocampus on MRI brain scan studies.
The hippocampus, located in the center of the brain, directs bodily functions, controls learning and memory, while also supporting the body's response to emotional stress.
A subsequent study conducted by Dr. Akemi Tomado, a child mental health researcher in Japan, found less developed gray matter in the brains of children who had been verbally abused.
Gray matter, a major component in the brain, controls emotions, attention span and decision-making.
Children whose parents frequently yell and repeatedly state the children were "bad" exhibited lower self-esteem.
Typically, parents who use strong but directly negative language toward children believe they are making their child more responsible and compliant; research shows that parental sarcasm and threats inadvertently make children feel guilty, unloved and inferior.
This poor self-perception can lead to depression and/or anxiety in children.
So, what's the best approach in nurturing your child? Disciplining your child, teaching your child?
What's the best way to communicate while trying to teach them right from wrong?
Always stay calm and model good behavior.
Recognize your own emotions. Never try to discipline a child when you are angry.
Seek professional help when needed to better handle parent/child issues.
Don't suppress your child's feelings.
Allow the child to express his or her emotions such as crying or sobbing, but teach the child to define their behavior with a word.
For example, you state: "You are frustrated your brother took your toy but hitting your brother is never okay."
Feelings are what they are. Children should own their feelings, but outbursts caused by feelings is not good and will get them into trouble.
Have empathy for your child.
Let your child know you are listening to them. As an example, say, "I understand you are angry, you want to yell and scream, please know I'm here if you need me."
You are not agreeing with the behavior but stating you do understand it.
It's important to note, screaming at a yelling child only makes the yelling louder as he or she only wants to be heard.
Remember, if you both are yelling, no one is listening.
Problem solve.
Once their anger dissipates, children need guidance to help problem solve.
A mother could say, "Next time, when you become angry, how could you behave differently?"
When the child responds with a different solution, answer: "If you do that instead, what do you think would happen next time?"
This will build the child's self-esteem and improve inappropriate responses over time. Always watch for good behavior and praise that behavior.
Listen.
Make sure when communicating with children they have your undivided attention.
No phones allowed
If you don't give them undivided attention, your child will seek help elsewhere or worse, stop talking to you altogether, while internalizing stress.
Avoid pacifying bad behavior.
The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents against using technology to pacify an unruly child as this method does not allow the child to learn to regulate his or her emotions.
Seek help from a pediatric healthcare professional when needed.
Some children need an evaluation to rule out autism, developmental delay, anxiety, ADD or ADHD. Sometimes a formal behavior modification program can be instituted to encourage good behavior and build self-esteem.
Our job as mothers is to nurture our children to help them find their unique gifts, as they all possess them.
As New York Times best-selling author, Dr. Wendy Mogel, states, "Try to see your child as a seed that came in a packet without a label. Your job is to provide the right environment and nutrients, while also pulling out the weeds. You can't decide what kind of flower you'll get, or in which season it will bloom."
Have a Happy Mother's Day!

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
On April 2, 1951, the Times photographer Sam Falk went out to capture New Yorkers and visitors taking photographs in places like Rockefeller Center, Central Park and St. Patrick's Cathedral for The New York Times Magazine -- places where many people congregate to do the very same thing today.
This week, some of those scenes were brought back to life by Tony Cenicola, a Times staff photographer, in the latest installment of Past Tense, an archival storytelling project from The Times.
A Past Tense photo editor, Anika Burgess, found the original shoot in The Times's assignment database, which contains historical as well as contemporary assignments for photographers. "This one intrigued me because it was Sam Falk, and his work was really wonderful," she said. Ms. Burgess requested the negatives, discovered a charming shoot and thought it would be interesting, she said, "to see what photographers do on those sites now."
Mr. Cenicola was sent out to capture what had changed -- and what remained the same. While Mr. Falk used black-and-white film, Mr. Cenicola's photos were taken digitally and in color.
Ms. Burgess and Mr. Cenicola mined the original photos for clues about the precise locations where they could have been taken, then Ms. Burgess put together a scouting document using Google Earth. Over the course of three days in April, Mr. Cenicola biked around the city with his camera equipment in tow.
Some of the shots were easy to recreate, like those around the promenade in Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's. There were lots of people around with cameras, and the locations were easy to find. Other photos were more challenging. One, taken on a rock in Central Park, had no distinguishing features. "I was looking for a rock by the lake, and so I had to go around the entire lake, and then look for people with cameras," Mr. Cenicola said. "In the end, I think I found it. The light and the kind of shadow it was casting gave me some sense of what side of the park he was on," he added.
It was an exercise in patience as well as in sleuthing. Mr. Falk did his shoot spontaneously in a day; when Mr. Cenicola found the same spots, he had to wait for people to wander into his frame before he could take their photographs.
"I put my camera on a tripod and framed the shot the way he had framed it, and I was going to shoot remotely," Mr. Cenicola said, "so I wasn't standing next to the camera and trying to be sly about it, but everyone would walk around the camera."
While Mr. Falk's work has been featured in Past Tense projects before, this is the first time a shoot from the past has been updated. "I really see this as an opportunity to tell interesting or surprising stories based on the long photographic history that The Times has," Ms. Burgess said.
The side-by-side images reflect what amateur photography looks like then and now. The clothes are different, as are the cameras; and in some, the lens has turned inward: a reflection of the selfie phenomenon.
But there are similarities, as well, sometimes as simple as a gesture. "I started to see that since people have been taking snapshots, they've been bending awkwardly at the knee to try to capture the spire of the cathedral, or whatever it is," Ms. Burgess said.
New Yorkers today are often frustrated when people block the sidewalk to take photos. And yet, we were doing the same thing some 70 years ago, just with different devices. The people have changed, and maybe the storefronts are different, but much remains the same.
For Mr. Cenicola, it was fun to think of walking in the footsteps of a photographer from the 1950s, whom he didn't know. "When I was at St. Patrick's Cathedral waiting, I tried to channel him, saying, 'O.K., bring somebody by!,"' Mr. Cenicola said. "I don't think he heard me, but it did help pass the time."

Libel laws protect the right to speak freely

Texto completo: Advocates of free speech, free press and holding government publicly accountable - liberals and conservatives alike - need to keep cautious eyes on new, perhaps coordinated, efforts to chill critics and water down legal protections regarding public comments about officials and famous individuals. In the space of a few weeks:
* Justice Clarence Thomas called for the U.S. Supreme Court to revisit its landmark 1964 decision New York Times Sullivan, which set a high standard for public officials and figures of having to prove "actual malice"- knowing or reckless disregard for the truth - in our speech;
* Nicholas Sandmann, a Kentucky high school student, has sued The Washington Post for $250 million and CNN for $275 million over news coverage of a January incident at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., where Sandmann and classmates were face-to-face with a man at an Indigenous Peoples March. The lawsuit claims the Post's news reports were a "modern-day form of McCarthyism" and - given Sandmann was wearing a Trump-themed baseball call - that its coverage was skewed by a "well-known and easily documented biased agenda against President Trump" and his supporters. Sandmann's lawyers also said they sent letters to about 50 media organizations signaling potential legal action against those outlets.
President Trump has called for changes in libel law - mistakenly speaking of a federal law on defamation, which does not exist - to make it easier for politicians to sue news organizations. When Sandmann's lawsuit was announced, Trump tweeted, "Go get them Nick. Fake News."
Thomas' call for revisiting the 9-0 Times decision was not supported by any other justice and most court observers consider it more of a call to action in upcoming years - perhaps when more sharply conservative justices are appointed.
In the Times decision, the Supreme Court held that public debate in a democracy should be "uninhibited, robust and wide-open" on matters of public interest and when public officials are involved - later expanded to include most public figures.
Nunes' lawsuit isn't given much chance of success: Opinion, satire and hyperbolic language are protected speech. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 protects social media sites because they don't originate speech or information, but merely convey it. Given that hundreds of news outlets carried initial reports of the incident involving Sandmann similar to the Postand CNN, it may be difficult to single out their coverage as biased because of what the lawsuit calls an anti-Trump "agenda."
As such, many consider Nunes and Sandmann lawsuits as little more than political posturing. But the impact of bringing those lawsuits - and the potential for more like them - ought to concern us all, whether or not the news outlets ever pay a dime on these two complaints.
We must not forget it's not just news organizations or social media moguls that would be affected - or the White House or Congress more emboldened - by weakening the Times standards, or by legislative action in states.
All of us would be more exposed when criticizing public officials at any level - and there are tens of thousands of local public officials and staffers who might just want to chill, punish or silence the critics and watchdogs in their particular community.
The nation's founders faced insults and satire far beyond what officials today face. In 2008, a CNN report documented exchanges in the 1800 presidential race: Vice President Thomas Jefferson's camp accused President John Adams of being a "hideous hermaphroditical character, a fool, a hypocrite, a criminal and a tyrant." Adams' backers called Jefferson "a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father" and a "weakling, an atheist, a libertine and a coward."
From bumper stickers to yard signs to social media posts, we generally can join without fear in the back-and-forth of that "uninhibited, robust and wide-open" exchange envisioned by the high court more than 50 years ago.
Make no mistake: The impact of chilling or weakening the Times legal protections will reach into every home, every cellphone and every social media post any one of us chooses to make on matters of "public interest."

Texto completo: Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions, which the couple launched last year, has partnered with Netflix for a slate of projects that include scripted and unscripted shows as well as full-length features and documentaries.
"We created Higher Ground to harness the power of storytelling," the former president said. "Touching on issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more, we believe each of these productions won't just entertain, but will educate, connect and inspire us all."
Some of the projects are:
"American Factory," about a Chinese-owned factory in post-industrial Ohio; "Bloom," an upstairs/downstairs drama series set in the world of fashion in post-WWII New York that depicts barriers faced by women and by people of color; a feature film adaptation of author David W. Blight's "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom," for which he won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in History; "Overlooked," an adaptation of The New York Times "Overlooked" obituary column, about deaths unreported by the paper; "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents," a half-hour preschool series; "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," a nonfiction series that will portray the importance of unheralded work done by everyday heroes guiding our government; "Crip Camp," a documentary about a 1970s summer camp for teenagers with disabilities.
Higher Ground has made a point of focusing on stories that reflect a range of "interests and experiences" but are "relevant to our daily lives," Michelle Obama said. "We think there's something here for everyone - moms and dads, curious kids, and anyone simply looking for an engaging, uplifting watch at the end of a busy day."
- Variety
Women unite: Typically, female country artists only get one or two slots on a tour or festival. But on Carrie Underwood's Cry Pretty Tour 360, six women will be behind the mic throughout the show. Underwood picked duo Maddie & Tae and trio Runaway June to open for her arena tour that starts Wednesday in Greensboro, N.C. The seven-time Grammy winner says it's a great time for women to come together and support each other.
Cave boys: Netflix announced it will join with the "Crazy Rich Asians" production company (SK Global Entertainment) to make a film about last July's dramatic rescue of 12 village boys in northern Thailand who were trapped with their soccer coach in a flooded cave for more than two weeks.
Wango Taylor: Taylor Swift has been added to the lineup of the iHeartRadio Wango Tango concert June 1 in Carson, Calif. She will also open Wednesday's Billboard Music Awards with a performance of her new single, "ME!" Ryan Seacrest hosts Wango Tango, which will also feature the Jonas Brothers, Halsey, 5 Seconds of Summer, Zedd, Ally Brooke, Tyga, Ava Max, Fletcher and TOMORROW X TOGETHER. Tickets go on sale Friday.

Google employees will sit in to protest alleged retaliation for walkout

Texto completo: Google employees will hold a sit-in Wednesday to send a message about alleged retaliation employees have faced from their managers.
“From being told to go on sick leave when you're not sick, to having your reports taken away, we're sick of retaliation,” Google Walkout For Real Change tweeted Tuesday afternoon. “Six months ago, we walked out. This time, we're sitting in. 11am tomorrow.”
Tweet
In November, 20,000 Google employees walked out in response to a report published by the New York Times detailing how Google oversaw sexual harassment allegations. According to the Times, the company paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives who allegedly participated in sexual misconduct. However, Google failed to disclose information about the misconduct.
But leaders of the walkout claim that they faced retaliation. For example, Google employee Claire Stapleton said that she was demoted after she recruited others to participate. Additionally, she was ordered to take medical leave — even though she wasn’t ill.
Another Google employee, Meredith Whittaker, said she was “informed my role would be changed dramatically” in an internal letter shared with co-workers earlier this month. The letter was obtained by the New York Times.
Google declined to provide comment to the Washington Examiner, but shared a previous statement on the tech giant’s policies.
“We prohibit retaliation in the workplace and publicly share our very clear policy,” a Google spokesperson said. “To make sure that no complaint raised goes unheard at Google, we give employees multiple channels to report concerns, including anonymously, and investigate all allegations of retaliation."

On a Journey, Don't Add to the Trash

Texto completo: Niagara Falls and its surrounding parks see millions of visitors a year, and all that foot traffic results in a lot of trash -- 832 metric tons each year from the Canadian areas alone. Still, park sanitation workers were surprised to find a piano, broken into pieces, among the items left in the garbage one day.
"People dispose of all kinds of things," said Steve Barnhart, the senior director for parks, environment, and culture at the Niagara Falls Parks Commission in Ontario. "But that was really unusual."
Although odd things occasionally surface at tourist hot spots, the bulk of the waste in the garbage cans comes from much more common, repeat offenders. Here, in time for Earth Day, are some items that major tourist destinations often find tossed out by travelers -- and some ways that you can avoid adding to all that rubbish along your own journey.
Plastic, plastic everywhere
Travelers often use disposable items as conveniences that they can simply toss afterward. But when a site hosts millions of visitors and hauls out hundreds of tons of trash a year, as many popular tourist destinations do, all those disposable items add up fast in ways that are quickly apparent on the ground.
Although that smashed piano caught Mr. Barnhart's attention, he cited disposable plastic items -- such as the brightly colored ponchos that visitors wear near the falls (which the park workers collect after the tours and bale together to recycle) and single-use drink bottles -- as the kinds of items he and his fellow park workers see much more often among the waste removed from the parks surrounding Niagara Falls.
Angie Renner, the environmental integration director for Disney Parks, also pointed to plastic bags, cups, bottles and straws as some of the more common items that end up in the receptacles at Walt Disney World and the company's other theme parks. And Jamie Richards, a park ranger and spokeswoman for Yosemite National Park, noted that plastic water bottles and cardboard coffee cups (including their plastic lids) frequently show up in the trash.
The most effective way to reduce the number of disposable items in the trash is often to just stop purchasing so many of them in the first place.
"Something that certainly helps us out is trying to reduce your single-use plastic water bottles," Ms. Richards said. "We have plenty of filling stations throughout Yosemite National Park and that just really helps reduce a lot of the waste that's generated in the park."
Mr. Barnhart also cited the installation of water-filling stations for reusable water bottles in Niagara Falls's parks as a way they have encouraged the reduction of trash.
Different drinkware options can replace other paper and plastic disposables. If you're going to drink hot coffee or tea, carry a travel mug. If you like having a straw, bring your own reusable one. If you prefer to keep your drinks ice-cold, bring an insulated water bottle so that you're not tempted to buy chilled bottles on site. Or if you want to carry the smallest pack possible, go with a collapsible bottle. (Wirecutter has recommendations for these in guides to the best water bottle and the best travel mug.)
Skip the printouts
Sophie Grange, a spokeswoman for the Louvre, listed maps and entrance tickets as some of the most common items the museum sees in the 1,200 tons of waste it carts out a year. The museum does recycle paper, but for visitors who are carrying a smartphone, paperless alternatives can be an even better option.
"The best way to reduce waste is to not produce any," Ms. Grange said in an email. Instead she suggests that visitors who want to reduce their trash footprint download e-tickets and use the museum's app or refer to posted signs for guidance on directions.
In addition to providing options for visitors to skip the printouts, she said the museum also tries to find ways to keep its own printed materials out of the landfill too. For instance, it sends promotional banners for temporary exhibits to a company that turns them into bags; the banners even go to archaeological schools for use as coverings to protect dig sites.
Although tickets and maps for many tourist destinations are offered electronically, some travelers prefer to keep their tech to a minimum or may be traveling in areas where dicey connections and power failures are common. If paperless travel isn't practical for you, the best thing to do is to have a place ready to hold your papers so that you're not leaving a trail of them behind as you move. You can use a travel journal or notebook (Wirecutter recommends the Traveler's Notebook), customized with an inset folder, to keep loose papers together until you can sort through them at home.
Unwrap new gear before you leave home
Disposable cups, bags, and utensils may be the first kinds of items that spring to mind when you're thinking about how to reduce waste. But the packaging your gear and supplies come in can also be just as big of a problem. And when you're on the road, you may find that places to dispose of that packaging are much more limited than they are at home.
In Yosemite National Park, Ms. Richards often sees this problem in action, especially when campers bring new gear directly from the store into the park without unpacking it.
"A lot of visitors don't think about the amount of packaging material that comes if you buy a new sleeping bag, or a new tent," she said. Before leaving home, "if you have the chance to pack down and condense, you can reduce the cardboard and plastics that you bring into the park."
You can also cut down on the amount of packaging you're carrying by planning ahead and bringing a reusable packable bag to carry groceries or other supplies instead of picking up a disposable plastic or paper sack when you do your shopping. In fact, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, more than 60 countries have already put restrictions on single-use plastic bags, so carrying your own not only reduces your trash footprint but also means you'll be better prepared in locations where bags aren't available.

Extreme ideologies on race collide at Trinity; Hartford college seeks to advance inclusiveness ; amid controversy

Texto completo: Not historically known for campus unrest, Trinity College finds itself thrust in the middle of an ideological clash over race that has brought unwanted national attention to the Hartford institution as it tries to move beyond its preppy label.
The controversy revolves around a pair of professors - one for tweeting that "whiteness is terrorism" and the other for his central role in an emerging alt-right group that's been accused of giving a platform to white supremacists and to former Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, whose daughter is a Trinity senior.
It comes as the college's administration has sought to advance diversity and inclusiveness at the liberal arts school of 2,300 students, where a student-led affiliate of the Churchill Institute is seeking recognition as a campus organization. Members of the student Senate will vote on the request to create a Churchill Club on Sunday.
A trio of conservative pundits is among the school's most notable graduates: Tucker Carlson, George Will and Jesse Watters.
Joanne Berger-Sweeney, the school's president, addressed the political unrest in a campus-wide letter Wednesday and said Trinity College's foundation is built on academic freedom and freedom of expression.
"Where else should these debates occur, if not here?" Berger-Sweeney wrote. "These debates help us define our differences and find our common ground, and while they may not always end in an agreement, they advance our understanding of each other."
Berger-Sweeney was not available for an interview, but a school spokeswoman said, "We respect [the Student Government Association's] process and the considerable pressure they are under with regard to this issue, and therefore it would be inappropriate for anyone in the administration to comment before the vote."
Trinity's board of trustees chairwoman, Cornelia "Cornie" Thornburgh, and its alumni association president, Justin Maccarone Jr., did not respond to requests for comment.
The 3-year-old Churchill Institute is based in Hartford and led by Gregory B. Smith, a political science professor who has been criticized for referring to on-campus cultural houses for African-American, Asian-American, Latino, Muslim and Jewish students as "tribal enclaves."
At the same time, longtime sociology professor Johnny Eric Williams caused an uproar with his tweet on Easter that "whiteness is terrorism" and for referring to Barack and Michelle Obama as "white kneegrows" in a Facebook post. Williams previously took a paid leave of absence in 2017 after he made racially charged social media posts, which drew death threats.
Carlson lambasted his alma mater Wednesday night on his Fox News show.
"Why would you send your kids to a place like that...because there are no consequences for saying something that's like transparently insane and, by the way, racist?" Carlson said. "They don't oppose hatred. They are encouraging hatred, obviously. Let's stop lying about that."
Carlson compared Williams to Alex Jones, the controversial radio show host and conspiracy theorist who is being sued by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims for his false claims that the massacre was a hoax.
"Alex Jones has never said anything like that and he's been completely deplatformed and kicked off PayPal, but Johnny Williams is completely fine, safe in the tender bosom of Trinity College's bureaucracy," Carlson said.
A Trinity College spokeswoman said in a written statement that Williams' comments were made in "the context of his academic scholarship on issues of race" and that additional context he provided on a Facebook group page for alumni "speaks for itself."
Some students say that there's been selective outrage on the political right against Williams, while Smith and the activities of the Churchill Institute had been overlooked until its student affiliate requested recognition as a campus group.
"Trinity is different than when Tucker Carlson went here. It's more diverse," said Coleman McJessy, a freshman who is involved in the Trinity College Democrats. "If Tucker Carlson doesn't like it, that's his problem."
Critics of Churchill Club's bid for recognition as a campus organization say they are troubled by the mission statement of its parent organization, which is named for Winston Churchill, the British statesman whose legacy of fortitude during World War II is clouded by his history of racist remarks.
"In a world where Western Civilization is under attack, politically and militarily, but even more ominously, intellectually, the Churchill Institute is dedicated to the preservation, dissemination and extension of the Western moral and philosophical Tradition," the group's website states. "Our Colleges and Universities, which should be the center of this defense, have become the home base for the primary attacks on Western Civilization. We stand together with all like-minded individuals to keep alive an understanding of the Western Tradition in our Colleges and Universities."
Smith, the institute's president and board chairman, did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.
Tanuja Budraj, a sophomore who is vice president of the Multicultural Affairs Council of the Student Government Association, said the college should not give legitimacy to the group.
"It feels like the premise of the Churchill Institute is that white people are under attack on campus," Budraj said. "We believe that SGA recognition goes with the community values that we have at Trinity College among students."
McJessy said the language used by the institute and Smith is similar to the remarks made by Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King to the New York Times, in which he said, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?" King was then stripped of his committee assignments by the House GOP.
"I do think it's fair to call the group a group founded on white supremacy," McJessy said. "It's dog whistle language."
McJessy said student government representatives need to send a strong message that Trinity doesn't stand for intolerance. If the Churchill Club is recognized as a campus group, he said "It gives the implicit consent of this community to their ideology, their activities and their rhetoric."
Kristina Miele, the Student Government Association president, did not respond to a request for comment.
Neither did Julia Gorka, an honor student and rowing team member, whose father, Sebastian Gorka, was a panelist at the opening colloquium of the Churchill Institute, which was held two years ago off campus at the Hilton Hartford. The younger Gorka was part of a group of undergraduate fellows of the institute. Her father, a former Breitbart writer who played a key role in the controversial policy banning visitors to the U.S. from predominantly Muslim countries, was ousted as Trump's deputy assistant in August 2017.
Connecticut Republican Chairman J.R. Romano, who graduated from Trinity College in 2001, said he was not familiar with the Churchill Institute. He said he doesn't remember this much campus unrest and pointed out that Trinity hosted Linda Sarsour, the controversial co-chair of the 2017 Women's March in Washington, D.C., who once called on Muslims to mount a "jihad" against Trump. Romano said people should not lose sight of the hateful social media posts of Williams.
"People who want to distract away from the comments that this professor made are missing the point," Romano said. "It says to potential students and donors, 'you're not welcome.' How does any student sit in a classroom and feel as though they'd be judged fairly with the content of his Twitter feed?"
Williams said that his efforts to draw attention to the oppression of African-Americans have been twisted into a narrative that he's a racist. He pointed out that he's taught at white colleges for a long time and is married to a white woman.
"I guess if I hated white people, I wouldn't be [here]," Williams said.
Williams was part of a group of 45 Trinity faculty members who wrote a letter to the administration this month expressing concerns about the recognition of the Churchill Club and overall racial tensions on campus.
The letter writers called for the adoption of a "racial harassment policy, along with more systematic and regular reporting about violent and threatening incidents by the administration to the campus community."
The college needs to take "a strong public stance condemning white supremacy without equivocating about harm experienced on 'both sides' of the issue," the group wrote.
"Without acknowledging the pervasive, hurtful campus climate in which many students of color, queer students, international students, first-generation college students, and other students who are harassed based on their identities feel marginalized and threatened on a daily basis, any discussion of 'harms' experienced on this campus rings hollow," the faculty members wrote.

Texto completo: It's been little more than a week since special counsel Robert Mueller's 448-page report - now a bestseller - was released.
It revealed that members of President Trump's campaign showed interest in benefiting from Russian government efforts to sway the election in his favor, but investigators did not find evidence that their conduct amounted to a crime. It also showed Trump tried to impede the probe, including directives to quash the investigation and dismiss Mueller. The directives failed when aides refused to carry out his orders, Mueller found.
Democrats have called for more investigations - a few have called for impeachment - while Republicans deemed the president in the clear and called for everyone to move on.
The Enquirer has requested interviews from all Greater Cincinnati-area congressmen and senators to explain their take on the Mueller report. Sen. Sherrod Brown answered some questions in Cincinnati earlier this week.
Among Republicans, so far only Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Westwood, has responded.
Chabot helped lead the House's efforts in 1998 to impeach Bill Clinton. At the time, he said his children "have witnessed the president of the United States shamelessly lie to the American people.
Chabot, as a Republican, is in the "move on" camp when it comes to the Mueller report.
Here are Chabot's responses to The Enquirer's questions in a phone interview:
Does Trump's behavior outlined by Mueller concern Chabot? Chabot: "I think virtually every president I've seen, their actions and behavior give me concerns. The question from my perspective, is it impeachable? For Trump, the answer to that clearly is no. The information in there, at most, will give people more information to decide whether or not it warrants a vote for or against. He's been controversial from the start."
The Mueller report accused Trump of trying to fire Mueller. Is that obstruction? Chabot: "I think, first of all, there's no underlying crime, Mueller left it open. The attorney general and the deputy attorney general didn't think it was obstruction. I understand some people disagree with that view."
Why does Chabot take the attorney general's word there's no obstruction? Chabot: "He was confirmed by the Senate. He has a long career of public service and of not being a terribly partisan person."
What does Chabot mean by no underlying crime? Chabot: "The whole investigation was about collusion and conspiracy with the Russians. The president knew it hadn't happened, that his people hadn't been involved in it. He was right on that issue. It seemed to me that he felt he was wrongfully and unfairly accused."
If Trump felt that he was unfairly accused and did nothing wrong, why try to fire Mueller? Chabot: "I think he thought Mueller, by the people he had hired, by the fact they had all contributed to Democrats, he didn't think Mueller was being fair to him. Ultimately, getting to the most important issue here, what he had suggested ought to happen didn't happen. Clearly, justice was not obstructed."
Note: Not all of Mueller's team members donated to Democratic campaigns. Mueller assembled a team of 17 investigators, 13 of which are registered Democrats, according to the Washington Post. The other four members had no party affiliation. Six of the nine team members who made political contributions to federal candidates gave money to Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, totaling $11,436, according to Factcheck.org. Five of the team members donated a total of $8,800 to Hillary Clinton's campaigns.
What does Chabot think Trump meant when he said "This is the end of my presidency. I'm f---ed." Chabot: "When he said that, it was open for interpretation. My thinking is, he was talking about being investigated now for a year or two years and not being able to accomplish anything . He was afraid he'd be so distracted with that, it would be virtually impossible to get anything done."
Trump asked former White House counsel Don McGahn to lie to the New York Times refuting a story about his attempts to remove Mueller. Sarah Sanders also lied about speaking to FBI employees who wanted director James Comey fired. Does that concern Chabot? Chabot: "Lying is a concern. No elected officials, nobody that represents the people in a position of responsibility, should lie. I think that's appropriate and open to be criticized for doing that, whoever it is, whether it's the president or the administration. We absolutely should not lie. The question here, is it impeachable? The difference between (Bill) Clinton and Trump, Clinton was under oath. He perjured himself. He literally put his hand on the Bible, swore to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, and lied."
What about Trump's lack of answers to Mueller's written questions? Chabot: "His answers there were very lawyered answers, so he didn't commit perjury."
Based on the Mueller report, will Chabot still support Trump in 2020? Chabot: "I'm going to support him over the policies I've seen of virtually any Democrat. If you look at what they're for virtually on any issue, from controlling our borders to giving out basically free stuff and not considering how it's paid for, President Trump's policies are far closer to mine."
The Mueller report accused Trump's campaign of expecting to benefit from Russian interference. Trump asked for some of the purloined emails of Clintons. Why doesn't that concern Chabot? Chabot: "It concerns me that the Russians were involved at all, period. There was a whole lot more evidence of involvement with the Russians on the Clinton side...Trump talked about stuff, the Clinton campaign did it. They paid for the dossier loaded with a lot of lies. If you look at what Clinton did, the Clinton Foundation, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars are coming from Russian interests."
Note: Research firm Fusion GPS contracted with former British Intelligence officer Christopher Steele conducted opposition research on Trump, first for a conservative website and later for the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The research resulted in the "Steele dossier" the findings of which helped spark the Mueller investigation. The accusations regarding Russians and the Clinton Foundation refer to Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. People accused Clinton of selling about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia in exchange for $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. PolitiFact ruled the claims "mostly false" saying some of the connections between the Clinton Foundation and Russian deal "may appear fishy, there is no proof of a quid pro quo."
Would an impeachment help or hurt Trump? Chabot: "I wouldn't' have thought this if I hadn't lived through it, but it might actually help Trump. I think it would hurt the country, it's a divisive issue."

Texto completo: Some kids play soccer. Other kids make slime. Guess who has more money for college?
Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

Texto completo: CINCINNATI-- A year ago Thursday, Ronald Acuna addressed the media at Great American Ballpark before his major league debut. The Braves had dropped the first two games of the series, looking lackadaisical in doing so.
Their response: a long-awaited promotion for baseball's top prospect, who'd been compared with a host of Hall of Famers. Acuna brought his swagger and energy into the Braves clubhouse, injecting a new level of confidence into the club. They won the next two, the second of which featured Acuna's first homer and signaled one of the more memorable seasons in team history was to come.
"I remember it like it was yesterday," Acuna said, recalling his debut through team interpreter Franco Garcia. "I've definitely enjoyed my time here, and I've made the most of it. That's one thing that's never going to change. I'm always going to play with fun because it's what I want to do, it's my passion."
The Braves, coincidentally, were back in Cincinnati at Acuna's one-year mark. It's only fitting for an athlete's tale that seems to have the most appropriate circumstance at every turn.
Acuna's first-year story can't be told without one key decision: To spark a stagnant offense, the Braves moved him to the leadoff spot following the All-Star break.He broke out, bringing unprecedented enthusiasm and jaw-dropping moments --sometimes daily--en route to winning rookie of the year. More important, his takeoff propelled the Braves to a National League East title after they were mired in the division's depths for years previously.
"I put him in the lineup and turn him loose," manager Brian Snitker said. "I have a great seat to watch this young man play. The best thing I can do is stay out of his way."
Since his debut, Acuna ranks eighth in the majors with a .931 OPS.He's reached 30 career homers earlier than any Brave ever. He's brought the franchise back into the spotlight, becoming a popular talking point for TV and radio while regularly gracing every publication with some variety of "Here's baseball's next superstar."
Acuna, 21, shies away from talking about himself. It's not about rivaling Mike Trout as the sport's premier player. While he possesses pronounced confidence, Acuna won't let it bleed into arrogance. Regardless of status and money, he boasts a young heart perfect for a kid's game.
"I feel like I've always been that way, even as a boy," Acuna said. "I've never felt any reason to change, whether I've got fame and notoriety or don't. There's no reason to change."
His first 111 games were impressive:A.293/.366/.552 line with 26 homers, 26 doubles, 64 RBIs and 16 steals despite missing a month with a knee injury.
"I think everybody would like to have that first year," Snitker said with a grin, his usual expression when talking all things Acuna. "Actually, feels like he's been here longer. But he's done great. He's done everything we'd hope. He's done everything he showed, the kind of player he was when we saw him in spring training. He hasn't disappointed anybody.
"He's continuing to work. He's going to get better. He's not a finished product yet, far from it. You like the base he's got and the ceiling he has to become one of the better players in the game."
Acuna embodies a franchise player: It stems beyond talent. His charisma, general marketability, freshness in a sport that's sometimes stale makes him appeal to all ages, compel any audience.
His rookie year was littered with memorable moments. Homering in five consecutive games. Tormenting the Marlins enough that they decided to hit him rather than try to get him out. An expectation of leadoff extra-base damage. A grand slam in SunTrust Park's first postseason game.
Fellow Venezuelan outfielder Ender Inciarte called Acuna the best player he'd seen. Colleague after colleague stood in awe of his achievements. First baseman Freddie Freeman, the Braves' franchise pillar, insists Acuna has another speed we've yet to see.
Chipper Jones and Bobby Cox weren't afraid to use Andrew Jones as a comparable. Acuna's Triple-A manager, Damon Berry-hill, invoked Alex Rodriguez. Dansby Swanson, who briefly was teammates with Acuna during his trip to the minors, said the prodigy is simply "a better athlete than everybody else."
From the infectious personality to the continual social-media videos of him and best friend Ozzie Albies goofing off in the dugout, Acuna brings with him a stress-free environment. Even before their first postseason game at Dodger Stadium -- a game in which the team didn't play well--Acuna was visibly comfortable. His body language always indicates anything but nerves, be it three hours before Saturday game in Cleveland or at the plate with the bases loaded in a must-win playoff game.
"I love the energy and how he plays," Snitker said. "I love watching him run the bases. His defense is getting better, it's better than it was a year ago when he came. His baserunning will get better with experience. I love to see the energy.
"I love the fact the kid likes to play baseball. The impression I get from that young man is he likes playing baseball, and who wouldn't if you have that skill set? I'd love to be in that body and have that skill set. Then I'd really love to play baseball."
Acuna looks like a perennial All-Star. He had some MVP buzz entering the year, an absurd thought for a player who opened the 2017 season in Advanced-A Florida.
"His plate discipline for his age is pretty rare," veteran teammate Nick Markakis said. "You can't teach plate discipline. It's a natural ability to do it. Not just his natural ability at the plate, but every aspect of his game is pretty impressive."
His trajectory is difficult to peg. Even in the unlikely event he plateaus, he'd still be a borderline top-10 player. The only true certainty of his future is he'll spend his prime in Atlanta. Acuna signed a team-friendly eight-year deal, which included two club options, with the team earlier this month.
The conversation then centered around his decision to forgo free agency at the peak of his powers. The New York Times called him the "$100 million bargain." The Braves might have MLB's greatest talent, one enriched with personality and confidence, on their hands for the next decade.
No one sums it up better than Markakis: "Braves fans and his teammates in the future should be excited to play with him, to watch him, because he's going to be one of a kind."

Texto completo: LONDON -- They're track-and-field legends who have competed around the world, at events including the Olympics and the London Marathon. They have run in stadiums packed with thousands of screaming fans, racing for medals and the glory of being crowned No. 1.
But an ugly feud between Mo Farah, a Somalia-born British runner, and his former childhood hero, Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian runner who set 27 world records over his career, spilled into public this week.
According to news reports and the athletes' public statements, the dispute revolves around claims of a theft, unpaid bills and an unprovoked violent attack. It all comes as Mr. Farah, the most successful British track athlete in history, is preparing to run the London Marathon on Sunday.
The public became aware of the simmering dispute during the final moments of a news conference in London on Wednesday, where Mr. Farah lit the fuse. As the event was wrapping up, he used his final few minutes onstage to reveal that although his marathon training had gone according to plan, he had been the victim of theft in a hotel outside of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he had spent the past few months training.
The hotel, the Yaya Africa Athletics Village, is one of five luxury resorts owned by Mr. Gebrselassie, who retired from professional running in May 2015.
Mr. Farah said that members of the hotel staff had broken into his room on March 23, the day of his 36th birthday, and had stolen two cellphones, a Tag Heuer watch that had been a present from his wife and around $ 3,000 in various currencies.
He said that he had appealed to Mr. Gebrselassie for help and to discuss the issues privately but that Mr. Gebrselassie had not responded.
"When you stay for three months in that hotel, it was very disappointing to know that someone who has that hotel and that kind of support couldn't do nothing," Mr. Farah said at the London news conference.
Mr. Gebrselassie, 46, once regarded as the world's greatest distance runner, responded on the same day with equally sharp comments in a news release, threatening Mr. Farah, a four-time Olympic champion who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2017, with legal action.
"It's with deep sorrow," he wrote, that he had learned of the comments made by Mr. Farah against him and his property.
Five of the hotel's employees were taken into custody for three weeks in connection with the theft and were later released, Mr. Gebrselassie said in his statement. The police investigated the theft but "found nothing on the reported robbery case," he added.
He also unleashed a litany of his own complaints about Mr. Farah's stay at his hotel, claiming that Mr. Farah had left without paying a $ 3,000 service bill, had been the subject of "multiple reports of disgraceful conduct" and had been reported to the police for an attack on a man and a woman in the hotel's gym.
The statement concluded with what was purported to be a text message sent by Mr. Farah on Monday that appeared to threaten Mr. Gebrselassie with damaging remarks. It said that Mr. Farah would bring the matter up at the news conference and would not be responsible for the effect it would have on Mr. Gebrselassie and his business.
The text message was signed off with "Greetings from a very disappointed friend, Sir Mo."
"Mo is disappointed with this statement and the continued reluctance by the hotel and its owner to take responsibility for this robbery," a spokeswoman for Mr. Farah said in an email. "Mo disputes all of these claims, which are an effort to distract from the situation."
The two athletes have competed against each other on the track only once, in 2013 at the Great North Run in northeast England. Mr. Farah came in second and Mr. Gebrselassie third.
Mr. Farah had previously described how watching Mr. Gebrselassie win the 10,000-meter race at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in a split-second sprint finish had inspired him to dream of becoming an Olympic champion.
The ugly dispute has soured relations between the runners, both hailed as legends in the athletics world.
Speaking about the deterioration in their relationship, Mr. Gebrselassie, a two-time Olympic gold medal winner, told The Guardian on Thursday: "I am very, very sad. I loved this guy, but he has tried to destroy my name."
Tensions between the runners were still high a day after the dramatic accusations became public. In the interview with The Guardian, Mr. Gebrselassie accused Mr. Farah of punching a married couple and kicking them in an unprovoked attack and claimed he had pleaded with the police to not detain Mr. Farah.
The spokeswoman for Mr. Farah confirmed to The New York Times on Thursday that there had been an incident "a number of weeks ago" but said, "It was categorically not of Mo's making."
Mr. Farah disputed Mr. Gebrselassie's account of events, she added, claiming that Mr. Gebrselassie had not been present when the encounter took place and that Mr. Farah had raised a complaint "to the highest level" within the police.
Mr. Gebrselassie did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
While Mr. Farah contends with one public quarrel, the countdown is on for a professional challenge on Sunday. He hopes to beat his third-place finish at the London Marathon last year.
The last time that Mr. Gebrselassie competed in the marathon, in 2007, he did not finish because of problems with asthma.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: "Jeopardy!" legend-in-the-making James Holzhauer is revealing the secret sauce that's made his exciting winning streak possible.
Holzhauer, 34, a professional sports gambler from Las Vegas, kept his streak alive on Thursday's episode, bringing home $90,812 in a runaway victory.
He has won a total of $1,225,987 over 16 days, second only to computer programmer-turned-author Ken Jennings, who made off with $2,520,700 over 74 games in 2004.
In a Q&A with The New York Times that published online Wednesday, the professional sports gambler shared how his experience helps him keep a firm grip on the game show.
"There are big advantages to having a lot of chips early on in a poker tournament," he told the Times. "You can make plays that other people can’t. "
Holzhauer, who goes "$1,000-1,000-1,000 whenever I can," said he conceived of the strategy of aiming for the high-value clues "right away. "
"You can see as soon as I get control of the board in the first game I’m going for the $1,000 clues whenever I have the opportunity," he said.
Holzhauer believes his "comfort zone is very different than the typical contestant," which he hails as "a huge advantage. "
He tells the outlet: "The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money. "
'Jeopardy!' Most loved, hated and memorable contestants through the years
More: A five-time champ explains why James Holzhauer a game-changer
Describing the typical way the game show is played as "too risk-averse," he explained the advantage of his strategy.
"The funny thing is, my strategy actually minimizes the risk of me losing a game," he said. "There’s times in a football game where a team goes for a big TD pass. If you don’t take a risk like that, you’re not going to win. "
Holzhauer's strategy is backed by knowledge he said he picked up from children's literature.
"I’ve found that in an adult reference book, if it’s not a subject I’m interested in, I just can’t get into it," he told the Times. "I was thinking, what is the place in the library I can go to to get books tailored to make things interesting for uninterested readers? Boom. The children’s section. "
He crossed the $1 million mark during Tuesday's episode, becoming only the second person in the game show's 35-year history to reach the feat in regular-season (non-tournament) play.

White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney doesn't recall keeping Russian meddling talk from Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A top White House official said Wednesday he doesn't recall keeping discussions of election security from President Donald Trump and defended the administration's effort to confront election meddling by Russia and others.
The response, from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, followed a report this week that former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to focus the administration's attention on the problem but was told not to raise it in front of Trump. Nielsen resigned this month amid tensions with the White House.
"I don't recall anything along those lines happening in any meeting," Mulvaney said. "But unlike the Obama administration, who knew about Russian actions in 2014 and did nothing, the Trump administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections. "
Russian interference in the 2016 election has once again moved to the fore after special counsel Robert Mueller's report spelled out a sophisticated operation tied to the Kremlin to sow division in the U. S. through cyberattacks and social media campaigns. In his public statements, Trump and top aides have dismissed the impact of those efforts.
Nielsen became increasingly concerned about Russia’s activity during the 2018 midterm election, according to a New York Times report Wednesday. Mulvaney made it clear that Trump equated discussion of Russian activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory, according to the Times, and said the issue should be "kept below his level. "
Administration officials have said they have taken steps to address the influence campaign and hacking that took place in 2016. Nielsen was one of several Trump officials who spoke to reporters at the White House last August about those efforts.
Nielsen and others said at the time that the administration is working with state and local election officials to protect voting systems from attacks and to block Russia and others from engaging in them.
"Our democracy itself is in the crosshairs," Nielsen said.

Texto completo: Former Vice Joe Biden is expected to announce his candidacy for president on Thursday, bringing months of speculation to an end.
Both the New York Times and the Associated Press reported Tuesday that Biden will announce his candidacy in a video to be released Thursday.
Biden, 76, is then scheduled to speak in Pittsburgh on Monday.
For months, Biden has dropped hints about running for president, including when he told Delaware Democrats in March that he has the "most progressive record of anybody running."
This will be Biden's third attempt at a presidential run.
Although he's favored in some polls and is seen as the front-runner for the Democratic primary, Biden has faced criticism in recent weeks over his behavior and stances on certain issues.
In late March, Lucy Flores, a former Democratic Nevada assemblywoman wrote in an article published in the Cut that Biden made her uncomfortable when he put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair and gave her a "big slow kiss" on the back of her head at a political rally in 2014.
Flores' claim prompted inspection of Biden's past, including media analyses of previously published photos showing Biden interacting with women. Three more women have since spoken publicly about how Biden's behavior made them feel uncomfortable.
Others quickly came to his defense.
It prompted Biden to release a video on social media in which he said that he will be more "mindful and respectful of people's personal space" following allegations from women that his behavior has made them uncomfortable.
In recent weeks, the Biden campaign has made calls to prominent Democratic donors, the New York Times reported.
The country's largest firefighters union is planning to endorse the former vice president, according to AP.

Resumen: LAS CRUCES The man who had identified himself as the “commander” of an armed group camped near the New Mexico border fence made an initial appearance in federal court on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition. According to the criminal complaint, “Witnesses (in 2017) reported seeing members of the United Constitutional Patriots bearing firearms at Hopkins' residence.” The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico raised concerns the group was doing more than watching.

Texto completo: LAS CRUCES The man who had identified himself as the “commander” of an armed group camped near the New Mexico border fence made an initial appearance in federal court on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, wore a brown Doña Ana Detention Center jumpsuit and answered “yes” when U.S. Magistrate Gregory B. Wormuth asked if he understood the charges and his right to legal representation. When the judge asked about any medical problems, Hopkins said, “Quite a few medical problems, sir. I'm 70 years old.”
Hopkins, also known as Johnny Horton Jr., is from Flora Vista, according to the criminal complaint.
The charges stem from November 2017, when witnesses reported seeing weapons at his residence in Flora Vista and that the group he was involved in was training to kill Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
Hopkins has spent about two months living on the New Mexico border at a camp set up by the United Patriots of the Constitution. Sunland Park police and FBI agents arrested him Saturday.
“This arrest has absolutely nothing to do with what they're doing down there, on the surface anyway,” said Kelly O'Connell, Hopkins' lawyer.
A spokesman for the United Patriots insisted Hopkins was not armed while at the camp and served as the camp's cook.
The criminal complaint from 2017 accuses Hopkins of unlawful possession of nine firearms and ammunition in his home in San Juan County in November 2017. Hopkins has three felony convictions, including possessing a loaded firearm in Michigan in 1996, being a felon in possession of a firearm in Oregon and “impersonating a peace officer” in Oregon in 2006, according to the FBI.
According to the criminal complaint, “Witnesses (in 2017) reported seeing members of the United Constitutional Patriots bearing firearms at Hopkins' residence.” And the group was “training to assassinate George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and Barrak (Barack) Obama, because of these individuals' support of Antifa.” Antifa is described as a “loose collection of groups, networks and individuals who believe in active, aggressive opposition to far right-wing movements” on the Anti-Defamation League's website, which lists Antifa as an extremist group.
Outside the federal courthouse in Las Cruces, Hopkins' attorney said the guns and ammunition did not belong to his client. O'Connell said he was hired to represent Hopkins late Sunday night, but he declined to identify who is paying the legal costs.
There was no further reference to the threats in the complaint, which was filed Saturday.
The Journal interviewed Hopkins for its “8 hours on the border” series last month. At that time he identified himself as Johnny Horton and said he was a leader of the group.
“We're always armed. We don't point our weapons at people. But we're armed, because we don't know who is coming across,” he told the Journal.
“We talked to Border Patrol, and they said they needed help. They needed eyes,” he said. Border Patrol welcomes tips from citizens who witness illegal activity on the border but cautions people against taking the law into their own hands.
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico raised concerns the group was doing more than watching. In a letter to the governor and attorney general Thursday, the ACLU referred to the men as “armed vigilantes” on the border who were “illegally detaining” hundreds of migrant families at gunpoint and called for an investigation.
The ACLU pointed to videos on social media that showed members of the group in camouflage standing over groups of migrant parents and kids.
“We are detaining people but not illegally. If they do not surrender to our verbal commands, we do not force them to stay with us,” Jim Benvie, the United Constitutional Patriots' spokesman, told the Journal on Thursday after learning about the ACLU letter.
The actions of the group have garnered national coverage both broadcast and print. The New York Times included a story on Monday's court appearance.
On Monday, Benvie reiterated the organization is not breaking any laws by patrolling the border with weapons.
“Our guys are carrying for protection. We're just a group of volunteer patriots, veterans in law enforcement,” Benvie said.
But he said Hopkins was not armed while living at the camp near the border fence. “He didn't have a gun. He didn't bring a gun. Johnny did not bring a gun,” he said.
“He's a 70-year-old Vietnam veteran who was cooking meals for people at the camp. He was a victim in this,” Benvie said.
Hopkins is being held without bond until his pretrial hearing in Albuquerque next Monday. Possible aid for asylum seekers

Are Russian mobsters coming to Kentucky?

Texto completo: Kentucky might be going into business with the Russian mafia.
Not the rough-and-tumble "Godfather" crowd with the bent noses and such names like Tessio, Barzini and Luca Brasi.
If all goes according to plan, by the middle of the year, we'll be in business with Oleg Deripaska, a buddy of Vladimir Putin.
He could be sending $200 million – if you believe media reports – in what could very well be mobbed-up money to northeastern Kentucky to build a $1.7 billion aluminum plant on an old strip mine there.
The United States government, according to the New York Times, has long believed that Deripaska has deep ties to Russian organized crime – the Bratva – so much so it has limited his travel here and prohibited him from doing business in this country.
The 51-year-old billionaire emerged as a powerful businessman following the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after a bloody fight for control of Russia's aluminum industry.
Last November, the New York Times quoted Mikhail Khodorkovsky, another Russian billionaire, saying he stayed out of that battle and urged those he worked with to do the same because of the ruthlessness of the fight. "There were so many murders, I refused to go into this business," Khodorkovsky said.
According to the Times, many have claimed that Deripaska "engaged in theft, intimidation, bribery and even murder, notably of a Russian banker in 1995," but that none of those claims has been substantiated.
He was sued in Delaware in 2004 in a case that portrayed him as a "member of a criminal gang that seized control of an iron-ore mining complex in the Ural Mountains in the late 1990s," the Times wrote.
"The previous manager claimed that at a meeting attended by Mr. Deripaska, a mafia leader and five armed thugs, he was told to transfer a majority share or 'this is the last time you will leave here alive.'"
Deripaska denied the claims. The Delaware case was dismissed in 2007 because the American court didn't have jurisdiction.
Now Deripaska could be bringing his aluminum acumen to Kentucky.
That plant in which he and his company is investing is the Braidy Industries aluminum plant that Gov. Matt Bevin poured $15 million of your money into in 2017.
When he announced the planned aluminum mill, Bevin hailed it as possibly the "most singularly transformative economic development decision that has ever been made in the commonwealth of Kentucky."
But the plant has had trouble getting off the ground, in part because Braidy was forced to move the planned construction site from South Shore to Ashland when it was learned the original location couldn't support the weight of the plant.
And money was a problem.
Enter Rusal, a Russian aluminum company that until just three months ago was barred from doing business in the United States in part because of its ties to Deripaska.
The Trump administration lifted the sanctions in January after Deripaska agreed to reduce his ownership stake in the Moscow-based company, the world's second-largest aluminum manufacturer, from 70% to less than 45%.
And that came only after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed that decision despite large numbers of Republicans and Democrats who objected to allowing Rusal and its parent company En+ Group into the United States.
The House voted to keep the sanctions 362-53, but the Senate fell three votes short of the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster. McConnell, along with fellow Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, voted against the resolution.
Get ready for borscht and vodka in Ashland.
The deal is that Rusal will own 40% of the mill and will supply it with its reserves of aluminum from a smelter under construction in Siberia. Braidy will roll it flat so it can be used to make car parts here in the United States.
So, why would you go into business with a guy like Deripaska?
Craig T. Bouchard, the CEO of Braidy Industries, has lagged behind in raising money to build the plant, and has repeatedly extended the fundraising deadline. And Bouchard and his new best buddy, Bevin, need to get this operation moving, and they could only do that after getting hundreds of millions in loans. And they couldn't do that until they had private investors putting up approximately $500 million.
The plant is supposed to be fully operational in 2021. There's not a lot of time left.
But maybe, more importantly, Bevin faces reelection in November, and there has been an air of suspicion surrounding the Braidy project as it has dragged on. The question being asked: Is this project really going to happen?
Even Bevin's fellow Republicans have expressed doubt. Earlier this week, U.S. Rep. James Comer, a Republican from Kentucky's first district, said he wouldn't invest in Braidy and said he wouldn't have accepted the Russian investment. He didn't even address the issue of Deripaska's alleged involvement with Russian organized crime.
With the election fast approaching, perhaps Bevin is worried if this deal dies, his political career could be sleeping with the fishes.

How will we deal with the Julian Assange problem?

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador's interior minister.
Assange's behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he's a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans – including many in the U.S. media – long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange's publishing activities.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you're a journalist doesn't make you one. (Granted, some are better than the "real" ones.)
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone's personal emails and under what circumstances?
One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn't accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government's decades-long campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham's bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts – all while risking great personal and financial loss – was epic.
Assange's process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
It isn't hyperbolic to say we're at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole – and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal – and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg's charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
Wikileaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that's just me.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - A California couple who tortured 12 of their 13 children, starving and beating them, depriving them of sleep and sometimes shackling them to their beds with chains, were sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison.
Some of their children gave statements at the sentencing hearing, saying they were haunted by the abuse they suffered, but also saying in some cases that they had forgiven and still loved their parents. One of their daughters told a packed courtroom that the suffering "may have been bad, but it made me strong."
"My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back," said the young woman, who is now in college. She added, "I'm a fighter. I'm strong."
The couple, David and Louise Turpin, cried and trembled as four of their children made statements, two of them through inter-mediaries, in Riverside County Superior Court.
One of the children, a young man who is studying software engineering at college, said that he had learned to ride a bike since being rescued. "Sometimes I just go on long rides because I enjoy it so much," he said.
The children were rescued in January 2018 after one of the girls worked up the courage to escape by jumping from a window of the suburban Los Angeles home where they had been kept prisoner. She called 911 from a cellphone she had grabbed from the house, and in a calm, clear voice described the years of abuse to a police dispatcher.
"I've never been out. I don't go out much," the girl told the dispatcher. She was 17, but her voice sounded like that of a much younger child, because, prosecutors said, her growth had been stunted by the abuse. The abuse left two of her sisters unable to bear children, authorities said.
Now, in a reversal of fate, the parents, who pleaded guilty to multiple counts of torture and abuse, are likely to spend the rest of their lives locked up. They will be eligible for parole after 25 years, prosecutors said, but unless a parole board decides otherwise, they will probably remain in prison for life.
The children ranged from 2 to 29 years old when they were found. Some were emaciated and appeared to have cognitive deficiencies from the abuse. Only the . toddler did not appear to have been abused, authorities said.
To their neighbors, the family seemed normal, if reclusive. David Turpin, 57, had been an engineer for Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Louise Turpin, 50, apparently stayed home. They lived in a nondescript stucco home in the small working class city of Perris, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles.
Neighbors rarely saw the children outside the home. It was neatly kept on the outside, and so did not arouse suspicion. But it reeked of human waste on the inside, where the children were often not released from their shackles to go to the bathroom.

Resumen: In Jadon Peck's impressionistic scene design, which suggests a range of rustic locations near a lake glimpsed through painted panels at the rear of the tiny Station Theatre, a prominent photograph of Chekhov looms as an icon calling forth the work's Russian soul. Adapting the piece for seven principal characters instead of the usual dozen or so, playwright Posner nimbly deploys Chekhovian themes on the significance of love and art in human experience to create a trio of couples who are by turns star-matched and star-crossed. Conrad (Jake Fava) overflows with artistic and romantic desire in his quest for "new forms" of theatrical expression as he seeks to impress his vain, dismissive mother, Emma (Joi Hoffsommer), and his prospective paramour, Nina (Lindsey Gates-Markel).

Texto completo: In the dusty archives of a famed actors' club in St. Petersburg, Russia, a bust of the great dramatist Anton Chekhov peers down at mere mortals who sit at a table near the bookcase where he is perched. Why would this come to mind at Thursday night's opening of "Stupid _______ Bird" by Aaron Posner at the Station Theatre in Urbana?
In Jadon Peck's impressionistic scene design, which suggests a range of rustic locations near a lake glimpsed through painted panels at the rear of the tiny Station Theatre, a prominent photograph of Chekhov looms as an icon calling forth the work's Russian soul.
This play with The News-Gazette's mandated blank space is "sort of" based on the Russian master's classic "The Seagull." The missing word is a vulgar adjective frequently employed throughout the play.
The characters are not, however, 19th-century denizens of a Russian dacha. These refugees (spinoffs?) from Chekhov speak the argot of today's version of bohemian culture. Adapting the piece for seven principal characters instead of the usual dozen or so, playwright Posner nimbly deploys Chekhovian themes on the significance of love and art in human experience to create a trio of couples who are by turns star-matched and star-crossed.
Conrad (Jake Fava) overflows with artistic and romantic desire in his quest for "new forms" of theatrical expression as he seeks to impress his vain, dismissive mother, Emma (Joi Hoffsommer), and his prospective paramour, Nina (Lindsey Gates-Markel). It is a lot of pressure for an intense young man whose sap is rising and who feels overshadowed by his actor mother and her lover, Trigorin (Gary Ambler), a famed literary figure.
As counterpoint to these couples, Posner offers two young people from the less-privileged classes, Dev (Eric Beckley) and Mash (Hannah Yonan). Mash pines for the young writer, Con, who barely acknowledges her existence. She wears black because, she says, "I'm in mourning. For my life. I'm unhappy."
For his part, Dev, whom another character describes as Con's "odd friend," carries the torch of unrequited love for Mash and good-naturedly argues with her over which of them is more miserable. When Mash wonders if they are characters in "a Dickens novel," we are reminded that this is not Chekhov, it's Posner, but as in Chekhov (and life), everyone's a little miserable.
Acting as a choric presence for the play is Sorn (William L. Kephart), an aging doctor who is Emma's brother and Con's supportive uncle. It is he who attempts to soothe troubled waters between his sister and nephew, who ruminates on the meaning of it all, and who unsettles the audience with his conclusions about human nature and purpose.
A key difference between Posner's "Bird" and Chekhov's "Seagull" comes in the current play's use of direct address to the audience. Chekhov is noted for his use of indirection, with key events often happening offstage so that audiences witness how characters react to the fact of these actions.
In Posner's comic view, however, indirection is overcome as characters break the "fourth wall," unburdening themselves of their cares and woes. They beg us to recognize them, to feel their pain, and ask us (literally) for advice. Something may be lost in this shifted paradigm, but much accessible adult humor is gained and Con's plaintive cry for new forms comes flickering to life.
Director Kay Bohannon Holley has cobbled a tight ensemble of actors, several of whom have worked together in the past. Fava's heated passion as the young artist sometimes feels as though it might overwhelm the intimacy of the theater space, but he wisely holds himself in reserve. Yonan's Mash is a revelation that makes us wonder why Con is blind to her many charms.
Beckley, as Dev, provides a needed and delightful balance to Mash and Con's intensity. As Nina, the heartbreaker who finds the making of art a crushing challenge, Gates-Markel floats through the play as if she were a butterfly who stings. She never lands for long, but she leaves pain in her wake. Like every true artist, she says, "I go on."
Stage veterans Hoffsommer and Ambler are well matched as a power couple among the literati in their world. Hoffsommer's Emma delivers a poignant speech on the satisfactions of winter romance that drives Trigorin back into her arms, for a while anyway. Kephart's Sorn provides many pleasures with warm, open connection to the other characters and to the audience.
There is much to admire in "Bird," but when the characters ask for advice, we want to say, "Stop wanting what is not yours."
Easier said than done. Don't you think?

Modell's taps financial adviser to help its business

Texto completo: Modell's Sporting Goods, known for its catchy "Gotta Go To Mo's" jingle, has obtained guidance from a financial adviser — an indication that the country's oldest sporting goods store is facing mounting pressure in today's competitive retail climate.
The Manhattan-based retailer, which has more than 150 stores in the Northeast, including dozens in New York and New Jersey, has tapped California-based consulting firm Berkeley Research Group, the same adviser that worked with Modell's in 2017 and that has advised other troubled retailers like Gymboree Group Inc.
Retail experts say it is not unusual for retailers to reposition themselves in the ever-changing world of retail, where competition from big-box stores and online shopping has forced a growing list of retailers to file for bankruptcy in the first four months of 2019 alone, including Charlotte Russe and Payless ShoeSource.
Mitchell Modell, the retailer's chief executive, said the retailer has long-term plans to stay in business.,
"We are committed to securing our future in a challenging retail climate, and therefore are always looking for ways to improve our performance," Modell said in an emailed statement responding to questions from the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "To help us with efficiencies and process improvement, we have engaged Berkeley Research Group, as we have done in the past."
Modell, a resident of Alpine, did not specify what the company's plans were. When asked if stores would be closing in New Jersey or New York, he said the retailer had no plans to shutter stores in those markets, beyond closures that he said occur annually when leases expire.
The Wall Street Journal first reported in March that Modell's hired Berkeley Research Group. In the report, people familiar with the matter said options on the table included a possible bankruptcy filing or restructuring.
Should the retailer eventually file for bankruptcy or plan any widespread closures, it could send shock waves across New York and New Jersey's retail sectors. The chain has an estimated 100 stores in the two states, according to a count on the company's website. That's about one-third of the chain's retail footprint.
Widespread closures could have a big impact on the region's commercial real estate market, which has recently had to absorb the closure of Toys R Us and Sears stores, and must deal with planned closures of some Bed Bath & Beyond stores soon.
Retailers typically hire financial advisers when the future of their companies is uncertain, and because advisers can offer an objective approach to dealing with a distressed company, said Ted Gavin, managing director of Gavin/Solmonese, a bankruptcy and restructuring consulting firm.
Modell's likely hired an adviser "because they have a fundamental business problem that is threatening the future of the company, and that is in all likelihood a combination of too little revenue and burdensome leases," Gavin said.
Gavin, who has more than 20 years of experience working with distressed companies, said Modell's may consider getting out of under-performing markets.
That, he said, is key to balancing other financial strains a retailer may be facing, whether too much debt or declining sales in particular stores.
"The key is to get out of the markets that aren't working for you and to do it early enough to be able to preserve cash," Gavin said. "Moving to online may supplement what you lose in closing retail — but the important thing is to get out of money-losing retail locations."
An immigrant from Hungary The retail world has been unforgiving to sporting goods companies, but Modell's, the oldest family-owned sporting goods company in the country, has managed to stay afloat amid the changing tides.
The business started when Morris A. Modell, an immigrant from Hungary, opened a general store on Cortlandt Street in Lower Manhattan in 1889 — a date that has been affixed on the store's red-and-white signs for decades. The company thrived after World War I by stocking up on Army surplus merchandise and selling it at low prices, according to William Modell's obituary in The New York Times.
William Modell, the third generation to run the business, profited from the failures of his rivals, the Times reported. In 1996, Modell's grew from 67 stores by paying $2.5 million for 15 outlets in New Jersey and in the Baltimore and Washington areas from bankrupt Herman's World of Sporting Goods.
Modell's reportedly considered a similar strategy in 2016 when Sports Authority liquidated all its stores. Modell's planned to bid on some of Sports Authority's failed stores, but that plan was never executed.
Often, the competition between sporting goods companies has been fierce. Dick's Sporting Goods, arguably, fast-tracked Sports Authority's demise — the big-box chain had a strategy of placing its new stores as close as possible to existing Sports Authority locations, taking away sales from the struggling retailer.
Today, Dick's Sporting Goods remains a dominant player. Founded in 1948, the company has ballooned and now operates 729 stores.
But even the successful chain experienced softening sales, and has plans to up its in-store and online game in 2019, officials said in the company's latest earnings release.
Modell's, by comparison, has a much smaller footprint that is exclusive to the Northeast.
Urban strategy The chain has more than 30 stores in New Jersey, and nearly 70 locations across New York, with most concentrated in New York City. Modell's also has dozens of stores scattered throughout Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia.
The chain has concentrated its retail footprint largely in urban areas, in or near cities like Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Boston.
The retailer's strategy to concentrate on a specific market, experts say, is what may have kept it afloat while other sporting goods chains fell by the wayside.
"They've always been a wise retailer," said Chuck Lanyard, president of retail brokerage firm The Goldstein Group in Paramus. "Over 20 years ago, they began to focus on a lot of inner-city sporting supplies, because they really met the niche for that urban, inner-city sporting good store."
For instance, the chain has a prominent location inside Center City Mall in Paterson. Alma Realty, which owns the property, declined to comment about the store's lease.
Shutting some stores, especially in weak markets where sales may be lagging, is typical for a retailer, Lanyard said. Often, a retailer may shut stores in under-performing markets to concentrate on profitable locations or on other ways to make money, he said.
"Very often we see tenants do the right thing in trying to really reposition themselves," Lanyard said. "Retailers recognize that there's other ways of making money — including doing internet business, in exchange for less bricks and mortar."
Local footprints Earlier this year, a Modell's in the Arlington Shopping Plaza on Route 46 in Parsippany closed after the holiday season.
That Modell's is one of two big-box vacancies inside the shopping plaza. The shell of a former K-Mart sits at the opposite end of the plaza. The Bed, Bath & Beyond store that is in the center, anchored with a Home Depot, is expected to close by summer — when that store's lease expires.
Just this week, Union-based Bed, Bath & Beyond announced plans to shutter an estimated 40 stores to make way for 15 new locations.
Modell's also has a store in Paramus, which is considered by many the retail mecca of Bergen County.
Lanyard, who heads his firm's Paramus team, said the borough is usually a retailer's strongest market. That's why, should a retailer close or give up on a market as lucrative as Paramus, it can be an indicator that a company is headed on a downward spiral.
"The reality is when stores close in Paramus, it usually means [retailers are] giving up on some of their strongest markets, which means they probably won't last," Lanyard said.
The Modell's on Route 4 in the Paramus Place Shopping Center is small, and sits near a much-larger Kohl's department store. Officials from the center did not respond to questions about the Modell's location. However, the store displayed a "now hiring" sign on its front window this week.
It remains to be seen what Modell's future will be. However, Gavin, the managing director of the bankruptcy and restructuring consulting firm, said that when retailers seem to be heading toward bankruptcy, "they usually get there."
A shuttered Modell's Sporting Goods store in Parsippany is shown on March 7.

The Lakers' Magic Is Gone, in More Ways Than One

Texto completo: The city of Los Angeles has never belonged to the Clippers. You feel reasonably safe saying that it never will.
You can also credibly say that the gap between them and the storied Lakers has never looked smaller.
The Clippers on Monday night completed the greatest playoff comeback in N.B.A. history when they overturned a 31-point deficit in the second half to stun the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors. Heading into a free-agent summer in which the Clippers are widely expected to beat their more glamorous Staples Center co-tenants to a superstar's signature, L.A.'s long-mocked "other" team has a roster full of never-quit scrappers whom you can already crown this season's undisputed Play Hard champions.
The Lakers, meanwhile, are mere days removed from the most disappointing season in franchise history -- with little evidence to suggest that the team's primary owner, Jeanie Buss, is prepared to take the necessary steps to steer them back to a winning course.
It has not quite reached the point that the inhabitants of Lakerland are clamoring for the return of the beleaguered Jim Buss. The Lakers, after all, did manage to sign LeBron James within 18 months of Jeanie Buss pushing out her brother Jim as the team's top basketball decision maker and replacing him with Magic Johnson.
But Johnson's abrupt April 9 resignation left Buss with a mess -- and a clear task. After six straight seasons of losing, as James nears his 35th birthday in December, there is a justified clamor to break from the outdated Lakers tradition of restricting their outreach to job candidates with well-established ties to the franchise.
Perhaps that looms somewhere in yet-to-be-announced plans, but the signals so far point to Buss refusing to modernize the franchise and instead allowing Johnson's top aide, Rob Pelinka, to assume greater responsibility and run the team's basketball operations.
Which would be the worst mistake of her tenure.
Pelinka is already running the Lakers' search for a new coach. The opening was created when the under-fire Luke Walton surrendered the final two years of his contract after months of withering scrutiny and pressure, largely instigated by Johnson's well-chronicled criticism in November, in part because he knew he could walk straight into a better opportunity and more tangible support from the woebegone Sacramento Kings.
In numerous rival organizations, there is both shock and relief that the Lakers haven't responded to events of the past week-plus by chasing the likes of Golden State's Bob Myers, San Antonio's R. C. Buford and Oklahoma City's Sam Presti before they go looking for a new coach.
That is the blueprint Golden State followed to build a championship organization. The highly rated Myers and Rick Welts were hired to oversee basketball and business matters -- with Jerry West was brought in as a consultant. All of that happened before Steve Kerr became Golden State's coach.
Steve Ballmer, the Clippers' deep-pocketed owner, invoked similar thinking in his bid to build a brain trust to try to compete with the league's most feared franchise. Ballmer hired West away from the Warriors and imported Michael Winger, the well-regarded salary-cap specialist, to flank Lawrence Frank in a revamped front office after Coach Doc Rivers was stripped of personnel power.
The 76ers tried to stage their own such coup last summer after the Bryan Colangelo Twitter scandal. As The New York Times reported last July, Philadelphia made an ambitious attempt at hiring Daryl Morey away from Houston -- and I'm told Philly also commissioned a clandestine run at prying Myers away from the Warriors that was likewise rebuffed.
Yet another example: Just last week, amid the latest outbreak of Lakers chaos, New Orleans quietly gave itself a major credibility boost by persuading David Griffin, arguably the most accomplished executive without a job, to take on the challenge of rebuilding the Pelicans in the wake of Anthony Davis's trade demand in January.
The Lakers, like Philadelphia, could certainly be foiled if they pursued a superstar general manager. But why not try? The easiest marquee free agents to sign are general managers and coaches -- those whose salaries need not fit under the cap.
Industry estimates suggest Morey's recent contract extension from the Rockets pays him in the $8 million range annually. Johnson was earning an estimated $10 million as the Lakers' team president. Given the TV riches that the Lakers bring in, Buss could presumably double those figures in a pitch to any of the game's elite executives.
Buss's defenders may try to point out that the Lakers did follow an element of the Golden State model by hiring Pelinka, given his prior run as a successful player agent the way Myers was. But Myers has always been a popular figure in league circles who also spent a full season observing Golden State's operation before he was elevated to general manager. Maintaining strong relationships within his own organization and throughout the league is one of Myers's strengths.
Pelinka, to be blunt, is not Myers. He is Kobe Bryant's former agent, but also a polarizing figure whose time with the Lakers has spawned numerous recent reports about trust issues -- not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world, but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises. The perception persists that he ascended to power with the Lakers solely via Bryant's push.
The Lakers would argue that Pelinka has received an unfair share of criticism for his work. Yet a succession of questionable choices in roster construction, while they belong to Johnson as much as Pelinka, has only lowered Pelinka's approval rating further. Ditto for Jeanie Buss's, since she appears to be Pelinka's most ardent supporter.
The Lakers responded to Johnson's sudden exit by vowing to "work in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future." What that means so far is interviews for their coaching vacancy with Monty Williams, the in-demand assistant coach of the 76ers, and Tyronn Lue, the former Cleveland Cavaliers coach. The Miami Heat assistant Juwan Howard is another known candidate, but a buzz is already circulating in coaching circles that Williams has a stronger-than-expected shot at the job because some in the Lakers' organization may fear hiring Lue would be giving James too much control.
Buss couldn't have honored her father's keep-it-in-the-family philosophy any better than by giving Johnson first crack to lead the Lakers back to glory. History won't be kind to Johnson's tenure as team president or how it ended, on top of a failed 16-game stint as coach of the Lakers at the end of the 1993-94 season, but he will ultimately be forgiven for every stumble because he's Magic Johnson -- maybe the greatest winner this franchise has ever employed and certainly its most charismatic.
Buss, by contrast, won't receive anything close to the same luxury if she persists with the status quo and the Lakers continue to lag behind the norms of the 21st century N.B.A. Post-Magic, she will get one mulligan. Not two.
The Clippers will realistically never fully close the gap, but they're starting to get uncomfortably close. They just gave the Warriors an almighty scare in this first-round series with what they already have -- and they're routinely billed as the favorites to sign Kawhi Leonard in free agency in July.
The Lakers, as a result, need professional help as quickly as they can find it.
Going beyond the borders of yesteryear is the first place they should be looking.

A new category for Netflix, Brene Brown

Texto completo: NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Brene Brown's books on shame, vulnerability and courage have given her A-list fans like Oprah and Melinda Gates and made her a go-to leadership consultant for both Pixar and the Seattle Seahawks.

But Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston's Graduate College of Social Work, thought she'd spend her career writing for other academics, not making The New York Times' best-seller list.

"My goal was to put it in peer-reviewed articles that no one would read but, like, five people and they would just read it to check to make sure they were quoted," Brown told The Associated Press from her home in Houston.

Five best-selling books later, Brown debuted her first Netflix special Friday, "Brene Brown: The Call to Courage," based on her two decades of research. The special is a bit of an experiment for the streaming service, the categories of which Brown doesn't neatly fit into.

"Am I comedy? Documentary? True crime?" Brown joked.

Brown's skill as a writer and speaker is that she doesn't sound like a typical self-help or leadership expert who is shouting motivational mantras. She has a researcher's mind for patterns and a storyteller's gift of language. She peppers her talks with plenty of Texas colloquialisms, like "There's nothing in the middle of the road but white stripes and dead armadillos." She tells personal anecdotes about her kids and her husband to illustrate her broader ideas about parenting, compassion, leadership and more.

"People will come up to me and say, 'I already knew everything you said. I just didn't have the language to say it. I didn't know we were allowed to talk about it,"' said Brown. "And so I think I just put language around feelings and experiences and thoughts that we all have."

She can also curse like a true Southern lady, which is just enough to set people at ease and give them a laugh. "Not like Andrew Dice Clay," she said. "An appropriate amount of cursing."

In the special, she talks about her 2010 speech on vulnerability that has become one of the most watched TED Talk speeches, now viewed about 39 million times. Her most recent book, "Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts," is a playbook for leading with empathy.

When asked about leadership qualities she hopes to see among candidates for the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election, Brown took a long pause.

"I am one inch away from being completely disenchanted with politics but I'm holding on. I'm white-knuckling it right now," she said. "I need a political system where the people who make the decisions actually are required to live by them and are not in such an elite position where they make policy and laws and financial decisions that don't affect them."

The Netflix special is good timing for Brown, who has spent years traveling all over the country giving speeches to corporations, entrepreneurs, women's conferences and leadership training events.

Her youngest child is in middle school, and she's moving into a period of her career where she's doing less of those speaking opportunities in order to be at home. But with Netflix, she has a chance to continue building on the conversations she started with her books.

"This opportunity from Netflix just felt like such a deeply important gift," Brown said. "This thing is going to drop in 190 countries."

Texto completo: "I'm just passionate about basketball. I just always have been."
Tayna Alford
It doesn't surprise Tanya Alford that her husband, Steve, signed the longest contract ever given to a coach at the University of Nevada, Reno.
But the Nevada men's basketball coach contract for 10 years and $11.5 million is nothing compared to her 32 year marriage.
While Steve Alford may have been given the coaching job, Nevada's newest first lady of the men's basketball program is ready to become a part of the Wolf Pack brand.
Her predecessor Danyelle Musselman, married to now Arkansas coach Eric Musselman, was a visible face in the community. The former TV sports anchor often took to the microphone leading charity events.
Tanya Alford said she also plans to get involved in charities but, unlike Danyelle Musselman who appeared calm from across the court, she is likely to be screaming during games.
"I'll be the loudest person in the gym," said Tayna Alford, who sat in the front row during a press conference at Lawlor Events Center on April 12.
A net, a ring and a proposal at Indiana Tanya Alford has been her husband's cheerleader since the two started dating in high school.
They met in the fifth grade. Both students in New Castle, Indiana, the two went on to college together at Indiana.
She would rebound for him as he made practice shots.
At the end of their junior year in college, the two walked into the gym and the net was caught on the rim.
After Steve Alford carried the ladder and put it under the basket, she climbed up as she had done countless times to untangle the net.
But this time, Alford put an engagement ring on the back of the rim.
Tanya has been a force behind her husband's success, including winning an Olympic Gold medal in 1984 to an NCAA championship in 1987.
After four NBA seasons for Dallas and Golden State, the couple went on to coaching posts in Missouri, Iowa, New Mexico and Los Angeles.
The couple has three children, now all in their 20s. They include daughter Kayla and sons Bryce and Kory, who played for UCLA under their father.
In 2015 Tanya Alford told the New York Times, "Dealing with the ups and downs of this game is what we're used to because basketball is part of our family's DNA."
The story talked about how she mimicked her husband's calls and hand gestures during a UCLA game and was on the sidelines decked out in a Bruins gear and fingernails painted in school colors.
"I'm just passionate about basketball," she told the Reno Gazette Journal. "I just always have been."
"I'm just passionate about basketball. I just always have been."

Texto completo: Almost two years after the Mueller investigation began, the special counsel's findings, submitted last month, have become public. On Thursday, Attorney General William P. Barr released a redacted version of the more than 400-page report.
[ Read about the report delivered to Congress and the public. ]
We asked readers what they wanted to know about it and received nearly 900 questions. Our journalists in Washington who covered the investigation and what came after answered a selection.
______
The Report's Release
How much was redacted?
Rosalie Baine, Atlanta
As journalists, we would say too much was redacted. We naturally want the public to know everything. But the redactions generally hewed closely to what the Justice Department predicted. Grand jury material was excised, as was material related to a few ongoing matters.
We don't know what we aren't seeing, of course, but we didn't see an obvious effort to black out material that was damaging or embarrassing to the president.
-- Matt Apuzzo
Are redacted portions of a report like this ever open to the public? Is that going to be 100 years from now?
Stacie Scholz, Edmonds, Wash.
As far as we know, the redacted portions will never be open to the public. Congressional leaders should be able to see a less redacted version -- meaning everything except grand jury material -- but that is still not supposed to be made public.
-- Maggie Haberman
What about the summaries prepared by Mueller's team? Have they been released and are they redacted?
Mark Correll, Boulder, Colo.
Yes, executive summaries written by Mr. Mueller's team have been included in the report. The more than 400-page document is divided into two volumes, each of which begins with an introduction and executive summary of the contents. Several sentences in each summary have been redacted, in almost every case because of what Mr. Barr deemed would cause potential "harm to an ongoing matter." -- Nicholas Fandos
I'm curious to know what it took to make all the redactions in the report. Was it a team as big as the New York Times one reviewing the report?
Carl Williams, Newark, N.J.
We don't know the answer to that yet, and may not for a while.
-- Maggie Haberman
I'm having a hard time reconciling Barr's comments with the report's contents and obvious spinning in favor of Trump. Barr's behavior seems bizarre; how will this be reconciled? Congress makes the laws, not Barr. His comments seem in conflict with Mueller's report? Confused.
Monica Spencer, Vancouver, Wash.
In theory, the attorney general is subject to censure or impeachment by Congress. In reality, given the ideologically diverse Democratic majority in the House and the Republicans' control of the Senate, the chances of that happening are unlikely.
-- Maggie Haberman
I would like to know if the special counsel's team was asked, ordered or pressured to complete the investigation within a certain time frame. If they had more time, say, to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the president's testimony, would investigators have been better positioned to make a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction of justice?
Liz Mazucci, Hoboken, N.J.
We don't know of any directives that the Justice Department gave to the Mueller team about the timing of the investigation's completion. But as it pushed into 2019, the special counsel's investigation risked bumping into the start of the president's re-election campaign.
It's worth noting that there are other ongoing federal investigations; the Mueller report says the team made 14 criminal referrals, only two of which are known.
-- Maggie Haberman
______
Obstruction of Justice
Should Americans blame Mueller for his failure to make a concrete deduction on whether Trump obstructed justice? With no substantial deduction, the report will be open to various interpretations across the political divide for the rest of its life.
Musinguzi Blanshe, Kampala, Uganda
Some legal commentators are already making that case.
The result of Mr. Mueller's investigation was not a matter of evidence falling short of the high legal bar needed to indict. Rather, Mr. Mueller said that because the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has declared that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, it would be inappropriate for him to analyze his evidence, lest it "potentially result in a judgment that the president committed crimes." Yet Mr. Mueller also said that if he thought the evidence he gathered had exonerated Mr. Trump, he would have said so.
-- Charlie Savage
What was holding Mueller from the obstruction charge?
Kathryn O'Brien, West Newton, Mass.
Great question. Mr. Mueller made clear that Mr. Trump tried a number of tactics to influence or even sabotage the investigation. But this posed a dilemma because so much of what might be considered obstruction was tied up in Mr. Trump's authority as president, such as firing the F.B.I. director. That executive authority did not give Mr. Trump a free pass, Mr. Mueller said, but it made the prosecutorial calculation different from a typical charging decision.
-- Matt Apuzzo
What was the evidence apparently relied on by Barr and Rosenstein to conclude Trump did not obstruct?
Tom Blinkhorn, Hanover, N.H.
In the summary that Mr. Barr gave Congress a few weeks ago, he said he and Mr. Rosenstein determined there was no obstruction of justice because there was no evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russians. In other words, Mr. Barr said, there was no underlying crime to obstruct.
-- Maggie Haberman
Is Mueller not charging the president with obstruction of justice only because a sitting president cannot be charged, or because there isn't enough evidence? In other words, if this were a civilian being investigated, would they be in handcuffs at this point?
Joyce Harms, Port Washington, Wis.
Mr. Mueller said it would be inappropriate for him to decide whether Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice, because carrying out that analysis would create the risk of concluding that the president committed a crime. This would be a problem, Mr. Mueller concluded, because the Justice Department holds that the Constitution implicitly prevents sitting presidents from being indicted. He reasoned it would be unfair to accuse Mr. Trump of a crime if the president would have no immediate opportunity to clear his name in a trial.
Notably, however, Mr. Mueller said that if the facts he gathered exonerated Mr. Trump of obstruction, he would have said so.
-- Charlie Savage
Was there any explanation of the president's motives for his actions?
John Brooks, Dallas
The written answers that the president gave to the Mueller team on Nov. 20, 2018, which are appended to the report, address specific actions.
But more broadly, and particularly in the firing of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, the president's lawyers have said over the last two years that Mr. Trump's actions were among broad executive powers afforded to him under Article II of the Constitution.
His advisers have also said Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in reaction to investigations of issues related to his presidency since before it began, a sentiment that Mr. Barr echoed in his news briefing on Thursday.
-- Maggie Haberman
______
Trump and Russia
How does Mueller's team reason that the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and the Russian lawyer not constitute an attempted conspiracy, when the whole purpose was to discover dirt on Hillary Clinton?
Danny Weisbaum, Cologne, Germany
This meeting was set up so a Russian lawyer could give politically damaging information about Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign. Prosecutors analyzed it as a possible violation of federal campaign laws. But Mr. Mueller said he could not prove the campaign officials "knowingly and willfully" intended to commit a crime.
It's also worth noting that investigators found no evidence linking the meeting to the hacking or the release of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Mr. Trump denied knowing about this meeting, and investigators uncovered no evidence that he did.
-- Matt Apuzzo
Will collusion with WikiLeaks continue to be investigated? If the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks knew the information was illegally obtained, isn't it criminal to disseminate that information?
Claire O'Neill, Shrewsbury, Mass.
A fair amount of material about WikiLeaks is redacted, likely because it is related to the ongoing case against Roger Stone, a former adviser to Mr. Trump. So we don't know if Mr. Mueller found evidence of the Trump campaign coordinating with WikiLeaks.
But Mr. Barr said on Thursday that any such coordination could not amount to a criminal conspiracy because WikiLeaks' publication of the stolen material was not a crime unless the group helped Russia steal it.
-- Matt Apuzzo
______
Other Investigations
How much of what was sent to other jurisdictions by Mueller was not included in this report?
Jon Gelberg, North Caldwell, N.J.
Mr. Mueller referred 14 cases to other prosecutors to investigate. We already know about the prosecutions of Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer and fixer, and Gregory B. Craig, who was the White House counsel under President Barack Obama and is charged with lying in a lobbying investigation that grew out of the special counsel inquiry.
The remaining 12 cases are still secret. Details of those cases were redacted but were not given much real estate in the report. We will probably see more charges trickle out over time, but Mr. Mueller said he only referred cases that were unrelated to the key issues in this investigation: Russian interference, the 2016 campaign and obstruction of justice.
-- Matt Apuzzo
Since Barr rejects the idea of pursuing an obstruction-of-justice charge against President Trump, can a different prosecutor (perhaps at the state level) elect to file those charges? Does Barr get the final say?
Mohit Sethi, Ottawa
For now, yes, Mr. Barr has the final say on whether to bring federal charges against Mr. Trump. But Mr. Mueller's rationale for not pursuing obstruction charges leaves the door open to the possibility that after the president leaves office, prosecutors could re-examine the evidence that the special counsel gathered and charge Mr. Trump.
-- Charlie Savage and Michael S. Schmidt
What follows if congressional Democrats decide that Trump's conduct constitutes obstruction, contradicting Barr's conclusion?
Ahir Verma, Green Brook, N.J.
Democrats who control the House are preparing to treat Mr. Mueller's report as a de facto referral for Congress to issue a judgment about the extent, if any, the president and his associates should be held accountable. The House is already investigating whether the president obstructed justice or abused his power. For now, Mr. Mueller's findings will be included in that investigation. But Democrats who have the power to impeach Mr. Trump will soon face a decision about whether there is political support to do so, and put the president on trial in the Republican-controlled Senate.
-- Nicholas Fandos
______
What Comes Next
What does this bode for Trump? What happens next?
Sarah Chan, Singapore
Congress will continue its investigations, and there will be efforts by the Democrat-controlled House to obtain an unredacted version of Mr. Mueller's report. There are also separate but ongoing federal investigations related to, or stemming from, Mr. Mueller's inquiry.
The president's advisers have acknowledged privately that earlier reporting on revelations that were considered potential acts of obstruction of justice helped desensitize people before the report's publication. The advisers believe that helped Mr. Trump.
-- Maggie Haberman
Will the Democrats in Congress get an unredacted version of the report?
Caroline Petti, Washington
We don't know yet. In the near term, Democrat and Republican lawmakers are likely to have private access to a fuller version of the report that includes classified information and material that could harm an ongoing investigation -- content that was blacked out in the public document.
But lawmakers will likely face a fight, and potentially a long one, to view secretive grand jury material that was collected by investigators and included in the report. It is generally illegal to release grand jury information, and to do so for Congress would almost certainly require court approval.
-- Nicholas Fandos
What is the likelihood that Mueller will testify in open session before Congress? And if he does, will he have to steer clear of issues that Barr redacted?
Skip Heaps, Atlanta
A high-stakes, nationally televised hearing with Mr. Mueller appears increasingly likely. Two Democrats who chair House committees on Thursday invited the special counsel to testify, and Mr. Barr, who has a say over whether or not Mr. Mueller can accept, indicated that he would not stand in the way. How expansive Mr. Mueller is willing to be -- or is allowed to be beyond the details of his report -- remains to be seen.
-- Nicholas Fandos
Though not technically "criminal," isn't this activity -- the threats, the firing, the WikiLeaks collusion, the half-billion-dollar Trump Tower Moscow denials during the campaign -- impeachable? Isn't that the real intent of Mueller's position -- that a sitting president cannot be indicted anyway, so it all comes down to impeachment?
Randall Walker, Rochester, Minn.
While it's the Justice Department's policy that presidents can't be indicted, Mr. Mueller would almost surely dispute the notion that he is simply handing an impeachment road map to Congress. Mr. Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian interference and possible coordination with the Trump campaign. Many Russians and campaign officials have been charged.
Impeachment is a political issue, though. Having covered Mr. Mueller as F.B.I. director, I am pretty confident he would say that he did his job and will leave the political questions to the politicians.
-- Matt Apuzzo
______
Media Coverage
It would be interesting to know how many New York Times staff members have been dedicated to reading through the 400+ pages.
Steve Kay, Ohio
We had at least a dozen people dedicated to reading through the report for our stories and briefing. I'm confident the number was even larger than that throughout the day.
-- Maggie Haberman
Is there anything in this report that wasn't already known or reported by the press?
Susan Jonas, Wilmington, Del.
There is a fair amount of new information, particularly details of what Mr. Mueller learned during the course of the probe into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice.
-- Maggie Haberman

Texto completo: MARATHON - Friends, family members and colleagues are remembering science educator Don Lutz as the developer of the Christa McAuliffe Nature Center in Marathon, a teacher's teacher and a lifelong learner himself.
Lutz, a Stevens Point native and 1970 graduate of Pacelli Catholic High School, died April 9 at a hospital in Fort Myers, Florida, as a result of a head injury he sustained in a fall a few days earlier. He was 68.
For most of his career, Lutz was a science teacher for the Marathon Middle School, now the Marathon Venture Academy.
In the late 1980s, when the building for the middle and elementary school was being planned and built, Lutz saw the potential for an undeveloped area on the southern part of the property as an outdoor classroom and nature center.
"I thought for kids nowadays, with all the problems with the environment, that they need to know how a community works," Lutz told the Wausau Daily Herald in 2015 when the center marked its 25th anniversary. "And this pond is a community of animals and plants and populations of different things. So it makes it real easy to adapt that thought to what's happening in the real world."
Money, as it always is for schools, was tight, and there was no budget for the outside learning center. So Lutz took it upon himself to find grant money to pay for its initial development, and secured funding from a foundation named after Christa McAuliffe, a teacher who was one of seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986.
But no matter where he was, Lutz simply loved teaching. He was known for starting his classes each day with a joke, usually science related and usually corny. He was president of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers, and he reveled in attending conferences where he could learn how to be a better teacher, but also mentor others who shared his passion.
David Ley, a veteran science teacher for Mosinee High School, met Lutz at such a workshop offered by the Wisconsin Academy Staff Development Initiative. Lutz was the oldest teacher in the group, Ley said, but he brought energy and enthusiasm to the training.
"Don could be a very serious professional, but he was always laughing about something. He always had a joke," Ley said. "He was a lover of the environment and for teaching kids. That was catching, inspiring. ... I think one of the themes of Don's life was that Don didn't just teach a classroom full of kids. He influenced so many educators around the whole state."
In the summers, Lutz led Marathon School District's summer program, teaching courses such as environmental education, rocketry and outdoor skills. Even after he retired as a classroom teacher in 2007, he continued those efforts.
Jenny Baeseman is a 1994 graduate of Marathon High School and a top-level scientist and researcher. Now a consultant, she was the executive director of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, an organization that helps coordinate scientific efforts in Antarctica. She didn't have Lutz as a classroom teacher, but she learned from him in summer programs.
"I remember trying to learn how to read a compass from Mr. Lutz, but for the life of me I couldn't figure it out," Baeseman said in a Facebook message. "I still think of him when I try to use a compass."
Baeseman said Lutz helped inspire "so many people to go into science as a career. But more importantly, he made science fun, which made students learn whether they 'liked science' or not."
Lutz also was an athlete. As a youth, he was on the junior Olympic team for ski jumping, and was also a marathoner, a triathlete and cross-country skier. Joint problems forced him to give up running as he got older, but he still loved walking with his two dogs, Buddy and Charlie, said his wife, Alvie Lutz. The couple had no children.
In recent years, the couple spent most of their winters in Florida, Alvie Lutz wrote in an email message about her husband.
Even though he was retired, he never gave up teaching. He was a substitute teacher for several districts in central Wisconsin, and was thinking about becoming one in Florida.
Nor did he ever stop learning.
"When he was in Florida, he would walk every day to the Fort Myers library and read the complete New York Times," said Dennis DeNuccio, who was a friend of Lutz's since they went to high school together. "And he always has some books piled up on his nightstand. ... I think he just liked to learn."

Texto completo: Chef Anthony Bucco, who four months ago opened the much-ballyhooed contemporary Italian restaurant Felina in Ridgewood, does not lack confidence. The convivial, fast-talking chef ("I have a lot of energy," he explains) has reason to be self-assured.
He worked for James Beard Award-winning chef Jonathan Waxman. He received four-star reviews for his work at the cherished Stage Left in New Brunswick, the beloved Uproot in Warren, the celebrated Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station and the acclaimed Restaurant Latour in Hamburg. In fact, he helped reopen the Ryland Inn — and was rewarded with the first four-star review from New Jersey Monthly in a decade. He has received an Excellent from the New York Times and AAA's esteemed Four Diamond Award.
Impressive. So why does his food at Felina lack the certitude he seems to have in spades?
The chef's admittedly endearing self-assurance isn't missing from the look-at-me decor of the 120-seat restaurant, formerly an old bank building that last housed the restaurant Fish. It's striking, with multi-leveled glowing orbs, a big oval bar, a spacious airy dining room, a sizable open kitchen, an eight-seat chef's counter, lovely reclaimed wood floors and a formidable vaulted ceiling. The best part perhaps: a semi-private dining area contained inside the beautifully polished bank vault with hundreds of gleaming safety deposit boxes. And, not to be missed, a rooftop bar — Ridgewood's first.
If only the food and drinks were consistently as impressive and bold.
While the chef's culinary mastery is made obvious in some dishes, most noticeably in a perfectly cooked octopus that had me dreaming for days and a delectable pasta primi called paprika creste de gallo, too many dishes lacked oomph. It was as if Bucco, talented, skilled and confident, suddenly was afflicted with a rather serious bout of cooking timidity.
Take the fluke crudo ($16), a gorgeous appetizer that could easily pass for a main course because the portion size is quite generous. There's much to like about this refreshing raw fish dish: fabulously crunchy little tempura bits, splendid black olive caramel and lovely lavender-hued sliced radishes. If only Bucco had added a touch more salt, a bit of citrus, or a soupçon of olive oil, it would have been a winner.
The roasted beets appetizer ($15), too, lacked zest. The plating was lovely and the multi-colored beets were well cooked and appropriately sweet, but the dish fell flat. I would have loved more dressing. High marks, though, for the delightfully crispy cracker served with it.
Both the rigatoni rosemary ($25) and the paprika creste de gallo ($26) were delicious, if not quite home-runs. The garlic-infused sauce that laced the rooster's crest-shaped pasta was heady, though I'm not sure the nuggets of pork sausage added much, and the hint of earthy rosemary in the rigatoni was lovely, though there was no hint of guanciale that the menu promised.
The least successful dish was the Glenwood Mountain pork ($35), a thick boneless chop that was overcooked and served with overworked polenta. And while the chop and polenta were accompanied by a nicely charred and tasty roasted cabbage, none of the elements brought color to the plate, making for a monochromatic and dull presentation.
The plating for the braised short ribs ($35) was lovely. And no complaints with the just-barely-cooked, slightly-crunchy celery root that accompanied them, nor the pickled celery. The ribs were perfectly cooked — nice and fork-tender — but as with other dishes, they lacked brio. How I longed for a more flavorful braise.
As for drinks? Beverage director Christopher James, 2013's Iron Shaker winner — Iron Shaker is N.J.'s statewide competition for the best bartender — offers a slew of cocktails, with playful names such as The Bitter Flamingo, Heavy Metal and Style Collision. I asked James to choose one of his special cocktails for me, letting him know that my drink of choice is a Negroni and that I don't like sweet cocktails. He served me a mezcal drink called Low Hanging Fruit. It was ... sweet. On another night, I asked for a Negroni; it was superb.
Superb, too, is the homemade focaccia — thick, rustic, and heavily sprinkled with coarse sea salt — that chef de cuisine Martina Krowicka, a Food Network "Chopped" winner and a former chef at Latour, baked. Krowicka offers five desserts, among them a Nutella budino ($12). The three-layer concoction of Nutella custard, cinnamon streusel and salted caramel isn't showy — no daring threads of caramel, no wine gelée, no towering constructions -- just a gratifying honest treat that feels grown up and fun.
Speaking of fun: Felina has brought excitement and vigor to the dining landscape in Ridgewood — make that North Jersey. Most every night, the place is filled with diners thrilled to be in a sexy new spot with an award-winning chef and team. And Bucco and his business partners are planning more Felinas; they are seriously looking at a spot in downtown Newark.
When they get more of the chef's spirit into his dishes, this Felina, and any future siblings, should make for a superb night out.

Heisler: Lakers sticking with family, but Kobe Bryant won’t be riding to the rescue

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

ZOOM, PINTEREST DEBUTS BOOST TECH IPO BOOM

Texto completo: In a year of rebound for tech public offerings, Pinterest and Zoom Video Communications on Thursday became the latest Bay Area companies to join the IPO caravan and each got off to a smashing start.
Both companies' public debuts showed the continuing enthusiasm for tech on Wall Street, which has been waiting for several so-called "unicorns" private companies with valuations of at least $1 billion to hit the trading block. Ride-hailing company Lyft went public just two weeks ago, and its shares have stumbled since its debut, creating some anxiety about what Thursday's results would show.
Not to worry, at least not yet: Pinterest, the image-sharing and information company that allows users to "pin" images and links of things they find and like online, saw its shares climb more than 28 percent to end the day at $24.40 after setting its initial public offering price at $19 a share. With its IPO off and running and with 75 million shares on the market the San Francisco-based company raised $1.43 billion, and its valuation rose to more than $12 billion.
Clement Thibault, senior analyst at Investing.com, said he was skeptical about Pinterest's growth prospects in the United States. However, he said there is one quality it does have in its favor as a newly public company.
"Pinterest is on its way to profitability," he said. "(That is) something we can't say about many big IPOs. So it's definitely got some good things going for it, and it could be a buy when the IPO craze runs its course."
Pinterest also holds the distinction of being one of the last, if not the last, of what might be considered the old guard of social media-based companies to come out from shadow of privacy and into the public light. The 10-year-old company has finally gone public years after the likes of Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
With approximately 250 million monthly active users, Pinterest has sold itself as a site of positive social interaction. According to The New York Times, which cited Pinterest's IPO prospectus, the company's philosophy has been on "personal growth and planning, rather than on comments and interactions with others." And while not mentioning any other social media companies by name, Pinterest said its focus has helped it "sidestep the bullying, toxic behavior and disinformation that have plagued other social platforms in recent years."
But when it came to share-price performance, Pinterest looked almost pedestrian compared to San Jose-based Zoom.
The cloud-based conferencing technology company's shares surged more than 72 percent, to close at $62 each. Zoom initially priced 20.9 million shares of its stock at $36 a piece Wednesday night. The reaction gave Zoom a valuation of $15.9 billion, which blew past the $1 billion the company was valued at in 2017 when it last took in private financing.
Zoom CFO Kelly Steckelberg, speaking from the Nasdaq Market Site, called the day a "milestone for the company."
"We'd been working toward this for a while," she said. "Our financial results were good. There was a lot of demand and interest during our investor roadshow. The market conditions were great, and everything kind of just all came together."
Lyft kicked off the latest round of IPO mania when, on March 29, the ride-hailing company went public at a price of $72 a share, then rose almost 9 percent to end its first day as public company at $78.29. However, Lyft has since seen investors' interest fade; the company's shares closed Thursday at $58.36.
Anticipation is expected to continue to grow in advance of Uber's upcoming IPO, which is set to take place next month. That public offering is expected to dwarf all others this year, and it could set ride-hailing giant Uber up with a valuation of $100 billion, making it one of the biggest IPOs of all time.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election identified 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. Mueller said in his report that he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed a crime or that he hadn’t. The following are the 10 instances.
Pressure on Comey
to end Flynn probe
This includes the president’s statement to then-FBI Director James Comey regarding the investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump told Comey: “I hope you can see your way to letting this go.”
President’s reaction
to continuing probe
Among the evidence is the president telling then-White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the Russia investigation and Trump’s subsequent anger at Sessions. Trump also contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders to ask them to push back publicly on the suggestion that Trump had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.
Firing of Comey
and aftermath
Mueller’s report says “substantial evidence” indicates Trump’s decision to fire Comey in May 2017 was the result of the FBI director’s unwillingness to say publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation. On the day after Trump fired Comey, the president told Russian officials that he had “faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.”
Appointment of special counsel, removal efforts
Trump reacted to news of Mueller’s appointment by telling advisers it was “the end of his presidency.” The president told aides Mueller had conflicts of interest and should have to step aside. His aides told Trump the asserted conflicts were meritless. Following media reports that Mueller’s team was investigating whether the president had obstructed justice, Trump called then-White House counsel Don McGahn at home and directed him to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused.
Further efforts
to curtail probe
Trump instructed former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to have Sessions publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was “very unfair” to the president, the president had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with Mueller to limit him to “investigating election meddling for future elections.”
Efforts to prevent
public disclosure
In summer of 2017, Trump learned the news media planned to report on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and Russians offering derogatory information about Hillary Clinton. The president directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the meeting. Before the emails became public, the president also edited a press statement for Donald Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was “with an individual who (Trump Jr.) was told might have information helpful to the campaign.”
Efforts to have
Sessions take control
At several points in between July 2017 and December 2017, Trump tried to get Sessions to declare he was no longer recused from the Russia investigation and would assert control over it. The report says there’s evidence that one purpose of asking Sessions to step in was so that the attorney general would restrict the investigation’s scope.
Trump orders McGahn to deny firing attempt
In an Oval Office meeting in February 2018, Trump told McGahn to “correct” a New York Times story that reported Trump had earlier instructed McGahn to fire Mueller. Trump also asked why McGahn had told Mueller’s investigators about the directive to remove Mueller. McGahn told Trump he had to tell the investigators the truth.
Trump’s actions toward Flynn, Manafort
Mueller looked at whether Trump’s sympathetic messages to Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and others were intended to limit their cooperation with Mueller’s investigation.
Trump actions
toward Cohen
Mueller noted that Trump’s conduct toward Cohen, a former Trump Organization executive, changed from praise to castigation after Cohen began cooperating with prosecutors. The evidence could “support an inference that the president used inducements in the form of positive messages in an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter” cooperation and undermine Cohen’s credibility, Mueller wrote.

Texto completo: The National Enquirer is being sold to James Cohen, an heir to the Hudson News newsstand chain.
American Media Inc. is selling the Enquirer and other tabloids to Cohen, who is part of the family that founded Hudson News Distributors, the leading magazine distributor on the East Coast, according to the Associated Press.
The sale is expected to reduce AMI's debt to $355 million, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the New York company's finances. The Post, which first reported on the sale, said Cohen was paying $100 million for the Enquirer.

Cohen and AMI Chairman David Pecker are longtime business friends.
Representatives of AMI and Hudson Media did not respond to requests for comment.
This month, AMI -- owner of the Enquirer, the Globe and National Examiner -- said its board had concluded a strategic operational review of its tabloid business, which began in August, leading to the decision to explore strategic options for the brands.
The move will "likely result in their sale in the near future," the company said in a release.
Among the potential bidders was supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle, who controls Yucaipa Cos. in Los Angeles, according to the New York Times.
A spokesman for Burkle denied he was buying the Enquirer.
In February, The Times reported that CalPERS, California's massive pension fund, was a major investor in the National Enquirer. Meghan White, a CalPERS spokeswoman, declined to comment other than to say that it is "still working to exit" the Chatham Eureka Fund, through which CalPERS owned as much as one-third of AMI.
It's unclear whether the Chatham Eureka Fund, managed by the New Jersey hedge fund Chatham Asset Management, still has a stake in AMI or if CalPERS remains one of AMI's largest indirect investors.
The tabloid has drawn the growing scrutiny of federal prosecutors for its ties to President Trump during the 2016 campaign.
AMI's decision to sell comes on the heels of the Jeff Bezos scandal in which the Amazon founder accused the Enquirer of extortion using leaked text messages and nude photos that the publication had obtained.
Bezos said the Enquirer was threatening him after he attempted to investigate the publication over its earlier articles about his extramarital affair with TV host Lauren Sanchez.
Though the Enquirer has long had a reputation for using questionable tactics to score celebrity scoops, the Bezos scandal put a new spotlight on Pecker, a former accountant who took over the company in 1999.
Pecker has been a longtime friend of Trump and has admitted employing catch-and-kill techniques to protect Trump from unfavorable stories.
American Media paid $150,000 to buy a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump.

'Mueller report absolutely does not clear the president': Opinionline

Texto completo: Los Angeles Times, in an editorial: "It’s true that the special counsel didn’t establish that Trump’s campaign criminally cooperated with Russia in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign. Instead, the report provides evidence that a Russian organization with ties to the Kremlin tirelessly promoted Trump and bashed Hillary Clinton on social media with the (evidently) unwitting aid of Trump campaign officials and Trump himself. It also notes several overtures by Russians to supply stolen emails and other “dirt” to the Trump campaign, drawing interest rather than alarm from campaign officials. But the report absolutely does not clear the president of the more serious accusation that he tried to obstruct justice through a variety of efforts to abort or interfere with the Russia investigation. "
James Robbins, USA TODAY: "The Mueller report and other investigations into Russian meddling show that Moscow remains committed to using every means at its disposal to sow discord in American politics. These efforts continued into the 2018 midterm elections, and we can assume that there will be a prominent effort to generate chaos during the 2020 election cycle. . . . Russian political warfare seeks not so much to rig individual elections as to achieve lasting and destabilizing psychological effects. Russia sought not to determine the outcome of the 2016 race, but to make Americans question the legitimacy of our system of government. The growing chaos in the political sphere shows that this psychological effect has taken hold with a vengeance. "
Harry Litman, Washington Post: "The most important day concerning the 22-month inquiry by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III quickly became deeply unsettling Thursday, laying bare grave failures by nearly all of the institutions and officials to which the country has been looking for answers to public questions of surpassing importance. First and most obviously: Attorney General William P. Barr, who presented a plainly slanted prebuttal of the Mueller report and stood up for the president’s conduct, and did so with a pugilistic swagger that almost dared opponents to take issue with him. "
Chris Truax, USA TODAY: "Whether Trump committed an actual federal crime does not completely answer the question we must decide. As the report points out, ultimately, it is up to Congress to sanction a sitting president and that determination is more than just a question of whether the president is an actual felon. For example, one of the reasons Barr believes the president did not commit obstruction is that the president’s efforts to interfere with the investigation were not motivated by 'corrupt intent. ' Rather, he said, Trump was personally upset and believed the investigation was “undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks. ” Assuming that is so and that interfering with an investigation for political reasons doesn’t qualify as corrupt intent — a big assumption — that still does not necessarily absolve the president. "
Noah Bookbinder, New York Times: "Crucially, the report explicitly rejects many of the most prominent defenses of the president that have been articulated by the president’s lawyers and Attorney General Barr. First, the special counsel rejects the notion that the Constitution forecloses scrutiny of a president’s use of his own constitutional powers to impede investigations. Instead, it says, 'The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law. ' Second, obstruction of justice cases do not require that the most prominent underlying crime being investigated — in this case conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia — be proven. To the contrary, the report states that 'obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect noncriminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal conduct falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. ' As the report repeatedly details, the motivation behind Mr. Trump’s obstructive conduct seems most likely to have fallen into one of these categories. "
Jason Sattler, USA TODAY: "The Republican Party and Barr have made their decision — to let Democrats carry this burden alone. They know the responsibility to impeach a president will be a distraction for a party that just took over the House by campaigning on issues voters care about, like health care and corporate tax cuts. But with an attorney general willing to do almost anything to protect this president, the question isn't 'What's politically advantageous?' It's what will be left of our democracy if Congress doesn’t do its job. "
Ramesh Ponnuru, Bloomberg: "The report is also an episodic portrait of the administration, and what it shows is a president who is untrustworthy, who has untrustworthy advisers, and whose advisers do not respect him. Mueller has not destroyed Trump’s presidency, as Trump feared. But he has shone a light on what’s weakening it. "
Scott Jennings, USA TODAY: "Democrats have two options — impeach the president or win an election. With their hopes dashed that Mueller would kick in the White House door and frog march the president to jail, Democratic remedies for getting rid of Trump are purely political: impeach the president for obstruction of justice, or work as hard as possible to win the next election. The House Democratic leadership was having trouble tamping down impeachment talk before, and it won’t get any easier now given the relentless focus on the obstruction section of the report. The bloodthirsty among them will grow even thirstier and calls for impeachment are likely to increase. Can Speaker Nancy Pelosi stop them? I have my doubts that she can herd her impeachment cats away from their hyper-partisan impulses. "

Teens broadcast college acceptance - and rejection Videos offer viewers a different reality from rich 'influencers'

Texto completo: Justin Chae woke up from a nap 10 minutes after Stanford University let early-action applicants for the freshman class of 2023 know whether they'd been admitted. With his camera perched next to him, Chae opened up his laptop.
"You know what they say," Chae said to the camera. "Hope for the best, expect the worst. So, let's see how this goes."
It was December. Chae, who is 17, is a senior in high school in Dallas. He was one of the millions of kids who refresh their inboxes every spring in anticipation of a fateful letter from colleges admissions officers. It's usually a moment of private drama for students, their families and friends, but Chae planned to share his with the world by filming his reaction to the decisions from the five colleges he'd applied to attend. Then he would post the recordings to YouTube.
Stanford was the first. Still sitting on his bed, Chae clicked the "status update" on his Stanford account. A letter popped up on the screen. For a second, Chae said nothing.
"OK, so, rejected from Stanford," he said finally. "Um, that was expected. Yeah. OK."
He would have to wait until March to hear from the others. When it was all over, he would edit the videos together and post all of his reactions as a kind of highlight reel - or maybe lowlight reel.
Social media is filled with content that celebrates (and sells) the college experience, from dorm room tours to "day in the life" videos to productivity tips. Rich influencers like Olivia Jade Giannulli - whose famous parents, actress Lori Loughlin and designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from a college admissions bribery scam this week - branded themselves as relatable college students, albeit ones with millions of followers and dorm rooms paid for by Amazon.
Reaction videos from non-celebrities, like Chae, offer a different kind of relatability. Some of the viewers are high school juniors and sophomores who are beginning the long process of applying to college themselves. For that audience, the videos aren't just good content, they're glimpses into the future.
That's how it was for Chae, who watched a few reaction videos before he started applying to colleges. "It's almost infectious seeing people freak out when they get accepted and you can't help but smile and be happy for them," he said in an email to The Washington Post.
But the rejections were valuable, too. They helped motivate him to submit long-shot applications to some of the top schools in the country, Chae says. "I realized that even if I also got rejected, it wouldn't be the end of the world and I would end up in the right place in the end."
He had to live with the Stanford rejection all winter. Finally, an email came from the University of Texas at Austin. Chae pointed his camera at his laptop and clicked on the link. The glare from the screen makes it hard to see the text, but his whoop makes it clear. "Let's go!" he says, grinning and pumping his fist. Then University of Southern California posted a rejection. The Ivy League schools were next. Yale? Rejected. Columbia? Rejected. Finally, he clicked a link from Princeton that left him speechless.
"CONGRATULATIONS!" it began. Chae held his hand to his mouth, which was agape, and looked directly at the camera with an expression of pure joy.
His video currently has more than 300,000 views.
Not all popular college reaction videos end with a dream coming true. A disturbingly world-weary high school senior filmed himself opening up all his college decisions at once. The first is Amherst. He looks at the screen, smiles and claps once. "Fantastic," he says. "So I got rejected from Amherst. Next college. Next college!" The rest of the video is much the same as the student casually leafs from one rejection to the next. (He does get into Carleton College and the University of California at Los Angeles.)
The authenticity of the college reaction genre is, like anything viral, primed for possible exploitation. A series of reaction videos from TM Landry, a prep school in Louisiana, attracted millions of views from those who were inspired by the nearly identical footage of students sitting at a laptop, surrounded by their classmates, finding out that they'd been accepted to some of the top schools in the nation. But the school is now the subject of a Louisiana state police investigation, after the New York Times reported allegations that the school helped students win acceptance to those colleges with "falsified transcripts, made up student accomplishments" and other misdeeds that "mined the worst stereotypes of black America to manufacture up-from-hardship tales that it sold to Ivy League schools hungry for diversity."
But most reaction videos appear to be amateur productions without any shady underpinnings. For Nina Wang, an 18-year-old senior from Massachusetts, the decision to document the big moment almost made itself. "I decided to film my own," she wrote in an email, "simply because I watched so many others (like, so so so many)."
Now, so so so many people have watched her video, which has hundreds of thousands of views.

Dems gear up; Could demand uncensored Mueller report

Resumen: House Democrats distrustful of Attorney General William Barr are prepared to subpoena Robert Mueller's full Russia probe report immediately after the Justice Department releases a redacted version Thursday morning, the Daily News has learned. A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss internal talks, told The News that Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) is ready to lob subpoenas for the complete special counsel report and all underlying evidence as soon as Barr drops the scrubbed document. Democrats have been openly skeptical of Barr's interpretation of Mueller's findings and were outraged after he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said he believed the Obama Justice Department was "spying" on Trump's campaign - a claim that echoes debunked right-wing conspiracy theories.

Texto completo: House Democrats distrustful of Attorney General William Barr are prepared to subpoena Robert Mueller's full Russia probe report immediately after the Justice Department releases a redacted version Thursday morning, the Daily News has learned.
A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss internal talks, told The News that Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) is ready to lob subpoenas for the complete special counsel report and all underlying evidence as soon as Barr drops the scrubbed document.
The report will be turned over to members of Congress on CDs at some point between 11 a.m. and noon Thursday - after Barr's planned 9:30 a.m. press conference at Justice Department headquarters.
Democrats were outraged at the prospect of Barr's pre-release conference and demanded he cancel it.
"This press conference, which apparently will not include special counsel Mueller, is unnecessary and inappropriate, and appears designed to shape public perceptions of the report before anyone can read it," the Democratic chairs of the House judiciary, intelligence, oversight, financial services and foreign affairs committees said in a joint statement.
"These new actions by the Attorney General reinforce our concern that he is acting to protect President Trump."
The Democratic pushback came after The New York Times reported the Justice Department has been briefing the White House on Mueller's complete findings over the past few days, allowing Trump to get a heads-up while leaving Congress in the dark.
"There is no legitimate reason for the department to brief the White House prior to providing Congress a copy of the report," the Democratic chairs said.
Nadler, who has refrained from issuing subpoenas while waiting to see what Barr will release, said last week he was ready to "very quickly" fire off the powerful document demands. The judiciary committee voted on party lines earlier this month to approve subpoenas for the Mueller report, leaving the timing up to Nadler.
Democrats say they won't accept anything short of the full report and suspect Barr is trying to protect Trump by redacting Mueller's findings.
Barr has given mixed messages on whether he's ready to ever share Mueller's unvarnished report with Congress.
He told lawmakers he's willing discuss how to make more material accessible to certain congressional committees after the redacted version comes out but has not made any commitments.
The attorney general has also rejected multiple bipartisan requests for the full report over the past few weeks, arguing redactions are necessary to comply with national security and privacy protocols.
If Barr refuses to comply with Democratic subpoenas, the fate of the full Mueller report is expected to be decided by federal courts.
The report out Thursday will be scrubbed of any information pertaining to classified national security matters, grand jury proceedings, ongoing criminal investigations and derogatory details about people who weren't charged in the investigation.
Barr has said Mueller's report exonerates Trump and his campaign of conspiring in Russia's illegal attempt to sway the 2016 election in his favor. Even though Mueller explicitly declined to do so, Barr also concluded the special counsel's evidence did not warrant obstruction charges against the president.
Democrats have been openly skeptical of Barr's interpretation of Mueller's findings and were outraged after he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said he believed the Obama Justice Department was "spying" on Trump's campaign - a claim that echoes debunked right-wing conspiracy theories. Barr did not share any evidence to back up the explosive statement.

Shaken? Stirred? That's Just the Patrons

Texto completo: The martini is a simple cocktail achieved by complex means. Choices along the way include gin or vodka, shaken or stirred, olive or twist, bitters or no, wet or dry.
At Abigail Hall, a new restaurant in Portland, Ore., the order is accomplished in only two steps: Grab bottle of martinis from the freezer. Pour into glass. Done.
The pursuit of greater efficiency has led to many innovations at craft cocktail bars, from draft cocktails to bottled individual drinks. Now the premixed freezer cocktail is gathering traction.
Daniel Osborne, the bar manager at Abigail Hall, is ready for any martini and manhattan order before it is even uttered. Hours in advance, he combines the ingredients for a large batch of each drink. He then dilutes the mixtures, mimicking the effect of melting ice that comes from stirring a cocktail. Finally, he stores the premade drinks in the freezer. This eliminates the traditional à la minute labors of the bartender. (There is a possibility the mixture may partly freeze, owing to the presence of the water -- something a quick shake of the bottle can solve.)
Nearly all the drinks on the new "Martini Hour" menu at Dante, in Greenwich Village, are mixed, diluted and chilled in advance. So are the Telegraph, a martini-like drink at Death & Co. Denver; the house martini at the Brooklyn restaurant Sauvage; the Diamond Eye, a highball at Lost Hours, a new bar inside the Hotel 32/32 in Midtown Manhattan; and the Café Disco, a variation on the old-fashioned at Mister Paradise, a new bar in the East Village. Ludlow Liquors, a Chicago bar, offers several prefabricated cocktails in one, two and three-ounce pours.
Fans of this approach say it both saves time and yields a better drink, particularly a martini. "I think having a martini very cold does make it better," Mr. Osborne said. "Most martinis you get are kind of warm. Dilution and chill are main ingredients."
Detractors say the practice robs them of another ingredient they expect for their money: service. When The New York Times reported in 2017 that the bar at the Grill, a restaurant in the former Four Seasons space, would be mixing, diluting and chilling its martinis in advance, a Twitter storm erupted, with cocktail purists decrying the move as depersonalized and anti-patron.
"From a consumer point of view, ordering a martini -- essentially a two-ingredient drink -- and being served from a premade mix feels insulting," said Alyson Sheppard, a beverage and food writer for the Robb Report who joined in the Twitter exchange.
Audrey Saunders, an owner of the Pegu Club bar in New York, put it more directly. "The last thing I ever want to see is my martini getting poured out of a pitcher of premix from the freezer," she wrote in an email. "For me, this simply does not spark joy."
Maggie Hoffman, whose book "Batch Cocktails" was published in March, thinks advance preparation can produce more consistent drinks. "I think we're seeing prebatched, prediluted, prechilled classic drinks like martinis because the technique really works," she said, "allowing for precision in dilution and temperature, and no variation depending on who's working that night."
Ms. Saunders said that could be bad news for bartending. "Craft-cocktail bar operators that don't have the ability to train their bartenders in consistent drink preparation, or trust enough to allow them to make drinks without worrying about overdilution are, in effect, neutering the bartender's skill set," she wrote. "Those programs not only lack soul, but display efficiency at its worst."
Ms. Sheppard said the martini in particular is a very personal cocktail, which bar customers enjoy customizing to their tastes.
But there is hope that all martini lovers can be satisfied in this new, no-assembly-required world. Tyson Buhler, who runs the bar programs at Death & Co. Denver and Lost Hours, pointed out that the presence of prepared drinks on his menus does not preclude individualized orders.
"If a drinker specifies a type of martini," he said, "they will get it."

Recipe: Make-Ahead Martini
Daniel Osborne, the bar manager at Abigail Hall in Portland, Ore., can satisfy orders for gin and vodka martinis and rye and bourbon manhattans in an instant. Each drink is mixed in bulk, diluted and chilled well ahead of time. Advocates of this process say it results in not only quicker service but also a better, colder and more viscous drink. "Dilution and chill are main ingredients" in a martini, Mr. Osborne said. To find out for yourself, you need to plan only a day before cocktail hour. This recipe will yield two drinks. If you wish to have more ready in advance, simply double or triple the measurements.
5 ounces gin, preferably Beefeater
2 ounces distilled water
1 ounce dry vermouth, preferably Dolin
2 lemon twists or olives
1. Combine the gin, distilled water and vermouth in a mixing glass. Using a funnel, transfer the mixture into a glass bottle. Seal the bottle and store in the freezer overnight.
2. When mixture is fully chilled, pour 4 ounces into a chilled cocktail glass. (Because of the presence of water, there is a chance the cocktail will begin to solidify in the freezer. If the drink appears slightly slushy when you remove it from the freezer, give the bottle a slight shake and let it sit for a minute or so before pouring.) Garnish with lemon twist or olive.
Yield: 2 drinks

The battle over naming rights grows for alternative foods

Texto completo: If you've had any "almond drink" lately, you might have noticed that there's a semantics battle happening among America's food producers, politicians and public. At its heart are the questions: How should we label products that imitate other products? Who has the right to use certain words? What do those words truly mean?
Culinary innovation and the lightening of the American diet has given us an abundance of options. If we're cutting carbohydrates, we can have cauliflower rice instead of regular rice. Folks with dairy allergies can opt for soy milk instead of dairy milk. And vegans and vegetarians - as well as people trying to scale back their meat consumption for health or the environment - have been delighted by the arrival of plant-based burgers that more closely replicate meat than veggie burgers.
But legislation around the country and world aims to block newcomers from being able to use some of those words to describe their products. It's all in service of reducing consumer confusion and protecting their businesses, say proponents of the milk and meat industries - and recently, the rice industry has joined the fight. The people who make and advocate for plant-based meats and milks, and veggie-based rices, counter that consumers aren't buying these products because they're confused and think they're something else; they're buying them because they know the products are alternatives, and these consumers want them.
Here's a briefing on the latest in the linguistic fight for your dinner plate.
Rice Non-rice "rices" have proliferated in recent years, thanks to the Paleo diet, which popularized cauliflower rice. Other vegetables soon followed: Now, if you walk down the frozen aisle of a grocery store, you can buy rices made of broccoli, sweet potato, beets and butternut squash. A new form of alternative rices has popped up in recent months, too: Legume and chickpea rices are a high-protein alternative rice, from the companies Banza and RightRice. They're made in a similar manner as chickpea pasta but cut to be rice-shaped - so they're very similar to orzo.
But in Arkansas, beginning in August, these products can no longer be called "rice." Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a bill last month that aims to protect the state's meat and rice producers. Most of America's domestically grown rice comes from Arkansas, and producers fear that rice alternatives will harm their businesses.
"This law only affects people who want to deceive the public about how their food originated," Arkansas state Rep. David Hillman (R), who introduced the legislation, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. "And if you're not trying to deceive the public, this will not affect you or any of the outlets who sell these products."
However, "ricing" is also a verb - "to reduce to a form resembling rice" - and the products are permitted to be labeled in this way. So Arkansans won't be buying cauliflower rice, but they can purchase "riced cauliflower." Many large companies, such as Green Giant, already label their vegetable rices that way. Manufacturers selling "cauliflower rice" after the deadline will be fined $1,000 for each mislabeled product. Restaurant labeling was not included in the bill.
Dairy The dairy industry has long fought against plant-based beverage producers calling their drinks "milk." As the number of alternative milks continues to proliferate - beyond soy and almond, we're now seeing oat, hemp, flax, pea, hazelnut, buckwheat, tiger nut and peanut milk - more states have adopted "truth in labeling" requirements that prevent these products from calling themselves milk. Last month, Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and James E. Risch (R-Idaho) reintroduced labeling legislation called the Dairy Pride Act, which failed to advance in 2017. A common slogan among supporters of these bills: "Almonds don't lactate." But producers of nondairy milks say that customers know the difference between dairy and nondairy products. Nondairy milk sales increased 61 percent between 2012 and 2017.
Louisiana is considering such a bill. KSLA News in Shreveport, La., reported that the state used to have more than 1,000 dairies, but there are now fewer than 100. "If we don't protect our industry, we won't have an industry to protect," Louisiana state Sen. Francis Thompson (D) told the station.
The Maryland Senate recently gave its approval for the state to join North Carolina in a compact to enforce nondairy labeling standards. The legislation still needs to be approved by the governor and House of Delegates - and even then, it won't be enforceable until other states sign on.
Proposed dairy labeling legislation is "good old-fashioned protectionism," wrote Paul Shapiro, the author of "Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World," in an October 2018 opinion piece for The Washington Post.
Meat Meat producers aren't too happy with the Beyond Burger and the Impossible Burger. The two plant-based burgers are famous for how well they can substitute for meat - they even "bleed" thanks to ingredients such as beets, which replicate the color of a burger's juices. But industry lobbyists are ramping up their efforts to prevent these companies from being able to use the word "burger." Last year, Missouri passed a law that penalizes companies that label plant-based products with certain animal meat descriptions, such as "ground beef style," with fines or jail time. Vegetarian protein companies sued the state, which settled. In February, the New York Times reported that "beef and farming industry groups have persuaded legislators in more than a dozen states to introduce laws that would make it illegal to use the word meat to describe burgers and sausages that are created from plant-based ingredients or are grown in labs."
"Five or 10 years from now, fake meat will have a product that is viable from a cost standpoint," Kevin Kester, the former president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, told The Post. "We have to make sure that everyone plays by the same rules."
It's not just an American thing. A committee in the European Parliament recently passed an amendment prohibiting plant-based products from being labeled as steak, sausage, escalope, burger and hamburger. The measure will be voted on by the full Parliament after its elections, before being put to member states and the European Commission, the Guardian reports. The measure was opposed by environmental groups, who feared it could discourage plant-based eating.
"We felt that steak should be kept for real steak with meat and come up with a new moniker for all these new products. There is a lot to be done in this front, a lot of creativity will be needed," Eric Andrieu, a French member of the European Parliament, told the Guardian.
It has led to a lot of jokes about what plant-based burgers in Europe will be called. "Veggie discs" has become the running gag, and it does have a certain ring to it.

Local journalism needs to thrive

Texto completo: This time last year, I wrote about communities innovatively responding to local economic and social challenges. The trend continues, strengthening democracy at the grassroots level.
One new wrinkle is the Aspen Institute's Weave project, the goal of which is to identify ways to heal the social fragmentation chipping away at many levels of American society. Led by New York Times columnist David Brooks, the project asks participants what they can do to "replace loneliness, division and distrust with relationship, community and purpose.
This movement is encouraging, but as it gains momentum, local journalism organizations are still struggling to find a sustainable economic model. Without one, they will not be able to maintain their connection to local readers and viewers as well as attract the younger readers and viewers they need for the future. (For the purposes of this piece, I am concentrating on print and TV, not local radio.)
Nor will they be able to cover their communities well. Some news organizations, like the Denver Post and San Jose Mercury News, have suffered deep cutbacks in staffing and coverage after new ownership took over.
This challenge affects not only journalism but also our democracy. An informed public is essential in a system of government that relies upon the consent of the governed. Perhaps that is why a 2016 Pew Research Center study reveals a strong correlation between people who consume local news and people who vote in local elections.
Of course, national newspapers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal draw national, even international audiences to their print and digital products. But local, state and even regional journalism organizations lack that reach. They instead are searching for economic security in a digital age, often to no avail.
According to a University of North Carolina study, 60 percent of U.S. counties are "news deserts that lack a local newspaper.
The Pew Research Center just finished a new look at local journalism and found 73 percent of respondents follow local news somewhat closely. But only 14 percent of local news consumers pay for it. What's more, 71 percent think media organizations are doing fine financially.
This discrepancy is at the heart of the problem. The internet has made news ubiquitous and largely free, so why should we have to pay for it? That question is natural, and vexes local news organizations. It also is prompting alternative models, such as nonprofit news organizations. The Pulitzer Prize-winning Philadelphia Inquirer, for example, is now part of the nonprofit Philadelphia Media Network, which the Lenfest Institute for Journalism owns.
Two drivers of the nonprofit model recently raised $42 million to rebuild local news operations. John Thornton, the venture capitalist who banked the launch of the successful nonprofit Texas Tribune site, and Elizabeth Green, founder of the popular Chalkbeat education site in places like New York and Colorado, recently created the American Journalism Project.
They are taking their experiences in providing compelling coverage of state and local issues and supporting existing and startup local news organizations. The initiative wants to involve philanthropies in rejuvenating civic news organizations, much like philanthropy has had a major impact on education, health care and the arts.
Report for America also offers a new model for local journalism. Like Teach for America educators, participants sign up for stints in local communities. This time it is in news organizations, where grants from Report for America help finance their enterprising work.
These are encouraging developments, but more needs to be done to sustain vibrant local news operations. And the challenges are not all financial.
For one thing, local journalists need to keep searching for more people to involve in their reporting. That Pew 2016 study revealed those who vote less often in local elections are less likely to think their local news organizations are in touch with their communities. And they are far less likely to have been interviewed by a local journalist than those more highly engaged local citizens.
I am not saying journalists should interview more people in order to get them to vote. But expanding the network of sources can broaden their work while also increasing community engagement, which is one of the goals of Weave and others in the localism movement.
The potential and hope of that movement is that it results in stronger communities, the kind with firm enough bonds that they can work through the social and economic challenges that inevitably hit every community. Journalism has a role to play in meeting that challenge.

Texto completo: Today the Drudge Report has been linking to the latest newspaper story on the long-running economic and cultural boom in Nashville, Tennessee. Like many such stories today's dispatch in the Guardian mentions the vibrant music scene, which goes way beyond the country acts that made the city famous, as well as the growth of various industries from health care to technology. Also, as in many such stories, there's no mention of the fact that Nashville happens to be located in a state with no tax on wage income.
Being the Guardian, there are gripes about gentrification and income inequality, but the paper's Khushbu Shah makes clear that Nashville is thriving:
Approximately 14 million people visit the city each year, the Chamber of Commerce estimates. This year, around 100,000 are due to show up in late April alone for the National Football League (NFL) draft. In explaining its choice of city, the NFL published a list citing Nashville's music, barbeque, and Broadway as factors making it the perfect location for 2019.
Nashville, unequivocally, is an economic success story, and not just in recent years, when outlets like the New York Times dubbed it the "it city".
In that 2013 Times story on the city's prosperity, the lack of a state income tax on wages made a brief cameo appearance in paragraph 23. Last December, another Times report put Nashville's success in historical and regional context, but this time with no mention of the Tennessee tax advantage:
Forty years ago, Nashville and Birmingham, Ala., were peers. Two hundred miles apart, the cities anchored metropolitan areas of just under one million people each and had a similar number of jobs paying similar wages.
Not anymore. The population of the Nashville area has roughly doubled, and young people have flocked there, drawn by high-paying jobs as much as its hip "Music City" reputation. Last month, the city won an important consolation prize in the competition for Amazon's second headquarters: an operations center that will eventually employ 5,000 people at salaries averaging $150,000 a year.
Birmingham, by comparison, has steadily lost population, and while its suburbs have expanded, their growth has lagged the Nashville area's. Once-narrow gaps in education and income have widened, and important employers like SouthTrust and Saks have moved their headquarters. Birmingham tried to lure Amazon, too, but all it is getting from the online retail giant is a warehouse and a distribution center where many jobs will pay about $15 an hour.
Also unmentioned was that one of the ways Tennessee encourages the creation of jobs paying more than $15 per hour is by avoiding mandating them. The appropriately named Volunteer State hasn't followed the trend of ordering wages above the federal minimum of $7.25 per hour, preferring to allow unskilled workers to decide whether to take a low entry-level wage to gain experience. The state also ensures that workers are free to decide whether to join a union or not. As if by magic, many businesses have arrived to offer jobs to these workers.
The American Legislative Exchange Council's annual Rich States, Poor States report notes various other aspects of Tennessee's economic environment which may not make it into stories about the Nashville boom. The report, written by Jonathan Williams, Art Laffer and former Journal editorial writer Steve Moore, ranks Tennessee seventh among the 50 states in terms of policies supporting future growth.
The ALEC report notes that along with no tax on wage income, Tennessee also has no death tax and relatively light taxes on property. Public employees make up a relatively small slice of the population and yet, as Fox Butterfield might observe, the place is thriving.
Come to think of it, it's probably best for Nashville residents not to discuss these facts unless they want media folk to stop calling their hometown the "it city."

Flames engulf Notre Dame Cathedral, caused roof collapse

New York Times
PARIS >> Notre Dame Cathedral, the symbol of the beauty and history of Paris, was scarred by an extensive fire Monday evening that caused its delicate spire to collapse, bruised the Parisian skies with smoke and further disheartened a city already back on its heels after weeks of violent protests.
The spectacle of flames leaping from the cathedral’s wooden roof — its spire glowing red, then turning into a virtual cinder — stunned thousands of onlookers who gathered along the banks of the Seine and packed into the plaza of the nearby Hotel de Ville, covering their mouths in horror and wiping away tears.
The crowd gasped when the spire fell. “Paris is beheaded,” said Pierre-Eric Trimovillas, 32.
“It is like losing a member of one’s own family,” said Pierre Guillaume Bonnet, a 45-year-old marketing director. “For me there are so many memories tied up in it.”
Around 500 firefighters battled the blaze for nearly five hours. By 11 p.m. Paris time, the structure had been “saved and preserved as a whole,” the fire chief, Jean-Claude Gallet, said. The two magnificent towers soaring above the skyline had been spared, he said, but two-thirds of the roof was destroyed.
“The worst has been avoided even though the battle is not completely won,” President Emmanuel Macron said Monday night in a brief and solemn speech at Notre Dame, vowing that the cathedral would be rebuilt.
“This is the place where we have lived all of our great moments, the epicenter of our lives,” he said. “It is the cathedral of all the French.”
The cause of the fire was not immediately known, officials said. But it appeared to have begun in the interior network of wooden beams, many dating back to the Middle Ages and nicknamed “the forest,” said the cathedral’s rector, Monsignor Patrick Chauvet.
No one was killed, officials said, but a firefighter was seriously injured.
The fire broke out at about 6:30 a.m. Hawaii time, upending Macron’s plans to deliver an important policy speech about trying to heal the country from months of demonstrations by the “yellow vest” protest movement that had already defaced major landmarks in the capital and disfigured some of its wealthiest streets.
The tragedy seemed to underscore the challenges heaped before his administration, which has struggled to reconcile the formidable weight of France’s ideals and storied past with the necessity for change to meet the demands of the 21st century.
A jewel of medieval Gothic architecture built in the 12th and 13th centuries, Notre Dame is a landmark not only for Paris, where it squats firmly yet gracefully at its very center, but for all the world. The cathedral is visited by about 30,000 people a day and around 13 million people a year.
For centuries France’s kings and queens were married and buried there. Napoleon was crowned emperor in Notre Dame in 1804, and the joyous thanksgiving ceremony after the Liberation of Paris in 1944 took place there, led by Charles de Gaulle.
World leaders congregated at the cathedral in a memorial service for de Gaulle in 1970, and then again for President Francois Mitterrand in 1996.
On Monday evening, as the last rush of tourists were trying to get in for the day, the doors of Notre Dame were abruptly shut without explanation, witnesses said.
Within moments tiny bits of white smoke started rising from the spire — which, at 295 feet, was the highest part of the cathedral.
Billowing out, the smoke started turning gray, then black, making it clear that a fire was growing inside the cathedral, which is currently covered in scaffolding. Soon orange flames began punching out of the spire, quickly increasing in intensity.
French police rushed in and started blowing whistles, telling everyone to move back, witnesses said. By then the flames were towering, spilling out of multiple parts of the cathedral. Tourists and residents alike came to a standstill, pulling out their phones to call their loved ones. Older Parisians began to cry, lamenting how their national treasure was quickly being lost.
Thousands stood on the banks of the Seine and watched in shock as the fire tore through the cathedral’s wooden roof and brought down the spire. Video filmed by onlookers and shared on social media showed smoke and flames billowing from the top of the cathedral.
Jean-Louis Martin, 56, a native of Dijon in eastern France who works at the university in Geneva, gasped as the flames leaped up. “It hurts me,” he said. “There are no words. It’s just horrible.”
The city’s prosecutor’s office said it had opened an investigation.
Chauvet said firefighters were able to save some of the cathedral’s artworks but did not say how much was damaged inside the building. A linen fabric associated with St. Louis, the Holy Crown of thorns and the cathedral’s treasury were saved.
Gallet, the fire chief, said firefighters were still rescuing artworks in the building, hours after the fire had started. The main risk, he said, was the smoke within the cathedral, and the fall of materials, including melting lead.
The cathedral had been undergoing extensive renovation work. Last week 16 copper statues representing the Twelve Apostles and four evangelists were lifted with a crane so that the spire could be renovated.
In recent years the Friends of Notre-Dame, a foundation based in the United States, estimated that the structure needed nearly $40 million for urgent repairs. The French state, which owns the cathedral, already devotes up to 2 million euros (about $2.4 million) a year in upkeep.
The fire came during Holy Week, six days before Easter Sunday. For Roman Catholics the cathedral has been a spiritual pilgrimage site for generations.
The risk of the fire is not just to the cathedral itself, but also to the gargoyles that cover its walls and to the stained glass, particularly its “rose” windows.
The largest of its bells, which dates to 1681, managed to survive the French Revolution and has been rung at some of the most important events in French history, including both world wars.
Yet the fire is likely to be just the latest, if most dramatic, insult to a landmark that has endured decades of neglect and damage, some at the hands of French revolutionaries, through its more than 850-year history.
Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel, “Notre-Dame of Paris,” noted even then that “one cannot but regret, cannot but feel indignant at the innumerable degradations and mutilations inflicted on the venerable pile, both by the action of time and the hand of man.”

Texto completo: "Don could be a very serious professional, but he was always laughing about something. He always had a joke."
David Ley
Mosinee High School science teacher
MARATHON – Friends, family members and colleagues are remembering science educator Don Lutz as the developer of the Christa McAuliffe Nature Center in Marathon, a teacher's teacher and a lifelong learner himself.
Lutz, a Stevens Point native and 1970 graduate of Pacelli Catholic High School, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Fort Myers, Florida, as a result of a head injury he sustained in a fall a few days earlier. He was 68.
For most of his career, Lutz was a science teacher for the Marathon Middle School, now the Marathon Venture Academy. In the late 1980s, when the building for the middle and elementary school was being planned and built, Lutz saw the potential for an undeveloped area on the southern part of the property as an outdoor classroom and nature center.
"I thought for kids nowadays, with all the problems with the environment, that they need to know how a community works," Lutz told the Wausau Daily Herald in 2015 when the center marked its 25th anniversary. "And this pond is a community of animals and plants and populations of different things. So it makes it real easy to adapt that thought to what's happening in the real world."
Money, as it always is for schools, was tight, and there was no budget for the outside learning center. So Lutz took it upon himself to find grant money to pay for its initial development, and secured funding from a foundation named after Christa McAuliffe, a teacher who was one of seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986.
But no matter where he was, Lutz simply loved teaching. He was known for starting his classes each day with a joke, usually science related and usually corny. He was president of the Wisconsin Society of Science Teachers, and reveled in attending conferences where he could learn how to be a better teacher, but also mentor others who shared his passion.
David Ley, a veteran science teacher for Mosinee High School, met Lutz at such a workshop offered by the Wisconsin Academy Staff Development Initiative. Lutz was the oldest teacher in the group, Ley said, but he brought energy and enthusiasm to the training.
"Don could be a very serious professional, but he was always laughing about something. He always had a joke," Ley said. "He was a lover of the environment and for teaching kids. That was catching, inspiring. ... I think one of the themes of Don's life was that Don didn't just teach a classroom full of kids. He influenced do many educators around the whole state."
In the summers, Lutz led Marathon School District's summer program, teaching courses such as environmental education, rocketry and outdoor skills. Even after he retired as a classroom teacher in 2007, he continued those efforts.
Jenny Baeseman is a 1994 graduate of Marathon High School and a top-level scientist and researcher. Now a consultant, she was the executive director of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, an organization that helps coordinate scientific efforts in Antarctica. She didn't have Lutz as a classroom teacher, but learned from him in summer programs.
"I remember trying to learn how to read a compass from Mr. Lutz, but for the life of me I couldn't figure it out," Baeseman said in a Facebook message. "I still think of him when I try to use a compass."
Baeseman said Lutz helped inspire "so many people to go into science as a career. But more importantly, he made science fun, which made students learn whether they 'liked science' or not."
Lutz also was an athlete. As a youth, he was on the junior Olympic team for ski jumping, and was also a marathoner, a triathlete and cross-country skier. Joint problems forced him to give up running as he got older, but he still loved walking with his two dogs, Buddy and Charlie, said his wife, Alvie Lutz. The couple had no children.
In recent years, the couple spent most of their winters in Florida, Alvie Lutz wrote in an email message about her husband.
Even though he was retired, he never gave up teaching. He was a substitute teacher for several districts in central Wisconsin, and was thinking about becoming one in Florida.
Nor did he ever stop learning.
"When he was in Florida, he would walk every day to the Fort Myers library and read the complete New York Times," said Dennis DeNuccio, who was a friend of Lutz's since they went to high school together. "And he always has some books piled up on his nightstand. ... I think he just liked to learn."
Memorial services for Don Lutz are pending.

Daily on Healthcare: Medicare for All goes way beyond other countries’ universal healthcare plans

MEDICARE FOR ALL GOES WAY BEYOND OTHER COUNTRIES’ UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE: The Medicare for All Act, the latest proposal to have the government become the only payer of healthcare services, is often billed by its supporters as a step toward realizing a similar system that other developed nations have in place.

“I want to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America being the only major country on earth that doesn’t guarantee healthcare to all people as a right and not a privilege,” Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., said when he unveiled the most recent version of the legislation last week.

But while other developed nations do have universal healthcare coverage, they get there in a different way than the plan laid out in the Medicare for All Act, and differ significantly from country to country.

The bill backed by Sanders and by others running for the presidency — Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey — would throw out private health insurance in favor of everyone being enrolled in a government plan. It would do away with all out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services and instead have the government pay for services in full. The plan also would cover more services than Medicare does now, including prescription drugs, dental care, vision care, abortion, and maternity care.

The proposal has no precedent among other nations.

In Canada, privately operated hospitals are funded by the government but people still have to buy private plans to pay for dental, vision, and prescription drugs to supplement their care. Often, people can get that coverage through their jobs.

Switzerland looks a lot what backers of Obamacare had envisioned because it requires everyone living there to buy private health insurance, which is heavily regulated by the government.

Germany has health insurance that is managed by nonprofits, and some residents have the option to buy private plans instead. In France, everyone must buy health insurance managed by nonprofits that are mostly funded through taxes. In Singapore, people are allowed to pay more to receive deluxe care and everyone has to set aside a savings account, which can be used to help pay for medical services. In the United Kingdom, hospitals are run by the government and paid for by the government, but private plans are also available.

“Some will refer to these countries having ‘single payer’ systems, often implying they are all alike,” according to a brief from the Commonwealth Fund. “Yet such a label can be misleading, as considerable differences exist among universal healthcare systems.”

TENNESSEE LAWMAKERS GO AFTER MEDICAID BLOCK GRANTS: A state Senate committee in Tennessee this week is considering a measure that would ask the Trump administration to structure Medicaid as a block grant. The bill already has passed the state House and Republican Gov. Bill Lee has signalled support.

Getting funding as a block grant means that states are likely to get less money from the federal government, but will in exchange have more flexibility about how they spend it. The proposal upends the current model in which the federal government matches a certain percentage of Medicaid dollars for each state, regardless of how much the state spends. No state has ever received Medicaid as a block grant — though it’s a model that has wide conservative support — and Alaska is considering the move.

NEW BILL WOULD CODIFY ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS: Rep. Mike Burgess , R-Texas, the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, on Friday introduced legislation that would allow the formation of association health plans. On Monday, more than 20 Republicans introduced the Senate version of the legislation.

The plans, which allow individual workers and small businesses to pool together to purchase health insurance, are currently allowed under rulemaking by the Trump administration, but have been blocked by a judge.

WHITE HOUSE HOSTS SCREENING OF FILM ON KERMIT GOSNELL : The White House hosted a screening late Friday of “Gosnell,” the movie about the Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell who was convicted of murdering three infants who survived abortions. White House Domestic Policy Advisor Joe Grogan said that the issue of protections for abortion survivors had spurred President Trump to back new limits on abortion.

MEASLES CASES REACH A NEW HIGH: As of April 11, reported measles cases has reached 555 in 20 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the second-highest number of cases since the disease’s elimination in 2000 with 667 in 2014. The CDC says that the latest tally is preliminary and is subject to change.

COMPANY BEHIND KIDNEY TRANSPLANT TEST SUES COMPETITOR: A diagnostics technology company, CareDx, Inc., which created a breakthrough blood test to warn doctors of imminent kidney transplant rejection, announced Wednesday it is suing competitor Natera for trying to do the same thing. CareDx lawyers say Natera’s study on their own test is “deeply flawed” and “unreliable”, meant to fool physicians and patients.

TERMINALLY ILL ADULTS IN NEW JERSEY CAN NOW CHOOSE TO DIE: New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy , a Democrat, signed off on legislation Friday that would permit terminally ill adults to end their lives with the assistance of medical professionals. Murphy, a Catholic, said in a personal statement that he struggled with the decision to approve the legislation but ultimately determined it was a personal decision. “Allowing residents with terminal illnesses to make end-of-life choices for themselves is the right thing to do,” Murphy said

GROUND BEEF SICKENS PEOPLE IN 6 STATES: CDC: The CDC announced Friday that ground beef caused a multistate outbreak of E. coli, and the Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is investigating. Although the CDC has not determined the source of the ground beef involved in the outbreak, the agency is not encouraging retailers to put a hold on selling the meat.

WHO SAYS CONGO EBOLA OUTBREAK NOT INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY: The World Health Organization announced Friday that it would not designate the ebola outbreak in the Congo as a global health emergency, despite the 1,100 cases in the country as of last week. Because the outbreak, which has been ongoing since August, hasn’t spread beyond the DRC, “we considered there would be no added benefit by declaring [an emergency],” said Robert Steffen , chair of the WHO-convened committee of external experts that deliberated over the emergency declaration.

GEORGE CONWAY ESCALATES ATTACK ON TRUMP’S MENTAL STATE: George Conway , White House counselor Kellyanne Conway 's husband, gave another scathing evaluation of Trump's mental state Saturday evening after the president criticized the New York Times on Twitter. "Lies, half-truths, exaggerations, distortions...things that randomly pop into his mind that he thinks sound good at any particular moment, random babble—all of [these] things swirl around in his head in an endless jumble," Conway tweeted.

Texto completo: As President Donald Trump continues to consider closing the United States' border with Mexico, West Virginia business owners and industry advocates worry about the effect it could have on the state's automotive sector.
Trump tweeted in late March he was considering a closure. On Friday, The New York Times reported that Trump had urged Kevin McAleenan, his choice as acting secretary of homeland security, to close the country's southwestern border.
Mexico is West Virginia's 11th-largest trading partner based on dollar value, according to 2018 Census data. Trade with Mexico supports 23,000 jobs, according a 2017 report from the Wilson Center, a non-partisan research institute. West Virginia's exports to Mexico have increased by 378 percent since 1993, according to the report.

Julian Assange is a political prisoner for revealing the truth

Texto completo: Last week’s arrest of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange by the British government on a U.S. extradition order is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the U.S. Constitution. It is an attack on the free press. It is an attack on free speech. It is an attack on our right to know what our government is doing with our money in our name.
Julian Assange is every bit as much a political prisoner as was Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary or Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
They, and so many more, were imprisoned because they told the truth about their governments.
Repressive governments do not want their citizens to know that they are up to so they insist on controlling the media. We are taught, at the same time, that we have a free press whose job it is to uncover the corruption in our system so that we can demand our political leaders make some changes or face unemployment. That, we are told, is what makes us different from the totalitarian.
The arrest of Assange is a canary in a coal mine to warn us that something is very wrong with our system.
What’s wrong? The U.S. mainstream media always seems to do the bidding of the U.S. government. That is why they rushed to confirm Washington’s claim that the Assange indictment was not in any way about journalism. It was only about hacking government computers!
As the New York Times said in an editorial, sounding like a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, Julian Assange committed “an indisputable crime.” But was it? As actual journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote last week, what Julian Assange did in 2010, for which he is facing extradition to the U.S., is no different from what New York Times and other journalists do every day! He attempted to help Chelsea Manning shield Manning’s identity as Manning blew the whistle on U.S. government crimes to a publisher. The information in question included a video showing U.S. military personnel participating in and cheering the murder of Iraqi civilians. Why is it criminal for us to know this?
The difference is that what Assange and Manning did embarrassed the U.S. government, which was lying to us that it was “liberating” Iraq and Afghanistan when it was actually doing the opposite. Mainstream journalists publish “leaks” that help bolster the neocon or other vested narratives of the different factions of the US government. That’s why the US media wants to see Assange in prison, or worse: he upset their apple cart.
The lesson is clear: when you bolster the government’s narrative you are a “brave journalist.” When you expose corruption in government you are a criminal. Do we really want to live in a country where it is illegal to learn that our government is engaged in criminal acts? I thought we had an obligation as an engaged citizenry to hold our government accountable!
As long as Julian Assange is in prison, we are all in prison. When the government has the power to tell us what we are allowed to see, hear, and know, we no longer live in a free society. Julian Assange will be extradited to the U.S. and he will have dozens of charges piled on. They want him to disappear so that the next Assange will think twice before informing us of our government’s crimes. Are we going to let them steal our freedom?

Texto completo: I’m beginning to feel sorry for President Trump.
The attacks on him, his policies, his kids, his cabinet, his staff and everyone who’s ever worked for him as a caddie by the Democrats and the Trump-hate media will never end.
The political attacks keep coming from dumbos in Congress like Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and the dozens of Democrats who are running for president in 2020.
The judicial attacks keep coming from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California, where Democrats routinely shop to get liberal judges to delay or stop Trump’s executive orders for bogus constitutional reasons.
The legal attacks will be coming soon from the Department of Justice’s Southern District of New York, which is using its investigation into the hush-money payments Trump made in 2016 to cover up affairs he had a decade earlier as an excuse to fish around in Trump’s finances.
It will never matter to Democrats what Robert Mueller’s report, Attorney General William Barr or even the U.S. Supreme Court concludes about Russian collusion, obstruction or any other alleged crime Trump did or didn’t commit before or after he became president.
The Democrats and the liberal media will always believe Trump won only because he cheated with the help of the Russians.
They will never let the facts or the truth get in the way of their permanent anti-Trump agenda or their impossible dream of impeaching him.
With collusion with Russia taken off the table (for non-deranged people, anyway), the Democrats and the people who play journalists on CNN and MSNBC will continue to look for anything else they can use to attack Trump.
That includes sliming the reputations or characters of anyone who works for Donald Trump or fails to use their power to bring him down.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller has become the first victim.
For two years he was touted by Democrats and the liberal media as the bipartisan, fair-minded and super-competent Swamp hero who was going find the proof of Trump’s collusion and obstruction. But now they see him as a bum, a failure, a partisan Republican hack who is part of a great Republican conspiracy to keep Trump in office.
The Trump-haters newest Devil is Attorney General Bill Barr. Until he wrote his summary of the Mueller Report’s “no collusion” findings two weeks ago he was seen as a fair-minded, by-the-book, respected member of the D.C. establishment. Now Democrat in Congress are calling him just another untrustworthy Trump puppet who spun Mueller’s findings to please his master.
We’d have bipartisan healthcare reform, immigration reform and who knows what else if the Democrats weren’t so hellbent on stopping Trump from getting legislation he wants through Congress.
There are a million things Donald Trump has done to tick me off.
But I can separate his personal flaws and un-presidential manners from what he’s been accomplishing in Washington - cutting taxes, boosting the economy, creating jobs, etc. with no help from Democrats and too little help from many Republicans.
I don’t know any other human in politics who could have withstood the bipartisan onslaught of hate that President Trump has and still be able to walk around with his head high and a smile on his face.
At this point he can’t be hurt politically by what the Democrats in D.C. say or do, or what The New York Times or Washington Post writes.
But sadly for the health and welfare of the country, the Swamp Democrats and the liberal media will never stop trying to destroy President Trump and his team.

Troubling, revealing portrait of Trump ally Steve Bannon; 'The Brink' *** 1/2

Texto completo: "Know thine enemy." It's an aphorism that may come to mind for a viewer of a certain political tendency while watching "The Brink," Alison Klayman's engrossing documentary about conservative operative and former Trump Svengali Steve Bannon. It's at least a justification for watching this portrait, which is as troubling as it is revealing about the man, who seems hellbent on disrupting the establishment by mobilizing white working-class voters through dog-whistle identity politics. But one has to question Bannon's motivation. Is it wealth? Power? Anarchy? Frustratingly, it seems to be just because he can.
Klayman's film is subtle and nuanced, not something one would associate with Bannon, a proud propagandist who learned the art of war at Goldman Sachs and honed his media skills in narrative filmmaking in Hollywood. At first, Klayman's film humanizes him, which can be unsettling, pitted against the image of him as a hate-spewing monster. But Klayman doesn't hesitate to introduce us to Bannon as a man who is vulnerable, self-aware and even funny. He speaks to the horrors of the Holocaust and is concerned with his appearance, sipping green smoothies and kombucha.
Klayman shows us his charm because charm is what makes Bannon so, so dangerous. Deep into "The Brink," he wins over a hostile Toronto crowd at a debate with wry, self-deprecating jokes, and you realize just how likable this guy is. It's a chilling thought, after we've watched him amass power and money to fuel his "populist movement" across Europe.
Klayman follows Bannon's breakneck schedule from 2017 to 2018, after his resignation from the White House in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., to the most recent midterm elections. He's busy networking with a coalition of far-right European leaders, setting his sights on influencing elections while attempting to coalesce the populist movement. It's meetings, phone calls and private jet flights as Klayman pulls back the curtain on how the sausage gets made - the wheeling and dealing with international leaders, the careful back and forth with the media, and the constant bickering within the organization.
Many will want to highlight the juicier moments of "The Brink," such as Bannon texting New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman a link to the trailer for his self-labeled propaganda film "Trump @ War," or Sam Nunberg claiming the border wall was his idea. But the most fascinating moments in "The Brink" are when the filmmaking apparatus is most apparent. Klayman often queries Bannon from offscreen, pushing back on his oft-repeated rhetoric.
Bannon even guffaws that the film is going to ruin him. This may come as a surprise, but "Sloppy Steve" always knows how he looks. The truly enlightening element of "The Brink" is these small moments of cynicism. Bannon may think he's constantly manipulating the media, but in this film, Klayman uses the tools of documentary filmmaking to reveal his inherent emptiness.

Your lawyer is unreal: How to spot the scammers

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.
“I’m not a lawyer, I just play one in your documents”
“Document preparation assistance” offices have proliferated in California. You can usually recognize them by their neon signs and big window advertisements stating you can get a divorce, file bankruptcy, do your estate planning … and go home with several Ginsu knives all for $299. (I’m only kidding about the Ginsu knives. Those are extra.)
These offices are staffed with non-attorneys (and, not unheard of, disbarred attorneys) whose role is supposed to be solely to assist you in typing up your paperwork for a divorce, bankruptcy, estate planning or other legal matter. By law, they cannot give you legal advice. What could possibly go wrong?
Well, let me tell you. Here are just a few issues the document preparer cannot advise you on:
* What type of bankruptcy to file
* Is a will sufficient or do you need a trust
* How do your retirement plans or life insurance integrate with your estate plan
* How do federal laws dealing with retirement plans affect your divorce
* How can you tell if the spouse you are divorcing is hiding assets
* Can your soon-to-be ex waive spousal support forever? How about child support?
* Do you need a corporation or a limited liability company? How will that entity be taxed?
And filing incorrect immigration papers can result in permanently destroying a person’s immigration status or losing your place on the years-long INS waiting list.
When you skip the lawyers and head to a “document preparer,” you’re the one who is now “playing lawyer.” You might guess right. You might not. However it turns out, the document preparation assistance guy or gal isn’t responsible — they were just your typist.
Legal matters require legal advice. And yes, we know, it’s not cheap. But it’s cheaper than getting it wrong. If you still go to a non-lawyer, please at least make sure they’re bonded. And remember, they’re not covered by the attorney-client privilege, so anything you discuss with them is not private, and they can be called to testify against you.
The victim lawyer
This is just to make you feel better. Lawyers are becoming the victims of online scams now as well. Usually, it’s someone claiming they need legal assistance and want the lawyer to hold funds for them in the lawyer’s trust account. And guess what they need in order to send that? The lawyer’s banking information. You’re not feeling sorry for us though, are you? It’s OK. We’re used to that.
Q: Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt? A: Because deep down, they’re really good people.

Texto completo: Shakespeare once wrote, “First, let’s kill all the lawyers.” And you can insert any of hundreds of lawyer jokes here. (Here’s one: What do you throw to a drowning lawyer? A: His partners.) So why would anybody want to pretend to be a lawyer? It happens, all too frequently, in many guises.
Here are a few to watch out for …
The fake lawyer “suing” you
A common scam these days involves a phone call or an email from someone claiming to be a lawyer representing an opposing party in a lawsuit against you. This fake lawyer may also state they’ve already obtained a judgment against you, and now it’s time to pay up. They may even give you a (fake) case number. Typically they’re demanding personal information and often a settlement amount. Real lawyer (me) wants you to know that’s not how this works.
If there were a lawsuit against you, you would know long before someone started calling to collect money. To start, you would have been served with the complaint. But the easiest way to figure out if the call is from an actual lawyer or even a real lawyer’s office is to ask for the name and bar number of the attorney handling the matter.
If the caller gives you a name and/or number, check with the State Bar of California at calbar.ca.gov/Public to see if the phone number they’re calling from matches the name and bar number you’ve been given. Attorneys (the real ones) in California are required to maintain current contact information with the State Bar.
This faux lawyer wants to represent you
Be wary of scams when you’re searching for a lawyer. Sadly, there are certain areas of law that seem to attract scammers pretending to be lawyers to make a quick buck off your pain. Common areas for this are immigration, disability, troubles with the IRS and personal injury. Signs it’s a scam include demands for large sums of money up front, pressure to retain them immediately, and the insistence that this is an emergency and you’ll soon lose rights if you don’t retain this person immediately.
If you find yourself being approached with offers of representation or even when you’re responding to an ad, be sure to do your due diligence. Again, find out the alleged attorney’s name and check with the State Bar. Check the phone number you’re getting calls from — does it really belong to a law office? Check your gut, too. If you’re feeling pressured, worried, or just queasy, this isn’t the right person to represent you, whether they’re a lawyer or not.

Texto completo: EAST LANSING – Bailey Kowalski wants to fight for the silent sexual assault survivors.
She knows what it's like to be one of them.
Known only as "Jane Doe" since filing a lawsuit against Michigan State University last April, Kowalski held an East Lansing news conference Thursday to put her voice and face behind her claim that university counselors coerced her to not report her sexual assault to police or campus officials. She was young and terrified then and believed the counselors who told her it would be best to keep silent.
She chose Thursday for her news conference — exactly four years from when she says three former MSU basketball players sexually assaulted her. Kowalski spoke to the New York Times for an article published Wednesday as well.
"The silent survivors matter and they're worth fighting for," Kowalski said. "I want the system surrounding Michigan State University to change."
The 22-year-old MSU senior was visibly nervous before stepping to the podium in front of dozens of journalists from local and national outlets, but her confidence grew as she spoke, just as it has in the four years since the assault.
"I became a shell of who I once was," Kowalski said of the time immediately after the attack. "I became anxious, depressed and closed off."
Although she's not fully healed now, and not the same person she was before, Kowalski said that might not be a bad thing.
"I look forward to who I will become because I took this step," Kowalski said.
The rape followed a night at a bar Kowalski's lawsuit says she was an 18-year-old freshman at MSU when she was sexually assaulted by three basketball players at one of their apartments. She'd met the players at Harper's bar, where she'd used a fake ID to enter. The team was fresh off its loss to Duke in the 2015 NCAA Final Four.
She said one of the men invited her to a party, but, when they arrived, only a few others were there. Her lawsuit says she felt "discombobulated" and could not control her thumbs to send a text.
One of the men pulled her into a bedroom, according to the lawsuit, saying "You're mine for the night."
His words made her uncomfortable, and she made her way back to the living room. She couldn't move her hands properly, according to the lawsuit, and thought she might have been drugged.
A second man offered to show her his basketball memorabilia and took her to his bedroom. The room went dark.
She was thrown face down on the bed, held in place while he sexually assaulted her, according to the lawsuit. She couldn't move or speak. Two other men took turns sexually assaulting her as well.
About a week later, she went to the university counseling center to talk to someone about the assault. After she told them basketball players were involved, the staff discouraged her from reporting it to police or the university, according to the lawsuit.
A counselor told her it would be an "uphill battle" and that she would be "swimming with some really big fish" if she chose to pursue the case.
"I took it as a threat, but I trusted the university at the time, so I thought she was probably telling me the truth," Kowalski said Thursday.
Why she came forward now Kowalski will graduate from MSU this year with a major in integrated biology. She said Thursday that she didn't want to walk across that stage without saying something about the assault.
She said she's been living a double life since 2015; she had to make up a story about why she switched her major from sports journalism to biology, why she went from a bleed-green Spartan fan to not caring about this year's Final Four game.
"If I didn't (speak out), I would be neglecting other victims and leaving them behind," Kowalski said. "Knowing I can be there for somebody right now, knowing there are women and men who exist as survivors, I look forward to being their support system if they do not have one.
"They do not have to be silenced, this isn't a burden they have to carry on their own."
Kowalski has not reported the assault to the police and is not sure if she will do so in the future. When asked why, she and her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, declined to answer.
Truszkowski said they did not have any settlement agreement with the individual players, who now play professionally. Neither Truszkowski or Kowalski would release the players' names.
Moving on requires action Even once Kowalski graduates, the problems will still exist at MSU, she said, and the only way to fix things is with accountability.
"I want the system surrounding Michigan State to change," Kowalski said. "I want all people to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their status."
Truszkowski has litigated several cases involving sexual assaults at MSU.
"There's obviously a problem here that needs to be addressed," Truszkowski said. "We need to start putting some pressure on the people who need the pressure."
Kowalski made a point of saying she does not have a vendetta against the basketball team.
"For me, this is not a basketball story. I did not choose who my rapists were," she said. "This is not about bringing attention to basketball team. I want to be a voice for individuals."

What the Charges Mean For U.S. Press Freedoms

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Charges against Julian Assange, the founder and leader of WikiLeaks, that were unsealed on Thursday brought to a head a long-running debate about whether his actions construed a crime and what prosecuting him would mean for American press freedoms.
Mr. Assange vaulted to global fame in 2010, when his anti-secrecy website began posting archives of secret American military and diplomatic documents leaked by Chelsea Manning, an Army intelligence analyst who had downloaded them from a classified computer network she worked on at her outpost in Iraq. His image became more complicated in 2016, when WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic emails that the Russian government had hacked as part of its covert operation to damage Hillary Clinton and help Donald J. Trump win the presidency.
Throughout that saga, national security and law enforcement officials in both the Obama and the Trump administrations have weighed whether they could charge Mr. Assange with a crime. That debate has raised concerns by press freedom advocates about what any precedent established by his case would mean for First Amendment rights and the future of investigative journalism in the United States.
Why does the case against Mr. Assange raise concerns about press freedoms?
Mr. Assange is not a traditional journalist, but most of what he does at WikiLeaks is difficult to distinguish in a legally meaningful way from what traditional news organizations, like The New York Times, do every day: seek out and publish information that officials would prefer to be kept secret, including classified national security matters, and take steps to protect the confidentiality of sources.
In recent years, prosecutors have begun far more regularly charging officials with leaking information to reporters under the Espionage Act, a World War I-era law. It criminalizes the disclosure of potentially damaging national security secrets to someone not authorized to receive them. On its face, the Espionage Act could also be used to prosecute reporters who publish government secrets.
While many legal scholars believe that prosecuting reporters for doing their jobs would violate the First Amendment, the prospect has never been tested in court because the government has never charged a journalist under that law. The rumblings about prosecuting Mr. Assange raised the possibility that prosecutors could violate that norm and try to establish that publishing government secrets can be a crime.
Was Mr. Assange charged with publishing secrets?
No. When the indictment was unsealed on Thursday, it showed that a grand jury had instead charged Mr. Assange with conspiring with Ms. Manning to illegally hack a government computer to obtain national security information.
Specifically, the indictment said, on March 8, 2010, Mr. Assange agreed to help Ms. Manning try to crack part of an encoded password that would have let her gain access to more information than her own account provided. Prosecutors also cited a chat log from two days later that they said indicated that Mr. Assange had taken steps to act on that conspiracy: He said he had "no luck so far" in trying to crack the password.
So can people concerned about press freedoms rest easy?
Not quite. For now, the case significantly reduces such concerns because it is outside traditional investigative journalism to help sources try to break passcodes so they can illegally hack into government computers.
But some press freedom advocates say they remain concerned. For one thing, the Justice Department could file a superseding indictment, so there is no guarantee that Espionage Act charges will stay out of the case. Under extradition procedures, however, any additional charges would most likely have to come soon -- before Britain decides whether to transfer custody of Mr. Assange.
For another, prosecutors cited details that expanded beyond a narrow focus on cracking the passcode and that sounded like typical activities of a journalist. For example, the indictment talks about efforts to conceal conversations by using a special chat service and deleting certain chat logs. It also says Mr. Assange took a step to help Ms. Manning send him the files, by making a special folder for her to upload files.
And it quotes a purported exchange midway through Ms. Manning's leaks in which she wrote, "After this upload, that's all I really have got left," but Mr. Assange replied, "Curious eyes never run dry in my experience." Several weeks later, according to the indictment, Ms. Manning copied and sent WikiLeaks the diplomatic cables.
The Justice Department's inclusion of those details as relevant to the case was cause for worry, said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
"The indictment and the Justice Department's press release treat everyday journalistic practices as part of a criminal conspiracy," he said. "Whether the government will be able to establish a violation of the hacking statute remains to be seen, but it's very troubling that the indictment sweeps in activities that are not just lawful but essential to press freedom -- activities like cultivating sources, protecting sources' identities and communicating with sources securely."
Could Mr. Assange be charged later in connection with Russia's election interference?
It would not be easy.
The Espionage Act does not cover the disclosure of unclassified emails like the Democratic messages, so prosecutors would have to come up with a theory in which publishing them violated some other law. Even if they could find one, a 2001 Supreme Court ruling held that the First Amendment did not permit prosecutors to charge someone with a crime for publishing or broadcasting information so long as no law was broken in acquiring it -- even if the source who provided it did something illegal to obtain it.
No one has suggested that the Russians needed or had any help from Mr. Assange in hacking Democrats' emails. And Mr. Assange has denied knowing who his source was; at the time, Russian military intelligence officers created the fictitious online persona of a hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0 to disseminate and call attention to the files, although evidence that it was most likely a front for Russian intelligence was broadly discussed.
What about the statute of limitations?
Normally, the statute of limitations prevents prosecutors from charging people with a crime for actions that took place more than five years ago. However, a hacking provision cited in the indictment -- intruding into a government computer to obtain national security secrets -- has an eight-year limit. A grand jury returned the indictment of Mr. Assange on March 6, 2018, just before the eighth anniversary of the day that Mr. Assange is accused of entering into a conspiracy with Ms. Manning to violate that law.
There is an oddity: As part of the USA Patriot Act after the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress added that provision to a list of crimes that get an eight-year limit under a separate law titled "extension of statute of limitation for certain terrorism offenses." While Mr. Assange's case involves national security, it is not about terrorism. The "terrorism" heading most likely makes no legal difference, however -- just as prosecutors can use the words of the Espionage Act to charge leakers, not just spies.
Is a trial imminent?
No. Mr. Assange is widely expected to fight extradition to the United States by arguing in British court that his prosecution is politically motivated. That fight and inevitable appeals could take years to play out.

Texto completo: For press-freedom advocates, Julian Assange has long been a polarizing figure.
And his arrest Thursday in London once again ignited the seemingly endless debate:
Is the WikiLeaks founder, who until Thursday had been holed up in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London for years, essentially a publisher - though a notably strange one - who believes in taking radical steps to expose government secrets, and who thus should be afforded the same First Amendment protections given to news organizations?
Or is he a reckless traitor - and by no means a journalist - who deserves no such consideration and who should be prosecuted without worrying about free-press concerns?
The nature of the charge from the U.S. government will make a difference.
Assange is being charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, with the government claiming that he conspired with former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning - and that he helped Manning crack a classified Defense Department password.
He is not, notably, being charged under the Espionage Act, which has been used in recent years to go after journalists and their sources. Manning was imprisoned for seven years, in part for being found guilty of violating that act.
The question hinges on this: Did Assange cross a crucial line by allegedly encouraging the password hack - a line that no legitimate journalist would, or should, cross?
Assange's attorney certainly doesn't think so.
The charges, Barry Pollack said, "boil down to encouraging a source to provide him information and taking efforts to protect the identity of that source." And some journalists were quick to agree.
The prominent First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams said Thursday that he hadn't made up his mind fully on the case but that one thing relieved him. The indictment is narrow in scope, not based on what journalists do all the time: receive and publish classified information, he told CNN.
What Assange is accused of - breaking into secure government computers - "is fortunately not commonplace journalistic conduct."
Still, there's a substantial gray area here. And a troubling one.
"The indictment discusses journalistic practices in the context of a criminal conspiracy: using encryption, making efforts to protect a source's identity, and source cultivation," said University of Georgia media law professor Jonathan Peters.
Those practices, he told me, are not only routine and lawful, "they're best practices for journalists."
In fact, WikiLeaks and Assange - and certainly Edward Snowden's 2013 leak of vast amounts of government information, bringing widespread government surveillance to light - have helped to usher in a new era for journalists.
News organizations now provide secure drop boxes for sources.
They wisely use encryption applications such as Signal to converse with, and receive information from, sources.
That these practices are cast as part of the conspiracy "should worry all journalists, whether or not Assange himself is seen as a journalist," Peters said.
What is distinct, though, is the conspiracy to break the password on a secure network.
"That would distinguish Assange in practice from traditional journalists."
That Assange is such a strange, and to many, unsympathetic character may enter too much into the debate. He's hard to defend.
"When governments are trying to restrict press rights of any kind, the inclination is not to go after the most popular kid in the room - it's to go after the least popular," Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told me last year.
What WikiLeaks has consistently done, Timm said, "is publish information that is true and that the government considers secret."
Recall the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the Vietnam War, which Daniel Ellsberg nearly 50 years ago stole from the Pentagon and delivered to the New York Times and The Washington Post.
Even before the attempt to crack the password, Manning had given WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of classified records, prosecutors alleged. The material allegedly included four nearly complete databases, comprising 90,000 reports from the Afghanistan war, 400,000 reports from the Iraq War and 250,000 State Department cables, The Post reported Thursday.
The American Civil Liberties Union's director, Ben Wizner, remains firmly in Assange's corner.
Prosecuting him "would be unprecedented and unconstitutional and would open the door to criminal investigations of other news organizations."
I'm inclined to agree.
Yes, Assange crossed a line if he indeed conspired with his source to break a secure government password.
But the risks to news organizations of prosecuting him remain very real.
Before we turn our backs on Assange, we ought to think deeply about what's at stake.
Casting him to the wolves as nothing but a narcissistic, bad actor - "not like us," of course - may seem tempting.
But organizations that aren't so very different in their aims may suffer the consequences.
The gray area here is bigger than it looks - and so are the dangers to traditional journalism and the public interest.

Texto completo: A spokesman for an investment firm founded and headed by Ron Burkle is denying a report by the the New York Times that the Penguins co-owner is negotiating a deal to purchase The National Enquirer tabloid.
"I can confirm we are not in talks to buy the Enquirer," Frank J. Quintero, spokesman for The Yucaipa Companies, told the Tribune-Review.
The New York Times citing "two people with direct knowledge of the negotiations" reported that Burkle was in "deep" negotiations with American Media Inc., which owns The National Enquirer, but "the deal could still fall apart."
NY Times Tweet
The story prompted social media skepticism and speculation.

David J. Pecker, American Media's chief executive, reportedly paid $150,000 for a story from a Playboy model who claimed she had an affair with President Trump, but never published it in an attempt to aid Trump's presidential campaign.
Burkle reportedly invested $20 million in the Penguins when he and Mario Lemieux, along with dozens of minority owners, bought the franchise out of bankruptcy in 1999 for $107 million.
Forbes estimated late last year that the hockey franchise was worth $650 million. It estimated Burkle's net worth at $1.5 billion, according to Forbes.

Bret Easton Ellis turns to nonfiction to talk Trump, Kanye West, ‘American Psycho’ and our whiny culture in ‘White’

Texto completo: By the fall of 1990, Bret Easton Ellis had enjoyed the success of his debut novel “Less Than Zero,” seen it adapted by Hollywood, and published a second novel all before he’d turned 27.
And then “American Psycho” happened.
Or more accurately, at first it didn’t happen: Just weeks before publication, Simon & Schuster canceled the book amid outcry over the violence in the black satire about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer.
And then it was back on. Knopf plucked “American Psycho” off its rival publisher’s scrapheap and published it 1991 to widespread publicity that zigzagged between acclaim and scorn.
While Ellis found success with the book, and the movie adaptation that followed years later, in that moment of controversy something changed. These events would influence his perspective on the world, on the role of the independently minded individual and on the ability to be truly free. All this flows across the pages of “White,” his first-ever book of non-fiction, and first book at all in nine years.
“That for me was a wake-up call,” Ellis says recently from his home in West Hollywood just over the hills from the San Fernando Valley of his childhood and adolescence. “That a corporation was making decisions about what creatively a subsidiary could do creatively. What a publishing house was allowed to publish and was not allowed to publish.”
It was, Ellis says, his close-up look at a mob mentality, a hysteria over fiction that nearly no one, including all of the individuals and organizations arguing against “American Psycho,” had read.
“Like the cancellation was going to save something in America,” he says. “It was a moment. My friends were right. Jay McInerney (author of “Bright Lights, Big City,” which made a similar splash to that of “Less Than Zero”) said recently in the New York Times that he believes that’s where my freedom of expression and hating censorship and self-censorship really began.”
In “White,” which is crafted as a series of loosely themed essays, many of them adaptations of pieces originally written as monologues for “The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast,” Ellis shows readers where that mindset – fiercely independent, sometimes controversial, and always outspoken – has led him today.
“It came together very quickly in terms of the mood I was in at this moment,” he says. “And the changes I was feeling as a member of a generation who really, you know, was mostly noted for not really be able to take offense at anything, and finding myself forced into a way of thinking that I never that I would before.
“I never thought I would have been labeled or considered, as my democratic socialist boyfriend calls me, very much in the center, rather than what I always thought was a progressive gay guy.”
So what offends the 55-year-old Gen X-er today? He points to groupthink and virtue-signaling, trigger warnings and safe spaces, the culture of victimhood, and perhaps most of all, what Ellis views as the tension between the righteousness of rationality and logic and the wrongheadedness of emotion-fueled sensitivity, though he admits that inside his own home that distinction depends on one’s particular point of view.
“He thinks I’m nuts,” Ellis says of his 32-year-old millennial boyfriend of more than a decade now. “I’m over-emotional, I’m a drama queen, I don’t see anything rationally or with logic whatsoever.
“That is where we are,” he says, and laughs.
The book runs in a relaxed chronology, from an adolescence in the Valley focused on horror movies, the beauty of Richard Gere in “American Gigolo,” and the furtive pursuit of porn in the pre-digital age, to the publication of “Less Than Zero,” the unsatisfying adaptation into a movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Andrew McCarthy, the “American Psycho” controversy, and eventually, his dismay at the dismay of Democrats and the mainstream media at the rise of Trumpism in the United States.
Not because he agrees with Trump on much of anything, but because of his distaste for what he considers the dishonest arguments and overkill with which Trump foes attack him.
“I do think if this had been written, I don’t know, 10 years ago, I would have totally gone after the Tea Party and the birther movement or whatever,” Ellis says. “It’s always an extreme or something that is hysterical or so rooted in kind of fundamentalism that bothers me. I sensed that a lot in the last four years, and it’s just kind of gotten out of control.”
“White” will surely anger some readers, but if they’ve followed Ellis’ writing in fiction, journalism, or social media they shouldn’t be that surprised. His Twitter feed, in particular, was home to some of his darkest humor, eventually sparking so much outrage that he largely abandoned the platform but includes a chapter titled “Tweeting” in the book.”
“I loved Twitter,” he says. “A lot of it was funny, it was exciting. It was to titillate and outrage people, which is what creative people do. That is their instinct, to push boundaries. And then it started morphing.
“I guess it’s about power-grabbing, one group trying to shut down another group. Now it’s all negative, and it is not fun anymore.”
“White” closes with a section on Kanye West, a creative artist who like Ellis has had his share of public controversy. West approached Ellis to write a script for him, and they’ve worked on other projects in recent years, and Ellis says he quickly came to admire West for his iconoclasm and refusal to change to appease his critics.
“He has this notion of freedom that is extremely appealing to a lot of people,” he says. “Regardless of whether you agree with it all or not, he is really his own man. He’s contradictory, he makes mistakes, he falls down, he picks himself up.
“It’s not that I agree with Kanye 100 percent, I don’t,” Ellis says. “But I like the notion of Kanye, and I like that kind of person who is unencumbered by feeling he has to tell a narrative that he doesn’t believe in just to placate the press.”
Like West, Ellis has no interest in pacifying his public critics, though he says at home he and his boyfriend have reached a truce of sorts as the 2020 presidential campaigns begin, and his partner – “a committed Bernie bro” – rededicates himself to MSNBC’s coverage.
“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Trump's sister retires as federal judge, ending tax fraud investigation

Texto completo: President Trump’s older sister has retired as a federal appellate judge, ending an investigation into alleged tax misconduct.

Maryanne Trump Barry, 82, retired Wednesday, but filed to leave the bench in February, 10 days after a judicial conduct council said it was investigating complaints about her conduct, according to the New York Times.

The original investigation came after a report about how the wealth from Trump’s father, Fred Trump, was transferred to the president and his siblings to avoid taxes. Fred Trump, who died in 1999, was a real estate titan who had accrued millions during his lifetime. Barry is reported to have earned $182.5 million from her father’s empire.

Barry was the co-owner of a shell company, All County Building Supply and Maintenance, which the Trumps allegedly used to markup purchases already made by their employees and split the markup without estate or gift taxes.

Trump’s lawyer, Charles Harder, has disputed any claims of impropriety, saying the "allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory.”

The probe into Barry's conduct has been rendered moot because retired judges are not subject to judicial conduct rules.

Barry had been appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit in 1999 by President Bill Clinton.

“There are two rules in our house,” Ellis says. “We don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election, and we don’t don’t talk about the 2020 presidential election.”
Of course, he is talking about it that moment and eventually, he gets caught.
“He just opened the door and is glaring at me,” Ellis says, interrupting a different line of conversation to give a little play-by-play from his home office. “See? This is how I’m living. He opened the door, glared at me, and hissed. And then he closed the door.
“There it is, in a nutshell,” he says, and then he laughs some more.

Texto completo: Cuando este miércoles los medios de comunicación desplazados a Texas le preguntaron al presidente Donald Trump sobre quién ocuparía la secretaría del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) -después de la dimisión de Kirstjen Nielsen – su respuesta fue contundente: “Francamente, solo hay una persona llevando la política migratoria (…) ¿Saben quién es? Yo” .
Antes de salir hacia Texas, el presidente había asegurado que Stephen Miller -su asesor y una de las personas que provocó la salida de Nielsen- un chico excelente, una hermosa persona, un hombre brillante”.
Sin embargo, también según las palabras de Trump, “podría pasar” que Kevin McAleenan , actual secretario interino de DHS, continúe en el cargo de forma permanente. En todo caso, aseguró que “en este momento él (por McAleenan) es el indicado”. McAleenan es también comisionado del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP).
Este miércoles Donald Trump estuvo en San Antonio, Texas para recaudar fondos para su campaña. El discurso ante sus seguidores volvió a estar relacionado con las cuestiones fronterizas y la inmigración indocumentada. El presidente amenazó a los inmigrantes con enviar a más militares a la frontera porque, según él, las personas que cruzan “están muriendo en los campos”, incluso -añadió- “mujeres embarazadas”.
A pesar de que Trump dijo este martes que no está pensando en retomar la política de separación de familias , algunos medios (como NBC y The New York Times ) informaron de Trump ha estado eses solicitando que vuelva dicha medida bajo la denominada “ opción binaria “, pese a estar prohibido por órdenes judiciales. Esta petición podría ser una de las causas que desembocaran en la renuncia de Nielsen.
Otro de los hechos que apuntan al empeño del presidente por controlar la política migratoria es la retirada de la candidatura de Ronald Vitiello para dirigir al Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE).

Don't demonize the electoral college; The delegates at the Constitutional Convention didn't choose the way we elect the president to promote slavery.

Texto completo: To Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it embodies "a shadow of slavery's power." To the New York Times editorial board it represents "a living symbol of America's original sin." To filmmaker Michael Moore, it advances a "racist idea."
What is this evil incarnate, which numerous Democratic presidential candidates want abolished? The electoral college. But progressives misunderstand the institution in their campaign to pull it down in favor of simple majority rule.
Under the Constitution, each state receives the same number of presidential electors as it has senators and representatives. So tiny Wyoming enjoys three, while mighty California gets 53. State legislatures are free to choose any method to pick the electors and control how they vote -- all but two award every electoral vote to the candidate who wins the state popular vote.

Because you can win a majority of electoral college votes without winning a majority of the overall national vote, Donald Trump and George W. Bush were each elected president. Those Republican-friendly results trigger Democrats to want to toss the electoral college into history's dustbin.
Democrats defend their partisan agenda by arguing that the electoral college violates democracy. It is true that the system at least dilutes democracy. Critics ignore, however, that much of that effect is because of the states themselves. They choose to award their electoral votes using a winner-take-all approach. Regardless of whether Trump won Pennsylvania by 10,000 votes or by 500,000 votes, he received its 20 electoral votes and Hillary Clinton got zero.
If the American people wanted a direct election for president, they could force their states to divide their electors in proportion to the Republican and Democrat tallies, or even assign their electors to align their votes with the nationwide result. The more states that shifted from winner-takes-all, the more the electoral count would match the national popular vote. But instead, the indirect system, as the republic's framers conceived it, has endured.
The framers originally deliberated between selecting the president in Congress or by nationwide vote. As it turned out, the delegates to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention overwhelmingly opposed popular national elections because of the size of the new nation and its relatively poor communications. They feared two types of candidates would come too easily to the fore: "local sons" from the voters' own state, or "pretended patriots" and "active & designing men" -- demagogues who would rule through a tyranny of the majority (think President Nicolas Maduro, in Venezuela).
The framers also rejected having Congress select the chief executive, as European parliamentary systems do today, because it would make the latter too dependent upon the former.
The electoral college was proposed to be representative but also temper popular passions, and to prevent giving Congress too strong a hand in presidential selection. In most elections in our history, the winning candidate has had to assemble a geographically broad, and usually ideologically moderate coalition throughout the country.
Today's "woke" critique, however, focuses on racism. According to some scholars and commentators, the electoral college purposefully protected slavery by allocating electors based on the number of senators (thereby giving states more voice) and representatives (the Constitution infamously allowed slaves, who could not vote, to count as three-fifths of a person, thus inflating the voting power of slave states).
During the Philadelphia Convention, James Madison acknowledged that the electoral college provided a necessary compromise between free states and slave-holding states, where the popular vote was diminished because slaves couldn't vote. But that was the only time a framer actually connected slavery and the electoral college.
The racism critique ignores the nuances of history. When one looks closer, as Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz has pointed out in disavowing his own earlier thinking, the racism charge related to the electoral college "begins to unravel."
The framers sought to balance direct democracy and their fears about it, as well as state's rights and nationalist passions, when they came up with the electoral college filter for presidential elections. The connection to the three-fifths calculation, and its empowering of slave states, was coincidental, in Wilentz's word, more than purposeful.
The electoral college was far more democratic than the earlier system under the Articles of Confederation, which had no chief executive and where every state had an equal vote. And it had strong support among the convention's abolitionists.
Alexander Hamilton, who left the Philadelphia Convention for a week in the summer of 1787 to attend an abolitionist conference in New York, said of the scheme, "if it be not perfect, it is at least excellent." And when the Philadelphia delegations voted on the proposal, every free state voted in support, while every slave state except Virginia voted against it. This lineup makes no sense if the electoral college was secretly designed to perpetuate slavery and empower slave states.
Most important, the claim of racism ignores the Civil War. More than 600,000 Americans lost their lives in the battle to emancipate the slaves , and the Reconstruction amendments adopted thereafter removed the three-fifths clause among other legal prohibitions on equal rights. The electoral college is now no more racist than any of the other constitutional arrangements that mitigate direct democracy -- judicial review, which isn't responsive to popular will; the Senate, where states have equal representation regardless of size; anything that in turn requires Senate, but not House, consent.
The electoral college is a device that balances nationalism with states' rights and leavens democracy's passions with deliberation and reason. Today a system that can deny victory to the popular vote winner may seem out of step, but the framers designed it with many goals in mind, primarily to advance the people's voice over federalism's centrifugal forces and avoid congressional dominance of the president.
In the rush to demonize and demolish the electoral college, critics should recall G.K. Chesterton's counsel to zealous reformers everywhere: Don't take a fence down until you know the reason it was erected. And, we might add, if the reason still exists, the fence should probably stay put.

Texto completo: Special counsel Robert Mueller provides a "fuller explanation" on obstruction of justice in the report that will be released next week, Attorney General William Barr testified Wednesday.

During a hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., asked Barr if he had any conversation with Mueller about why he did did not reach a conclusion one way or the other on whether President Trump obstructed justice.

"Yes, I did. And he also has a fuller explanation of that in the report that I'll be making available hopefully next week," Barr replied.

Mueller concluded his months-long Russia investigation last month, after which Barr submitted a four-page letter that stressed the special counsel's did not find evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Barr also said Mueller left the obstruction question unresolved. A line taken from Mueller's final says, "while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him." Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein found there was a lack of “sufficient” evidence to determine whether Trump obstructed justice.

Barr appeared before a congressional committee for a second day in a row on Wednesday -- both hearings were intended to focus on the proposed Justice Department budget, but often got sidetracked with questions about Mueller's investigation.

In his appearance Tuesday, Barr said Mueller played no role in crafting the summary and added he suspects special counsel Robert Mueller's team "wanted more" out of his summary of the final report for the Russia investigation.

Democrats not satisfied with Barr's summary, who are angling to get access to Mueller's full report, were further incited by reports last week from the New York Times and Washington Post in which anonymous sources said members of Mueller's team were frustrated with the way Barr portrayed the findings in his summary.

In a March 29 letter, which followed the summary, Barr identified four categories of information that will not be made public in the redacted report he intends to release, including material related to grand jury proceedings which by law cannot be made public, information deemed by the intelligence community to compromise sensitive sources and methods, details that could affect other ongoing investigations — including those referred by the special counsel’s office to other offices — and material that would “unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.”

Barr testified Wednesday that he never "overruled" Mueller on any redactions.

The Judiciary Committee, ruled by Democrats, voted last week in favor of subpoenaing Barr to turn over the entire Mueller report.

However, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Tuesday his panel will not actually issue a subpoena for Mueller's full report until they see the redacted version provided by Barr.

NYT: Sanders promises tax returns by April 15

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said he plans to release 10 years of his tax returns by Monday, according to the New York Times.
In a story published Tuesday, Sanders told the the Times, "We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them."
Sanders currently leads in polls among declared candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Last week, his campaign said he raised more than $18 million in the first quarter, by far the most of any candidate who has reported fundraising results so far.
Sanders has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's failure to release his tax returns. The senator's delay in releasing his own return has left him vulnerable to accusation of being a hypocrite.
Sanders also never released his returns during his 2016 Democratic primary, saying there was no need because he failed to win the nomination.
Releasing tax returns ahead of Fox News appearance? Sanders is due to appear Monday in a town hall hosted by Fox News, a network the senator has called mostly "right-wing propaganda."
Sanders was pressed on when he would release his tax returns during a February appearance on a CNN town hall, as he was by Trevor Noah during a recent appearance on Comedy Central's The Daily Show.
CNN was later criticized for failing to disclosed that a person chosen to pose a question at the town hall had ties to Hillary Clinton, Sanders' 2016 primary opponent.
Sanders explained his reason for agreeing to the Fox appearance in an April 4 story by Amanda Terkel in Huffpost: "You've got to go into areas where people are. Working people need to know the truth, and that is that Donald Trump betrayed them, lied to them. And I intend to do that."
The Democratic National Committee last month barred Fox from hosting any of the party's primary debates, with DNC Chairman Tom Perez saying in a statement, "Recent reporting in the New Yorker on the inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration and Fox News has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates."

Texto completo: Headnote Trump makes move to dismantle government's immigration leadership; many to be pushed out
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump moved to replace the top ranks of the Department of Homeland Security on Monday, a day after forcing the resignation of its secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, as he accelerated a purge of the nation's immigration and security leadership.
The White House announced the departure of Randolph D. Alles, director of the Secret Service, who had fallen out of favor with the president even before a security breach at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida that the agency effectively blamed on Trump's employees.
Government officials, who asked not to be identified discussing personnel changes before they were announced, said at least two more top department figures were expected to leave soon as well: L. Francis Cissna, head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and John Mitnick, the department's general counsel and a senior member of Nielsen's leadership team.
The latest shake-up came just a day after Trump pushed out Nielsen during a Sunday afternoon meeting at the White House for not doing enough in his view to secure the border. And it came three days after Ronald D. Vitiello, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Services and the president's nominee to take the job permanently, was told to step aside so the administration could go in a "tougher direction," as Trump put it.
The wave of departures of officials originally installed by Trump seemed to underscore his growing frustration with his own administration's handling of immigration and other security issues. In recent days, Trump has threatened to close the southwestern border altogether only to back off and give Mexico a one-year warning in the face of concern about the economic effects of such a move.
The latest moves also appeared to be a house-cleaning of officials associated with John Kelly, the president's former chief of staff and his first homeland security secretary, who was pushed out at the end of last year after months of tension with Trump.
Alles, a retired Marine major general who goes by Tex and was the first person from outside the Secret Service to head the agency in more than a century, received instructions 10 days ago to come up with an exit plan and was expected to leave on his own timeline, according to officials familiar with the discussions. The president had soured on Alles a while ago, even making fun of his looks, calling him Dumbo because of his ears, two officials said.
The instruction to form an exit plan came before the arrest of a Chinese woman carrying a malware-laced device at Mara-Lago, exposing holes in the security of the private club. The Secret Service was so disturbed that it issued a statement faulting the Mar-a-Lago staff for not tracking its guests tightly enough.
Some Secret Service officials said Monday that they suspected that Alles' departure was accelerated in part because of the episode.
The White House made no mention of that in its statement announcing Alles' departure.
Alles "has done a great job at the agency over the last two years, and the president is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country," Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in the statement.
She said he will be replaced in May by James M. Murray, a career Secret Service official who has served as deputy assistant director overseeing protective operations.
Nielsen will be replaced on an acting basis by Kevin McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner.
Speaking with reporters Monday, Nielsen expressed no unhappiness about her departure and thanked Trump "for the tremendous opportunity" to serve her country and the employees of her department for their efforts to secure the nation.
"I share the president's goal of securing the border," she said. "I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border. And other than that, I'm on my way to keep doing what I can for the next few days."
But in recent weeks, Trump had asked Nielsen to close ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum-seekers, which she found ineffective and inappropriate, according to people briefed on the conversations.
She has been on the receiving end of presidential wrath for months. She arrived at the White House with a list of changes that she thought needed to be made to continue in the job, but Trump was determined to fire her. As one administration official put it, they had different meetings in mind when they sat down for 30 minutes alone in the White House along with only Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.
Congressional leaders were left Monday trying to sort through the changes and what they could mean.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, complained about "congressional dysfunction" in addressing border security, but added, "I am concerned with a growing leadership void within the department tasked with addressing some of the most significant problems facing the nation."

Trump inexplicably cedes the immigration hardline to Obama

Texto completo: Who knew that former President Barack Obama was more effective on deterring illegal immigration than President Trump, who claimed to care more about the issue than anyone else?

Trump said precisely that during a brief exchange with reporters Tuesday at the White House.

Asked about whether the administration was considering a return to the falsely named “family separation” policy for illegal immigrants who are caught crossing into the U.S., Trump said that it was an action that started under Obama. Trump then took credit for ending it in spite of its effectiveness.

His full answer, which referenced photos that went viral showing images of immigrant children in detention centers (“cages”):

"Obama separated the children, by the way. Just so you understand, President Obama separated the children. Those cages that were shown, I think they were very inappropriate. They were built by President Obama’s administration, not by Trump. President Obama had child separation. Take a look. The press knows, it, you know it, we all know it. I’m the one that stopped it. President Obama had child separation. Now, I’ll tell you something. Once you don’t have it, that’s why you see many more people coming. They’re coming like it’s a picnic, because ‘let’s go to Disneyland.’ President Obama separated children, they had child separation. I was the one that changed it. "

In the span of 20 seconds, Trump both blamed an Obama policy for the current border crisis and credited it as a deterrent for illegal border crossers. Figure that out.

There are reports that say Trump is considering reimplementing “zero-tolerance” for illegal aliens, which wasn’t so much a “policy” so much as it was a decision to fully enforce immigration law.

Trump backed down on it in 2018, though there was evidence it was working. No less than the New York Times reported on migrants who were thinking twice about unauthorized entry into the U.S.

“Maybe it’s best not to,” 21-year-old Yolanda Lopez of El Salvador told the paper in June 2018 after considering that her two young children would be taken from her. “What bad luck.”

Lucía Carmen Flores Sánchez, also of El Salvador, said she had planned on coming into the U.S. with her 8-year-old daughter, but after finding out about the “zero-tolerance” enforcement, she said it was “maybe better to stay” in Mexico, just south of California.

Trump is welcome to give it another go. But if he backs down again, he won’t be able to pin the blame on Obama.

Evangelicals, Trump and hypocrisy

Texto completo: "Ever since I've known him, he's been a good, moral person, a strong leader, a tough leader - and that's what this country needs. - Jerry Falwell Jr., regarding Donald Trump.
In West Virginia, Trump's net approval rate has dropped 14% since his election, from 62 percent approval, 25 disapproval to 59 percent vs 37 percent, according to a recent Morning Consult Poll. Trump has dropped in approval among various groups, but there is one segment that remains steady: white evangelicals.
Trump was elected with strong support from religious, Christian, white Americans, especially white evangelicals. While I struggled with this fact, I thought that I understood it. Maybe the average American did not know about or understand Trump's nefarious, immoral background and just didn't want another establishment person as president. I thought the situation would change as his numerous moral flaws became evident to good people.
But I was completely incorrect. Pew Research has been surveying this subject monthly for the last two years and Trump's support has been strong throughout.
While white evangelical support was at 78 percent in Feb. 2017, it's still very high two years later, at 69 percent. Compare this to the white Catholic support that is now at 44 percent.
For comparison, Trump's support is at: 20 percent for the religiously unaffiliated; 24 percent for Jews; and 18 percent for Muslims. Given his many bigoted remarks, these figures are not surprising. But why do white church goers, especially evangelicals, like Trump? Pew didn't ask, so we have to go elsewhere.
Reviewing the many articles written on this topic, their support is generated by the following factors:
Abortion: It is very clear that Trump has taken measures to endear himself to the anti-choice segment of Christians. He has appointed anti-choice judges and tried to cut family planning funding, among other measures. He's also implied that women getting abortions should be punished. Interestingly, before his political career began, Trump was "very pro-choice, as documented in a 1999 interview on NBC News. He reiterated these views in a 2011 interview with The New York Times.
Economy: Trump promised to use his business acumen to super charge and "turnaround the economy. Evangelicals believed that this would result in more jobs and greater prosperity for the poor. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics data, there was no turnaround. The economy went up and unemployment went down in the Obama era, a trend continuing under Trump.
However, although the economy has been good, the benefits have not gone to the poor, but rather to the wealthy. For example, the tax cut spurred the economy, but The Washington Post termed it "a gift to the rich because hardly any benefits were received by the middle class or lower class. Meanwhile, the deficit has grown tremendously and the new Trump budget cuts social programs benefiting the poor in order to try to rebalance the budget due to the cuts.
Defense/Foreign affairs: Trump campaigned on taking a hard line on foreign policy and being a friend of Israel. He has asked for increased military spending. He did move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and has supported Netanyahu's government. However, he has also ruined our relations with NATO while cozying up to Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-Un, Duarte in the Philippines and other dictators. And, he has ignored warnings from our intelligence agencies about the threats that Russia and North Korea pose.
Values: There is much to say on this topic, with evangelicals supporting someone who has been married three times, paid off a porn star while cheating on his wife and been cited for sexual harassment by over a dozen women. That's not to mention his constant lies and irregular business dealings. But, for the sake of space, let's just examine Trump and gay rights. Prior to his election, Trump appeared to be very accepting of the LBGTQ community and had significant support, especially after he condemned the Orlando gay club attack in 2016. After the election, it was a different story. He has banned transgender military members, appointed anti-LBGTQ judges who support "traditional marriage, and promoted so-called "religious liberty bills designed to use religion to discriminate against the LBGTQ community.
Essentially, the reason for Trump's support by evangelicals can be summed up in his statement to the 2017 Values Voter Summit: "How times have changed. But you know what, now they're changing back. Apparently, there is a segment of white Americans, including evangelicals, who are longing for the "good old days. As long as white, church-attending evangelicals believe his words, they will vote for him, regardless of his personal immorality or obvious hypocrisy.

BERNIE SCHEDULES SUNDAY RALLY IN OAKLAND

Texto completo: As Democratic hopefuls for the presidency frequent Iowa and New Hampshire early in the race for 2020, Pittsburgh is set to get its first visit from a contender this weekend.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will hold a rally at 5 p.m. Sunday in Schenley Plaza in Oakland, his campaign announced Monday. The senator's visit will be part of a three-day battleground tour in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania - states that were key to Donald Trump's victory in 2016.
The Democrats' strongest path to winning back the presidency "runs through the upper Midwest," where Mr. Sanders' message is primed for victory, the senator's campaign wrote in its announcement.
That message: trade, unions and health care.
"[Mr. Sanders] will deliver a message focused on fighting against unfair trade deals that undermine workers' wages and enrich CEOs, rebuilding and strengthening unions and guaranteeing health care as a right to all with Medicare for All," the announcement reads.
Mr. Sanders, who officially launched his campaign in early March, is one of 18 Democrats who have declared for 2020 so far, according to a list compiled by The New York Times.
"We're going to bring our country together to fight for an agenda that works for all of us and not just the people on top," Mr. Sanders said at a summit last week in Washington, D.C.
The Vermont senator ran for the Democratic nomination in 2016 but fell short to Hillary Clinton. Along the way to the nomination, Ms. Clinton won Pennsylvania by about 12 percentage points.
But Mr. Sanders' brand of progressive politics has garnered praise - and victories - in the region recently. John Fetterman, a progressive Democrat backed by Mr. Sanders, won Pennsylvania's lieutenant governorship in 2018.
Earlier in the year, two members of the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America - Summer Lee and Sara Innamorato - beat a pair of longtime Democratic incumbents in state House primaries.
"What does it tell me? It tells me that when candidates run on a progressive agenda, when they mount strong grassroots campaigns involving in this case hundreds of people, there's no way they're going to lose," Mr. Sanders told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in July 2018.
Mr. Sanders' rally is free and open to the public.

Texto completo: When Trisha Yearwood came off a three-year world tour with Garth Brooks just in time for Christmas in 2017, the last thing she expected was to hear her husband say he'd like to get back on the road and do it all again – but in stadiums.
After all, that last tour was his first in 13 years.
"I thought he would maybe be like 'OK, I'm gonna take a break. I don't know if we're gonna do this ever like this again,'" Yearwood says with a laugh. "And then, because he's Garth, he's like 'We never really have done stadiums. What do you think?'"
It's been fun, she says, to watch as her husband approaches this stadium tour as though he's never toured before.
He's come up with "a brand new stage, a brand new look, some different elements to make every show in every city different," Yearwood says. "So as his wife and as a fellow artist, it's been really cool to see him take this on as 'I want people that see this show to say, 'Oh my gosh, I've never seen that.'"
Another thing that's different about this tour is that Yearwood isn't on the bill, although she will be hosting Trisha's Tailgate in the parking lot before the shows.
Back to 'Trisha business' "This is a Garth show," Yearwood says. "This past year I spent working on two new albums. I haven't made new music in a while. So I said, 'I would like to not be on the ticket.' That doesn't mean I won't make an appearance at a show now and then. But I also have other Trisha business I need to do. So I'd like the freedom to do that."
Yearwood laughs and says, "I didn't know at the time that I would end up in the parking lot, doing tailgates. I jokingly say, 'Garth's in the stadium and I'm in the parking lot.'"
It's not that she didn't love sharing the spotlight with her husband on that last tour.
"It really was a good experience," she says. "I've been making records since '91, so I've done a lot of touring. And I thought my favorite place was these small intimate theaters. But the Garth tour is its own thing. I've never been to a more energetic show in my life. So I got the opportunity of coming out in the middle of his set into all that energy and my job was just to kind of hold my own out there and not bring the energy down for when he came back out. I learned a lot. I learned how to perform in an arena."
There was no question, she says, as to whether or not she'd be joining Brooks on tour, even after opting out of a spot on the ticket.
"When we got married, we said we don't want to be together to be apart. So we really have tried for these 14 years to make sure we make our plans where we don't have to spend very much time apart."
Hosting a tailgate party is a natural for Yearwood.
"I'm a sports girl," she says. "So I know about tailgating for, you know, Georgia Bulldogs games. But when we did the world tour, we'd pull up for soundcheck and I'd notice that people were tailgating for the show. I guess I was late to the party on that. I didn't realize that everybody was doing that."
She did her first Trisha's Tailgate before last year's one-off show at Notre Dame.
"And it went really well," she says. "So we decided to do this in every city. We have a tent set up and there's gonna be seven or eight Trisha foods. There's gonna be games and drinks. I'm gonna do a food demo. It's just kind of a hangout for several hours before you can go in to see the stadium show."
Why she loves to cook It's the sort of menu you'd expect if you've seen "Trisha's Southern Kitchen," a Food Network series that features Yearwood cooking Southern meals for her family and friends.
"I'd love to say I had this planned, but honestly, it was a happy accident," Yearwood says of the show. "I wrote a cookbook with my mom and my sister for fun. I never dreamed that there would even be a second cookbook. But when had a New York Times best-seller, the TV shows started calling. I actually thought, 'I don't know if it would be fun to stand behind a counter and tell people to add the butter' or whatever. But the Food Network was great about saying It can be whatever you want it to be. So we created this show that was a very off-the-cuff, not-scripted show that really was the book come to life. Telling the family story. Having my family, my sister and my best buddies on the show. We laugh a lot. And I think I represent most cooks because I'm not a chef. Most people cook like I do."
Yearwood's parents were amazing cooks, she says.
"So my sister and I growing up, our jobs were usually things like setting the table and cracking the ice cubes, because we didn't have an ice maker."
It wasn't until she'd gone off to college that she learned to cook.
"I moved into an apartment," she says. "And I didn't know how to make anything. So I called home and I think the first recipe my mother gave me is her potato salad, which is very Southern and has, like, four ingredients. When I made it and it tasted like hers, I thought 'Oh my gosh, I can do this.' I missed home, I missed my family and I was able to feed myself and my friends and also to create that feeling of comfort from home. There's such a connection there."
Her tailgate party is a benefit for Habitat for Humanity, which she and Brooks have been involved with for "probably 10 years now," she says.
"Garth and I started with Habitat a couple years after Katrina. We went to New Orleans and really we thought we were going to be celebrities that did a couple interviews and swung a hammer for a photograph. And we got hooked. I mean, that day, I learned how to frame a wall. I learned how to put a window in. I was like, 'I want to do this.' It's wonderful to give money. And we do that. We also sign items for charity. There are great ways to give. But getting in and getting your hands dirty, working alongside the homeowners, because Habitat's motto, which I love, is 'a hand up not a handout.' If you're gonna live in this house, you put in sweat equity. If they can't build for some reason, they work in the office, stuffing envelopes or whatever. They earn this home."
'Let's Be Frank' In February, she released a Frank Sinatra tribute album titled "Let's Be Frank."
"I've wanted to make a standards record for about 20 years," she says. "I grew up with my mom's music, which was a lot of things but she really loved old movies and musicals, so I knew all these songs since I was a kid."
That desire to do a full album of standards became more focused on Sinatra songs a couple years ago.
"The Grammys did a 100th birthday tribute to him," Yearwood says. "And Don Was was the musical director. He and I had worked together before and he said 'Have you ever thought about making an album of these songs?' I was like, 'Yes, I think about that all the time.'"
She assembled a list, Yearwood says, of about 100 songs.
"My criteria was if Frank recorded it, it was fair game," she says. "So there's a mix of really well-known, almost written-for-Frank songs and other songs like 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' that you might associate more with Judy Garland but Frank recorded it. And it was a real joy to make. I worked on it at Capitol Records in L.A., where Frank recorded a lot of his music, with a 55-piece orchestra and got to sing on his microphone."
She's had live strings on records before, she says. "But I've never recorded live like that where you walk into the room and you're another instrument. It's never more pressure because it's not like you can punch in if somebody makes a mistake. You have to start over. So I didn't want to be the one person out of 56 who went, 'Ugh, I didn't come in right there. Can we start over again?'"

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award at a ceremony next month, the Kennedy Library Foundation announced Sunday.
The California Democrat is being recognized for leading "with strength, integrity, and grace under pressure — using her power to protect the most vulnerable of our citizens," former ambassador Caroline Kennedy, the foundation's honorary president, said in a statement.
"She is the most important woman in American political history and is a true Profile in Courage," Kennedy said.
The award, created in 1989, is among the most prestigious in politics. It is meant to identify heirs to the people profiled by President John Kennedy in his 1957 book, "Profiles in Courage."
Winners are chosen each year by a bipartisan committee of political, business, and academic leaders. Previous recipients include the late senator John McCain of Arizona and former presidents Barack Obama, Gerald Ford, and George H.W. Bush.
In announcing this year's award, the foundation cited Pelosi's work spearheading the 2010 Affordable Care Act, Democrats' subsequent loss of the House, and Pelosi's "persistence and determination as she set out to rebuild the Democratic Party in the image of America" and eventually reclaim the speakership last year.
Pelosi called the award "a powerful testament to the extraordinary legacy and leadership of President Kennedy."
Caroline Kennedy and Jack Schlossberg, the foundation's president and a grandson of the late president, will present the award to Pelosi at a ceremony May 19 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.
Washington Post
Democratic campaign arm nears war with liberals
The House Democratic campaign arm is nearing open warfare with the party's rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard-fought campaign next year to preserve the party's shaky majority.
Progressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois — the chairwoman of the campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee — moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge, went so far as to encourage her 3.8 million Twitter followers to “pause" their donations to the campaign committee in protest. She also started a fund-raising push on her official Twitter account for Representatives Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Katie Hill of California, and Mike Levin of California. That initiative, Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter, raised $30,000 in roughly two hours. She also helped raise money for Representatives Katie Porter of California and Lauren Underwood of Illinois.
The open hostilities are just the latest in the rising tensions between an experienced party establishment focusing on what is possible in the short run and a group of young liberals chafing at such restraint. House Democrats have divided over single-payer “Medicare for All" versus incremental legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and over Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal versus less ambitious climate change policies. Liberal Democrats and more moderate newcomers from Republican-leaning districts have fought over Republican procedural motions.
And divisions on health care, climate change, military spending, and tax policy persuaded the House Budget Committee chairman, John Yarmuth of Kentucky, last week to give up on drafting a budget that would have laid down a broad legislative agenda for the new Democrat-controlled House.
Now that tension has migrated to the mechanics of the 2020 campaign.

Booker raises $5 million in first quarter of 2020 race
Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced on Sunday that his presidential campaign had raised more than $5 million in the first quarter of the year.
Booker's total is among the smallest fund-raising figures to be voluntarily disclosed so far by a Democratic candidate, though it is still expected to outpace others; nearly a dozen candidates have yet to announce their first-quarter numbers.
Six candidates have released their totals: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he raised $18.2 million; Senator Kamala Harris of California raised more than $12 million; former representative Beto O'Rourke raised $9.4 million; and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., raised $7 million. Booker outpaced only political newcomer Andrew Yang, who said he raised $1.7 million.
In addition to the money he raised, Booker has $4.1 million in his Senate campaign account that he is eligible to transfer to a presidential campaign.
Booker declined to disclose how many people had contributed to his campaign or the number of contributions he received.
The full fund-raising reports are due on April 15.

Larry Kudlow calls criticisms of Moore and Cain 'unfair'
President Trump "stands behind" Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, his picks for two open seats on the Federal Reserve Board, the top White House economic adviser said.
Criticism of the pair for being insufficiently qualified or too partisan for the independent central bank is "unfair," said Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." Moore and Cain, if confirmed, would represent Trump's view that economic growth is not, by nature, inflationary, he said.
Kudlow didn't directly call for a change in Fed interest rate policy, as he and Trump have done recently.

What happened when Patriot Prayer went to B.G. City Council

Texto completo: Things got a little bit emotional at last nightï¿½s Battle Ground City Council meeting where Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson and others tried to convince the council to take action against a gun control initiative passed by voters last fall.
During the meeting, there was talk about voter nullification, Nazi Germany, ï¿½sheepleï¿½ and Gov. Jay Insleeï¿½s presidential run. The meeting ended with an outburst and was followed by dueling social media posts about socialism and upholding the Constitution.
Washington voters passed Initiative 1639 with nearly 60 percent of the vote last fall. Since then, Gibson and other activists have been appearing before local city councils in hopes of persuading them to adopt an ordinance limiting local law enforcementï¿½s role in enforcing the law.
Over the last month, Gibson and others have viewed the city of Battle Ground as the most receptive to adopting an ordinance. His group held four events in the city in hopes of persuading the city council to get on board. A day after holding his most recent rally, Gibson and others appeared before Battle Ground City Council.
ï¿½Itï¿½s a slippery slope, and weï¿½re going to go over to a bad place if we donï¿½t do something,ï¿½ Gibson said after recounting a story about a woman who was arrested and tortured in Nazi Germany after being caught giving out dissenting fliers.
He said that there may be people on the city council who ï¿½believe in freedom but they are afraid.ï¿½ He encouraged them that ï¿½anything thatï¿½s worthwhile is scary.ï¿½
Several members of the city council seemed sympathetic yet cautious. Councilor Brian Munson said that while the initiative passed, a majority of Battle Ground voters cast ballots against it. He said that he wanted the city attorney to evaluate the cityï¿½s options and find a way to ï¿½have a voice.ï¿½ But he said, ï¿½if we canï¿½t do that, we canï¿½t do that.ï¿½ He also called out Inslee, who has come under scrutiny for increased security costs as he runs for president.
ï¿½He has armed bodyguards,ï¿½ Munson said. ï¿½Weï¿½re not taking away his guns.ï¿½
Councilors Shane Bowman and Steven Phelps also seemed supportive. But Councilor Philip Johnson said that the proposed ordinance amounted to ï¿½voter nullificationï¿½ and would go against the will of ï¿½free American citizens,ï¿½ not ï¿½sheeple.ï¿½
As he spoke, the crowd grew testy. In a video of the meeting posted to Facebook, people can be heard yelling ï¿½You canï¿½t enslave us!ï¿½ ï¿½Itï¿½s a shame!ï¿½ and ï¿½You will be voted out shortly, pal!ï¿½
Mayor Mike Dalesandro struck his gavel and told the crowd that there would be no more outbursts and he would eject the next person who spoke out. Johnson continued with his remarks saying he believed in the system.
ï¿½Itï¿½s not Mr. Insleeï¿½s law; itï¿½s not Mr. Fergusonï¿½s law; itï¿½s your neighborsï¿½ law,ï¿½ Johnson said, referring to the governor and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson.
Dalesandro said that heï¿½s received many phone calls and emails and that he agreed that there are portions of the law that are ï¿½flawed.ï¿½ But he said that change would come from the courts or the Legislature and cautioned the council on proceeding with an ordinance.
ï¿½I want to be honest,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½I donï¿½t see a path for an ordinance for me.ï¿½
Earlier today, Dalesandro took to Facebook and Twitter to criticize Gibson for a ï¿½disrespectful outburstï¿½ that was directed toward a ï¿½26-year Army veteranï¿½ who serves on the city council, almost certainly a reference to Johnson. Dalesandro reiterated his position that an ordinance would be outside the councilï¿½s scope.
Gibson initially responded with a Facebook post stating that he had an outburst after listening to a city council member say ï¿½he doesnï¿½t care if 51 percent of the population votes to enslave the other 49 percent.ï¿½ Gibson wrote that he became ï¿½extremely emotional and I should have not acted that way.ï¿½ He also wrote he was trying to stop a civil war while Dalesandro was controlled by the Democratic Party.
By afternoon, one of Gibsonï¿½s conciliatory posts appear to be taken down. Patriot Prayer later posted pictures that Dalesandro had taken on a February trip to Washington, D.C., of him with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described ï¿½democratic socialistï¿½ from New York.
ï¿½Is Battle Ground filled with socialists who want to control your life?ï¿½ read the post. ï¿½I have a feeling that Battle Ground is going to wake up to who this man really is. We believe in freedom up here, NOT SOCIALISM OR COMMUNISM.ï¿½
The post included the mayorï¿½s contact information.
Herrera Beutler and ï¿½Abortion Survivorsï¿½
U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, signed a petition Tuesday to bring the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote.
S. 311 would ï¿½prohibit a health care practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the case of a child who survives an abortion or attempted abortion,ï¿½ according to the text of the bill. It was introduced by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., on Jan. 31.
ï¿½Saving the lives of babies that are born alive shouldnï¿½t even be a debate. Today, I joined my colleagues in signing the discharge petition to bring the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act for a vote in the House,ï¿½ Herrera Beutler tweeted. ï¿½Any elected officials who do not support saving the lives of babies that survived #abortion should have to go on the record saying so.ï¿½
Of course, ï¿½#abortionï¿½ is rarely that simple in practice. The scenario the bill would seek to address ï¿½ a mother seeking to terminate a viable fetus that can survive outside the uterus, usually at 22 to 24 weeks into pregnancy ï¿½ is rare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that less than 1 percent of all abortions are done after 24 weeks. By that stage, many abortions in that category are a result of severe fetal abnormalities, or because the mother faces health- or life-threatening complications if she continues to carry the pregnancy.
So who would this bill likely affect? From a New York Times interview with a spokesman for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:
A fetus on the very cusp of viability, with a mother who needs to induce labor because her body is suffering from a potentially deadly condition like pre-eclampsia, or
A fetus discovered to have a severe abnormality late in the pregnancy. In that case, the doctor may induce labor knowing the fetus is unlikely to survive.
Faced with this decision, and under counsel from their doctors, many parents request ï¿½comfort careï¿½ ï¿½ inducing labor, holding their premature baby and letting him or her die naturally. Under this act, doctors who provide comfort care instead of attempting resuscitation ï¿½shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than five years, or both,ï¿½ according to the billï¿½s text.
As it stands, itï¿½s highly unlikely the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives will bring S. 311 to the floor for a vote.
A similar Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, or H.R. 2175, is already on the books. In 2002, the legislation established that any fetus born alive at any stage of development qualifies as a ï¿½ï¿½person,ï¿½ ï¿½human being,ï¿½ ï¿½childï¿½ and ï¿½individual.ï¿½ ï¿½ Critics argue that 2019ï¿½s revisit is less about saving lives and more a bad faith attempt by pro-life members of Congress to reframe the conversation around abortion into one about infanticide. Perhaps they heard the House minority whip, U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., call the bill a response to ï¿½a public uprising against the process of murdering babiesï¿½ earlier this week.

Texto completo: Sales for Michelle Obama's memoir "Becoming" are still rising. Penguin Random House says the book has sold more than 10 million copies - including hardcover, audio- and e-books - since it came out in November. That puts it near (or at) the top of all-time memoir sales. On its first day, it sold an astounding 725,000; within 15 days, 2 million in North America. Soon it also became a No. 1 seller abroad, in Britain, Germany and Greece, among many others.
Obama's book tour also has been magnetic, with the original 10 cities expanded by 21. Coming up: Copenhagen, Stockholm and Paris; Nashville, on May 12, is the final stop. (Washington Post)
National Poetry Month events: Two well-known ODU poets will read from their newest works on Thursday in Virginia Beach. They are Luisa Igloria and Renee Olander. Igloria's latest, "The Buddha Wonders if She is Having a Mid-Life Crisis," considers the constant dynamic between human desires and the longing for grace. Olander's, "American Dangerous," explores rape, bias against interracial relationships, class, and her parents' death.
Details: 12:30 p.m. Reception follows. Lecture Hall, 244, ODU Virginia Beach, 1881 University Drive. Parking in Lot 3. Free. 757-368-4108. Live-streaming to the Peninsula and Tri-Cities centers and online.

For the workshop: members, $10; others, $20. Tidewater Community College, Blackwater Building, 1700 College Crescent, Virginia Beach. Details: hamptonroadswriters.org; email hrwriters@cox.net to reserve.
Snap it up: Ruth Reichl's new book, "Save Me the Plums," a memoir of her decade heading Gourmet magazine - till Conde Nast unexpectedly killed it in late 2009. (Random House, 288 pp.) "Although it was easy to paint Gourmet as the food magazine for the elite," The New York Times reported at the time, "it was a chronicler of a nation's food history, from its early fascination with the French culinary canon to its discovery of Mediterranean and Asian flavors to its recent focus on the source of food and the politics surrounding it." Reichl's "My Kitchen Year: 136 Recipes that Saved My Life" detailed the end of Gourmet and her year cooking to deal with it.
Headed for TV: Candace Bushnell's "Sex and the City" follow-up. "Is There Still Sex in the City?" won't see print till August, but Paramount Television and Anonymous Content have bought it for a series. This volume, like its predecessor, is an essay collection; it deals with the lives of people over 50. (Washington Post)

new and recent
From short-story master Amy Hempel, "Sing to It" (Scribner, 192 pp.). This, her first collection since 2006, "consists of 15 characteristically bold, disconcerting, knockout stories," said a reviewer for Publishers Weekly. "The title story, which fits on a single page, offers no plot, names, dates, or setting - just snippets of dialogue, a proverb, and a gesture to capture a moment of personal connection."
"Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt" by Arthur C. Brooks (Broadside, 256 pp.).

Texto completo: White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said recently that he could guarantee Americans would not lose health coverage if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in a court challenge.
Apparently, MAGA means unaffordable health care
By Frederick Isasi
At a time when one in four Americans are forgoing needed health care because they simply can't afford to see their doctor or buy their prescription drugs, the Trump administration is making the situation worse.
It is waging war on some of our country's most vulnerable people — children, the terminally ill, people with disabilities and the elderly — by urging the complete judicial repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Such an action would leave millions of families without health care coverage, their health care costs would increase exponentially, and our nation would erase hard-won protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
Is this what making America great again looks like? Having people choose between paying rent or buying critical medication that keeps them alive? Apparently, to the Trump administration, it does.

Beyond supporting judicial activism to repeal the ACA, President Donald Trump's administration has authorized multiple forms of junk insurance coverage that can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, deny essential health benefits like life-saving prescription drugs, refuse to cover catastrophic medical costs, and destabilize the consumer-protected market by luring young and healthy adults out of that market.
In sharp contrast to this, we see action from Congress to support meaningful coverage and financial security for our nation's families. For example, Democratic House chairs have introduced the Protecting Americans with Pre-existing Conditions Act, which repeals policies that permit the broad operation of the president’s junk health insurance policies.
Let's be clear, people's lives and the future of our nation’s families hang in the balance. Take, for example, the Eilers family in California. Nine-year-old Myka was born with an undiagnosed heart defect and, as a result, will forever be labeled as having a pre-existing condition. She spent the first few weeks of her life in the neonatal intensive care unit and had two open heart surgeries before her first birthday. At some point, she will require a heart valve replacement. Without the ACA and the protections it offers for individuals with pre-existing conditions, the Eilers worry that Myka will be unable to secure coverage for her heart, or that she will be subject to the return of lifetime caps.
We live in one of the wealthiest nations in the world. We spend twice as much on health care than other high-income nations on health care. The Eilers and all in our nation deserve the ability to receive the health care they need to live to their greatest potential. It is one of the most important measures of our society, and it's what making America great truly looks like.

What others are saying
Nicholas Bagley, The New York Times: "The Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over, that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress, and that it doesn’t care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone. It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They’ll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration’s zealous commitment to taking away their health care. "
Alexandra Petri, The Washington Post: "The GOP is the party of health care! The Justice Department is asking an appeals court to invalidate the entire ACA, but don't worry, the GOP is going to be 'the Party of Great HealthCare,' and it is going to replace what currently exists (a health care system) with something even better: the void; oblivion; the rush of wings of an enormous eagle departing, never to return!"
Robert Henneke and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, FoxNews. com: "First, President Donald Trump is recommitting our nation to health care freedom and to removing the constraints placed on market forces. Second, he is putting the force of the Department of Justice behind the very legitimate constitutional issue originally raised. . . . Instead of letting fear and tepidity rule the day, we should embrace the opportunity to present a third way for health care in America, a way past the current broken regulated 'managed' care system — made worse by Obamacare — and the top-down, budget-busting 'Medicare for All. ' "
What our readers are saying
If Republicans have a great health care plan — better than what we have with the Affordable Care Act — why don't they present it in Congress? The answer is easy: They simply do not have a plan.
— Ed Wilts
Translation on Mick Mulvaney's guarantee that no one would lose their coverage even if the ACA were to be struck down: We're going to say whatever we need to say so we can repeal Obamacare and replace it with Trumpcare, which will be the exact same thing only with a different name that Republicans will unanimously love simply because it has Trump's name on it.
— Austin Williams
Mulvaney's point is probably that insurance will still be available, but you may no longer be able to afford it — and that is your problem.
— Joseph Breckenridge
Coverage is not really the issue. What is covered and the costs are the issue. We need an affordable national health insurance that guarantees care for all, just like some of the other high-income countries.
— Patricia Tally

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Texto completo: UNION (Union) – Chelsea Clinton is a household name thanks to her parents. When it comes to children's literature, however, she's making a name for herself on her own.
Clinton, the only child of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State and U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and a best-selling author, presented a sold-out discussion, book signing and audience Q&A at Kean University's Enlow Recital Hall Thursday night, which centered on her fifth children's book "Don't Let Them Disappear."
The book, which was released Tuesday, focuses on the rate at which endangered animals are disappearing around the globe and what the public can do to help solve the problem. Each section introduces young readers to a new endangered animal, including elephants, rhinos and pandas, and shares what makes them special and what we can do to help them survive.
The event, which drew a crowd of 500 adults and children and was moderated by former state Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak, was Clinton's second stop on her "Don't Let Them Disappear" tour, her only Garden State appearance.
Lesniak, who established the Lesniak Institute for American Leadership – an event co-sponsor – as well as Kean's Distinguished Lecture Series, advocates for several causes, including animal welfare.
Lesniak said even he, who worked to make New Jersey the first state in the nation to ban ivory transactions to save elephants from poachers and to ban imports of trophies of endangered species, learned a lot from "Don't Let Them Disappear."
"This is also a book for adults," he said. Clinton, who spoke in accessible language for both children and adults, said that currently she is focusing on young readers because "It's never too early to start highlighting the issues in our communities."
"I think that kids' books are one of the first ways that we tell kids what's possible and what's not, expand their imaginations and show that we value them," Clinton said. "They're little people who are a part of our families and our communities."
Clinton, who also said that she has always loved to write, continued that when she became a parent, she realized that there was a lack of female voices in children's books, which inspired her to write her own.
"So many kids' books are told from a male perspective, so I tried to center my books on women's voices," said Clinton, who also wrote The New York Times-bestselling picture book "She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World." "As a parent, I noticed that it was always a male cat or a male duck speaking."
Clinton said that she also noticed when asking children which issues they cared about, one that always resonated was that of the plight of animals, so it was only natural to choose the theme for her next children's book.
In the discussion, Clinton shared facts about endangered animals, such as there are more tigers in the United States in captivity than there are wild tigers around the world, many of which are in private hunting ranges.
"What kind of person would kill an animal to display it on the wall?" Lesniak said. "Pope Francis said that anyone who is cruel to an animal is also likely to be cruel to human beings. That's why your book is so good. You will teach kids that this is not acceptable."
Clinton also shared facts about the ivory trade and elephants, which she said, "is the first animal that I fell in love with."
"Kids need to say to their parents and grandparents that ivory always looks better on an elephant than it does on your wrist," she said. "Parents are influenced by their kids' decisions and we need to save elephants, which are a keystone specie – meaning that many other animals rely on them."
Clinton continued to say that civilization is a domino effect, meaning that when important species are gone, others will follow – including humans, Lesniak pointed out.
"What's the seventh mass extinction? It's us," he said. "Scientists say that in 50 years, one-third of New Jersey will be underwater if we do not take dramatic action on climate change. We live on this earth together and we don't want to be the seventh mass extinction."
Clinton ended her discussion on a positive note, pointing out that it was kids who helped to save the bald eagle, which was once an endangered species.
"A lot of kids pushed for the preservation of bald eagles when they were on the brink of extinction in the 1970s," she said. "Kids said, 'No, we don't want a bald eagle head in our schools and in our home. We can appreciate them from a picture.'"
Gloria Montalto, a Kean University professor, said she attended the discussion in part because one of her grandchildren is an environmentalist. She said she was impressed at the depth of knowledge about endangered species and the environment that Clinton showed during the discussion.
"My biggest takeaway was that she was very well-informed, and she is wise beyond what her children's book says," Montalto said.
Deborah Linder, another Kean University professor who attended the discussion, said that as an educator, she appreciated Clinton's work for children.
"As a professor, I found her approach intriguing that she tries to work through kids to solve these issues," Linder said. "If you wait until they're older, it's too late and the bad habits are already formed."

Texto completo: A new adaptation of a classic novel debuts on HBO. And Kit Harington hosts "Saturday Night Live."
What's on TV
NATIVE SON (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. The conceptual artist Rashid Johnson makes his feature-directing debut in this adaptation of the 1940 novel by Richard Wright. Ashton Sanders ("Moonlight") stars as Bigger, a rebellious bike messenger in the South Side of Chicago with big ambitions. Opportunity arrives when a wealthy white businessman, Henry Dalton (Bill Camp), offers him $1,000 a week to be his chauffeur, and suddenly Bigger is thrust into a world of money, luxury and power. His hopes for a better life collapse, though, when a night alone with Henry's spoiled daughter (Margaret Qualley) ends in tragedy. James Baldwin was famously hostile toward Wright's novel; he argued that Bigger's character perpetuated the stereotype that black men are predisposed to violence. And that view didn't go unnoticed. "Baldwin's criticism is unavoidable," Johnson said in an interview with The New York Times. He added: "I mean, now, Wright and Baldwin are so matched together, that it would be foolish and disingenuous to tell the story without taking into account what we know."
TRUE LOVE BLOOMS (2019) 8 p.m. on Hallmark. The premise of this will-they-won't-they romance comes from the mind of one of its stars, Sara Rue ("Will & Grace.") As a child, Rue worked in a community garden in Manhattan that was demolished to make way for a new building. That memory stuck with her, and here she gives it a twist: Rue plays Vikki, an urban gardener who fights to save her plot of land from a hunky real estate developer (Jordan Bridges) who threatens to replace it with condos. Because this is from Hallmark, viewers might be able to guess what happens next.
[Video: "S.N.L." Promo Watch on YouTube.]
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Kit Harington hosts "S.N.L." for the first time, ahead of the premiere of the eighth and final season of "Game of Thrones" on HBO, and Sara Bareilles performs songs off her new album, "Amidst the Chaos." "S.N.L." has had "Thrones" stars poke fun at their own show in the past: Peter Dinklage appeared in a behind-the-scenes sketch with Kate McKinnon as Emilia Clarke leading up to Season 6, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau showed up in a sketch about a fake trivia show called "Game of Game of Thrones" in 2013.
What's Streaming
SUPERSTAR (1999) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Molly Shannon has had a long, prolific career -- and she returns to the big screen next week in the historical comedy "Wild Nights With Emily." But it was when Shannon was a regular cast member on "S.N.L." that her star began to rise. One of her most popular sketches on the show inspired this feature-length comedy about Mary, an awkward schoolgirl who has two goals: to become a "superstar!" and to kiss her crush, Sky (Will Ferrell). The movie has many flaws, but Mary's tense posture, finger-sniffing and signature pose still draw laughs 20 years later.

Texto completo: CULLOWHEE - Duke University historian Dr. Nancy MacLean will speak on democracy at Western Carolina on April 11.
Her lecture, "The Campus Origins of Today's Radical Right and of the Crisis of Our Democracy," starts at 7:30 p.m. in the Blue Ridge Conference Center on campus. The lecture is based on her 2017 book "Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America," which was a finalist for the National Book Award in Non-Fiction.
It is sponsored by the WCU College of Arts and Sciences Humanities Initiative with support from the Chancellor's Visiting Scholar Fund.
MacLean is the award-winning author of "Behind the Mask of Chivalry" (a New York Times "noteworthy" book of the year) and "Freedom is Not Enough," which was called by the Chicago Tribune "contemporary history at its best." She is the William Chafe Professor of History and Public Policy at Duke University.
Booklist calls "Democracy in Chains" "perhaps the best explanation to date of the roots of the political divide that threatens to irrevocably alter American government." The Guardian said: "It's the missing chapter: a key to understanding the politics of the past half century."

CMP corridor supporters' climate claims don't hold up to scrutiny The Maine DEP should do an independent review of the proposal's impact on greenhouse-gas emissions.

Texto completo: FREEPORT -- Mainers are increasingly anxious about climate change and the adverse effects it's already bringing: more violent weather, warmer and more acidic seas threatening our fisheries, increased flooding and erosion along our coast, the spread of Lyme and other insect-borne diseases, invasive bugs destroying our forests, ticks eating our moose, etc. And if they've read David Wallace-Wells' "The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming" (No. 3 on the New York Times non-fiction best-seller list), they're probably scared silly by what the future holds, as they should be.
Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, the principal driver of climate change, is something we need to start doing now, and big time, if we want to protect ourselves, our children and our grandchildren from a world we don't want to (and may not be able to) live in. To quote the first line of the book, "It is worse, much worse, than you think."
So, many people may have initially been inclined to favor the New England Clean Energy Connect project being proposed by Central Maine Power and Hydro-Quebec. This 145-mile electrical transmission line would run from western Maine on the Canadian border to a substation in Lewiston, where it would connect to the regional grid. While the transmission line would cut a big, ugly swath through Maine, all the power would go to customers in Massachusetts.
CMP and Hydro-Quebec state that NECEC will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by importing supposedly "clean" hydropower from Quebec. But that hydropower would be clean (i.e., reduce greenhouse-gas emissions) only if it were new - in addition to hydropower that Hydro-Quebec is already generating or could be expected to generate in the normal course of business. Such power is called "incremental" power.
But according to testimony on behalf of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, as well as a study by the international consulting firm Energyzt, the contracts that Massachusetts utilities have signed with Hydro-Quebec contain no legal stipulations that would require Hydro-Quebec to deliver all incrementally clean power all the time. Hydro-Quebec could buy cheap power from other suppliers on its extended system who are using coal or gas, both "dirty" sources, and sell it at a premium to Massachusetts. (Such money-making arbitrage is Hydro-Quebec's stated practice.) Or it could reduce exports of clean power to other customers in its system, requiring those customers to buy dirty power elsewhere. Obviously, if you simply shuffle the location of greenhouse-gas emissions from one location to another, there has been no global reduction in climate-changing pollution.
It's instructive that, even if we buy CMP's allegations that all the Hydro-Quebec power sent to NECEC will be squeaky clean, CMP claims only that greenhouse-gas emissions would be reduced in New England, not on a global basis, which is required to reduce the risks of climate change.
Unfortunately, the Maine Public Utilities Commission appears not to have devoted a lot of attention to the Massachusetts contracts that would permit Hydro-Quebec to follow a profit maximization strategy and send supposedly "clean" power to Massachusetts ratepayers. Nor does it appear to have acknowledged that, even if Hydro-Quebec sends truly incremental clean power to New England, it doesn't necessarily reduce greenhouse-gas emissions on a global basis - and it may cause them to increase.
That's why Maine voters should support a bill recently introduced by state Sen. Brownie Carson. L.D. 640 would require the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to conduct an independent investigation of CMP's claims that the proposed transmission line would have benefits for the climate through reduced greenhouse-gas emissions.
It's essential that Maine (and Massachusetts) citizens find out whether NECEC will, in fact, significantly reduce the carbon pollution that's changing our climate. If not, we're not only having the wool pulled over our eyes by people who stand to make a lot of money by doing so, but we're also in the very dangerous position of thinking we're taking a positive step to help solve the climate crisis when, actually, we're not. Deception is dangerous, but self-deception can be disastrous.

Justice Dept. Defends Barr on Mueller Findings

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department defended Attorney General William P. Barr's handling of the special counsel report on Thursday, saying that it had to be scrubbed of sensitive information, amid revelations that some members of the office have said he failed to adequately portray their findings and the extent to which they could damage President Trump.
"Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the attorney general decided to release the report's bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately -- without attempting to summarize the report -- with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process," a Justice Department spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said in a statement.
At issue is a four-page letter that Mr. Barr wrote to lawmakers on March 24 outlining the main findings of the nearly two-year investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Quoting sparingly from the nearly 400-page report delivered to him two days earlier, the attorney general revealed that Mr. Mueller had declined to decide whether the president illegally obstructed the inquiry and that Mr. Barr himself had stepped in to conclude that Mr. Trump did not commit an obstruction offense.
[Some of the Mueller investigators said that the attorney general failed to adequately represent their findings.]
Some of Mr. Mueller's investigators have told associates in recent days that Mr. Barr could have released more of their own work, government officials and others familiar with their frustrations told The New York Times for an article published on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump attacked the article, falsely asserting on Twitter that Times reporters relied on "no legitimate sources," a longstanding tactic of his to try to dismiss news reports that portray him negatively.
Mr. Barr has told lawmakers that his letter was an update of his progress in reviewing the report and that the document was not intended to fulfill a requirement under Justice Department regulations that he send a summary to Congress at the end of any special counsel investigation. Though Ms. Kupec said Mr. Barr was not trying to summarize the report, she was referring only to the regulatory requirement for a summary.
Ms. Kupec also said that the report and its release were subject to the regulations, which stipulate that Mr. Mueller prepare a confidential document of his findings intended only for the attorney general. She also said that sensitive information had to be blacked out first, noting that "every page of the 'confidential report"' was marked with a warning that it may contain secret grand jury testimony. Mr. Barr and other law enforcement officials are also reviewing the document for classified material, information about continuing investigations and derogatory details about third parties not directly related to the inquiry.
The attorney general has said he is aiming to send to lawmakers a redacted version of the report by mid-April. Under the regulations, he is free to release parts or all of it if he decides it is in the public interest.
The special counsel's report included summaries of the major findings, and some team members believed Mr. Barr should have included more of their material in his March 24 letter, according to the government officials. But the attorney general "does not believe the report should be released in a 'serial or piecemeal fashion,"' Ms. Kupec said, citing a letter that Mr. Barr wrote to lawmakers on Friday.
Justice Department officials have also said they determined that the summaries contained sensitive information that needed to be reviewed before they were released.
Democrats have demanded full access to the report. The House Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to let its chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, use a subpoena to compel Mr. Barr to turn over a complete copy of the Mueller report and its underlying evidence.
Mr. Nadler said on Thursday that the reports about frustration among members of the special counsel team would not alter his plan to give Mr. Barr a bit more time to hand over the report voluntarily before issuing a subpoena.
"It is his duty to release the entire report," Mr. Nadler said of Mr. Barr. "We were demanding he do so and he hasn't done so."
But given the frustrations expressed by some of Mr. Mueller's investigators, Mr. Nadler asked Mr. Barr in a letter on Thursday to turn over all communications between the special counsel's office and other Justice Department officials about the report, including discussions about the disclosure of the report to Congress or the public and about Mr. Barr's March 24 letter.
Mr. Nadler also said that Mr. Barr had undermined his own desire to release the report all at once when he outlined the principal conclusions "in a fashion that appears to minimize the implications of the report as to the president."
And Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday that he would ask the Senate to pass a resolution calling for the Justice Department to provide transparency on the results of the special counsel's work.
But Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has taken a far different tack. He told reporters on Thursday that he had no interest in "retrying" the Mueller investigation and trusted Mr. Barr to fairly present its findings.
"I don't think Barr misrepresented the Mueller conclusions," Mr. Graham said. "I don't have any interest in taking all the work product and re-litigating it. That's enough for me."

Texto completo: While baseball fans look to April to once again hear the crack of a bat ring out around the plate, literary fans have their own heavy hitters to look forward to.
The Carroll County Public Library, in partnership with Carroll Lutheran Village and A Likely Story Bookstore in Sykesville, will bring bestselling authors Dave Barry and Lisa Scottoline to Carroll County within days of each other.
Scottoline, the New York Times bestselling author and Edgar Award-winning author of 32 novels, will debut her newest book, “Someone Knows,” and kick off her book tour in Westminster.
Barry’s event, which is sold out but has opened a waiting list, celebrates the start of National Library Week by inviting the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and author to give a talk at Carroll Lutheran Village on Saturday about his new book, “Lessons from Lucy: The Simple Joys of an Old, Happy Dog.”
An Evening with Lisa Scottoline takes place Monday, a day before the official release of the book. Attendees will get a copy, so they can start digging into the psychological thriller a day earlier than other readers.
After her talk, Scottoline, of Philadelphia, will sign books and other titles from her catalog will be available to purchase from A Likely Story Bookstore. No outside books are permitted at the book signing.
“Someone Knows” centers on five young people who grew up in an insular community where carefully curated appearances can be deceptive. Three return home, where they face an unbearable secret they all share.
“With inspiration from Fyodor Dostoevsky’s ‘Crime and Punishment,’ ‘Someone Knows’ explores the guilt that ripples from a twenty-year-old tragedy that took one teenager’s life and forever changed many others. She reveals how a single decision can undo a family, how our past can derail our present, how ‘not guilty’ doesn’t always mean ‘innocent’ and how the worst punishment for a crime may well be what happens in the criminal’s mind and heart afterwards,” according to a news release.
The book is hotly anticipated as a Barnes & Noble Top Fiction Pick for April, a Goodreads Most Anticipated Mystery & Thriller for Spring and the Amazon Mystery & Thriller Best Book of the Month.
Scottoline goes on stage at 7 p.m. April 8 at the Carroll Arts Center, at 91 W. Main St. in Westminster. Tickets are $29 and include a copy of the book. Tickets can be purchased at www.CarrollCountyArtsCouncil.org.
Barry, of Miami, will bring his humorous and insightful take on the later years of man and canine to the Krug Chapel and Auditorium of Carroll Lutheran Village on April 6 at 2 p.m.
Tickets are $26 and include a copy of “Lessons from Lucy.” Tickets are sold out, but hopefuls can join the waiting list at library.carr.org/barry or in person at any Carroll library branch.
Double Dog Dare Rescue will be collecting donations of supplies at the event. Their most-needed items are monetary donations, puppy pads, bleach, wipes, paper towels, crates, collars, leashes and gas gift cards to defray transport costs.

Biden Reaps the #MeToo Whirlwind; 'It's never, never, never, never, never OK to touch her without her consent,' he told college men in 2011.

Texto completo: While speaking to students at the University of New Hampshire in 2011, then-Vice President Joe Biden told men in the audience that "no matter what a girl does, no matter how she's dressed, no matter how much she's had to drink—it's never, never, never, never, never OK to touch her without her consent."
One of Mr. Biden's signature issues during the Obama administration was fighting an alleged epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses. He promoted the debunked claim that 1 in 5 women will be sexually assaulted as undergraduates—the result of surveys using an impossibly broad definition of sexual assault that encompassed any conduct that, knowingly or not, made someone uncomfortable.
The Obama administration issued guidelines to campuses in 2011 to combat the alleged crisis. Mr. Biden headlined the announcement. The guidance traduced due-process rights for students accused of sexual assault and threatened colleges and universities with federal investigations and potential funding reductions if they did not find more accused students and professors guilty.
Now those impossible standards are being applied to their proponents. Since last Friday, several women have accused Mr. Biden of making them uncomfortable during his interactions with them. One accuser, Caitlyn Caruso, told the New York Times that during an event about sexual assault at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, Mr. Biden put his hand on her thigh and didn't remove it even when she showed discomfort by shifting in her seat. She also said he hugged her "just a little bit too long."
On campus, such behavior can get you in trouble. Author Junot Díaz was subject to a month-long investigation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for allegations that included an unwanted kiss. He was ultimately cleared. A student at California's Saddleback College, Marcus Knight, who is mentally disabled, was even suspended for taking a "selfie" with a female student and touching her shoulder. His suspension was eventually lifted, but the misconduct still appears on his record.
Mr. Biden's habit of touching women without first asking would also run afoul of campus "affirmative consent" or "yes means yes" policies—which he defended in a speech at George Mason University in 2017, saying, "Consent requires affirmative consent!" Under the letter of such policies, men must have verbal permission for any sexual act. Mr. Biden allegedly touched and kissed women without first asking if he could do so. No one thinks he had sexual intent, but on campus intent may not matter.
Mr. Biden has also jumped on the believe-all-women bandwagon, telling the Washington Post last September that "you've got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she's talking about is real, whether or not she forgets facts, whether or not it's been made worse or better over time."
When accused himself, Mr. Biden naturally fell back on all the arguments that are often dismissed when made by college men. He said it was never his "intention" to make women uncomfortable. He also acknowledged that "social norms have begun to change" without acknowledging that he helped lead the change—and hasn't lived up to the standards he sought to impose on others.

Texto completo: In Tel Aviv, Israel, new crosswalk lights might help save “cellphone zombies.” The city has begun installing ground-level LED strips at a major intersection. The bright visual cues are designed to help pedestrians pay attention to traffic instead of their phones. The light strips switch from red to green, signaling when to stop and go. Similar crosswalks have been introduced in Singapore, Australia, and Germany. (Reuters)
In San Francisco, the U. S. Department of Energy announced the production of a $500 million supercomputer. The department hopes to compete with China in the race to advance computer technology. Government supercomputers have been used to design weapons and break code; this one will help advance scientific research. The new supercomputer, called Aurora, is expected to be the first American machine to meet “exascale” performance, capable of completing more than a quintillion calculations per second. Aurora is scheduled to be ready in 2021, and is in the running against three systems in China that are slated for completion by 2020. (The New York Times)
In Tokyo, Toyota is planning a new  moon rover. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) announced it would land astronauts on the moon by the 2030s, and it hopes to have help from the car company. Preliminary designs for the mission’s manned vehicle include fuel cells that emit only water. (Toyota currently uses similar technology in a line of hydrogen-powered cars, available for purchase exclusively in Japan.) The rover will have a range of 6,000 miles to explore the moon’s surface, and its pressurized interior means occupants won’t have to wear spacesuits when they’re inside. (Toyota)

Texto completo: It is a truth universally acknowledged that power in Washington is not necessarily measured by an impressive job title, or even appearances on CNN. Case in point: Andrew Marshall, who died last week at the age of 97.

Marshall, who ran something called the Office of Net Assessment at the Department of Defense from 1973 until his retirement four years ago, probably had more influence on American military thinking and planning — and by extension, foreign policy — over a longer period of time than any other government official, including officials who were nominally his superior. Yet he was almost wholly unknown to the public, even to many in government and political journalism.

The story begins in 1947, when Secretary of State George C. Marshall concluded that the State Department needed some sort of compact, independent, long-range planning bureau, an internal "think tank" before the phrase was invented, to analyze trends and anticipate problems, and report directly to the secretary. The Policy Planning Staff was a good idea, but Marshall's mistake was to appoint the neurotic, self-dramatizing scholar-diplomat George Kennan as its first director. Kennan swiftly ran afoul of Marshall's successor, Dean Acheson, and after he left in 1950, Policy Planning was absorbed into the State Department's carnivorous bureaucracy, where it remains.

Andrew Marshall was, among other things, the temperamental opposite of George Kennan. Homely (his affectionate nickname of "Yoda" was not entirely inaccurate), self-effacing, and largely devoid of political ambition, Marshall had been an autodidact student of diplomatic and military affairs, a graduate of the University of Chicago, and by 1972, battle-tested veteran of the RAND Corporation's Cold War research and planning apparatus. When Henry Kissinger, from his perch at the National Security Council, was looking to establish something like a policy planning staff at the Pentagon, Marshall was the obvious recruit.

His initial assignment was to assess the military strength of the Soviet Union. Marshall's conclusions were counterintuitive and prophetic. The Soviet economy was considerably weaker than was universally believed, especially by the CIA, and Moscow's military budgets took a disproportionate bite out of the Soviet gross national product. Of course, the 1970s were the high tide of detente between Russia and the United States, and the Nixon-Ford administrations had plenty of things to worry about, including winding down the Vietnam War and disrupting the global order with the People's Republic of China. But in the following decade, Marshall's insights prompted the Reagan administration to wager that challenging Moscow economically and politically would strain the Soviet Union's resources to the breaking point, as it did.

In that sense, Marshall not only correctly diagnosed the Cold War, but helped end it as well.

In time, Marshall's periodic "net assessments" of military strategy, probably the most rigidly classified documents in Washington, came to be seen by successive defense secretaries as reliably prescient. But not always. As The New York Times has pointed out, Marshall "missed big trends like cyberwarfare and had wrongly ignored the kind of terrorism threats that the United States faced in the early 21st century." Nevertheless, the reform and modernization programs that Marshall promoted were critical to the success of military operations in the Bush and Obama administrations. And in the 1990s, Marshall was very nearly a lone voice, in Washington or anywhere, predicting the impending challenge and peril of Chinese strategic power.

It may well be, of course, that Marshall's very obscurity was the key to his success and service to his country. Largely insulated from political or ideological pressures, and free to conclude and assert what he thought, for four decades he surrounded himself with a small, distinguished coterie of assistants and associates who, after graduation, have gone on to widen their mentor's strategic influence.

Yet while Marshall himself was as vital as ever into his early 90s, the weight of bureaucracy eventually prevailed. At the beginning of President Obama's second term, the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment was, in the words of The Washington Post, "realigned on the bureaucratic flow chart," no longer reporting directly to the secretary but to the under secretary of defense for policy. One year later, Marshall was gone.

Texto completo: Donald Trump won the 2016 election last weekend — again.
The professional Trump Haters in Washington, Manhattan and Hollywood are still in full denial mode, though, and they're refusing to accept Special Counsel Robert Mueller's determination that the president and his campaign did not collude with the Russians.
It's sad.
The anti-Trump zealots in the Democrat Party and liberal media have been deluding themselves for two years that Mueller and his lawyers were going to nail Trump on collusion, obstruction or any number of impeachable crimes.
Journalists at the New York Times and the Washington Post swallowed every crazy story the Democrats spun about Trump — and then blared them as fact on their front pages with little or no skepticism.
Meanwhile, MSNBC/CNN's troika of Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and Don Lemon piled on nightly.
In addition to their own left-liberal rants, they paraded out every Trump enemy or ex-Obama team member they could find to call the president a liar, a crook, a tax cheat, a dictator, a traitor, a puppet of Putin...
But the Trump Haters' bubble broke with a huge pop recently when Attorney General William Barr reported that Mueller's investigation had found that the president was telling the truth.
"No collusion on Russia" was crushing news for the lefties and fake journalists on MSNBC and CNN, the co-flagships of the Fake News fleet.
Maddow and Lemon almost cried on camera, and Matthews was so speechless he couldn't interrupt anyone.
I'd cry too if I were one of those guys.
After two years of being wrong, wrong, wrong about Trump and the Russians, their credentials as pundits or commentators are shot — and apparently even many of their loyal viewers know it.
The large audience of liberals Maddow had built up with her tedious nightly "seminars" about Trump's alleged treason dropped by about 20 percent this week — probably because so many distraught viewers are visiting grief counselors.
Maddow and her equally deranged MSNBC colleague "Morning Joe" Scarborough are in complete denial. They are not apologizing for how they and the biased journalists in their political camp got it so wrong about Russian collusion.
Maddow and Scarborough are imitating my own embarrassing Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, who claims to know stuff about Trump that Mueller's army of lawyers and investigators could not dig up.
They are now nitpicking Attorney General William Barr's synopsis of the Mueller report and hinting of an even bigger conspiracy.
Meanwhile, President Trump has the last laugh — a big one — and he now has the high political ground. He's already embarked on a "No Collusion" victory tour in the Midwest and his chances are looking better than ever for reelection in 2020.
Without collusion and obstruction, the Democrats have no major issues left to attack President Trump. The economy is still doing great. Unemployment among blacks, Latinos and women is at all-time lows. Incomes and wages are going up.
So all they really have is collusion, obstruction and impeachment, which is why we'll be seeing Mueller and Barr dragged into the House of Representatives to be interrogated by Schiff and his fellow desperate Democrats.

Texto completo: Trump didn’t give up his businesses, is no patriot
Recently there have been several responses from local conservatives, addressing questions posed in an op/ed piece by Dr. Henry Reiff titled “Questions for Christian conservatives about Trump, the man.” Most respondents danced around the basic premise by outlining various actions or beliefs of Trump’s that in their minds demonstrate he’s not so bad after all. They are able to ignore Trump's many lies, transgressions and potentially criminal actions, as long as they are getting what they want politically. In other words, to them, the ends really are all that matters, means and messenger be damned.
One writer opened his missive with the statement that Trump “is a patriot who gave up his business to campaign for the presidency.” Wow! We should all be aware that Trump never gave up his business. In fact, members of his family still run his vast interests, some of whom do double-duty in the White House - a flagrant conflict of interest that I’m not aware has ever been perpetrated. Lest we forget, Trump owns a hotel just down the street from his current residence in Washington, DC, one where foreign leaders and lobbyists stay just to curry favor with our commander-in-chief. The law is clear, no President may use his office to promote their personal business interests.
It is calling Trump a “patriot” that bothers me the most, but I’m not exactly sure why. Obviously, Trump does not play football for a certain team from New England. Seriously, that label has become almost as trite as “socialist” or RINO, yet it does seem to convey a certain set of attributes to some individuals. The dictionary defines patriot as “a person who vigorously supports their country and is prepared to defend it against enemies or detractors.” Trump’s policies and actions do not fit that definition. He dodged the draft as a young man, continues to defame real American patriots like the late John McCain, and conveniently ignores the one thing our intelligence community agrees on - that Russia indeed tried to influence our election in 2016.
No, I fear patriot has come to mean something else different. I fear it has become a dog whistle for some of our worst, deep-seated prejudices. I fear Trump has enabled and justifies a level of white nationalism and xenophobia that our country hasn’t witnessed in decades, and his form of “patriotism” is exactly what some of his most fervent supporters desire.

Obama bureaucrats, politicians, media corrupt, not Trump
This is in response to Dean Minnich's [March 28 colomn] “Collusion versus corruption.” Minnich said “the real issue never was collusion,” it's corruption and President Trump isn't exonerated. Robert Mueller's superiors, Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein stated there is not sufficient evidence to establish President Trump committed an obstruction-of-justice offense: that's exoneration. How could President Trump obstruct something that didn't happen?
Mueller had 19 Democrat attorneys, 40 FBI agents/professionals, issued 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, interview 500 witnesses, requested information from 13 foreign governments and found no evidence President Trump or anyone associated with his 2016 campaign colluded/conspired with Russia. The FBI investigated Trump from July 2016 to May 2017, then the House and Senate Intelligence Committees investigated Trump, and all four found no evidence of collusion. There never was any evidence. In America no investigation should be started without a crime and evidence of that crime. This was a Banana Republic witch hunt.
This Russian hoax started under Obama's administration. Obama's biased bureaucrats at the DOJ committed crimes, by abusing their power (statute 18U.S.C.242) for political purposes. The Democratic leadership, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, congressmen Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler, Maxine Waters, etc., lied when they said they saw “evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.”
Minnich said “the news media must continue to shine the light on corruption.” Their light is a liberal torch: the news is supposed to inform, not influence you. For almost three years the so-called NBC journalist Lester Holt, Hallie Jackson and Chuck Todd said every day/night “Possible Russia Collusion.” The Washington Post and New York Times printed lies, misinformation and innuendos and the CNN and MSNBC hacks constantly accused President Trump of treason and being a Russian agent. They are fake news lackeys for the propaganda arm of the radical Democratic Party to deceive the American public.
This Unholy Trinity - corrupt Obama bureaucrats, unscrupulous politicians and the complicit mainstream media - purposely lied to the American public for almost three years. They tried to influence the election for Hillary and when that failed they immediately attempted a coup d'etat, by starting an investigation, with no evidence, to destroy and overthrow the freely elected president of the United States. That's corruption!

Trump fetes criminal justice overhaul

Texto completo: President Trump on Monday was expected to host about 300 guests, including convicted felons, at the White House for the “First Step Act Celebration," a party intended to bring attention to a rare piece of bipartisan legislation he passed last year and which he plans to highlight on the campaign trail.
The East Room fete will cap a day of events dedicated to overhauling the criminal justice system, an issue that agencies across the government have been asked to elevate. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta is expected to participate in a panel on workforce development. Ben Carson, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is to lead a session about prisoner reentry. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and senior adviser, will weigh in on a session dealing with incarcerated women. Kim Kardashian, the reality star, was even invited to participate in the panels and the party, but couldn't attend.
Months after the legislation passed, and amid foreign policy blunders and a defeat on funding a wall along the southern border, Trump's administration is putting the issue front and center.
But some activists who helped work on the legislation — which would expand job training and early-release programs, and modify sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders — have expressed concern that Trump is more attuned to the political opportunities the law offers him, rather than with ensuring it is enacted effectively.
Despite the high-profile party and round tables — and the White House releasing a presidential proclamation declaring April “second chance month" — Trump's budget, released last month, listed only $14 million to pay for the First Step Act's programs. The law passed in December specifically asked for $75 million a year for five years, beginning in 2019. The funding gap was first reported by The Marshall Project.
Advocates participating in the events at the White House on Monday said they were hoping that officials would publicly address questions about funding the program.
“The answer is a resounding yes. We're fully committed to doing that," said Ja'Ron Smith, a White House adviser who has worked extensively on the First Step Act implementation, referring to the funding.
Some activists have been more willing to give the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt, noting that the lower funding level for 2019 could be because First Step programs are not expected to be up and running until the end of August, less than two months before the end of the federal fiscal year.

Barbara Bush saw Trump as a 'symbol of greed'
Barbara Bush didn't bite her tongue in recent years when it came to Donald Trump: She just didn't like him. But a new biography of the former first lady finds that her disdain for the Republican president, who transformed the party her own family had embodied for generations into his likeness, dates as least as far back as a 1990s diary entry.
She referred to Trump in the entry as "the real symbol of greed in the '80s."
Mrs. Bush, who was 92 when she died last April , gave Susan Page, author of "The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty," access to volumes of her diaries, which she began keeping in 1948. The former first lady recounts in a January 1990 entry about reading a news article on Trump speaking at a Los Angeles charity awards dinner for Merv Griffin. Former president Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, attended the gala, and Trump needled the former president over pricey speeches he had given in Japan.
Mrs. Bush later showed a friend news clips about Trump's separation from his first wife, Ivana, and noted that allies of the soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Trump were saying a $25 million settlement in the prenuptial agreement she signed wouldn't be enough.
"The Trumps are a new word, both of them," Mrs. Bush wrote. "Trump now means Greed, selfishness, and ugly. So sad."
Her dislike of Trump spiked more recently over the way he belittled her son, Jeb, when the New York businessman and the former Florida governor competed for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Trump also had criticized other members of the Bush clan, including George W. Bush, over starting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Commander in Cheat? Book recounts golf misdeeds
Colluding with Russia? The special counsel says no. Cheating at golf? Well, that's something else.
From pulling a fast one on Tiger Woods to exaggerating his handicap, Donald Trump's alleged misdeeds on and around the golf course are the subject of a new book by former Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly, "Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump." Reilly documents dozens of examples of underhanded golf behavior by the president, transgressions talked about by pro golfers and duffers alike.
"In golf, he's definitely not exonerated," Reilly said. "There's been dozens and dozens of people that can declare him guilty of cheating."
One infamous instance came in a 2017 round with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson, who is the current No. 1 player in the world. The president's playing partner, Fox Sports golf analyst Brad Faxon, reported that Trump's offenses included putting down a score that didn't account for two balls he hit into the water on one hole.
"You've heard so much about it, it's almost like you want to witness it so you can tell the stories," Faxon is quoted as saying.
No big deal, many would say. It's only a game.
But outside of formal tournaments, golf is a game of honor in which individual players act as their own referees, keep their own scores, and assess themselves penalties for rule violations. Trump's cheating, Reilly said, motivated him to write the book.
Says Reilly: "I don't know much about politics, but I know golf and it really offended me, not as a voter or as a citizen — just as a golfer."
Reilly quotes players who accuse Trump, his caddie, and Secret Service agents of regularly moving his golf balls out of difficult lies. At Winged Foot Golf Club in New York, the only non-Trump property where the president is a member, Reilly writes, "The caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him: 'Pele."' That's the world soccer star from Brazil.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden responded Sunday to Lucy Flores' claim of inappropriate behavior, denying any wrongdoing but promising to "listen respectfully. "
I wish people had a broader lens of Joe Biden
By Margaret Aitken
I had the great honor of working for then-Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del. , for 10 years as his press secretary.
During my time in his office, I spent hundreds of hours commuting with him to Washington on Amtrak, accompanying him to thousands of interviews and traveling with him to every corner of the state, as well as nationally and internationally.
Every day, I watched people gravitate to him — from the shoe shine guy at the train station to the elderly ladies lining the streets at the St. Anthony's parade to the Dalai Lama. People wanted to talk to him, to connect with him, to tell him a story or relay a family connection.
He listened to every single one of them. Every single one.

There were many times our young staff members were tired or hungry, and we wanted to move on, but if we encountered one person whose Uncle Johnny went to grade school with Joe Biden, all bets were off.
He was gracious and magnanimous to a fault.
In all of those years and thousands of interactions, I never once saw anything that even came close to resembling something inappropriate. What I did see were people he communed with, comforted or congratulated. I saw people's faces light up when he remembered their kids' names.
As a woman and a mother, I am happy that we are now moving into a place where people can speak their piece without fear of reprisals or repercussions. I don’t doubt Lucy Flores' story, nor do I discount her feelings.
I simply wish she had a broader and more accurate lens through which she could see the real Joe Biden.
During the event in question, I believe that, as he always does, Biden noticed a human being standing before him who was nervous and uneasy, and he tried to give her comfort and confidence. Period. She may have felt differently about the interaction, and that is truly unfortunate.
I read his statement, and as tough as this all must be for him, he signaled a willingness to listen and learn.
There were no assaults on her character. No questioning her motives nor her integrity.
Unlike many others in public life right now, he didn't launch a nasty and personal Twitter attack. He was civil and open-minded.
That is what leadership looks like.
Margaret Aitken is a former press secretary for Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del. This column first appeared in The (Delaware) News Journal.
What others are saying
Michelle Goldberg, The New York Times: "In response to Lucy Flores, former Vice President Joe Biden could have told her that he was sorry for making her uneasy. Instead, he focused on his intentions rather than her experience, a faint echo of the way he had ignored Anita Hill's experience decades ago. No one should judge the whole span of Biden’s career by the standards of 2019, but if he's going to run for president, it's fair to ask whether he’s the right leader for this moment. He is a product of his time, but that time is up. "
Alyssa Milano, Twitter: "I am proud to call Joe Biden a friend. He has been a leader and a champion on fighting violence against women for many years, and I have been fortunate to accompany him to events with survivors where he has listened to their stories, empathized with them, and comforted them. . . . I respect Lucy Flores' decision to share her story and agree with Biden that we all must pay attention to it. But, just as we must believe women who decide to come forward, we cannot assume all women's experiences are the same. I believe that Joe Biden's intent has never been to make anyone uncomfortable, and that his kind, empathetic leadership is what our country needs. Especially now. "
Elizabeth E. Alexander, USA TODAY: "What you won’t read about is how Joe Biden took the rare step of paying staffers through their entire maternity leaves. . . . What you won’t read about is how he recruited women who had worked for him in the Senate, and had 'gaps' in their paid work history because of family demands. . . . Those years in between compensated work were just as valuable to him as any traditional work experience. What you won’t read about it is how he supported staff (like me) when they wanted to go to law school at night. . . . You won’t read about how he’d tell male staffers and senators who were repeatedly interrupting a woman to pipe down, so he could hear what she was trying to say. "
What our readers are saying
My whole family is a loving, touching, hugging family, and that's how I am. I will give big hugs even to strangers. I'm a 57-year-old grandma, so I guess I'm creepy, too.
But I've never bragged about grabbing someone by the p---y, or seeing young girls naked in the dressing room. Republicans voted in a sexual predator to office; they need to keep their mouths closed.
— Pat Harmon
As anyone who has sat through sexual harassment training will tell you, it doesn't matter what your intent is. It only matters how it is perceived.
— Nicholas Riecken
This story is dead on arrival. Biden may have invaded space, but all of the stories about him have taken place in public settings. Critics want Biden to fold because his chances of winning the 2020 presidential race are high.
— Brenda Jackson
A lot of people justify their improper actions and don't see a problem with what they've done.
— Henry Huckaby

WHAT RURAL AMERICA HAS TO TEACH US WHEN CIVIC SERVICE BECOMES A WAY OF LIFE, PEOPLE MAKE THEIR TOWNS BETTER THAN THEY FOUND THEM

Texto completo: Everybody says rural America is collapsing. But I keep going to places with more moral coherence and social commitment than we have in booming urban areas. These visits prompt the same question: How can we spread the civic mind-set they have in abundance?
I spent last week in Nebraska, in towns like McCook and Grand Island. These places are not rich. At many of the schools, 50 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price lunch. But they don't have the pathologies we associate with poverty.
Nearly everybody is working at something. Nebraska has the sixth-lowest unemployment rate among the 50 states. It has the 12th-longest healthy life expectancy. Some of the high schools have 98 percent graduation rates. It ranks seventh among the states in intact family structure. Crime is low. Many people leave their homes and cars unlocked.
One woman I met came home and noticed her bedroom light was on. She thought it was her husband home early. But it was her plumber. She'd mentioned at the coffee shop that she had a clogged sink, so he'd swung round, let himself in and fixed it.
When she needs some auto work done, she leaves a blank check on the front seat of the car. The town mechanic comes by when he can, drives the car to his garage, does the work and fills out the check.
McCook has only 7,700 residents, but it has a Rotary club, a 4-H club, a future farmers group, a music festival, a storytelling festival, a chapter of the Nebraska Community Foundation, churches, libraries, museums and Sehnert's, a James Beard Award-winning bakery and coffee shop where the retired men gather and kibbitz.
If a teenager misbehaves, his parents have heard about it by the time he gets home. Many people make time for civic life and seem to wear 15 hats.
Jared Muehlenkamp returned from Los Angeles to McCook and runs a print and design store. He went to three meetings after work the day before I met him, including of the City Council, on which he serves.
Mark Graff, who runs a local bank, says he spends 50 percent of his time on civic volunteering.
His sister-in law, Ronda Graff, is raising seven children. She also writes for the newspaper, coaches swimming, is a substitute teacher and bus driver, competes in ironman triathlons, works at the Y, helps run a concert series, helped organize the building of the dog park, helps out with the high school discipline program and seems to sit on every spontaneous civic organization that pops up.
It should be acknowledged that things are not as rosy as they appear on the surface. "There are a lot of people here in desperate economic circumstances doing extraordinary things to look middle class," one person told me.
But these community weavers are pretty honest about their problems. A few of the towns are 30 percent Latino, and they struggle with integration. The most highly educated young people leave. The community project is to find ways to lure them back.
One farmer said there is a feudal mindset among many of his friends. They're too proud to admit any dependence. They're afraid of vulnerability. The attitude is: I'm a farmer. My business is my business, and your business is your business. Their loneliness is driven by fear and pride.
And they do have to work hard to make sure national viciousness doesn't tear local bonds. At one dinner, a Latina woman looked at her Anglo friends with tears in her eyes and told them she had dropped off Facebook because "a lot of people ... make me feel at home here, and I'd never had a home. ... I don't want to change my mind about you because you liked one comment on social media."
What causes the community's weavers to be so civically active? I have a few theories.
Farm life inculcates an insane work ethic, which gets carried into community life. The weavers are deeply rooted in place. Many said their main goal in life is to make their small town better at their death than it was at their birth.
There are also 93 counties in Nebraska, several with populations below 1,000. That means there are a ton of local government functions and not that many people to fill them, so everybody has to chip in.
Many people try not to use Amazon so they can support local businesses. They don't use the self-checkout lanes in the drugstore so they can support local workers. They're almost fanatical in their support of local arts programs.
Constantly they are thinking: Does this help my town or hurt it? And when you tell them that this pervasive civic mindset is an unusual way to be, they look at you blankly because they can't fathom any other.

Burger King’s Whopper gets an Impossible version

Texto completo: Burger King has begun testing an Impossible Whopper in 59 St. Louis restaurants with an eye to rolling out the plant-based protein option to all of its U.S. locations.
If Burger King’s partnership with Impossible Foods expands, it would be a coup for the Bay Area company that’s dedicated to “making meat using plants.” Burger King is in the top 10 largest fast food chains, frequently listed at No. 6.
Impossible Foods has captured diners’ attention with its signature product, the Impossible Burger, which it markets as being as tasty as beef and requiring far less land, water and other natural resources to produce.
It’s aimed at flexitarians, people who like meat but want to cut down on their consumption for ethical or health reasons.
Impossible Foods also markets itself as a tech company and created a stir last January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with the debut of its Impossible Burger 2.0.
Among the improvements to the product was making it hold together better on grills, thus making it easier for restaurants that flame-broil burgers to serve it.
Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods’ main competitor, announced a partnership with Carl’s Jr. for its Famous Star, placing its Beyond Burger in 3,800 restaurants. Del Taco is moving forward with Beyond Tacos.
Plant-based meats typically cost more than beef, about $2 more at Carl’s Jr. Burger King did not announce the price of its Impossible Whopper in St. Louis but released a video of Whopper lovers proclaiming that they can’t tell the difference.
Burger King is considering a rapid rollout of the Impossible Whopper to 7,200 U.S. restaurants, according to the New York Times. Company representatives affirmed it’s a possibility.
Burger King announced the Impossible Whopper on April Fool’s Day, but in a news release said the Whopper is real and the news is not a whopper.
The Impossible Burger is currently available in more than 5,000 U.S. restaurants, according to the news release. That’s a lot of growth since April 2018, when the Impossible Burger was something of a novelty at events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.
Most national chains that serve the Impossible Burger are casual restaurants rather than fast food chains. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews added it to its menu on April 1 as an option for any of its burgers. With more than 570 restaurants in the United States and Canada, it claims to be the largest chain currently serving it.

Texto completo: Kylie Jenner's status as the youngest "self-made" billionaire has sparked furious debate across social media, with scores of people accusing Jenner of leveraging her family’s affluence and notoriety into profit.
Forbes bestowed the coveted title on the 21-year-old makeup mogul last month, thanks to her lucrative company, Kylie Cosmetics, which is worth over $900 million.
After initially shooting down critics by saying, "There’s really no other word to use other than 'self-made,' because that is the truth," Jenner now appears to be changing her tune.

During an interview with The New York Times over the weekend, the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan admitted that she "can’t say I’ve done it by myself. "
"If they’re just talking finances, technically, yes, I don’t have any inherited money," she said. "But I have had a lot of help and a huge platform. "
Jenner has 130 million followers on Instagram, which allows her to advertise her lip kits and products directly to her devoted fan base with virtually no marketing expenses.
"It’s the power of social media," she told Forbes. “I had such a strong reach before I was able to start anything. "

When Forbes first reported last summer that Jenner was on track to take over the title, she was met with debate from USA TODAY readers and social media users alike, who argued over whether her success was "self-made" or merely a byproduct of being born into an already-famous and wealthy family.
In response, Jenner told Interview last month that she used "100% of my own money to start the company" in 2015, adding that "not a dime in my bank account is inherited … and I am very proud of that. "
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously held Forbes' title for youngest self-made billionaire.

Texto completo: What insights can former President Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Richard Branson impart about running your small business? Solid ones, it turns out.
Those three were the powerhouse speakers addressing the crowd of 11,000 at the Qualtrics X4 Summit last month.
Though neither the conference nor the speeches were political, Obama did take the opportunity to call on us to respect our democracy and each other.
“We live in such a polarized time,” Obama said at the Salt Lake City event presented by Qualtrics, the experience management software company recently bought by SAP for $8 billion.
“If you watch Fox News, you’re in one reality, and if you read The New York Times, you’re in a different reality. … It’s been challenging to have a common conversation. … If we listen to the voices that help us rediscover our common hopes and dreams and values rather than constantly gravitating to those things that push us apart, that oftentimes are designed to make us angry … we can accomplish big things. ”
Obama also said: “Things like rule of law, competence and facts are not partisan ideas. Nor do they happen automatically. There must be citizens who insist that they happen. A democracy is a garden that must be tended to carefully. ”
Here are other insights helpful to small business owners:
Overcoming fear: “What’s happened to me over the last decade is a shedding of fear,” Obama said. “(There were) times when you were constrained by, ‘Man, I don’t want to screw this up, let people down, be seen as a failure. ' … I was a better president in my second term not because of policy, (but) you get enough reps and familiarity that you stay focused on the task and not on how you are doing the task. ”
Handling your ego: “By taking your ego out of what you do, it liberates you and makes you more able to do it,” said Obama. “You get more accomplished. … One of the problems with people in big jobs is they start feeling like, ‘I have to project that I have every answer. '” He said he was not afraid to ask questions and rely on those who had more expertise on a a particular subject.
Being clear about your goals: Oprah Winfrey emphasized the importance of the word intent. “I don’t do anything without thinking about what I ultimately want the energy, the motivation I’m putting into it (to be). … The intention is the force field that carries from the action and all the way to the end result. ” Oprah told her staff, "Don't come to me with an idea unless you know why you're doing it. "
Hiring: Obama and Richard Branson had good advice on hiring. “I was good at making sure that the people who are working for me, with me, were there for the right reasons and there was a core integrity to what they were doing," said Obama. And Branson: “Find somebody that’s better than yourself and leave day-to-day (issues) to someone else. … Don’t try to do everything yourself. ”
Employee treatment: “All that business is, is a group of people,” said Branson. “We (at Virgin companies) do everything we can to insure we have the happiest people. … The reason people leave companies is because they’re not being listened to. ” He also decried the lack of required paid holidays in the U. S. , the worst holiday policy of any advanced economy. "Something of a disgrace," he called it.
Company culture: "If you can build a culture where it's about solving the problem, or getting the work done, as opposed to who’s getting the credit or 'how much money am I making out of this' or what have you, that builds a transparency that allows for good decision-making because there’s clarity about the goals and objectives and values at the heart of the organization,” Obama said. “And it also means that you don’t have big scandals and indictments. "
Purpose: Oprah's "show wasn’t about a show nor is any of our work really about the work," Winfrey said. "It’s about how you use your inner self, your one grand, big, precious life in service to the world. … Ultimately you want to be able to live out the fullest, highest truest expression of yourself as a human being.

Early Bettors Are Waiting For Rewards

Texto completo: Brian Chesky, chief executive of Airbnb, likes to tell the story of his early struggles to fund his home-sharing start-up. Many venture capitalists refused to meet with him, he said in an email. Some walked out in the middle of meetings.
That changed after venture firms such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund decided to gamble on Airbnb's potential to shake up the vacation rentals business.
Three investors at those firms -- Alfred Lin of Sequoia, Jeff Jordan at Andreessen Horowitz and Brian Singerman of Founders Fund -- are now among the top players in the venture capital industry, according to an annual ranking compiled for The New York Times by CB Insights, which tracks the start-up industry. Airbnb, privately valued at $31 billion, landed more venture investors at the top of the list than any other company.
In his email, Mr. Chesky said Mr. Lin, Mr. Jordan and Mr. Singerman "have a founder's mind-set" and "share our long-term vision."
Airbnb is expected to go public sometime in the next year, following a bumper crop of initial public offerings that began on Friday with the ride-hailing company Lyft. Uber, Pinterest, Slack and others are also expected to list their shares in the next few months.
These offerings will likely mint many venture capital winners, generating huge returns for those who wrote the early checks to these companies. Here's a look at some of the venture investors who may reap the I.P.O. rewards.
Alfred Lin
Sequoia Capital
When Uber goes public, Mr. Lin may feel a sting. That's because he made a small personal investment in the ride-hailing company when it was very young, but turned down numerous chances to invest on behalf of Sequoia as Uber grew into a behemoth.
"We just didn't dream with the entrepreneurs," said Mr. Lin, 46, who joined Sequoia in 2010. "Sometimes we just make the wrong call."
He may have other opportunities to celebrate. Mr. Lin and Sequoia invested early in Airbnb; DoorDash, a food delivery start-up valued at $7.1 billion; and Houzz, a home design and remodeling start-up worth $4 billion.
Sequoia wrote Airbnb a $585,000 check in 2009 and invested in each of the company's later funding rounds. Mr. Lin said he was impressed by how the Airbnb founders could "articulate a dream of the world that is very different from what exists today."
Yet sometimes those lofty dreams clashed with reality. As Airbnb grew, Mr. Chesky said, he wanted to hire executives from Apple and Disney, companies he admired for their creativity, design and simple product lines.
Mr. Lin, a former executive at Amazon-owned Zappos, said he had gently suggested that Airbnb emulate businesses that looked more like itself: ones with complex operations in many different places and a wide array of inventory, like Airbnb's millions of home listings.
To help make the point, Mr. Lin introduced Mr. Chesky to Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon's retail business, in 2012. That meeting persuaded Mr. Chesky to shift his focus. Airbnb ended up poaching top Amazon executives to become its chief financial officer and head of its homes business.
"Part of our job is to help with the sparring of ideas," Mr. Lin said.
With the I.P.O. stampede now on, he said, he is cautioning companies not to rush to go public because their peers are doing so. "These things are milestones, to some degree, that you celebrate," he said. "But soon after you go public, you have to go back to running your business."
What's next? Mr. Lin said he and his team were looking at everything from robotics and artificial intelligence to payments and short-form video.
Jeff Jordan
Andreessen Horowitz
Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the founders of Andreessen Horowitz, have long been fixtures in the top rankings of venture capital investors, thanks to investments in companies like Lyft. Mr. Jordan, their partner, has recently outdone them.
Mr. Jordan, 60, got behind companies such as Pinterest, the digital pin board, which recently filed its prospectus for going public. He also bet on Instacart, the grocery delivery company worth $7.6 billion, and Lime, a scooter start-up valued at $2.4 billion.
In 2011, Mr. Jordan also led Andreessen Horowitz's $60 million investment in Airbnb. He has said the company's "marketplace" model of matching travelers with home providers reminded him of the early days of eBay, where he was an executive for five years.
When Airbnb experienced a hiccup in 2011 -- a host's home was trashed by a guest -- Mr. Jordan helped the company with a new insurance program, Airbnb Guarantee, which was modeled after one at eBay.
Mr. Jordan, who also led OpenTable before joining Andreessen Horowitz in 2011, said part of his investment success was due to the firm's wide range of services for start-ups, including recruiting, public relations and business development. It was once unusual for venture firms to to provide those services, though they have become more common.
Apoorva Mehta, founder and chief executive of Instacart, said Mr. Jordan often provided corporate development advice and introductions to potential retail partners.
"Jeff has always felt like an extension of our team," Mr. Mehta said.
Mr. Jordan, who declined to comment on the current wave of I.P.O.s, said he was looking for the next "platform," which could be voice or augmented reality and virtual reality.
Brian Singerman
Founders Fund
Founders Fund does not offer a suite of services to its start-ups. That's in keeping with the contrarian philosophy of its founder, Peter Thiel.
"We're not operating the company," Mr. Singerman, a partner at the firm, said of the reason for not providing additional services. He added that he also eschewed the typical venture capital practice of investing in companies based on a specific strategy or thesis.
"That is not me," he said. "I'm actually open to anything. "
All of this helps explain why Mr. Singerman, a 42-year-old former Google engineer, has backed companies as diverse as a health insurance start-up, a payments company, a cancer drug maker and a seller of cheap novelty gifts. And, of course, Airbnb.
When Founders Fund helped fund Airbnb in 2013, its international growth had begun taking off.
"We had never seen an international network effect like they had," Mr. Singerman said. He said Mr. Chesky also had a strong sense of what his customers wanted and "kind of wills things into existence."
Mr. Singerman, who joined Founders Fund in 2008, said his biggest challenge was finding the right companies and persuading the founders to let him invest. To source deals, he relies on a broad network of contacts, which led him to Stemcentrx, a cancer drug company that was sold to AbbVie in 2016 for $5.8 billion, and RigUp, an online job platform for energy industry workers.
There's one area in which Mr. Singerman is like other venture capitalists: his professed nonchalance toward I.P.O.s. Founders Fund tends to hold stock in its investments "for a very, very long time," so a company's public offering "doesn't impact us," he said.
In 2016, Mr. Singerman invested in a company called Long Term Stock Exchange. Founded by Eric Ries, the author of the start-up bible "The Lean Startup," the company wants to open a new stock exchange for young companies that are seeking investors who will stick around for the long haul.
Mr. Ries said he had gone to Mr. Singerman for funding because he knew his idea was "out on a limb" and would require patience from investors.

City adapts to changes in curbside recycling: Cost of program and what happens to the recyclables in flux here, across nation

Texto completo: From residents' point of view, curbside recycling in Savannah has remained relatively unchanged since the city first started the program in 2009. It's still collected twice a month, with voluntary participation, still mixed in the same yellow-topped bin. But behind the scenes, the cost of the program and what happens to the recyclables is in flux here as in the rest of the country.
In January, Savannah's decade-long contract with Pratt Recycling expired and a new annual contract with the same company, one less favorable to the city, began. Instead of Pratt paying the city $15 a ton for mixed recyclables including glass, plastic, paper and aluminum, Savannah now pays Pratt to take the recyclables away. The program brought in about $160,000 a year in rebates from Pratt but now the city agreed to pay Pratt $696,000 a year. Savannah households are being billed an additional 35 cents a month in part to make up the costs.
"We're no longer receiving a rebate," said Sanitation Director Gene Prevatt. "We're actually paying them to take the materials and that works out to be about $100 a ton. We'll be doing that on an annual basis. The market is somewhat unstable because the overseas has pretty much dried up."
China stopped accepting the bulk of U.S. recyclables over the last year or so, citing the high amount of contamination with nonrecylable waste as a reason. University of Georgia researchers last year estimated that by 2030, 111 million metric tons of plastic waste will be displaced with the new Chinese policy.
Without China as a buyer, many U.S. cities are revamping their recycling programs, said Scott Mouw, director of strategy and research for the Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit that works to support and improve recycling nationwide. While a recent New York Times report indicated there are "hundreds of towns and cities across the country that have canceled recycling programs, limited the types of material they accepted or agreed to huge price increases," Mouw said cancelling is the rarest of these choices. He's aware of only two municipalities that have done so.
"We're not seeing 'Oh, God it's not working, let's eliminate recycling,'" he said. And the $100 per ton range struck Mouw as the "new normal." But Georgia does have some protections from emerging barriers to recycling, said Gloria Hardegree, executive director of the Georgia Recycling Coalition.
"Georgia and the Southeast region have plentiful markets for end-use of recycled materials, some of the strongest in the nation-these are manufacturers using these recovered materials as feedstock for making new recycled content products," she wrote in an email. "Not to say we are insulated totally from the Chinese import challenges, but we are better off than many U.S. regions as we are less dependent on export than for example west coast areas.
Georgia has 15 paper mills that use recycled content, eight of which are 100 percent recycled, including familiar names like Pratt, WestRock, Caraustar, Sonoco and Georgia Pacific. The carpet industry in northwest Georgia sources plastics and Georgia boasts one of the largest aluminum recyclers in the world with Novelis in-state.
"We also have good processing capacity in dense population areas of the state; collected materials are hauled to processors where they are sorted and prepped for these markets and sold/shipped to them as feedstock based on specific specs set by each buyer," she wrote.
Glass and plastic still accepted, not all recycled
Savannah's curbside program continues to accept glass even though for several years it it has not been recycled here. The U.S. market doesn't currently support the cost of collection and sorting, especially because it's tough to keep glass "clean."
"The problem with glass in particular is it's very sensitive to contamination," Prevatt said. "Typically it's split into three streams - green glass and brown glass and clear glass. Say you've got a truckload and have six pack of bottles of colored bottle in a clear load, then you have got a load of colored glass now, which is the lowest value. That's a problem."
Still, Savannah's contract specifies that Pratt must take the glass, which Prevatt expects will end up in private landfills. It makes up almost a fifth of Savannah's waste stream by weight. The city considered removing glass from the mix but ultimately decided against it in an effort to keep the program stable, a move that Mouw applauded.
"There might be a market on the horizon,' he said. "Rather than whipsaw our customers back and forth with these items this month and then change and do something else. It doesn't make for a stable program. Ultimately, it's a policy decision. For this year we're continuing just as we have been with paper, cardboard, plastics, metals and glass you can continue to place into your cart."
Hardegree said Georgia, which has two bottle-to-bottle and four fiberglass manufacturers, is working on solutions to glass recycling.
"This has become a challenge in the past couple of years as glass contamination in single stream collection has increased-we are working on this as well with better technology in the processing facilities,
along with more separate glass collection and expanded drop-off capability," she said.
Glass can be endlessly recycled and consumers do a good job of putting it in the recycling bin, Mouw said.
"Where it has the right conditions in play it can come back into the economy and play a role in achieving environmental benefits," he said.
Like glass, hard plastics labeled numbers 1-7 are similarly still accepted in Savannah's bins, though there are only traditional recycling markets for some of these.
"Right now there are good strong markets for plastics 1 and 2," Prevatt said. "One is PETE, polyethylene terephthalate. That's clear plastic soda bottle. Then, number 2 is HDPE or high density polyethylene, is used for a lot of things like milk cartons, things like that. Those two there are firm markets."
The others plastics, which make up about 1 percent of the waste stream by weight, don't have profitable markets at the moment. Mouw confirmed that around the country "there have been lots dropping 3-7 plastics." Pratt uses them as fuel.
"What happens to those, I was not aware of this until the new agreement," Prevatt said. "There's not a recycling market so they're sent to a gassification plant next to the (Pratt paper) mill. It creates a synthetic gas that powers the turbine used in plant at the Conyers paper mill. It's not recycled in the sense of recovered material, but there is a beneficial use of it."
Stewardship, avoided landfill use
Prevatt figures the more than 5,400 tons of recycling the curbside program diverts from the city's landfill every year extends its life by about two and a half weeks annually for an estimated value of over $2 million over the last decade. But that's not enough to make recycling revenue neutral.
"If you look at just the hard numbers it would be cheaper to landfill it," Prevatt said. "Then we have to look at other factors things like it's a service that people want. It's a value people have."
Savannah spokesman Ken Slats agreed.
"We have the responsibility to treat the environment right," Slats said. "There are a lot of things if we just broke it down by numbers we shouldn't be doing."
New businesses and industries coming to Savannah, like the film industry, are among those looking for a recycling program.
"As we try to attract new businesses and industries into the community, that's a selling point having a recycling program," Prevatt said. "That value is out there. These are the criteria we look at for where we want to be."
Recycling nationwide and in Georgia is in a transitional period working to sort materials better and to introduce domestic markets. Just wait, Hardegree said.
"Multiple national, regional and locals organizations are working to increase domestic markets via innovation while improving technology with more investment," she wrote. "Along with this we intend to expand education and outreach to the public to do a better job in understanding what to put into and what not to put into their bin or cart and why."Recycling is alive and relatively well, despite some rhetoric of doom-we just have to pool resources, work together and do a better job overall-the environmental and economic benefits of recycling are worth this time and investment."

Texto completo: Batter up and banter up! The new baseball season is in full swing, and the playful palaver of the plate is wafting through the spring air like the smell of freshly-mowed grass. Take me out to the "call" game!
As lexicographer Paul Dickson observes in his introduction to The Dickson Baseball Dictionary, baseball slang leans toward the light and low-key. Baseballese is baseball-ease.
If basketball is a street fight, full of speed and physics ("fast break," "rebound," "pivot"), and football is war, exploding with "bombs," "blitzes" and "shotgun formations," the dialect of the diamond suggests a friendly checkers match. As Steve Palay noted in a 1987 op-ed for the New York Times, "Going into 'extra innings' sounds so much better than 'sudden death.'"
Even the most dangerous play in baseball - the pitcher throwing at the batter to intimidate him - is euphemized into a playful love tap: "brushback," "duster," "chin music." Likewise, when Babe Ruth earned fame for continually unleashing the most powerful weapon in baseball, the home run, he was dubbed not "The King of Clobber" or "The Duke of Death," but "The Sultan of Swat," as if he were a comfy caliph just batting away a pesky fly.
Terms such as "squeeze play," "slider" and "soft liner" seem more appropriate for lovemaking than battle. And what other sport would call its field of play a ball "park"? Even our nickname for baseball refers to its laid-back, easygoing pace: "the national pastime."
This relaxed tone is perhaps best exemplified in baseball's creative use of common comfort food. Names for the ball itself include "pea," "apple," "tomato," "onion" and "stitched potato."
Now it's your turn to step up to the "plate." See whether you can match each of these edible baseball-isms with its correct definition.
Terms:
1. green pea 2. jam sandwich 3. cheese 4. rhubarb 5. cup of coffee 6. ice cream cone 7. can of corn 8. pancake 9. lollipop 10. pickle
Definitions:
A. a minor-league player's brief trial in the major leagues B. a play in which a baserunner is caught in a rundown between bases C. a soft pitch that's easy to hit D. a ball caught in the top of a fielder's glove so it looks like a scoop of ice cream E. an easily caught pop fly F. a heated dispute or ruckus G. a rookie H. an old, worn out fielder's glove I. fastball J. a pitch thrown near the batter's fists

Resumen: Several of the investigations targeting Trump carry potential criminal repercussions, but none appear to be as threatening as a couple of inquiries being conducted out of the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. Following her November election, New York Attorney General Letitia James pledged to shine "a light" on Trump's business dealings and probe him for possible crimes - and she has made good on that promise. The attorney general's office in New Jersey is looking into similar allegations at Trump's Garden State golf club.

Texto completo: President Trump has been on a victory lap since special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his investigation with a whimper earlier this month - but the commander-in-chief may not be completely out of the woods yet.
Although Mueller's full report has yet to see the light of day, Attorney General William Barr stated matter-of-factly in a March 24 letter that the special counsel's investigation cleared Trump of any criminal wrongdoing.
Mueller's anti-climatic conclusion shifts focus to New York, where at least seven civil and criminal investigations into Trump's business dealings and personal affairs remain ongoing.
Trump faces several more investigations and lawsuits in states such as New Jersey and Maryland as well as intense oversight efforts in Congress, but the president's deep ties to his native New York has made him a particularly hot target for Empire State prosecutors.
Several of the investigations targeting Trump carry potential criminal repercussions, but none appear to be as threatening as a couple of inquiries being conducted out of the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.
Michael Cohen, Trump's ex-personal attorney, pleaded guilty in a case last year that directly implicated the president in illegal pre-2016 election hush money payments.
Cohen confessed Trump ordered him to issue the payments to two women who had threatened to go public with allegations they had sex with the president over a decade ago.
Cohen has copped to campaign finance crimes stemming from those payoffs and will start serving a three-year prison sentence in May on those and other charges.
Pertinently, the statute of limitations for the campaign finance crime runs out in 2021, meaning Trump could be charged if he loses the 2020 election.
The Manhattan feds are separately looking into Trump's inaugural committee and whether it was used as a pay-to-play scheme for deep-pocketed political donors, according to reports.
The committee raised $107 million - more than any other committee in history. Prosecutors are reportedly probing whether foreigners illegally funneled money through the committee via straw donors in order to gain access to the incoming administration and whether Trump enriched himself by plugging proceeds into his own business empire.
Following her November election, New York Attorney General Letitia James pledged to shine "a light" on Trump's business dealings and probe him for possible crimes - and she has made good on that promise.
James picked up where her predecessor, Barbara Underwood, left off and continued to investigate Trump's namesake foundation over possible self-dealing. The foundation was forced to dissolve, but James wants the Trump family to cough up millions of dollars in fines and be barred from serving on charity boards for a decade.
The attorney general's office in New Jersey is looking into similar allegations at Trump's Garden State golf club.
The New York Times published an extensive report in October alleging Trump and his father for years engaged in complex "tax schemes" that at times amounted to "outright fraud."
Within days of that report, the New York State Department of Taxation confirmed it was looking into the allegations.

A FUNNY THING ABOUT BROOKS; Beloved by audiences, but not always by those he lived and worked with

Texto completo: He's not the 2,000-year-old man yet.
But Mel Brooks turns 93 in June. And like the kvetching character he created with old pal Carl Reiner in 1961, he's showing no signs of slowing down.
After nearly 80 years in show business, Brooks still travels the country with a one-man show, hungry for the applause, loving the attention.
But he'll find little to love in "Funny Man."
The substantial biography from Patrick McGilligan gives Brooks credit for some of cinema's funniest moments, from the campfire scene in "Blazing Saddles" to the song-and-dance number in "Young Frankenstein."
Yet it insists he's stolen plenty of credit, too. Grabbed cash, as well, in hard-hearted maneuvers that left collaborators fuming, and his first wife desperate.
Which is why McGilligan's title cuts two ways. Brooks is definitely funny. But for a rich and beloved celebrity, he often acts a little, well, funny.
Born Melvin Kaminsky in 1926, on the kitchen table of a Brownsville tenement, his parents couldn't afford him. Brooks later joked that they were so poor "the lady next door gave birth to me."
Then, life got tougher. When he was 2, his father died, leaving a widow and four boys.
Everyone pitched in and at 14, Mel, the youngest, got his first real job. It was at a second-rate Catskills hotel, the Butler Lodge, where Brooks was expected to carry bags and run errands.
In between, though, he was a tummler, a Borscht Belt jester, there to keep the guests entertained continuously.
His go-to shtick? Brooks would put on a derby and an alpaca overcoat, pick up two suitcases, and walk to the edge of the swimming pool's diving board. "I can't go on!" he'd shout. And then jump in.
That summer proved Brooks would do anything for a laugh, or just a bit of attention. And it also marked his introduction to Sid Caesar, a strapping 18-year-old already landing acting gigs.
Brooks envisioned his future.
It would have to wait awhile. He continued playing the Jewish Alps, then went into the Army. After the war, he reconnected with Caesar, now a stage star who had just been offered an early TV variety series, "Your Show of Shows."
The producer and most of the staff hated Brooks - a "talking writer," they sneered, someone who shouted out gags but couldn't finish a sketch. Caesar hired him anyway. Caesar, who later signed Neil Simon and Woody Allen, had an eye for talent.
But he also had wild mood swings, fueled by booze and pills.
Once, while they were sitting around Caesar's hotel suite, Brooks began to annoy him, whining that he wanted to go out. Oh, you want to go out? Caesar snapped. He threw open the window, picked up the pint-sized comic, and dangled him outside by his ankles.
"How far do you want to go?" Caesar shouted. "Is that far enough?"
"In would be nice," Brooks responded.
It was a crazy time, but a profitable one. When he became head writer, Brooks made $1,750 a week, which was about half of the average family income for a year. He was also a husband and a father.
Yet he was unclear on some basic concepts. He gave his wife, Florence Baum, a dancer, an allowance of $3 a day. He kept a little black book of women's names, and regularly came home late. Finally, he didn't return at all.
The split was ugly, with long fights over money and late child-support checks.
Brooks would soon find a happier relationship with Anne Bancroft, marrying her in 1964. Even people who couldn't understand her attraction admitted it was a genuine love affair.
"When he comes home at night, when that key goes in the door, I mean, my heart's fluttering," Bancroft said, after they spent 20 years together. "It's like the party's going to start!"
Brooks' relations with business partners, though, were not quite as jolly. Buck Henry felt cheated out of credit for co-creating TV's "Get Smart!" The crew on Brooks' first film complained about red-faced rages.
Of course, it had been a fight just to get "The Producers" made.
People hated the Hitler jokes ("How about 'Springtime for Mussolini'?" one mogul suggested). The shoot was a struggle, with the studio pushing Brooks to fire Gene Wilder, and Zero Mostel fighting Brooks daily.
When the finished picture had its sneak preview in Philadelphia, it was as the bottom half of a double-bill. The first feature was a German sex-ed film. Five people stayed, one was a homeless woman.
"The worst night of my life," Brooks said.
Reviews were mixed, as they always were with Brooks' movies. The Daily News gave it four stars. The New York Times labeled it "shoddy and gross and cruel."
When that year's Oscars were awarded, Brooks won for best original screenplay.
The tummler was now an auteur.
Brooks reveled in his new career, although it wasn't easy at first. "Blazing Saddles" had a disastrous start when its original co-stars, Richard Pryor and Gig Young, were waylaid by serious substance-abuse problems.
Then Cleavon Little stepped in for Pryor. And after the picture had already started shooting, Wilder jumped in to take over from Young. When the film came out, it was clear Brooks hadn't made just another movie. He had invented "A Mel Brooks movie."
From now on he would specialize in big busy farces that mixed wild parody with Borscht-belt shtick and boasted a stock company of zany actors. "Young Frankenstein" refined the formula, with a script so terrific that stars like Gene Hackman begged to do cameos.
Brooks turned out hits for a while, including "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs." Still, the old problems remained.
Wilder, who felt cheated out of money and credit for "Young Frankenstein," never worked with Brooks again. Comedian Howard Morris, a friend since "Your Show of Shows," complained Brooks was becoming dangerously self-indulgent.
Soon, Brooks' films started flopping. He didn't take it well. When Roger Ebert slammed "Dracula - Dead and Loving It," Brooks was furious. "I have a body of work," he yelled at the critic. "You only have a body."
With his Hollywood career fading, Bancroft urged him to consider Broadway and turn "The Producers" into a musical. To Brooks' delight, the result was a smash, bringing him the respect he had always hungered for. Nominated for 15 Tonys, it won a record 12, and three were for Brooks.
He had always had an ego, but now he joined that rarified group as an EGOT, winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. At the age of 74, the boy from Brownsville finally reached the top.
Of course, the high couldn't last. A film of the musical flopped; a follow-up Broadway attempt, "Young Frankenstein," was only so-so. Bancroft's death in 2005 left him shattered, and he refuses to discuss it.
Instead, in his regular one-man shows, he screens films. He makes jokes. He basks in the applause. When he first arrived in Hollywood, he used to shout at the tour buses, "Hi, it's me, a celebrity, Mel Brooks!"
He doesn't have to do that anymore.
Now, everyone knows who he is - even if, as "Funny Man" suggests, nobody really knows him.

That's Punny

Texto completo: Puns. They've been called the lowest form of humor. What are they? A type of wordplay that relies on a double meaning. For instance: "The kitten nearly went out the window -- it would have been a cat-astrophe!" Some news organizations love puns in headlines, in part because they can be fun, and in part because a double meaning can literally double the meaning in a short headline. At a tabloid, I once had to write a headline about a woman who promised her best friend's son that she would go to the prom with him if he didn't find a date. He didn't, but the school barred them from attending, because she was married. The headline was: "Prom-Mrs., Prom-Misses."
At The New York Times, puns are allowed, but we have lots of rules about them. Here's the short version: Puns have a place, but as a trace element rather than a staple. A pun should be a surprise encounter, evoking a sly smile rather than a groan and flattering the intelligence of a reader who gets the joke. Plays on personal names never qualify.
Basically, we try to avoid any pun that sounds like something your trying-too-hard dad would say -- "The rubber industry is bouncing back!" -- as he digs his elbow into your ribs and adds, "Get it?" The Times wants to be your smart friend, not your corny dad (see "Ugh! Dad Jokes" on Page 9).
I should know -- I'm the senior editor who keeps an eye on digital headlines at The Times. So people regularly ask me if a headline is too punny. (And sometimes they don't. Sigh.) Why don't you try being the judge: Here are a few real Times headlines that I thought made the grade, and a few that I thought didn't. Which was which? ◊ 1. A Labor Watchdog Who's Not All Bite
2.
'Roseanne' Gets Barred
3.End of an Aura 4. Who Killed the Iceman? Clues Emerge in a Very Cold Case 5. The Mush in the Iditarod May Soon Be Melted Snow 6. Business Is Boo-ing! TheWorld of Extreme Haunts
7. Game, Sweat, Match Answers:
1. Bad. "Not All Bite" is an elbow to the ribs. 2. Bad. Roseanne Barr is an actress. We don't pun with names. 3. Good. It's usually "The End of an Era," but this was about a dead fashion designer who definitely had an aura. 4. Good. It works even if you don't get the Iceman/cold case wordplay. 5. Good. "Mushing" is another name for dog-sledding. 6. Bad. Boo-ing, instead of Booming? Boo! 7. Good. It's usually "Game, Set, Match," but a heat wave dogged this tennis tournament.
What made the difference? The good ones weren't overly obvious. The losers were.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
"Fart" is not a word you see very often in The New York Times. In fact, for most of the paper's history you never saw it at all -- not because fart wasn't in regular use (it has been since at least half a millennium before The Times existed), but rather because of its crudeness. It wasn't until 1972 that it made its first appearance, in an extended quotation in an article about the writer Samuel Beckett. For the first story to feature farts, it had the perfect title: "As Close to Silence as a Man Can Get."
Readers of the latest New York Times for Kids, which is published the last Sunday of each month, will learn very quickly how much can change in 47 years. This issue of the paper within the paper is dedicated to comedy, and covers everything from puns and dad jokes to politics and pranks. Naturally, there are farts. So many, in fact, that they have their own section.
"We had too many good stories from writers about farts," the NYT Kids editor, Amber Williams, said. "So we needed a farts page." And there it is, right between "National" and "Science."
"We already use humor," Ms. Williams said, but this issue in particular allowed NYT Kids "to really push our stories, our style, our art as far as it could go." And it's not all hot air; the issue also features discussions of the science and philosophy of comedy, along with games, quizzes and more. John Schwartz, who covers climate change for The Times, wrote about his propensity for groan-worthy dad jokes. Nicholas St. Fleur, a science reporter, examined the bodily practicalities of astronauts' lives in space.
NYT Kids is a print-only section produced monthly by NYT Mag Labs, and takes the form of a mini-version of the paper itself, covering national and international news, science, culture, sports and more. But there are also occasional special issues -- there will be four this year, beginning with the humor issue -- that are themed.
It is important in every issue of NYT Kids, and particularly in a special issue like this, to "package it in a way that doesn't talk down to kids," said Debra Bishop, the art director of The New York Times Magazine Labs, who oversees the design of the mini-paper. "You want it to be cool, but you want it to also be very smart." It is, she said, "beautifully designed within the genre. With a little bit of vulgarity in there, which I hope people aren't too upset about."
"The whole thing is pretty devious," Ms. Williams said, though there's "nothing inappropriate." Still, her primary concern isn't annoying adults by providing children with a treasure trove of pranks and jokes (though both she and Ms. Bishop joked about whether this issue, with all its pranks and scatological humor, might get them into trouble). Rather, her motivation is to stay true to her audience.
"There's tons of poking fun at grown-ups in this issue, and us siding with our readers," Ms. Williams said -- its contents include a how-to guide for making fun of your parents. "Even if adults are like, oh no, I don't like being roasted, we don't care. Because that's what our readers want."
Even so, the issue has plenty to offer older readers, too. Ms. Bishop pulled a scatological prank on her co-workers, though it didn't quite work out. She swiped a couple of deceptively shaped chocolate-peanut-butter swirls (check out the section's Food page to see exactly what shape) from a photo shoot late one afternoon. She left one on a colleague's chair -- but in the morning it was gone.
Nobody ever mentioned the chocolate surprise; and someone, somewhere, must be very confused. But Ms. Bishop stands by NYT Kids' content. "I hope people actually make the chocolate-peanut-butter swirls," Ms. Bishop said. "They taste pretty good."

Texto completo: The last time Jimmy Butler met his former Timberwolves teammates, he greeted several of them as they were boarding their bus to depart the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.
He even gave Ryan Saunders a gift to commemorate Saunders taking over as the interim head coach -- a bottle of wine.
"It's still in my house," Saunders said. "That's an expensive bottle so I'm saving it for a big moment."
Saturday might not be that moment for Saunders, but it will be a big moment for Wolves fans, who will get a chance to voice their full-throated displeasure with the way Butler orchestrated his exit out of town. The melodrama is still fresh:
The way Butler blew up his first preseason practice, cursing out teammates and General Manager Scott Layden, then sat down for an ESPN interview after news of the practice leaked.
How he didn't play in multiple games early in the season because of what former coach Tom Thibodeau described as "general soreness."
And how the whole thing threw off the energy of a Wolves team that started 4-9 before Thibodeau approved a trade of Butler to Philadelphia, a start that plagued the rest of the season.
Butler's 76ers clobbered the Wolves 149-107 in Philadelphia back in January. But the 76ers come to Target Center for their lone visit Saturday, and Butler knows what to expect.
"They're going to boo me," Butler told the New York Times this week. "I would boo me too. I'm not going to lie to you. I'd boo the heck out of myself."
There were boos even when Butler was here, such as when he was introduced in the starting lineup during the home opener against Cleveland. But now Wolves fans don't have to feel confusion over booing one of their own since Butler got his wish and will be wearing enemy clothing Saturday night.
But while fans may revel in the hostility, some of Butler's former teammates don't hold the same attitude. Butler had strained relationships with some Wolves, among them center Karl-Anthony Towns, and he questioned Towns' and Andrew Wiggins' competitive drive often. But others have a different feeling.
"That's my brother, so we talk quite often," guard Tyus Jones said. "He knows it's going to be interesting coming back. … We went through a lot of battles together, made a playoff run. Accomplished a lot in his one year here. I think he's more excited to get a chance to see everybody. This was home for him for a year. He still does have good memories here."
While fans may be upset with Butler, Jones and Saunders said they were able to distinguish between their personal relationships with Butler and Butler's desire to leave Minnesota.
"It's not personal. And everyone has their personal preference," Jones said. "He decided he didn't want to continue playing here and nobody holds that against him. … I don't think anyone confuses the two with holding it against him or being mad at him. At the end of the day, they're entitled to their own opinion and what they want to do with their life and career. That's what he decided he wanted to do."
Added Saunders: " I've always [said] you need to base your opinions and your relationships off interactions you've had as an individual with somebody. Other things can come into play at times. It's going to be how people treat you as an individual. … Obviously you know we wish him well."
That may not be the case with fans, and Butler said he's OK with that.
"I love it," Butler told the Times. "Who wants to be loved all the time?"

Now more than ever, Wisconsin and the U.S. need 'wounded healers'

Texto completo: Editor's note: If you or someone you know is dealing with suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-8255 or text "Hopeline" to the National Crisis Text Line at 741-741.
From China to Europe, from India to South America, average suicide rates around the world have fallen 33 percent since 1990.
Not in the United States. American suicide rates are at their highest levels since the second world war, making suicide the second leading cause of death between ages 10-34, government data show.
The increase in suicides, combined with record levels of drug overdoses and alcohol-related fatalities, are so extreme that they're lowering the life expectancy of the average American. Mental health problems disable more American workers than any other affliction — suburban, rural or urban — and caregiver burnout and compassion fatigue are epidemic.
Not for generations, if ever, has a wounded nation needed its elite corps of "wounded healers."
They are the counselors, social workers and psychologists often best suited to accompany others on the path to recovery because they've already walked that path themselves.
They possess some of the most indispensable and in-demand therapeutic skills in the country, and by all accounts, they exist in sizable numbers. In a nation swimming against the global tide of improving mental health, these healers ought to be the heroes.
But few advertise what might be their strongest credential.
Instead, many appear to do their best work with quiet professional anonymity — except in moments of confidentially when their private story might help a struggling client.
"There are many like us," said Bart Andrews, a suicide attempt survivor who's a practicing psychologist and senior administrator at St. Louis-based Behavioral Health Response.
"We're really afraid to tell our stories because we're afraid we're going to lose our jobs," Andrews told a suicide survivor site called Live Through This, in a 2015 interview shortly after his first public disclosure. "People are going to take our degrees away. They're going to take our licenses away. They're going to think I'm not a good therapist."
The mental health field professes to want to de-stigmatize the shame and stereotypes that isolate many who struggle, he said, and yet the same taboos reach far into the corridors of institutional providers.
Surprisingly few "come out," said Stacey Freedenthal, a Colorado psychotherapist and associate professor at the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work.
"Some people cannot take the risk of revealing their mental illness, suicidality, or other vulnerabilities. They might be fired, or discriminated against, or hurt in other ways," said Freedenthal, also a suicide attempt survivor.
Knowledge beyond a diploma Unsung and unheralded, their occupation seems like a contradiction — mental health professionals who lived through mental illness, drug and alcohol counselors who lived through dependency, suicide intervention therapists who survived their own attempts.
"Theories and interpretations are not much help in the terrifying depths of the psyche," Kathryn Larisey, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, wrote in her 2012 article "The Wounded Healer."
Many have diplomas and licenses but rely on knowledge no doctoral degree can confer. From drugs to depression, they make a uniquely convincing case that people can and do recover — even when their clients are nowhere near it.
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, a pioneer in modern psychology, coined the term "wounded healer" more than a century ago. He meant it as a badge of honor, a tribute. It remains in use: "My name is Dr. Paul Epstein and I'm a wounded healer," begins one therapist's blog post.
But some balk at the title. To them, the word "wounded" smacks of impairment or deficiency. "I hate the 'wounded provider' metaphor and cringe when I hear folks use it," Andrews said in an interview.
Whatever they're called, their numbers spill out beyond psychiatric hospitals and clinics. Within non-profits and social agencies, many prefer to be called "peer specialist" or "recovery coach." In the 12-step recovery programs of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, they're "sponsors." For those who served in war zones, they're fellow vets.
The most accepted term is a practitioner "with lived experience."
Camilo Delgado, a Florida-based psychotherapist and international mental health consultant, prefers the term "alchemist" — someone who can transform pain into purpose.
'Post-traumatic growth' To be sure, just because people have crash-and-burn stories of their own hardly qualifies them as competent healers. Therapists preoccupied with their own traumas aren't much help to others. But those who have mastered their own alchemy can possess therapeutic superpowers.
"Someone doesn't have to have been suicidal to help suicidal people, but there can be gifts in the experience," Freedenthal said.
At Rogers Memorial Hospital in metro Milwaukee, psychologist Sarah Reed prefers to speak of "post-traumatic growth" — not the more common diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
In videos and workshops, Reed has disclosed her own history of an eating disorder, depression and anxiety. "It often gives me more clout than my degree and education," said Reed, who holds a doctorate in community psychology.
Therapeutic storytelling can be transformative for those who open up and for those who hear the stories, according to a consensus of recovered healers.
Reed conducts workshops to help young adults safely write their own narratives, using guidelines written by recovered healers. Young people sort the costs and benefits of sharing their stories, weighing how much to share and with whom — and only in situations that will be helpful.
"People with lived experience are absolutely necessary and undervalued," Reed said.
Out of the 'closet' It took Freedenthal 22 years to break her silence. Her own suicide attempt took place in her first year of graduate school. "Professionally, it seemed too much of a liability for people to know," Freedenthal wrote on her webpage.
In 2017, she published a short memoir in the New York Times ("A Suicide Therapist's Secret Past"). She followed up with a "coming out" essay on her website ("The longer I hid that I myself had been intensely suicidal, the more hypocritical I felt.")
As the feedback poured in, she discovered how many others like her anonymously populate clinics and psychiatric hospitals. Scores wrote to her — some in training to start their careers, some in mid-career, and many who kept their recovery stories secret all the way to retirement. The statistics bear out what she found:
A 2009 survey found that 87 percent of psychology graduate students reported experiencing anxiety; 68 percent reported symptoms of depression; 19 percent reported suicidal thoughts, according to the American Psychological Association.
A survey conducted at a U.S. workshop for clinical psychology trainees found that 59 percent had experienced suicidal ideation and 5 percent at one point actually had a plan to carry it out, according to the New School Psychology Bulletin in 2015.
An anonymous web survey of 678 British clinical psychologists found that two–thirds "had experienced mental health problems themselves." The same survey found that many didn't want to disclose due to shame and career consequences, reported the Journal of Clinical Psychology in 2018.
The impact of economic disruption Serious mental health challenges continue to rise in the U.S.
In 2017, deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide hit their highest levels in both Wisconsin and nationally since federal data collection began in 1999. The increases in Wisconsin are slightly higher than the national average, according to a Journal Sentinel analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The epidemic of mental and behavioral health afflictions defies simple explanations. But studies are consistent on one point: Exposure to traumatic assault, abuse and abandonment increase amid economic disruption. That leads to an increase in post-traumatic disorders including mental afflictions, addictions, aggression, homelessness and suicide.
However many recovered healers already exist, there aren't enough.
Acute shortages of social workers and counselors are well documented, particularly in rural regions. Of Wisconsin's 72 counties, 48 lack even one practicing child psychiatrist, according to the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.
"More of these healers and mental health professionals would greatly improve our mental health situation in the U.S," Delgado said.
John Schmid reports on how Wisconsin's people and communities are confronting the impact of globalization and economic disruption for the Journal Sentinel's Ideas Lab. Beginning with a 2017 series called, A Time to Heal, and then with multiple follow-up stories, he interviewed scores of social service and mental health practitioners. Email: john.schmid@jrn.com.

Deadly explosion hits near crowded Mogadishu restaurant

Texto completo: A car bomb exploded Thursday near a hotel and restaurant in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 11 people in a busy area targeted in the past by Islamist militants, rescue services said.
The explosion on a busy road in Mogadishu sent a huge cloud of smoke into the sky and destroyed two restaurants and cars parked in the area. A witness at the scene counted six dead bodies, according to Reuters.
"So far, we carried 11 dead people and 16 others wounded," Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin Ambulance service, told Reuters.
A police spokesman, Maj. Mohamed Hussein, told The Associated Press that the explosives-laden vehicle has detonated outside the restaurant.
"The blast destroyed a restaurant and killed many who were inside and outside the restaurant," he told Reuters. "The death toll may rise."
He said dozens of others had been injured in the blast, and that most of the casualties had been among diners at the crowded restaurant.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing. But the Islamist group al-Shabab, whose militants are linked to al-Qaida, have targeted the same location, the Wehliye Hotel, which is along Maka al Mukaram road.
On Saturday, al-Shabab gunmen stormed a government building in Mogadishu after a suicide car bombing, and the ensuing gunfight and blast killed at least 15 people, including the country's deputy labor minister, the police said, Reuters reported.
On Tuesday, a bomb planted in a private luxury car exploded in Mogadishu's Hodan District, killing the driver and injuring a nearby pedestrian, Col. Ahmed Abdi, a police official, told The AR
Al-Shabab are fighting to topple the Western-backed government protected by African Union forces. The group was ejected from Mogadishu in 2011 and has since been driven from most of its other strongholds.
The U.S. military has increased the number of deadly airstrikes against the militants since Donald Trump took office as president. A number of multinationartroops, including African Union forces, Somali forces and Kenyan soldiers, are also fighting al-Shabab.

Texto completo: Mientras Donald Trump recorría el país intentando convertirse en presidente, sus hijos viajaban en ocasiones al sur de Florida en avión y eran recibidos en el aeropuerto por un miembro de su equipo de seguridad, Zoltan Tamas, armado con pistola, que los conducía seguros hasta el campo de golf que la familia posee en Jupiter, a 80 millas al norte de Miami.
Tamas, de 38 años, había emigrado legalmente desde Rumanía en 2011. Logró la residencia permanente, pagaba sus impuestos, y se compró una casa.
Pero desde hace ocho meses está encerrado en un centro de detención del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés), y no ha podido ni siquiera ver a su esposa y a sus dos hijos de 11 y ocho años, según informa el diario The New York Times. La mujer y los niños son estadounidenses, pero dependían del salario del hombre para subsistir.
¿Qué sucedió?
Tamas fue arrestado después de que aplicara para conseguir la ciudadanía en 2016, cuando un control de antecedentes reveló que había sido condenado en Rumanía por un fraude con un seguro.
Su abogado ha recurrido ante la corte migratoria para evitar su deportación, y ha recibido cartas de apoyo de empresarios y antiguos empleadores, pero ICE considera que debe permanecer detenido hasta que se aclare su caso.
“A Zoltan no le atraparon cruzando la frontera”, ha explicado su abogado, Mario Urizar, “estaba en el país legalmente, pagando sus impuestos, y no tiene antecedentes criminales en Estados Unidos. ¿Por qué mantenerle detenido?”.
Tamas comenzó a trabajar para una propiedad de Trump en 2006, según el citado diario. Tenía entonces 25 años, y llegó al complejo vacacional de Mar-a-Lago con un visado H-2B de trabajo temporal.
Era camarero y estacionaba carros. Su novia de entonces, rumana, vino de vacaciones y se casaron en Las Vegas (Nevada). Fueron de luna de miel a Hawaii. Volvieron a Rumania, tuvieron un hijo, y en 2011 lograron la residencia permanente en la lotería de green cards, que permite cada año a 50.000 extranjeros emigrar legalmente a Estados Unidos por sorteo.
Tamas volvió a Florida, y logró trabajo en Mar-a-Lago, mientras su esposa se quedaba en Rumania esperando el nacimiento de su segundo hijo. En 2013, fue trasladado al campo de golf de Jupiter, y allí se convirtió en guarda de seguridad y, con los años, fue ascendiendo hasta convertirse en vicedirector de seguridad.
En 2016, transcurridos cinco años como residentes permanentes, la familia intentó conseguir la ciudadanía. La mujer y los niños lo lograron en abril de 2017. En junio, ICE citó a Tamas, y luego lo detuvo.

Trump extends Liberian immigration protections

Texto completo: Isabella Wreh-Fofana screamed with joy when she heard the news that the Trump administration had approved another year's delay in removing immigration protections for Liberians living in the United States.
The White House announcement on Thursday came just before she was to appear at the State Capitol alongside Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison and fellow Liberians to advocate for an extension of the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) program, which was set to end Sunday. Wreh-Fofana and hundreds of Liberians faced deportation to West Africa many years after resettling here to escape civil war.
"It's too emotional," Wreh-Fofana said of repeatedly waiting for extensions. "It's scary."
Liberians and their political advocates praised President Donald Trump's decision but called for comprehensive immigration reform and said they would immediately renew work on a legislative remedy that would offer those with DED status a pathway to citizenship.
Minnesota's senior U.S. senator, Amy Klobuchar, hailed the move by the man she hopes to succeed as president.
"The vision of them taking grandma in her wheelchair, after she's been here 30 years, back to a country [where] she hasn't been for decades -- it just didn't make a lot of sense," Klobuchar said in an interview.
She said Congress must make a priority of finding a permanent fix, but she expressed concern that a year from now, "We might well be back in this same situation, which just seems absurd."
Liberian refugees were initially authorized to stay in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) approved by President George H.W. Bush in 1991. The protections continued under DED in 2007 under President George W. Bush -- with no pathway to apply for permanent residency -- but Trump announced last spring that conditions in Liberia had improved regarding the war and the Ebola virus and gave the program one year to wind down.
In his directive to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Thursday, Trump said that he had decided it was in America's foreign policy interest to extend DED through March 30, 2020. "The overall situation in West Africa remains concerning and Liberia is an important regional partner for the United States," Trump's directive said. "The reintegration of [DED program] beneficiaries into Liberian civil and political life will be a complex task, and an unsuccessful transition could strain United States-Liberian relations and undermine Liberia's post-civil war strides toward democracy and political stability."
Ellison has spearheaded a legal effort by 10 attorneys general to support a lawsuit by Liberians to block the termination of their DED protections.
The plaintiffs sued Trump and Nielsen this month, asking Massachusetts U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman for a nationwide preliminary injunction. Ellison argued that Minnesota, which has one of the nation's largest Liberian communities, would see its health and social services industries harmed because many Liberians work in those sectors, which already are beset by worker shortages. Wreh-Fofana, a resident of St. Paul who moved here in 2002, is a nursing assistant.
Minnesota is home to nearly 16,000 people who were born in Liberia or claim Liberian ancestry.
"The Trump administration looked at the case against them and realized they were probably going to lose the motion for a preliminary injunction in court … so they did what they should have done in the first place," Ellison said.
He added: "Making people ride this roller-coaster year after year is inhumane, hurts families and wreaks havoc on our economy and communities. It's no way for any Minnesotan to live."
Abdullah Kiatamba, executive director of African Immigrant Services in Minnesota and a national voice in the push for extension, said that ending the program "would have separated families … [and] caused so many problems in our community."
Ebenezer Community Church, which has been active in pushing for the extension, is anticipating a jubilant congregation on Sunday. But minister Chea Jerboh noted, "We don't want to go back to the same situation so we have to keep the pressure on. … We want to lobby those who are in power to come up with a bill that can pass." The Organization of Liberians in Minnesota, which has worked with the church on DED, is planning a town hall on Friday at 5:30 p.m. at its Brooklyn Center office to discuss how to address the matter before the next deadline.
Trump's directive expressed a desire to give Congress time as it "considers remedial legislation" that would make repeatedly granting one-year extensions unnecessary. U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., vowed to wake up the next morning and get back to finding cosponsors for his bipartisan bill with U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., that would move DED holders into TPS for the next three years.
"Immigration is a complicated issue here in Congress and it's going to take a lot of investment in time and energy and coalition-building to get it done," Phillips said.
House Democrats also introduced the Dream and Promise Act this month to give immigrants under DED, TPS and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) the option to seek permanent legal status.
"We're not going to sleep. … We have to have a congressional fix for this," said Imam Mohammed Dukuly, a community leader who recently spoke on DED at a news conference in front of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
He suggested the possibility of going to D.C. to lobby for a solution on Monday.

'It's just not for me': Why a growing number of women are saying no to parenthood

Texto completo: For Marianne Miller, 32, watching other kids play with baby dolls during her childhood was the first time she realized she never wanted to have children of her own.
"I could always see child rearing was a choice, and I knew immediately it was a choice I wanted to opt out of," Miller said.
Today, Miller is married and works as a voice actress in Los Angeles. She isn't alone in leading a "childfree" life. America's fertility rate steadily declined between 2014 and 2017, and 2017 marked the lowest rate in over 30 years, with 60. 3 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, according to the most recent data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In a 2018 poll from Morning Consult for The New York Times of nearly 2,000 people ages 20 to 45, 36 percent of survey respondents who did not want children or were not sure about becoming parents said they wanted more leisure time. Thirty-four percent said they haven't found a partner to raise children with, and 31 percent can't afford childcare.
That means thousands of American women are turning their back on parenthood for reasons ranging from financial stability to lifestyle. Here's what you need to know about this growing trend:
'It's just not for me'
Mikaela Fleisher, 31, who lives in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said motherhood never felt natural.
"I have never felt drawn to have children of my own," Fleisher said.
Beyond not feeling connected to parenthood, Fleisher also enjoys the freedom of living a childfree life. When she is not working as a receptionist at a local animal hospital, Fleisher volunteers with animal rescue organizations and sleeps in on her days off. She also has chronic migraines, so she says caring for herself without also caring for a child works best for her life.
"Just because society tells us that we should grow up, get married and have children does not mean that it's the right thing for everyone to do," Fleisher said.
Society telling women they must have children is also on the decline, according to Laura S. Scott, author of "Two is Enough" and director of the Childless By Choice Project. She said American women used to face social isolation from friends and neighbors with children, but, for many, that stigma has dissipated with celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Aniston and Helen Mirren explaining their choice not to become mothers.
"We think everyone is going to love being a parent, but that's just not true," Scott said. "We have these role models where we can point to them and say, ‘Well she doesn’t regret it. '"
Both Miller and Fleisher said their parents have not pressured them about children, and although Miller said she has had some friends with children "disappear" because of busy schedules, she has always felt secure in her decision to remain childfree.
Women in the United States are not the only ones questioning whether parenthood is right for them. Fiona Thomas, 32, an author from Birmingham, England, said she has never felt "maternal," and she agreed that she and her husband both feel a sense of freedom without children. In 2017, England and Wales saw the lowest number of live births in over a decade, according to the Office for National Statistics.
"I've never felt that uncontrollable urge to have kids so I always assumed it wasn't in the cards for me," Thomas said. "I enjoy the freedom. I also enjoy getting to be selfish a lot of the time. "
Higher education, careers
Women are choosing higher education and career opportunities in the face of the high costs of raising a child, according to Brady Hamilton, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics.
Many women who pursue higher education do have children, though, and at increasing rates. Between 1994 and 2014, the percentage of women with a Ph. D aged 40 to 44 who had ever given birth increased from 65 percent to 80 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. But, overall trends still point to American women having fewer children later in life, with nearly 500,000 fewer babies born in 2017 than 2007, The New York Times reported.
"There's a lot of factors that go into the choice of whether or not to start a family," Hamilton said. "People are asking themselves, 'Is this really a good time to have children?'"
The cost of raising a child is an estimated $233,610, excluding college tuition, according to a 2018 estimate from the Department of Agriculture.
Miller said that, although she does own her home and gives "150 percent" of herself to her career, without child costs she and her partner still "barely have enough money to make ends meet. "
Children present more than a financial concern for Miller and Thompson. Both emphasized mental health issues. Thomas said her mental health made her think "more deeply" about whether having children was the right decision — especially if she couldn't take the medications during pregnancy that treat depression and anxiety.

More: U. S. birth rate plummets to lowest point in 30 years
"Having a mental illness has definitely brought up more questions about whether having a family would impact my wellbeing," Thomas said.
Scott agreed that the freedom women or couples without children feel extends beyond having to worry whether a babysitter is going to cancel.
"It's freedom in all aspects, in terms of personal freedom, financial freedom, the freedom to move around or travel," Scott said. "We're seeing people become more honest about the pitfalls of family. "
Who will take care of me when I'm older?
Scott said one of the worries childfree women often have is wondering who will care for them when they are older and can no longer maintain their own home.
"People do worry, 'What happens when I get old?'" Scott said. "There's a perception that not having kids is a state of arrested development until you get old. "
But Scott added that the women choosing not to have children who she works with are actively planning for retirement decades in advance. Plus, women can save their money not spent on children to live safely and comfortably as they age.
More: Having a baby? You won't get a good night's sleep for 6 years, study says
Thomas said she and her husband also worry about being "lonely" as they age, since they do not live near any family.
"That sense of community is really important to me, and I do worry that I'll be missing out when I'm older," Thomas said.
Fleisher and Miller agreed that the idea of a family to rely on in your later years can mean something different to everyone, regardless of whether that means children, pets, a partner or other friends and family. Miller said she tells women considering the decision not to have children that it is "something you know in your heart whether you want to do. "
"Our lives are entirely customizable," Miller said. "Ultimately, no factor other than your own wants or needs should come into question. "

Adam Schiff has no business on the Intelligence Committee

Texto completo: After two years of intense anticipation and speculation, the findings of the Mueller Report are finally in: President Trump did not collude with the Russians.
The headline in the New York Times on Monday, March 25 read, “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” the Washington Post declared, “Mueller finds no conspiracy,” and the Wall Street Journal printed, “Mueller finds no Trump collusion.”
In spite of all of that, on Tuesday, March 26, Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, was quoted in the Washington Post as saying, “Undoubtedly, there is collusion…We will continue to investigate the counterintelligence issues.”
In another interview with “ABC This Week,” Schiff said that there is “still significant evidence of collusion” and that “there’s a difference between compelling evidence of collusion and whether the special counsel concludes that he can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the criminal charge of conspiracy.”
Okay, then.
Either they don’t deliver the papers to Burbank, or Schiff is prepared to accept the Mueller Report the same way he accepted the results of the 2016 presidential election.
Not at all.
Schiff is like one of those Japanese soldier hold-outs they found on a Pacific island 30 years after World War II ended, still carrying on the fight. Long after Trump and Melania and Ivanka are dead and buried, Schiff will be demanding that President Barron Trump answer a few more questions about the Steele dossier.
At first glance it’s easy to assume that Schiff is pretty dense, and think “how did in the world did he even get on the Intelligence Committee in the first place? Did his parents pay someone a half-million dollar bribe?”
But don’t make the mistake of thinking that he’s stupid.
On the contrary, Schiff is a malicious grifter who has recklessly peddled this provably false conspiracy theory for years, and can’t muster up the courage to admit that he’s wrong.
Schiff’s incessant collusion theories have gotten him so much coverage on cable news he’s been on MSNBC more often than the inmates on “Lockup.”
Here’s just a sampling of some of his greatest hits…
In March of 2017, Schiff said on Meet the Press that there was “circumstantial evidence of collusion” and “direct evidence… of deception.”
Also in March, Schiff told MSNBC there was “more than circumstantial evidence” — and claimed that had seen it.
On December 14, 2017, Schiff told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “Well, look, there’s clear evidence of an attempt to collude.”
On March 1, 2018, Megan McCain of ABC’s “The View” asked Schiff, “Last March you said you have more than circumstantial evidence of treasonous collusion with Russia. What specifically were you referring to? And please be specific because if it’s true I do believe Americans have the right to know a year later what that is.”
In response, Schiff gave a rambling answer that referenced George Papadapolous, Donald Trump Jr., and a meeting at Trump Tower.
When he was finished, McCain said, “I just think if Mueller doesn’t end up charging him, it just looks like a lot of smoke and mirrors.”
On May 27, 2018 he told “ABC This Week,” that of the Russia investigation, “I think, of a size and scope possibly beyond Watergate.”
On August 5, 2018 he told “CBS This Morning,” “I think there’s plenty of evidence of collusion.”
For two years, Schiff would tell anyone who would listen that President Trump colluded with the Russians, and now we know for a fact, that he was full of it the whole time.
A charlatan like this doesn’t belong anywhere near the Intelligence Committee, let alone as its chairman.
For heaven’s sake, Megan McCain made him look like a fool on The View. That alone should get him kicked off the Intelligence Committee.
At this point, I think it’s obvious that a con artist like Congressman Schiff doesn’t have the character to apologize to President Trump or to the American people; so it’s up to his colleagues to remove him as chairman of the Intelligence Committee.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays at 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Texto completo: Ironworker half caff
Five years ago, Shane Galloway was roasting coffee for himself, and for his friends. When he couldn't keep up with the demand, he figured it was time to make his hobby into a business. So, four years ago, 4AM Coffee Roasters was born in downtown Carrollton, and Galloway turned a dough-nut shop into a coffee shop plus farm-to-table breakfast-lunch-dinner cafe. He's roasting his coffee in an air roaster, rather than a drum roaster, so the beans "float" in a stream of hot air as they heat. Bits of chaff from the coffee bean husks that would make the coffee bitter blow away. For those times when you don't want a fully caffeinated day, try his Ironworker blend. It's a half caff combination of waterprocesseddecaffeinatedSumatran
coffee beans with natural processed Ethiopian beans. The natural process means the beans are dried with the fruit (called the coffee "cherry")on the beans, and the resulting coffee really does taste fruity and smooth. His Etsy shop offers eight fully caffeinated coffees as well. Buy a bag of coffee at the shop, and they'll brew you a cup for free.
$12 per 12-ounce bag. Available at the shop, 105 N. Park Street, Carrollton, or at etsy.com/shop/4AMCoffeeRoasters.
Big Bang blend
The New York Times described Alfred Peet as "the Dutch coffee merchant who pioneered a revolution that led to America's love affair with high-end coffee." Peet's first shop in Berkeley, California, which opened in 1966, was ground zero for understanding that it matters where coffee is grown. He was generous with his expertise, and Starbucks co-founder Jerry Baldwin credits Peet for teaching him how to cup, roast and blend. Peet's started in California, but now has 400 coffee bars across the country, and Peet's coffee is available in grocery stores across metro Atlanta.We tried their Big Bang blend, named after a quote from former Atlanta magazine dining critic Corby Kummer, saying Peet "was the big bang. It all started with him." This is a medium roast coffee that includes natural processed Ethiopian beans, which give it a sweetness we really liked. We also like their limited-release Anniversary blend, with beans from Colombia and Rwanda -- rich and delicious.
Big Bang is $15.95 per pound. Available at Publix, Whole Foods, Kroger and Target. Anniversary Blend is $19.95 per pound. Available at peets.com.
Chocolate-covered coffee beans
I don't know about you, but coffee and chocolate are my very favorite flavor combination. And, while mocha drinks are fine, chocolate-covered coffee beans are even better. No cup required, just grab a handful! Atlanta's classic coffee roaster, J. Martinez & Co., was founded in 1988 by Jamaica native John Martinez. He offered his customers the chance to purchase "estate" coffee, sourced from individual coffee estates. It was pretty revolutionary at the time. One of the coffees the company has offered since its inception is renowned Jamaica Blue Mountain, and those are the beans they use for this chocolate-covered treat. The dark chocolate version is their best seller, but there's also a milk chocolate version that will appeal to those who want a milder chocolate experience. Chocolate-covered coffee beans for your Easter basket this year?
$15 per 1-pound bag. Available at their roastery, 3934 Green Industrial Way, Atlanta, or at martinezfinecoffees.com.

Texto completo: Ask Rod Gaspar what moment he remembers most from the Mets' 1969 season, and the backup outfielder with the powerful arm points to a head-spinning game in San Francisco at the end of August. And why not? It was a game in which he and Donn Clendenon combined to throw out three Giants runners at third base and home plate in the eighth and ninth innings before the Mets won it in the 10th.
Or, as Gaspar put it: "Typical Mets."
Ask Ron Swoboda the same question and he graciously overlooks his famous catch in the World Series and instead cites a September game against the Chicago Cubs, with first place on the line.
In the bottom of the first inning, the Cubs knocked down the Mets' invaluable leadoff hitter, Tommie Agee. Swoboda takes it from there:
"In the top of the second, Jerry Koosman throws a rocket right at Ron Santo's coconut and he put an arm up. You want to play this game? I don't think so. He hit Santo in the arm. Koosman was a warrior, he was an assassin. They threw at Agee, that's all Koosman needed.
"After they knocked down Agee, I remember Tom Seaver yelling in the dugout, 'You don't want to do that.' Koosman took care of the rest."
Ask Koosman who or what stands out most 50 years later and he is quick to cite Gil Hodges, the manager behind the Mets' miracle.
"Gil was the man -- there was a lot of quiet management that went on," he said. "Gil talked a little bit in code, but you knew what he meant. You knew where he stood and what he expected of you. And it worked great. We won, didn't we? At 100-to-1 odds in Vegas before the season, and we end up winning."
Ed Kranepool, who played 18 seasons for the Mets, remembers what it was like to be a platoon player in the World Series. In the five games it took for the Mets to upend the favored Baltimore Orioles, Kranepool and three other left-handed hitters -- Art Shamsky, Ken Boswell and Wayne Garrett -- were in the starting lineup just once, for Game 3.
"Did the left-handers want to play in the World Series?" he said. "Yeah, but you had to respect Gil and what he was doing. We did get to face Jim Palmer in Game 3 and we knocked him out. The next day, we sat down again. So we sat there, but we were winning."
Jim McAndrew, who was in the back end of the 1969 starting rotation, was on the postseason roster and didn't get to play a single moment. But he almost did.
"I was scared to death because Seaver gave up that leadoff homer in the first inning of the World Series, and Hodges immediately had me up in the bullpen," he said. Still, he didn't get into that game or any other in the Series.
"But you can't gripe," he said.
McAndrew, Gaspar, Swoboda, Koosman and Kranepool spoke to The New York Times early this month in connection with the 50th anniversary of one of the most remarkable moments in baseball history -- the sudden ascent of the Mets to a championship after the team's previous life as a laughingstock.
The five spoke with pride of what they accomplished, but with some sadness, too. Fifty years is a long time, and a half-dozen players from that team have died. Others have serious medical issues.
It is a somber scorecard that also includes Hodges, who died of a heart attack before the 1972 season, and the death of three of his four coaches. And Seaver, 74, the best player on that 1969 team, has advancing dementia.
The disclosure of Seaver's condition was made shortly after the former Mets had spoken with The Times. But they were all aware that Seaver had been struggling with the effects of Lyme disease for years. More than anything, they were aware of how relentless time is.
"Casey was right when he said you get old very quick," said Kranepool, referring to Casey Stengel, who was the Mets' manager when Kranepool joined the team as a teenager. Now Kranepool is 74 and in need of a kidney transplant, although he remains intent on being part of the 1969 reunion the Mets will stage at Citi Field in June.
"It's frustrating," he said. "You would like to see everybody, but it doesn't work that way. I don't think I'm going to be around for the 100th, so I'm glad we're doing this."
Swoboda, who is also 74, said: "I don't know where the 50 years went, but we are a band of brothers. Very few of us were involved in anything else of that magnitude."
"It's no fun seeing our guys go down," said Gaspar, who is 72. "I hope we can have 15 of us at the reunion."
Koosman said he planned to be there. He is 76, the oldest of the five, but still doing back-and-forth bantering with Swoboda. Except now it's via email instead of in the clubhouse. And what do they jab each other about?
"Politics," said Koosman. Swoboda, he said, is too liberal. "Tell him to get a life," he said, joking. "Tell him to quit watching MSNBC and reading The New York Times. Tell him to read the sports section and stop there."
Told what Koosman had said about him, Swoboda laughed. 'I love the guy," he said, "but he sends me all this stuff from the blogosphere."
McAndrew, amused by all of this, was willing to volunteer that he views himself as "socially compassionate, fiscally responsible." Swoboda, he added, "is a non-backing-off lefty."
A lefty who, in 1969, played right field, and not always that well. Hodges would take him out of games for defensive purposes and insert Gaspar, "which drove me crazy," Swoboda said.
"I wanted to be good enough for Hodges not to have to do that," he added. "And eventually, I was. Eventually, he left me alone."
Right through the top of the ninth inning of Game 4 of the Series, when Swoboda's do-or-die catch of Brooks Robinson's line drive kept the Orioles from taking control of the game.
"Clendenon," Swoboda noted sardonically, "called it the stupidest catch he ever saw because I went for it."
Clendenon. Alert, tough, college-educated. A veteran voice in the clubhouse. And a central figure in that wild August game in San Francisco that Gaspar so vividly remembers. Here's how he tells it:
"It's the bottom of the ninth, tie score, one out, Bob Burda is on first, Willie McCovey is up and we have the McCovey shift on. Everyone is pulled over to the right. I'm playing left, but I'm almost in center. Tug McGraw is pitching and McCovey sticks out his bat and hits a high, nine-iron shot down the left-field line. I chase after the ball, pick it up and throw blindly toward home plate.
"I knew it was the game right there. I figured Burda was going to score easy. But you know what? I threw a rocket to Jerry Grote, all the way in the air, and Burda was out by 15 feet. And Grote was so stunned he rolled the ball back to the mound even though there only two outs. And McCovey, who had reached second, sees this and takes off for third. And Clendenon, who was always paying attention, picks the ball up and throws to third. Double play.
"The next inning, Clendenon hits a home run and we win the game."
McAndrew said: "Clendenon could strap you on his back and get those big hits to drive in runs for a week or 10 days. All the low-scoring games, we won them."
And all the crazy games -- the Mets won them, too. Some mystical combination of talent, toughness, luck and magic conquered everything in its path. For one season.
"The next year," Swoboda said, "we tried to make it happen, rather than let it happen. Something was missing. All it does it add more mystery to 1969 in my book."
A magical, mystical mystery, actually. One that, 50 years later, still endures.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Ex-Official Ties Duterte to Drug Trade

Texto completo: MANILA -- A former high-ranking official in the Philippine National Police says he reported more than a year ago that two Chinese associates of President Rodrigo Duterte were involved in drug trafficking, and that the president has taken no action against them despite his well-known crusade against illegal narcotics.
Mr. Duterte has denied the accusations. The former official, Eduardo Acierto, a senior superintendent who was dismissed from the force last year over corruption allegations, has produced no evidence to support them, other than photos of the president with two men who he says are the drug suspects.
Mr. Acierto, apparently the highest-ranking police officer to have accused the popular president of wrongdoing, said he had received death threats and gone into hiding. On Sunday, he met with a group of journalists, including one for The New York Times, in Manila, where he showed his photos of Mr. Duterte with the men, apparently taken on a number of different occasions.
"If this is going to be the reason for my death, that's fine," said Mr. Acierto, a 27-year veteran of the police force. "At least I have shared it with you already."
Mr. Acierto, who once led the force's anti-narcotics division, said he submitted a report to his superiors in December of 2017 warning that two Chinese nationals who knew Mr. Duterte were suspected of involvement with narcotics. One of the two men, named Michael Yang, later became a presidential adviser, although he lost that status last year, Mr. Duterte's office has confirmed.
But Mr. Duterte and officials in his government have denied that Mr. Yang is involved with drugs. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Duterte said Mr. Yang was a telecommunications businessman whose enterprises in the southern Philippines had created many jobs. He accused Mr. Acierto of corruption and various crimes.
"Why would I give importance to his report?" he said. "He should have done his job."
Mr. Acierto was dismissed from the force last year over a scandal involving illegitimate licenses for assault rifles. He was one of several officers accused of issuing such licenses, for weapons that reportedly ended up in the hands of Communist insurgents. He refused to discuss the matter on Sunday, saying it was being litigated.
Aaron Aquino, the head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, confirmed that he had received Mr. Acierto's report on the two Chinese men in 2017 and sent it on to Mr. Duterte's office. He said Mr. Yang and the other man named in the report did not appear to be on any of the lists of supposed drug suspects, many of them in positions of authority, that Mr. Duterte has made public in the past.
Mr. Acierto, however, said that Mr. Yang was involved with a methamphetamine manufacturing operation in the southern city of Davao as early as 2004. The other man named in the report worked with him, he said. At the time, Mr. Duterte was the mayor of Davao.
Mr. Acierto said he was not sure whether Mr. Duterte had known about Mr. Yang's alleged involvement in drugs before he submitted his report. But in light of the report, he said, if Mr. Duterte "really was angry at the proliferation of drugs, why did he not have these people investigated or arrested?"
Attempts to contact Mr. Yang have been unsuccessful.
Mr. Acierto said he believed that Mr. Duterte's war on drugs -- in which police officers and vigilantes have killed thousands of people, the vast majority of them poor -- should focus on major players in the drug trade, including syndicates with ties to China and Taiwan. He said he believed he had been threatened for implicating two such higher-ups.
"It is unusual for big personalities involved in illegal drugs to be caught or killed," he said.
Officials in Mr. Duterte's government said they would take another look at the Chinese nationals named in Mr. Acierto's report, even as they disputed his allegations.
Salvador Panelo, Mr. Duterte's spokesman, said it was easy for anyone to have a photo taken with the president, and he accused opposition figures of being behind what he called a "political stunt." He said Mr. Acierto's report had never been "validated" by the country's then-police chief, Ronald dela Rosa, a longtime aide to Mr. Duterte.
"The president would never tolerate anyone involved in drugs regardless of stature or relationship with him," Mr. Panelo said in an interview. "That policy is inflexible."
It is not clear where Mr. Acierto is staying, but some of the people with him on Sunday were connected to the Catholic Church, a powerful institution in the Philippines that has been critical of Mr. Duterte's drug war. Several bishops have also recently said that they had received death threats and speculated that they came from people linked to the government.
In his speech on Tuesday, in the southern city of Koronadal, Mr. Duterte tore into Mr. Acierto, calling him an "idiot" and accusing him of involvement in drug smuggling himself, along with various other crimes.
"Don't ever believe especially this Acierto," Mr. Duterte said. "What if I ask the military and the police, 'Why is this son of a bitch still alive?"'

McDonald's Cedes in Minimum-Wage Fight

Texto completo: In an abrupt shift, a top McDonald's official said Tuesday that the company would no longer lobby against minimum-wage increases at the federal, state or local levels.
The announcement, which was simultaneously cheered by supporters of higher pay and criticized as a publicity stunt by some in the restaurant industry, was included in a letter that a McDonald's vice president wrote to officials at the National Restaurant Association.
In the letter, a copy of which was obtained Wednesday by The New York Times, the McDonald's vice president, Genna Gent, said that the company would "not use our resources, including lobbyists or staff, to oppose minimum wage increases" at any level, and that it would not "participate in association advocacy efforts designed expressly to defeat wage increases."
"We do have a perspective on elements of this discussion," she wrote. "We believe increases should be phased in and that all industries should be treated the same way."
"The conversation about wages is an important one; it's one we wish to advance, not impede," she wrote.
McDonald's Corp. declined to comment on Wednesday.
Ms. Gent's remarks thrust McDonald's into the middle of the ongoing and sometimes contentious national debate about worker pay and what constitutes a living wage. Federal lawmakers, including several Democratic presidential hopefuls, have increasingly sought to help lower-income workers whose wages have remained stagnant as corporate profits have grown, housing prices have skyrocketed, and a homelessness crisis is gripping many urban areas.
A bill that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 over five years from the current federal hourly rate of $7.25 was introduced in Congress earlier this year. In the meantime, several states, including New Jersey, California, New York and Massachusetts, have adopted plans to gradually move toward that milestone. Expensive cities like New York and the District of Columbia have also raised the minimum wage to that level while some major corporations, including Target, Amazon and the Gap, have increased pay for their own employees.
Still, advocates for higher minimum pay said that as one of the world's largest employers with more than 800,000 workers in the United States, McDonald's has long been a public face of low wages. They pointed to the change in the company's stance as a signal that fighting wage increases has become untenable.
"Having a player like McDonald's say 'We're not going to fight this any more' is a big deal," said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, a lawyer for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for low-wage workers. "I think it shows that a $15 minimal wage has been normalized."
But the announcement was also greeted with some skepticism. An expert on restaurant lobbying who requested anonymity because of McDonald's power in the industry said the chain's repositioning appeared to be at least in part a political publicity stunt. More than 90 percent of McDonald's restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent franchisees, according to the company's website. It is those franchisees, not McDonald's Corp.'s bottom line, that the expert worried could be most affected.
Officials with the National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald's franchisees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. A spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it would not comment "on individual company decisions."
The National Restaurant Association has argued that only a small fraction of food service workers earn the federal minimum wage, and that most get a raise within six months.
"The National Restaurant Association is the largest food service trade association in the world, representing every aspect of the industry," the association said in a statement on Wednesday. "Our members are as diverse as the communities they serve, and the economies of every region are different." McDonald's, the association added, is "a valued member."
In her letter, which was first reported by Politico, Ms. Gent, the McDonald's vice president, said the average starting wage in the company's corporate-owned stores is already more than $10 per hour, above the federal minimum set a decade ago. Though the company does not control the wages franchisees pay their employees, she said the average starting wages for those workers were "likely similar."
"We recognize that overall wages reflect the realities of different communities and that elected leaders have the responsibility to set, debate and change mandated minimum wages," the letter said.
Terrance Wise, a McDonald's worker in Kansas City and a leader of the Fight for $15 campaign, said its fight would continue even after the announcement.
Workers have long called both for a $15 minimum wage and union rights, he said, "and we're not going to stop marching, speaking out and striking until we win both."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, House Democrats' self-styled message man, was blunt on Tuesday morning: No more impeachment talk.
"We didn't run on impeachment," he said. "We didn't win the House of Representatives on impeachment. We're not focused on impeachment."
Mr. Jeffries had a provocation, and it was not the findings of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. It was a letter, circulated Monday evening by Representative Rashida Tlaib, the freshman firebrand from Michigan, asking fellow Democrats to support a formal inquiry into "whether President Trump committed impeachable offenses."
Impeachment has bedeviled the 116th Congress since it convened in January, its prospects fed by a drip, drip of damaging disclosures about the president's actions, the swirling special counsel investigation into his campaign and explosive testimony of misdeeds. On Tuesday, responding to Ms. Tlaib and staring soberly at Mr. Mueller's apparent conclusions, Democrats set out to drive a stake through the idea once and for all.
"What's tough is impeachment in principle is something that I openly support, but it's also just the reality of having votes in the Senate to pursue that," said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the self-described democratic socialist from New York who has become a face of Mr. Trump's resurgent opposition. "That's something that we have to take into consideration."
Besieged by reporters, Representative Maxine Waters of California, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee and a vocal proponent of impeachment in the past, responded realistically.
"Impeachment has never been a caucus agenda," she said.
Representative Debbie Dingell, who represents a Detroit-area district neighboring Ms. Tlaib's, said she knew her colleague was not trying to "box anybody into a corner" but "feels strongly" that Mr. Trump is unworthy of his office. Ms. Dingell was, to put it mildly, not in agreement.
"We've got real work to do," she said, "and every week, we get off on some subject that doesn't matter to the working people in my district or the Midwest."
Even Mr. Trump, who has sought to paint Democrats as rabidly pursuing his presidency, seemed to have gotten the message.
"I don't think they're talking about impeachment," he said on Tuesday as he walked into a Senate Republican luncheon on the other side of the Capitol. "We have the greatest economy we've ever had. Our country is in incredible shape. They and others created a fraud on our country with this ridiculous witch hunt, where it was proven very strongly, no collusion, no obstruction, no nothing."
In fact, the special counsel pointedly said he did not exonerate Mr. Trump on the issue of obstruction of justice. It was Attorney General William P. Barr who stepped in to reject that charge.
Nonetheless, Democratic leaders were eager not to make too much of the opening. They have tried for months to play down the possibility of impeachment. Too divisive, they said. Too dangerous. "Not worth it," said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, who has urged her colleagues to beat Mr. Trump at the ballot box instead.
Mr. Mueller's report to Mr. Barr, summarized in a letter to Congress on Sunday, seems to have finally proved the point. Mr. Barr wrote that Mr. Mueller had not found evidence to prove that the Trump campaign had conspired with Russia to subvert the 2016 presidential election or to bring a case that the president obstructed justice.
Ms. Pelosi met privately with members of her leadership team Monday night to discuss the path forward after the conclusion of Mr. Mueller's investigation. On Tuesday, they emerged abuzz about a Trump administration's legal motion to have the Affordable Care Act invalidated by the federal courts and intent on wrestling the narrative back to the party's policy agenda.
Democrats have not given up on the Mueller report entirely, with six committee leaders leading the fight for access to the full report. And they say they will push ahead energetically with their own investigations into other aspects of the Trump presidency.
But it is clear that Ms. Pelosi and her team are trying to turn down the volume.
Ms. Tlaib's resolution outlines three areas of scrutiny for an impeachment inquiry: the president's possible violations of the Constitution's foreign emoluments clause, which bans gifts or payments from foreign governments; his role in a pre-Election Day scheme to silence a pornographic film actress and a Playboy model who claimed to have had affairs with him; and the lingering questions around whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice.
"We all swore to protect our nation, and that begins with making sure that no one, including the president of the United States, is acting above the law," wrote Ms. Tlaib, whose vulgar cry to impeach Mr. Trump crashed the Democrats' swearing-in parties in January. "I urge your support in recommending that the House Committee on Judiciary begin hearings, take depositions and issue subpoenas to answer this question that is fundamental to the rule of law and the preservation of our democracy."
Ms. Tlaib made clear in the closed-door meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday that she was not introducing articles of impeachment, just a resolution that would approve an inquiry into whether such a drastic step was necessary, according to another person in the room.
A spokesman for Ms. Tlaib declined to comment on Tuesday.
All three issues outlined in Ms. Tlaib's letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, are already a matter of investigation by the House Judiciary Committee, and in some cases by other panels. The difference is that those investigations are part of the committees' regular oversight work.
The full House would have to vote to open an impeachment inquiry. And Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, has repeatedly dismissed the idea -- presenting the inquiries that he has already opened as sufficient for the time being.

The Plunder of Mexico's Black Gold

Texto completo: MEXICO CITY -- In the first months of this year, the word "huachicolero" -- once a rarely used term -- has been on the lips of people all around the country. Car owners particularly have cursed it, but I've even heard schoolchildren shouting it. Etymologists debate the word's origins and whether its root comes from a Mayan term for thief or a French word for watered-down paint. But today, it's used almost solely to refer to people who steal gasoline, diesel and even some crude oil, usually directly from pipelines, so they can sell it. This has become an extremely lucrative illegal business in Mexico.
The term was brought to national attention by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has made a crackdown on these huachicoleros a cornerstone of his administration, which began in December. Soldiers have been securing pipelines, the police have raided the thieves' mansions, and the authorities have recaptured tanks of stolen gasoline.
It's been a messy operation. When Mr. López Obrador shut down some pipelines in January, to stop the huachicoleros stealing from them, it caused shortages of gasoline in swaths of the country. The fuel thieves have fought back against the police and soldiers, blocking roads with burning cars and ambushing convoys. In January, they hung a banner with a message threatening to kill innocent people if Mr. López Obrador didn't end the offensive.
But he continued the battle, and it is a battle worth fighting. Mexico's oil is publicly owned, so when the fuel is looted on a grand scale, it robs the state of money. The government oil monopoly, Pemex, said the huachicoleros took fuel worth 140 billion pesos, or roughly $7.4 billion dollars, over three years. The huachicoleros also contribute to the lawlessness that has seen Mexico's murder rate rise and rise, with a record 33,300 or so homicides last year. And it is a catastrophic public health risk. When a crowd filled cans from a tapped pipeline in the town of Tlahuelilpan in January, a fireball exploded, burning many alive, leaving others hospitalized and struggling for their lives. The death toll for that disaster reportedly is now well over a hundred.
The fight against fuel theft is fundamentally different from the fight against the illegal drug trade. Trying to force people to stop producing, selling and taking drugs has proved a losing battle in most of the world. In contrast, most countries manage to stop their oil pipelines from being savaged with a basic rule of law.
The rise of huachicoleros in the last decade illustrates how Mexico's rule of law has been shattered. And with that, democracy in much of the country has been under assault, with city mayors being controlled or attacked by criminals; journalists harassed and murdered; and community activists targeted. Fuel-theft gangs are suspected in various crimes against journalists, including the reporter Daniel Blancas being held at gunpoint in January.
I first heard the term huachicoleros back in 2011, when I went to the state of Puebla to write about them. I found it incredible when I saw a pipeline they had drilled two holes into, one to suck the gasoline out and one to pump water in to keep the pressure up. Former oil workers are often involved in these more sophisticated taps. I also saw a charred neighborhood back then, where a gasoline spill believed to be from a robbery caused a fire that tore through homes, killing as many as 30 people.
With some 700 similar taps detected across Mexico in 2010, I was amazed that the government was not clamping down. By 2018, the number had risen to over 14,000 in the course of the year.
It is especially telling that this criminal growth happened under President Enrique Peña Nieto. One of his major reforms was to open Mexico's oil sector to foreign private investment, a move that was praised by the financial press, and one that he said would be a motor for the nation's growth. But at the same time, Mr. Peña Nieto ruled over an incredible plundering of Mexico's black gold and had no solid plan or political will to try and stop it.
Born in the oil-rich state of Tabasco, Mr. López Obrador is more cautious about the role of the foreign private sector, leading to criticism from some investors. Ratings agencies have also hit Mexico since he took power, including cutting the credit rating of Pemex. But unlike his predecessors, Mr. López Obrador is making a solid and sustained effort to stop the fuel from being stolen on a vast scale.
Of course, the fight against huachicoleros should not all be by the police. Targeted investment is needed in poor communities where people turn to crime amid a lack of opportunities. Focused social work can help steer teenagers from being recruited into the sprawling gangs.
But law enforcement is certainly a central part of it. Mexico is overwhelmed by high levels of criminal activity of many different kinds, and the police need to prioritize which offenses to go after. Fuel theft is one of those worth prioritizing, a crime that the government should be able to actually succeed in reducing. If Mr. López Obrador follows through with his crackdown, 2019 could be the first year in over a decade in which the number of illegal taps goes down instead of up.

Texto completo: New York Times columnist David Brooks says 2020 presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke and former CIA Director John Brennan should apologize for their comments about President Trump during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

“It’s clear that many Democrats made grievous accusations against the president that are not supported by the evidence,” Brooks wrote Monday. “It’s clear that people like Beto O’Rourke and John Brennan owe Donald Trump a public apology.”

Brooks quotes O’Rourke, a former Democratic member of Congress as saying: “You have a president who, in my opinion, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sought to, however ham-handedly, collude with the Russian government, a foreign power, to undermine and influence our elections.”

The opinion columnist also quotes Brennan in calling Trump’s behavior “treasonous.”

“If you call someone a traitor and it turns out you lacked the evidence for that charge, then the only decent thing to do is apologize,” Brooks said.

Attorney General William Barr sent a letter summarizing Mueller’s report to Congress on Sunday. The letter concludes that Trump did not collude with Russia but makes no determination on whether Trump obstructed justice during the 22-month investigation. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the president obstructed justice.

[ Related: Brennan on his hyping of Mueller report: 'I don't know if I received bad information']

Brooks also called on Republicans and Trump supporters to approach Mueller’s findings with humility.

“For two years they’ve been calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt,” Brooks wrote. “ … They should apologize for peddling the sort of deep cynicism that undermines our country’s institutions.”

He said politics in the country has become poisoned by a climate of scandal. He said lawmakers and political figures should return to talking about issues rather than accusations.

“Politics is no longer a debate; it’s an attempt to destroy lives through accusation,” he wrote.

Post-Mueller report, NYT’s Manjoo explores a very troubling truth

Texto completo: You already know these three things: Russia interfered in the 2016 election to try to help Donald Trump win. And he did win (though he didn’t get the most votes). But, after an exhaustive investigation, Robert Mueller, according to Attorney General William Barr’s letter to Congress, wrote in his report, “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
In a blistering op-ed in this morning New York Times, columnist Farhad Manjoo rubs our collective noses in a much more troubling truth. If we were the country that we want to believe we are, an unqualified, lying, carnival barker like Trump should never have been the nominee of a major American party and should never have been within hailing distance of an Electoral College majority – with or without Russian help. From the Manjoo column:
Here’s my theory: Collusion was a seductive and convenient delusion. For many Americans, the simple truth that Mr. Trump really had won was too terrible to bear. The ease with which a racist, misogynist, serial con man had slipped past every gatekeeper in American life suggested something deeply sick at the core of our society.
In particular, Mr. Trump’s win pointed to tectonic failures within the mainstream news media, whose leading brands had fanned the showman’s rise with copious television coverage; indulged his every gimmick with yet more attention; and elevated his opponent’s trifling email-management kerfuffle into a scandal of world-historic import.
Mr. Trump’s win also pointed to the failure of our political parties. …
There were other minor factors in this American tragedy: Jim Comey’s grandstanding; the tech giants’ inability to appreciate or curb the chaotic powers of their new communications platforms; our collective innumeracy regarding polling; and a naïve failure to appreciate the profound fragility of our national enterprise.
Finally there was the plainer constitutional failure. You didn’t need a two-year federal investigation to determine the single most important lesson of the 2016 race: America does not treat all its voters, and all of its votes, equally. …
Read the full Manjoo column here. It’s headlined: “Collusion was a seductive illusion.”

“I really hope people see it in a positive light,” Sankara-Jabar said. “The show is sort of comedic, but talks about serious issues. I hope that people see some hope.”
The series follows Cenac, a comedian and writer, across the country as he explores social and cultural issues, according to HBO’s website. Cenac is also known for his work as a correspondent on “The Daily Show” with Jon Stewart.
Sankara-Jabar was flown to an HBO studio in Brooklyn, N.Y., last fall for her appearance on the show.

During the interview she and Cenac discussed the work Racial Justice NOW! has done in the Dayton community, including creating programs with Dayton Public Schools and working with Sen. Peggy Lehner to pass Ohio House Bill 318, which prohibits out-of-school suspensions or expulsions for pre-K to third-grade students who commit minor offenses, starting in the 2021-2022 school year.
“The show is about what’s wrong with education in America, but we talked about solutions,” Sankara-Jabar said. “I was consulted about my expertise in what people call the ‘school to prison pipeline,’ so I talked about the different solutions we put forth in Dayton.”

They also discussed racial disparity, restorative justice and practices, and forging strong relationships with parents, teachers and community members.
“We talked about creating strong relationships to make a healthy school community and a healthy school climate.”

The first episode of the second season of “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas” airs April 5. Sankara-Jabar said she makes an appearance in many episodes during the series but will be featured heavily in the second episode.
“I’m hoping it is a story of resilience for people,” Sankara-Jabar said. “I also hope it inspires somebody if they’re watching the show and maybe if they are experiencing that in their community they can see us as a model to feel empowered to do something similar in their own community.”

Michelle Singletary: The college admissions scandal isn't just about rich, entitled people — it's a mirror of the March madness that befalls a lot of parents

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Please, let's stop pretending that the college cheating scandal is just an indictment of overindulgent, wealthy helicopter parents.
The Justice Department has accused dozens of super-rich parents of making $25 million in illegal payments — and, in some cases, taking a tax break to boot — to get their children into selective colleges.
If true, these parents broke the law. They could face some prison time. But in the coming weeks, a lot of parents and their children, who've been legitimately accepted to pricey colleges, will make a move to put themselves in another type of prison.
Certain madness takes over this time of year — between late March and early April — when the college acceptance letters are sent out. Hearts are elated if children are accepted to prestigious public and private universities. Then comes the financial reality: Going to these dream colleges often means taking on substantial student loans.
Outstanding student-loan debt at the end of last year was $1.5 trillion. Education debt ranks second in consumer debt nationwide behind mortgages.
Parents will sentence themselves and their children to decades of debt because they believe attending a select school is a must for their children to succeed. They will trade financial stability for the status symbol of a brand-name college education.
The recent admissions scam has been used to underscore the pressure parents and students are under to get into "better" schools, as if the thousands of other colleges and universities in the country just aren't good enough. Heaven forbid you suggest a student attend a community college first, if money is woefully lacking. The pushback is typically substantial — and illogical.
Dripping with disdain, parents and students say that if the acceptance to an elite college doesn't happen, there is always the "safety school." What's financially sound and safe about struggling under the weight of enough debt to equal the price of a home?
And the financial imprisonment is even harder for low-income families, particularly minorities. Many students from these homes run out of money before they can graduate. They end up with debt and no degree.
Last fall, I met a mother at a financial-literacy program in Delaware who was very concerned about how to pay her parent PLUS loans. She had taken out more than $100,000 to help send her child to the top-rated University of Michigan to study to be a teacher.
I asked her why she didn't send her daughter to a school in her home state or somewhere close by so she could commute and reduce the cost of attendance.
"It's where she really wanted to go, and she worked hard to get into Michigan," the mom said with pride.
But studies have shown that the determination and hard work that the child demonstrated would have helped her succeed wherever she ended up going to college.
"A sort of mania has taken hold, and its grip seems to grow tighter and tighter," wrote New York Times op-ed columnist Frank Bruni in his 2015 book "Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be."
It's the "elite edge" that drives many parents and students to put themselves in financial jeopardy, Bruni pointed out.
What about the connections a child will make at a premier institution, you might ask?
Gallup asked 5,100 graduates about the career helpfulness of their undergraduate alumni networks.
Just 9 percent of graduates said the school network has been very helpful or helpful to them in the job market, according to Gallup, which released the findings earlier this year.
Just one in six alumni from schools ranked in the top 50 by U.S. News and World Report reported that their alumni network has been useful to them in the job market.
"While these alumni are slightly more likely than alumni from lower-ranked schools to perceive their alumni network as helpful, the differences are relatively minor and unlikely to offset the significant differences in tuition costs," Gallup stated.
What can markedly make a difference in job success for a student?
What helps tremendously is an internship during college in which a graduate can apply what he or she is learning, Gallup stated.
Long before the current admissions scandal, Bruni wrote, "The admissions game is too flawed and too rigged to be given so much credit. For another, the nature of a student's college experience — the work that he or she puts into it, the skills that he or she picks up, the self-examination that's undertaken, the resourcefulness that's honed — matters more than the name of the institution attended."
Stop the madness. Don't succumb to admissions mania that can condemn you and your kid to a life of crushing debt.

With the iPhone Sputtering, Apple Bets Its Future on TV and News; Tim Cook is gambling that selling services, an area filled with risks and competition, will be the company's next chapter

Texto completo: The iPhone is running out of juice. To go beyond the device that made Apple Inc. a global colossus, Tim Cook is betting on a suite of services—marking the company's biggest shift in more than a decade.
The chief executive's strategy, years in the making, takes Apple out of its comfort zone into areas where it has failed in the past, and that today are replete with risks and competition. Apple will take a giant leap toward its goal on Monday, when it plans to announce video- and news-subscription services that it hopes will generate billions of dollars in new annual revenue and deepen ties between iPhone users and the company.
In some ways, Apple helped create its own predicament when it launched the app industry a decade ago. The goal was to make the iPhone more powerful.
Over time, though, apps and services, from Spotify to Netflix to China's WeChat, have often become more important to users than the devices that run them. That allows consumers to hold on to phones longer or switch to less expensive versions. In January, Apple reported its first decline in revenue and profit for a holiday quarter in over a decade.
Revenue from the services business grew 33% last year, to nearly $40 billion—about 15% of the company's total of $265.6 billion.
The company's ambition in video is to become an alternative to cable, combining original series with shows from other networks to create a new entertainment service that can reach more than 100 markets world-wide. It is the tech giant's latest attempt to reinvent television, something it has tried to do for about a decade with limited success.
On Monday, the tech giant plans to unveil the first footage from some of its new original TV shows, according to people familiar with the event. Apple has used a $1 billion budget to buy dozens of original TV shows in hopes it can land a breakout hit. It has cut deals with Hollywood stars including actor Reese Witherspoon and director J.J. Abrams, who have been invited to attend Monday's event on Apple's campus, according to those people.
Apple declined to comment for this article.
Apple hasn't said what it will charge for the programming. People working on the projects said the company plans to charge a fee, after previously saying it would be free to Apple device owners.
The original series will be delivered in a new TV app that staff have been calling a Netflix killer. It will make it easier for people to subscribe with a single click to channels such as Starz, Showtime and HBO, with which Apple has been negotiating to offer their shows to users for $9.99 a month each, people familiar with the talks said.
Apple has been negotiating to bring its new TV app to multiple platforms, including Roku and smart TVs, according to people familiar with the talks—an unusual move for a company that has long preferred to limit its software and services to its own devices. Some of those distribution agreements are expected to be announced Monday.
At the same event, Apple plans to showcase a revamped News app that includes a premium tier with access to more than 200 magazines—including Bon Appétit, People and Glamour—as well as newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal. It plans to charge $9.99 for the service and believes the premium news content can lift engagement on its devices, people familiar with the plans said. The New York Times earlier reported on the Journal's participation.
As part of the arrangement, much of the Journal's content will be available through the service, although certain types of stories—particularly general news, politics and lifestyles news—will be showcased, while business and finance news won't be displayed as prominently, according to people familiar with the situation. The deal will result in the Journal hiring more reporters focused on general news to help feed Apple's product, one of the people said. The Journal sells its own subscriptions for $39 a month.
The news subscription offering follows Apple's 2018 acquisition of a Netflix-for-news app called Texture . The deal gave Apple rights to most major North American magazines for at least five years and up to two decades in an agreement that splits revenue 50-50 between the tech giant and publishers such as Hearst Magazines and Condé Nast, according to people familiar with the deal.
The terms rankled some newspapers Apple courted, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, which sell monthly subscriptions for $15 and $10, respectively. The Washington Post and New York Times aren't participating in the new app, according to people familiar with the situation.
Pushing services
When Apple last found itself on the ropes in the early 2000s, co-founder Steve Jobs reinvented the company by pushing it into mobile devices. The iPod and its accompanying iTunes service revived a company that was largely dependent on Mac computer sales. The subsequent iPhone helped Apple become the first company to surpass $1 trillion in market value last year.
Mr. Cook is attempting a similar feat in the approaching twilight of the smartphone era. He began pushing the services strategy hard in late 2017, after Apple launched its 10th-anniversary smartphone, the iPhone X. While a big price increase to nearly $1,000 was helping boost revenue, the iPhone X wasn't selling more phones , and higher prices made sophisticated, lower-cost rival devices more appealing.
Mr. Cook, who had vowed earlier that year to double Apple's services revenue by 2020, began meeting regularly with the services division.
At the monthly sessions, the 58-year-old CEO has peppered the team with detailed questions. He wanted services team members to tell him which apps were selling well, how many Apple Music subscribers stuck with the service, and how many people were signing up for iCloud storage, a costly service that required spending billions of dollars to build data centers around the U.S., according to people familiar with the meetings.
"You couldn't say, 'I don't have that information. I'll get that tonight,' " said one person involved. "You had to have a dictionary of backup."
Apple's biggest source of services revenue comes from distributing other companies' software through its App Store. The company is now battling Spotify and Netflix, two of the most popular apps, over its practice of taking 30% of sales or subscription revenue from apps.
Netflix recently stopped letting users sign up for its service on Apple devices, and said it won't participate in Apple's video subscription service. Spotify AB this month filed an antitrust complaint in Europe claiming Apple abuses its control over the App Store, something Apple denies.
Apple's music-streaming service, its biggest attempt so far to build its own subscription business, has about 50 million global subscribers—far behind Spotify's 96 million.
Apple's base of 1.4 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs in use globally gives it a distribution platform. Yet the businesses of selling gadgets and services can conflict. To reach the biggest possible market for video service, Apple would have to offer it on non-Apple devices—something it has been loath to do in years past.
Previous successes with services such as iTunes, which redefined the music industry, have been offset by troubles with Maps and Siri.
"They built an organization to make beautiful gadgets and compete with Samsung and other gray-box manufacturers," said Mike Levin, co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology analysis firm. "Now, they have to really think about the services and software that have been so uneven and compete with a lot of very different competitors."
Mr. Cook has said Apple retains its edge. "Apple innovates like no other company on Earth, and we are not taking our foot off the gas," he told investors in January, when Apple reported earnings.
Apple's stock, while up since early January, remains nearly 20% below its peak in October. It is currently valued at $900.85 billion.
Co-founder Mr. Jobs foreshadowed Apple's services future when he started iTunes in 2001, offering categories from competing major labels to make the first successful digital-music store, with songs available for 99 cents.
App resistance
When Apple created the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs opposed letting other companies sell apps for it, fearing they could undercut performance or introduce viruses.
Apple's software team, recognizing that more apps could make the phone more dynamic, pushed back and prevailed. The resulting App Store has generated more than $120 billion in total sales for developers since it opened in 2008.
It also brought competition from rivals such as Spotify, which began selling subscriptions in the U.S. in 2011.
The competition led to Apple's biggest deal, its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics LLC in 2014, so Apple could launch a competing music-streaming service.
By then, concerns had already been rising inside Apple about the iPhone's future. The number of devices Apple sold was growing more than 20% annually as Mr. Cook pushed it into new retailers and markets, but sales executives told colleagues in 2014 they were running out of avenues for easy growth, former employees said. "They were freaked out," one person said.
During a presentation before the launch, the music-streaming team told Mr. Cook they expected to generate more than 10 million subscribers in the first year.
"Double that," said Mr. Cook, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The executives ended up easily clearing the goal, which encouraged them about Mr. Cook's vision for the opportunity in services, the person said.
Mr. Cook and Eddy Cue, his lieutenant in charge of services, started looking for other subscription opportunities. Video was an immediate priority. Apple's share of movie sales and rentals was more than 50% in 2012. By 2017 it had fallen to between 20% and 35% .
Apple wanted a service that could beat Netflix, a person familiar with the company's plan said. After a 2015 effort to persuade Walt Disney Co. and others to join a streaming-TV service faltered, Apple's executives debated alternatives, including acquiring Walt Disney Co. or Netflix, and building its own studio, people familiar with the discussions said.
In 2017, it hired two prominent executives from Sony Pictures Television and empowered them to cut deals for more than two dozen original programs. They scooped up a reboot of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television's "Amazing Stories," scored a series about a morning talk show starring Ms. Witherspoon, and struck a partnership with Oprah Winfrey.
Apple faces steep competition from big spenders while it plays catch-up to experienced rivals. Netflix has 139 million subscribers and is expected to spend $15 billion on content this year. It also offers a far deeper content library than Apple plans to make available. Disney, which has decades of experience making hit shows and movies, plans to launch its own streaming service later this year.
Morgan Stanley estimates that a combined media package from Apple that includes video and music could generate more than $22 billion in sales by 2025.
Previously, Apple used software and services to sell more of its own devices. In January, Apple announced it would put a TV app on sets made by rival Samsung Electronics Co., making it available to people who don't necessarily own any Apple hardware.
Apple executives made clear during talks with TV makers that it needed as broad a reach as possible to compete with Netflix and others. Last year, Apple announced a similar agreement with rival Amazon.com Inc. to bring Apple Music to Echo smart speakers.
"We made a mistake with Apple Music, thinking we could go it alone, and it took a long time to catch up. We still aren't there yet," the head of marketing Apple services, Jon Giselman, said during a meeting with one of the company's partners, according to a person in attendance.
The push into news subscriptions could help Apple battle Facebook Inc., whose News Feed has helped it become the No. 1 app world-wide in monthly active smartphone users. It is also the anchor of a business that Facebook is looking to expand by emphasizing private messaging , a step many interpret as the first in an effort to become a super-app like China's WeChat, which allows users to shop, order food, buy movie tickets and make reservations on any mobile operating system.
For Mr. Cook's monthly services meetings, the company has intensified monitoring of apps that benefit and threaten Apple. The team has created a release radar for the CEO to track apps that are expected to sell well and other metrics for the apps that have challenged Apple's business, including iTunes sales decreases compared with Apple Music subscription growth, said the person involved with the meetings.
Other successful subscription apps have given away much more content at lower prices than Apple is expected to offer initially. Amazon Prime members, who pay $119 annually, get free video content and discounted music subscriptions. Some inside Apple's services group wanted similar benefits for iPhone buyers. Mr. Cook and his leadership team have made it clear that its forthcoming services will carry a price tag.
"There's this conflict between wanting to become a services business and acting like one," said the person. "They haven't solved that."

Texto completo: The Trump White House claims that granting security clearances is the president’s unique prerogative and not subject to legislative review. This assertion comes amid reports that President Donald Trump ordered clearances for his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner despite recommendations by the White House counsel, chief of staff and other officials against granting them.
Even before the news from Democrats last week that Kushner used WhatsApp for official White House business, and that both he and Ivanka conducted official business on personal email accounts, there was ample precedent for a congressional investigation. That’s particularly true given credible allegations that the president acted in a fashion that put national security at risk.
While the White House claims that the president has unique responsibility for protecting the national security, in fact that is a shared duty between the executive and legislative branches. And in this case, the legislative branch is acting in the interest of protecting the national security while the executive branch stonewalls.

I vetted judges and senior officials and never ran across anyone like Jared Kushner
Don't play games with security clearances
Trump's fact-free foreign policy decisions give US adversaries the upper hand
The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN reports on Trump's involvement in the Jared and Ivanka clearances, each attributed to several unidentified people familiar with or briefed on the matter, appeared between Feb. 28 and March 5. But Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, has been asking the White House since January for information about the security clearance process, including potential breaches of national security information. The White House has refused to provide the requested information, citing the need to respect “the separation of powers and the constitutional prerogatives of the President. ”
The White House responded in letters to Cummings that as commander in chief, the president has a “fundamental interest” in protecting national security information and the Congress’s investigative authority cannot intrude in this area. Also, the White House seeks to protect the president’s need for confidentiality when consulting with close advisers. The president therefore claims plenary authority over “selecting, and communicating with, his immediate advisers. ”
It is contrary to the spirit of a system based on checks and balances and the rule of law to try to resolve intra-branch disputes by referencing the “constitutional prerogatives of the President” or other self-serving claims. Both Congress and the president have constitutional interests and authority regarding the security clearance process. The Supreme Court has long held that Congress’s investigative authority is an essential power in its ability to legislate as well as conduct oversight.
Congress, presidents are equals on security
The White House insistence that somehow national security is a unique and quintessential presidential responsibility is misguided at best and counterfactual at worse. Presidents since George Washington have tried to withhold information from Congress under the guise of national security concerns, but have often relented after legislative pressures. There are countless examples of Congress taking a co-equal, if not lead, role in the protection and ongoing maintenance of national security records.
Equally concerning is the argument that White House staff should be walled off from congressional inquiries based on separation of powers concerns. The presumption of withholding documents and-or testimony weakens in situations where there are allegations of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court made this fundamental point in U. S. v. Nixon when it held that executive privilege is a legitimate presidential power but it is not absolute and cannot be used to conceal wrongdoing. President Ronald Reagan even waived executive privilege in a national security case dealing with the Iran-Contra investigations and, instead, cooperated with Congress and turned over parts of his personal diary.
The White House claims that it is willing to accommodate “legitimate requests for information" but, like many presidential administrations, wants to be the arbiter of what constitutes legitimate requests. Neither branch is on higher ground than the other in these disputes. In fact, in most of these cases, the branches resolve information conflicts through an ongoing dialogue and eventual compromise.
Let Congress do its job on national security
Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, want to standardize clearance procedures to avoid future uncertainty and partisanship. They have introduced a bill that sets criteria for considering security clearance requests; requires a written rationale to be given to candidates who are denied a security clearance; and establishes an appeal process before an independent panel.
For now, with so much doubt surrounding the current management of security clearances, the only reasonable resolution is for the White House to hand over the necessary documents so the House Oversight Committee can carry out its responsibility and determine if national security information has been disclosed — whether it be as a result of mismanagement or abuse of the security clearance process.
Indeed, the very information the White House seeks to protect relates not to any specific national security documents but to the process for granting security clearances. Seen in this context, the presumption should be in favor of disclosing the information which will — hopefully — answer the concerns of Congress and the public. And if the process of legislative review reveals additional issues, the public has a right to know about those as well.

Author Nicole Chung was born in Seattle, but her first memory of the city dates from when she was 10 years old and her parents took her for a visit from their home in southern Oregon.
"I remember just realizing that it was the first time I felt I could just blend in anywhere," says Chung, a Korean-American who was adopted and raised by white parents. "We went to the Chinatown-International District, and I remember walking down the street being pretty much surrounded by Asians. And that was amazing to me - the thought that a place like this could exist in my country."
Chung tells the story of her search for roots in her memoir "All You Can Ever Know," published last fall and listed among the year's best books by the Washington Post, National Public Radio, Buzzfeed and others. The moving story has touched a special chord among transracial and Asian-American adoptees like herself, which Chung finds gratifying. "It's not as if everyone can relate exactly or entirely, because of course our stories are very different," she says in a recent interview. "But the reality is there aren't a lot of books out there on this topic from this perspective."
Chung, who is also an essayist and literary editor, will bring her story to Spokane on May 14 when she appears at The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages Book Club.
Chung was always curious about her origin story and not at all satisfied with her mother's explanation of why her Korean immigrant birth parents decided to give her up shortly after Chung's premature birth: "They thought they wouldn't be able to give you the life you deserved." It was a vague explanation, short on details, which gradually acquired the status of family myth in a devoutly Catholic family where the baby's arrival was treated as a gift from God for a couple unable to have children of their own.
As for their racial differences, Chung's family was more likely to joke about it or dismiss it entirely, saying they would have loved her whether "you were black, white or purple with polka dots." That colorblind approach to adoption may have been admirable, and it followed the accepted advice from social workers and other experts of the time. But it's not surprising that Chung hid the casual racism she encountered in the schoolyards of her small town in Oregon, and the loneliness she felt because she was so different from nearly everyone she met, including family members.
Chung often thought about searching for her biological parents and finally decided to pursue it in her mid-20s, when she was pregnant with the first of two daughters. As she tells the story, the final push came from a clipboard-toting midwife, asking questions that would have been routine for most expectant mothers: How many brothers and sisters do you have? How old was your mother when you were born?
"I was thinking a lot, as parents do, about legacy," Chung says. "Things that you can pass on to your children. The questions they'll have and how you will answer them. And that was really for me the final impetus."
So Chung began her search, and with some digging and the benefit of Washington state's relatively open adoption laws was able to learn the unlikely story of her birth family and find sisters who never knew she existed. The memoir became a love story as Chung developed a correspondence, and eventually a close relationship, with her sister Cindy.
"It was completely unexpected, and it's been totally wonderful," Chung says. "We're family, with no qualifiers - we're just family." She described the relationship as "something really wonderful and uncomplicated in the midst of a very complicated situation."
Chung said adoption practices have changed a lot since the 1980s, and adoptive parents today are far more likely to acknowledge, honor and even celebrate the racial heritage of adopted children. But that doesn't mean it's easy.
"Where I still think it's probably challenging for a lot of families, where it was certainly challenging for my family, is having these harder conversations about race and racism and white privilege. There were certainly things I experienced growing up as a person of color in this country, and in a very white part of it, that my parents, who are white, had never experienced."
Chung said her adoptive mother has been very supportive, even though at first she didn't understand the idea of a memoir written by someone in her 30s and not even a celebrity. But there was her mom, sitting in the front row at a Barnes & Noble reading in Oregon, taking home the event poster.
Chung's adoptive father died last year before the book was published. "He did get to read the first half before he died and he really loved it," Chung says. "He was particularly happy one of his jokes stayed in."
Even though she had discussed her book with her parents in some difficult conversations, Chung says she was still "a little anxious" about sharing the manuscript with them a year before publication. "But honestly they were really great about it, and really proud."

Airline chief questions training requirements

Texto completo: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia >> The warning and training requirements set for the now-grounded 737 Max 8 aircraft may not have been adequate, in light of the Ethiopian plane crash that killed 157 people, the chief of Ethiopian Airlines said Saturday.
After the Lion Air crash off Indonesia in October, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing "came up with contents that we incorporated in our working manuals and also briefed all our pilots. But today we believe that might not have been enough," Tewolde Gebremariam told The Associated Press in an interview in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
Ethiopian Airlines insists the carrier's pilots went through all the extra training required by Boeing and the FAA to fly the 737 Max 8 jet. The March 10 crash killed people from 35 countries.
FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford declined to comment, citing an open investigation. Boeing did not respond to messages.
Gebremariam said earlier in the week that the training was meant to help crews shift from an older model of the 737 to the Max 8, which entered airline service in 2017. In a statement, he said pilots were also made aware of an emergency directive issued by the FAA after the Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people.
Ethiopian Airlines has said there is a "clear similarity" between the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, citing preliminary information from the flight data recorder.
Although the causes of the crashes haven't been determined, investigators in the Lion Air disaster have focused on an automated system designed to use information from two sensors to help prevent a dangerous aerodynamic stall.
It is not known whether the same flight-control system played a role in the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines jet shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, but regulators say both planes had similar erratic flight paths, an important part of their decision to ground the roughly 370 Max planes around the world.
Both planes flew with erratic altitude changes that could indicate the pilots struggled to control the aircraft. Shortly after their takeoffs, both crews tried to return to the airports but crashed.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the pilots of the doomed Ethiopian plane never trained in a simulator for the Max. Gebremariam, the Ethiopian Airlines CEO, said Saturday that "it wouldn't have made any difference" as the 737 Max simulator isn't designed to imitate problems in the new jet's flight-control software.
He still didn't say whether the pilots had trained on the simulator. Boeing's planned software update for the Max must "address the problem 100 percent before we return the aircraft to air," he said.
n
oting that the airline hasn't made a decision on whether or not to cancel orders for Max jets.
Ethiopian Airlines is widely seen as Africa's best-managed airline.
The carrier had been using five of the Max planes and was awaiting delivery of 25 more.

'Malta Exchange' would test a saint's patience

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange" (Minotaur Books, 393 pp., ), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned seller of rare books.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, "Who am I to judge?"
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo's estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother's ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You'll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn't.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.
Steve Berry is passionate about history.

Texto completo: Amber Tamblyn, co-star of "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" films and star of "Joan of Arcadia," has moved away from acting in recent years and toward activism. She was deeply involved in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2018 and was one of the founders of Time's Up, a nonprofit organization that was formed in 2018 to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.
Tamblyn has also become more interested in writing, contributing to The New York Times, as well as writing books of poetry and the novel "Any Man." Tamblyn's latest work, "Era of Ignition," is equal parts memoir and call to arms. It's a look at the corrosive impact of sexism and misogyny in politics and the entertainment industry, but it's also a hopeful story about the power of social movements to effect change. Tamblyn spoke with Variety about her new book.
The following is an edited transcript.
Q: Can you explain the book's title, "Era of Ignition"?
A: The title encapsulates the place that we are collectively as a nation. It feels like a time of immense change. Things are breaking apart in very big and fundamental ways, which can be terrifying. But it can also be a good thing. It's an opportunity for us to make real, lasting progress.
Q: This period of social unrest and activism, is it in response to Donald Trump's election?
A: Trump was a huge part of why unprecedented numbers of women marched on Washington. It's why an unprecedented number of women ran for office in 2018 and won, and it's also why an unprecedented number of women are running for president in the Democratic primary. It's a fire that we're feeling right now. Part of that is a response to Trump, but I think Hillary Clinton's loss was sort of this cherry on top of a much more deeply rooted feeling of invisibility that women have felt for so long. No matter how anybody feels about her personally or her politics, the truth is that very deeply ingrained misogyny played into the 2016 election. Every woman, at some point, no matter what she's done in her career or what profession she works in, has been like Hillary Clinton. They've been the most capable person in the room or the most qualified person in the room and they still didn't get the job.
Q: Were you disappointed that Hillary Clinton just announced she's not running for president in 2020?
A: I think that's the right thing to do and she knows that. I wouldn't want her to go through that again. I wouldn't want her to go through all the lies and the cruelty. It would be one thing if people were willing to accept her for who she is, but I think she made the smart move. I will forever feel robbed that I didn't get to experience Hillary's presidency.
Q: Where do the Time's Up and #MeToo movements go from here?
A: Well, first I'll clarify the difference between #MeToo and Time's Up. Time's Up is not a movement, it's an organization. #MeToo is a movement. The reason so many of us got together and created Time's Up is because we didn't want a woman or a man to ever have to say "me too" again. We focus on legal and legislative policy that can change the laws that have created these problems in the first place. We want to make sure there are safe and dignified workplaces for all people. The organization has been going into all these different industries where change is really needed in a large-scale way. We just launched Time's Up Healthcare, which is trying to change representation and pay for women and the LGBTQ community in the medical field. We need more women in research. We need more women on hospital boards of directors. We need more female physicians. You can look across almost any industry and see this kind of imbalance. Any person can raise their hand and say, "There's a big problem here. We need help." Time's Up will be there to support them.
Q: In the book you compare Susan Collins and her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh (to the U.S. Supreme Court) to Soon-Yi Previn's relationship with Woody Allen. What did you mean by that?
A: I wrote that Susan Collins was a version of how men groom women to become partners that they can control. I stand by that and would happily debate anyone over that. In everything that's going on right now, we're just looking at romantic relationships and personal relationships. We're also talking about political affiliations and professional relationships. I brought up (Soon-Yi Previn's) relationship in the book to talk about some of my own abuse that I suffered in my early 20s. It's difficult to know that you're in a groomed relationship if you are a woman who is with a much older man who has groomed you to become a partner that he can ultimately control. I'm not condemning that relationship or comparing it to my own experience, but I am raising questions. How do we know that our day-to-day actions are not totally affected by the men in our lives? We need to be conscious of where men's influence ends and where we begin.

Texto completo: Let's talk some more about that college cheating scandal, shall we?
There's been a bit of shoulder shrugging since the news broke this month that 50 people were indicted in an alleged scheme to secure spots in elite colleges and universities for students who didn't earn them.
This is news? This has been happening forever. Nothing new here.
I've heard a lot of that. You probably have too.
What's new is that a bunch of people allegedly have been caught -- including people whose names and faces we recognize. Which means now we have an opportunity -- an obligation, in fact -- to start fixing this mess.
Now we can start demanding accountability from colleges -- particularly public ones -- about their admission processes and procedures and how they're being protected from bribery and scams.
"Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases," as our old pal Justice Louis D. Brandeis said. "Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants."
And we can examine the way we approach and talk about college with the kids in our own lives. Let some sunshine in there too.
I wrote a column about what I want high school seniors to know in the wake of this scandal. Namely: College is the beginning of something, not the end.
College is where you fill your mind with new ideas and binge on new philosophies and try on new personalities and fall in love with new friends, new books, new buildings, new partners. College doesn't define you. College shapes you.
More than half a million people have read the column online so far, and many hundreds have emailed me -- high school students, parents, teachers, admissions officers, a guy from Perth, Australia. (Hi, Perth!)
Some wrote variations on "This is news?" But most offered thoughtful, layered perspectives, shaped by parenting a high schooler or being a high schooler or attending a tiny, barely known college and absolutely loving it or not attending college at all.
"I hate the emphasis on 'college,'" Peg wrote to me. "Why can't we say post-high school education? Two of my three children attended traditional college, one even earning a master's degree. Both are very successful and happy. My third child attended a trade school and is also very successful and happy."
A reader named Colleen shared a similar thought. "My son didn't go to college, he went into the trades," she wrote. "He was not one to sit in a classroom. My daughter has not started college yet because she was in no way prepared for it. They are both in their mid-20s. My husband and I have stepped back and allowed them to explore life, to learn some significant life lessons that will help them become independent, empowered adults. They always have our support and encouragement, but only they can determine how they want to live their lives."
And a reader named Meg added this:
"At some point when our oldest child was looking at colleges, someone shared the following with me: 'Think of five people you admire (who are not related to you) and tell me where they went to college.' I can't, nor could anyone else I know."
Author and educator Rosalind Wiseman, best known for her 2002 New York Times best-seller, "Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence," added her voice to the conversation with a brilliant essay on Grown & Flown, a parenting blog.
"Our children's happiness will never be dependent on what college they attend," Wiseman writes. "Their happiness is, and will always be, based on contributing to something larger than themselves, curiosity, meaningful social connection, a hope of success, and having a place to process and find peace as they navigate the inevitable conflicts and challenges they face."
To that end, she urges grown-ups to stop asking the high schoolers in their lives where they're going to college.
This feels especially urgent at this moment -- when a whole bunch of seniors are waiting for acceptance letters, and when we're engaged in a national dialogue about the entire admissions process.
Reflexively asking high schoolers where they're headed in the fall adds to their anxiety.
Wiseman asked some of the young people she works with what they'd rather hear from adults. Here's what they said.
Are you taking any classes in school that you like and are really interested in?
What do you think are important issues high school students care about?
What do you think is the best use of your time after you graduate from high school?
I'm sure you can think of your own questions as well.
The point is, we can use this moment to examine all of the big and small ways we've veered off-course when it comes to helping our kids grow into productive, fair-minded, successful adults.
Whether and where they go to college isn't shorthand for who they are. Let's own -- and adjust -- our part in making them feel as though it is.

Texto completo: As befits a movie that celebrates the circus, creating a live-action version of the animated classic "Dumbo" proved a high-wire balancing act.
Take the title character of director Tim Burton's update, which reaches theaters March 29. Unlike the other, realistically rendered CGI animals in the new "Dumbo," the eponymous elephant with outsized ears he flaps to fly is mostly natural-looking except for the eyes - big blue pools of emotion that maybe aren't quite the stuff of the Keane paintings in Burton's 2014 "Big Eyes" but aren't "National Geographic" either.
"Dumbo had to feel like he existed in the world, and then rather than being slavish to exactly what an actual baby elephant looked like, we wanted to create the most appealing version of the character," says Justin Springer, 38, one of the producers, speaking by phone from Los Angeles. "So there was a lot of discovering what was necessary to find that line. And I think it results in something interesting, where you don't feel like you're beholden to reality but at the same time you've created a character that does feel like he's in this space."
That space includes new human characters facing as much emotional darkness as the anthropomorphic animals of the 1941 original. Replacing the animated feature's Timothy Q. Mouse as Dumbo's protector and champion are young siblings Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe Farrier (Finley Hobbins) - whose father, former trick horseman Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell), has just returned to the circus from World War I minus an arm and with the children's mother having died from influenza.
That sounds like "Old Yeller" territory, but Farrell ("In Bruges," "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them") says he understood the balance needed between emotional reality and potential trauma. "If I was approaching that character in a $5 million film that was a kitchen-sink drama, it would have been a lot different from my approach to this," the Dublin native, 42, reflects in his natural Irish brogue. "Not that you don't treat this just as serious, but [such a drama] asks for a particular depth, I suppose, or a particular expression of uncertainties and pains and fears that maybe the tone of this film didn't want to venture to."
Indeed, the new film - also starring Danny DeVito as ringmaster Max Medici, Michael Keaton as conniving impresario V.A. Vandevere, Alan Arkin as banker J. Griffin Remington and Eva Green as aerialist Colette Marchant - reflects Burton's penchant for meshing the ghastly and the giddy. That's well evident here as in any of his works from "Beetlejuice" to "Big Fish."
"It's Tim Burton's movie," acknowledges Green (Bond girl Vesper Lynd in "Casino Royale," Vanessa Ives in the Victorian-era horror series "Penny Dreadful"). "I can't say no to Tim. I could play anything for him." A star of the director's "Dark Shadows" (2012) and "Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children" (2016), "I didn't even read the script when he approached me for it," the 38-year-old says. "You know with Tim that it's always going to be visually very interesting. The characters that I've played before with him have always been quite diverse and bigger than life."
The script, says Farrell, "was very sweet, in no way groundbreaking, but really lovely. It had some time-honored conventions, and I think that's OK, too. We're not reinventing the wheel. But with Tim's guidance and with his imagination and his visual accouterments, it's an astonishing world that's created for this story to take place in."
That world wisely does not revive the most problematic part of the original, the racist-stereotype birds led by Jim Crow - the name of a stock character from minstrel shows that has since become a shorthand for segregationist policies. Yet though the filmmakers did not include them, they also don't want to talk about them: Producer-screenwriter Ehren Kruger, 46, maintains the choice was from nothing more than "scaling way back on the animals who had speaking parts." Springer calls it simply a matter of retaining "the things that you remember most about" the original "that you feel like you really want to hold on to." In the animated film, Jim Crow and buddies Fats, Deacon, Dopey and Specks introduce the popular song "When I See an Elephant Fly" and teach Dumbo how to take flight.
"I think the themes of that movie hold up beautifully, and it's a beautifully animated film," Kruger, when pressed. says gingerly of the original, adding that "with any movie from a different era, it's an opportunity to reflect and have a conversation about how the world is different."
Whether the original "Dumbo" can even be shown to kids today or is now fit only for animation scholarship and for viewing by adults with perspective is an open question. But the live-action remake is certainly fit for ladies, gentlemen and children of all ages, as the big-top saying goes. "I think one of the great sadnesses of being a human," reflects Farrell, "is that there are many people out there who are judging their worth against a broken system." In some ways, we're all poor put-upon pachyderms that have to rise to heights of respect.
Despite a problematic sequence featuring racist African-American stereotypes of the time, Disney's "Dumbo" remains an animation classic, inducted into the Library of Congress' National Film Registry in 2017 for virtues including "its lovely drawing, original score (which would go on to win the Oscar that year) and enduring message of always believing in yourself." Ironically, the 1941 film had been conceived of as something quick and cheap simply to help recoup losses from the expensive and experimental phantasmagoria "Fantasia" (1940), which had opened to disappointing box office. Made for an estimated $850,000 to $1 million - far less than each of Disney's three previous animated films - it is only 64 minutes long, making it one of the studio's shortest features. Production was hampered by a five-week animators' strike in summer 1941, which ended when federal mediators, financiers and even brother Roy Disney persuaded studio chief Walt Disney to recognize the Screen Cartoonists Guild. Hollywood lore has it than in retaliation, some of the strikers were then caricatured among the "Dumbo" clowns that demand a raise, though Disney sources have denied this. "Dumbo" proved profitable, earning an estimated $1.6 million and going on to periodic reissues. Reviews were positive, with The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther calling it "the most genial, the most endearing, the most completely precious cartoon feature" yet from Disney, "a picture which touches the very heart of sentiment," and he recognized the now-famed, surrealistic pink-elephants sequence as "truly brilliant." Of course, he also mentions "Jim Crow, the loud and fancy sport who cackles, 'Well, hush mah beak!' and his raffish crew of dusky satellites," so keep in mind the classic doesn't necessarily mean perfect. - FRANK LOVECE

Texto completo: CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand -- The ad hoc memorial at the police cordon spread out across a wide area. Within a few hours of the terrorist attack that stole the lives of 50 people at two mosques here, there was a mountain of flowers and handwritten messages filled with anguish.
"This is your home and you should have been safe here."
"Our love and prayers and sympathy are with you."
"Christchurch, Christchurch, what will we do?"
The memorial was the first thing I saw when I arrived outside the first mosque the gunman targeted. Like many others, I snapped a few photos of the memorial and posted one to Instagram. But then immediately, I had a moment of déjà vu. I'd taken a very similar set of pictures in 2016 when I was covering the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla.
The Pulse attack had seemed like such an American nightmare -- a mass shooting driven by hate -- and now that nightmare had found its way to the other side of the world, to a laid-back country where violence is so rare that there isn't even any airport security when you fly to regional hubs.
From the vantage point of this city of 375,000, the signature American exports of our age were not freedom and Hollywood fantasy but rather a cocktail of gun culture, white supremacy and Facebook, where the killer live-streamed the attack with a camera that gave it the look of an American video game.
And while the causes have spread along with Instagrammable memorials, the question emerging here a week later is whether potential solutions can be globalized too.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is doing what she can to lead the way. She announced a ban on military-style assault rifles and ammunition Thursday. She has hammered social media companies for allowing and amplifying extremism. She even went to a high school this week, which lost two of its students in the attack, and told the children they need to fight prejudice.
"Let New Zealand be a place where there is no tolerance for racism," she said. "That's something we can all do."
And yet, it's hard to see how places like New Zealand can ever feel safe without some changes internationally. "We need to understand American laws because they affect us," one commentator said on Radio New Zealand this week.
Indeed the lack of legislative effort by American lawmakers on the issues that helped spawn the Christchurch attack -- guns, racism and tech platforms -- is no longer just a frustration in the United States. Now it wounds the world.
There's hard work to be done for that to change. The solution is not praying for victims or praising Ms. Ardern on Twitter. What New Zealanders want is for Americans to learn from others, for globalization to go the other way, even if it means limitations on fundamental U.S. of A. freedoms.
On guns, countries like New Zealand have less to confront: Of the 3.9 million New Zealanders of gun-licensing age, 238,000 -- just 6 percent -- have a firearm license, according to the website GunPolicy.org. In the United States, three in 10 adults say they own a firearm.
Tech companies are another challenge. Despite a growing body of research showing that the algorithms of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms push people further into violent extremism, getting those companies and their employees to dial back their self-regard and shift their priorities may be as hard as persuading gun owners to give up their AR-15s.
And let's be honest: Those are the easy things to fix compared with racism and white supremacy.
Some Muslims in Christchurch are hoping that the unity of the community and New Zealand officials will set a new standard.
"If we can use what happened here to say enough is enough, if we can promote what we call in New Zealand 'aroha,"' said Mustafa Farouk, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, using the Maori word for love, "maybe the people behind these shootings will change."
But according to others, the changes will need to become more common, below the ranks of public figures.
Here in Christchurch, one of the first people I contacted when I arrived was Kumar Yogeeswaran, a senior lecturer in psychology at the University of Canterbury who studies diversity and received his Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts.
We discussed the deep societal problem of not just violent racism but also the casual racism that feeds it. He said many of his nonwhite students in Christchurch have come to him with stories of ethnic slurs hurled at them or colleagues at work mocking their accents. In the aftermath of the attacks, he said some students have heard white New Zealanders express anti-immigrant sentiments, asking why they're here and why they've come.
"When an earthquake hits, the whole community grieves together," Mr. Yogeeswaran said. A mass shooting that killed mostly immigrants -- all of them Muslim -- has not quite done the same, some New Zealanders said, noting that the unaffected have been quicker to move on while others fear additional violence from extremists across the ideological spectrum.
In 2008, I wrote an article about Derek Black, who was then trying to run for local office in Florida as a white supremacist. He later renounced those views, and we were in touch this past week, emailing a bit about how New Zealand and the world could accelerate and expand the shift he made from hate to inclusion.
"When Ardern says that the people who were attacked 'are us,' that has to become a sentiment that does not sound surprising or untrue to people," he said. "This is a long process of people, particularly white people, redefining their in-groups and national identity."
Mr. Black thinks the only way to do this is for people not to isolate themselves.
The memorials I saw were perhaps a baby step in that direction, our shared emotions made visible in lilies and words that linger.
But some people did not stop there. On Thursday, I met Michael Tarren-Sweeney, a professor of child and family psychology, as he was leaving the funeral of Junaid Ismail, one of the victims. Mr. Tarren-Sweeney told me he worked with Mr. Ismail's sister, and when I shook his hand he had dirt on it from participating in the Muslim tradition of burial, in which mourners toss handfuls of earth into the grave.
Just behind him, leaning against a concrete pole at the cemetery's edge, was Caitlin Phillips. "I'm just paying my respects," she said. She had an iPhone in her hand. Had she seen news of the funerals on social media? Had she gone to the memorials?
"No, I live around the corner," she said. "I just wanted to come because I've lived here 18 years, all my life, and I've never seen anything so wrong."

Resumen: Through his prolific and often profound Facebook posts, he recorded his journey and his thoughts through Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, sharing the journalistic details of his surroundings, the people, politics, food, costs, crime and cool experiences in which he was immersed. Word came on Facebook that O'Connell was dead, found in his room at the White River 2 hotel in Phnom Penh, Cambodia a $6-a-night stay he had recently described as seedy enough to scare Charles Bukowski.

Texto completo: He left Albuquerque in September 2017, saying goodbye to the many friends he had made, the family he had created, the life he had built.
Most of his possessions, including his trusty Triumph Tiger Explorer motorcycle, were sold. Many of the tears he and his beloved girlfriend Andi had shed were dried. He was 45 and he was just hours and 8,500 miles away from living a dream he had cultivated since college.
“My last full night in town with my family, whose lives I am interrupting by pursuing adventures and opportunities,” Tom O'Connell wrote in his farewell Facebook post. “I gave myself heartbreak to do this. But I feel worse for any heartbreak I have caused them. I realize the selfishness of this. I have to do it.”
But it wasn't farewell. O'Connell journalist, idealist, adventurer had a dream, and he was taking all of us along for the ride.
Through his prolific and often profound Facebook posts, he recorded his journey and his thoughts through Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, sharing the journalistic details of his surroundings, the people, politics, food, costs, crime and cool experiences in which he was immersed.
He was the poor man's Anthony Bourdain, an American abroad, a foreign correspondent. He called it stumbling through Asia chasing interviews with the best kind of people the weird and wild ones.
“I love my very strange life,” he wrote. “I bought the ticket and took the ride. But I am looking back, too, and appreciating and missing the things in my rear view that I now carry in my heart.”
This week, O'Connell was headed to Vietnam after his stint as an editor for Globe Media Asia in Cambodia had ended.
But Wednesday his ride ended, too. Word came on Facebook that O'Connell was dead, found in his room at the White River 2 hotel in Phnom Penh, Cambodia a $6-a-night stay he had recently described as seedy enough to scare Charles Bukowski.
Because he was an American and because he was familiar to local media his death made local news, some of it salacious and unsubstantiated, some of it just wrong. Official word, according to Cambodia News, was that he had died of a heart attack. He was 47.
Funeral plans are being arranged, his uncle said.
O'Connell most likely would have been incensed about the mistakes, grammatical gaffes and lack of journalistic acumen in some of the reports on his death. Accuracy, fairness and getting deep into story were important to him in his years with The Times of London, The New York Times, Fast Company and his freelance writing and editing for Details, British Esquire, Spin, Entertainment Weekly, Penthouse, Vanity Fair, InStyle, Self and others.
The Indiana native had moved from New York City to Albuquerque sometime in the 2000s and worked for New Mexico Business Weekly, ABQ Free Press, SMPC Architects and BurqueMedia, among other endeavors.
But he struggled to keep financially afloat in a media market with far fewer opportunities for his brand of passion and prose.
Still, he kept plugging away, specializing in telling the stories of those who lived off the beaten path and those beaten down by society.
Our friendship began in 2015, though it consisted only of Facebook messages until one serendipitous weekend that October when we both happened to be in Pagosa Springs, Colo.
Over many hours and many beers, we talked about the privilege, adventure and angst of our profession. He longed for more adventure, more writing jobs.
He despised spinning his wheels searching for a place for his words to be read, and maybe that's because as a cancer survivor he knew time was not something to take for granted.
“Life is incredibly wonderful but sometimes just decides to kick us in the b---- for no reason whatsoever,” he wrote a week before his death. “A lot of us have lived to tell this story of adaptation and survival.”
A friend of his asked him why he had chosen to give up his life in Albuquerque for the unknown.
“I don't know,” he replied. “I guess for a great adventure and I didn't want to cram it into just a week or two of my entire life.”
He crammed that great adventure into 17½ months.
He was one of the lucky ones, daring to pursue his dream, diving deep into the unknown, always searching for the next story.
His story was not nearly as long as it should have been. But it was a good one.

Texto completo: Holy milestones, Batman! Detective Comics, where the caped crusader debuted on March 30, 1939, will reach issue No. 1000 on Wednesday, just days before the hero's 80th birthday. "It is evidence of the greatness and power of the Batman concept that the character has appeared continuously over eight decades," Peter Sanderson, a comic book historian, said.
Growing up, I saw versions of Batman in comics and on TV, but one of the great leaps forward was Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, a four-part story which presented an older version of the hero coming out of retirement to protect Gotham City once more. Miller's vision of Batman helped pave the way for Tim Burton's "Batman," starring Michael Keaton, perhaps the first time my love of comics was less childish and more socially acceptable.
Since then, we've had many film Batmen -- his onscreen incarnations have oscillated between campy (Joel Schumacher) and dignified (Christopher Nolan) -- but his guiding principle has remained the same. "Batman never gives up on his mission to protect the innocent from evil," Sanderson said.
Comic book creators, historians and fans helped me pick out key moments in Detective Comics to commemorate Batman's career. Here they are:
March 1939
Detective Comics No. 27
Detective Comics was an anthology series that began in 1937 that eventually gave DC Comics its name. The Bat-Man, as he was then called inside the book, premiered in this issue's six-page "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate." (The later cover date -- of May, in this instance -- was a practice publishers used to keep comics on newsstands longer.) The story introduces Commissioner Gordon, the wealthy Bruce Wayne and his caped alter-ego, who thinks nothing of heaving a criminal off a roof. Batman was created by the artist Bob Kane and the writer Bill Finger, though it took many years for Finger to receive credit for his significant contributions to the canon. Another bat-fact: A copy of Detective No. 27 sold at auction for $1.075 million in 2010.
[Read The New York Times obituary for Bob Kane , who died in 1998, and a short article about Bill Finger and the Bronx .]
March 1940
Detective Comics No. 38
The world of Batman brightened with the introduction of Robin, the Boy Wonder. "Robin humanizes Batman and also allows for some levity in the heavy-shadowed stories of Gotham, while of course hooking young readers with someone they can also relate to," said Peter J. Tomasi, who writes the current Detective Comics series.
It certainly hooked me. As a young fan in the 1970s, Robin, whose real name was Dick Grayson, was one of my introductions to superheroes. I witnessed his growth into adulthood and transformation into Nightwing, a confident, outgoing adventurer who brings together the DC heroes in a way that the more reclusive Batman cannot. Since Dick's graduation, other Robins have emerged, including Bruce Wayne's son, Damian.

December 1949
Detective Comics No. 156
Michael E. Uslan, a comic books historian and a producer of the "Batman" films, called this issue transformative. "The Batmobile of 1950," he said, "redefines Batman, modernizes him, and moves him into a new generation, equipped with higher tech." (There have since been many iterations of the Batmobile.) The cover mentions an "Indian lawman," a sheriff who is Sioux. His name is Ohiyesa Smith. But, in a sign of the times, a character decides, "That name's too tough to pronounce," and calls him Pow Wow, based on his philosophy of talking first, then resorting to violence if needed.
March 1964
Detective Comics No. 327
"This issue introduces the legendary 'New Look' Batman, with the yellow circle around his chest symbol and a whole new look and style both visually and in terms of character development and story," Uslan said. "Readers of that era still feel jarred and elated by this sea change!" The chief architects of the evolution were the editor Julius Schwartz and the artist Carmine Infantino, who came in to shore up sagging sales in the hopes of avoiding cancellation.
November 1966
Detective Comics No. 359
When producers of the Batman television series wanted to increase female viewership, they asked DC for a new character. They got Batgirl, whose civilian guise is Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham's police commissioner. Batgirl's career was halted in 1988, when she was paralyzed after being shot by the Joker. She eventually became Oracle, a hacker and information broker aiding DC's heroes. In 2011, she underwent experimental surgery that returned her to the rooftops. Many fans would love to see Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson as a romantic dynamic duo.

November 1973
Detective Comics No. 439
Batman has no dialogue in "Night of the Stalker," which is a little gimmicky but manages to work, if you believe the hero's laser-sharp focus leaves little room for words. The story -- written by Steve Englehart, plotted and drawn by Vin and Sal Amendola and inked by Dick Giordano -- begins with our hero seeing bank robbers murder a couple in front of their son. After justice is served, Batman unmasks at home. Suddenly "sorrow explodes within him" as he remembers being a boy and witnessing the death of his parents. The final caption: "In this gray-lit, lonely tower, for this single moment in infinity ... he is that boy again."
December 1975
Detective Comics 457
Another side of Batman emerges in "There Is No Hope in Crime Alley," by Denny O'Neil and Dick Giordano. Batman makes an annual pilgrimage to the street where his parents died, seeking out Leslie Thompkins, a woman who consoled a young Bruce Wayne on that fateful night. That encounter inspired Leslie to devote herself to charitable work in hopes of preventing future tragedy. In a rarity for Batman, he thanks her and kisses her brow tenderly. In the morning, his loyal butler, Alfred, finds him sleeping peacefully and smiling.
December 1980
Detective Comics No. 500
Paul Levitz, whose long career with DC began in 1972, said that assembling the all-star creators for this milestone issue was his proudest editorial moment. The 80 pages include a prose piece by Walter Gibson, the creator of the Shadow, in a tribute to the earliest days of Detective, which included text stories. Another achievement: In 1978, when Levitz took over editing Batman, he read every issue of Batman, Detective and World's Finest that had featured the hero. It was a daunting task then, and seems nearly impossible today.
June 2009
Detective Comics No. 854
Batwoman was originally introduced in Detective No. 233 in 1956, in part to give Batman a love interest. It did not take. She was rebooted in 2006 as a lesbian who had been discharged from the military. This Batwoman was embraced by fans, and she took over Detective for a year before graduating to her own series. In 2013, her creative team quit over an editorial edict preventing her from marrying. The decision was about keeping true to the mission of the Batman characters, who have sacrificed their self-interests for the greater good.
March 2019
Detective Comics No. 1000
This 96-page issue has several stories by a boldface slate of creators. The first, "Batman's Longest Case," by Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo, recalls his first adventure. It also introduces the Detective Guild, some of whose members had extensive solo stories in Detective, including Slam Bradley (12 years), Martian Manhunter (nine years) and Elongated Man (five years). "The richness, variety and popularity of these backups contributed to Detective's success and longevity," said Richard Roney, a member of the geek squad I run with, who researched and extolled these supporting characters.

Texto completo: LONDON - European authorities on Wednesday fined Google 15 billion euros for antitrist violations in the online advertising market, comtinuing its efforts to ren in the world's biggest technology companies.
The fine, worth about $1.7 billion, is he third against Google by the European Union since 2017, reinforcing theregion's position as the world's most aggressive watchdog of an industy with an increasingly powerful role in society and the global economy. The regulators said Google hadviolated antitrust rules by mposing unfair terms on companies that used its searh bar on their websites in Burope.
Europe's regulatory approach was once criticized as unfairly argeting technology conpanies from the United States, but is now viewed as a potential global model as governments question the influence of Silicon Valley. Europe is at the forefront of a broad debate about the role of tech platforms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, and whether their size and power hurt competition.
In the United States, where policymakers have taken a largely hands-off approach to the companies, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made breaking up Google and other tech giants a priority in her Democratic presidential campaign. This week, Rep. David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law, called for a federal investigation of Facebook.
"Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules," Margrethe Vestager, Europe's top antitrust watchdog, said in a statement.
The case is the last of three investigations the European Commission has pursued against Google, headquartered in Mountain View, California, and whose parent company is Alphabet.
Last year, Vestager fined Google a record 4.34 billion euros (about $5.1 billion at the time) for using its ownership of the Android mobile operating system to unfairly undercut rivals in the mobile phone market, a decision that also forced the company to change how it bundles its apps on smartphones. In 2017, the company was fined an additional 2.4 billion euros for unfairly favoring its own shopping services over those of rivals. Google is appealing both fines.
On Wednesday, European officials said Google had unfairly required websites that used its search bar to feature ads from Google's advertising services over those of rivals. Google has said it stopped the practice starting in 2016.

Texto completo: As authorities rushed to stop a gunman on a mass killing spree in New Zealand, engineers, programmers and content moderators around the globe were scrambling to keep the rampage from going viral.
It didn't work.
The terrorist in Christchurch killed 50 people at two mosques last Friday, livestreaming part of the attack on Facebook. The original video was taken down within an hour. But copies proliferated across the major platforms.
On Saturday night, Facebook announced that it had removed 1.5 million copies of the video, with 1.2 million blocked at the moment they were uploaded. YouTube declined to give numbers, although its chief product officer told The Washington Post that at times, a copy of the video was being uploaded every second.
After decades of shunning responsibility for user content, Big Tech is slowly making its products safer for society — banning anti-vaccine misinformation, for instance, and cracking down on political disinformation. More moderation comes with heavy risks, of course. Decisions about the limits of free speech would shift to companies whose priorities are driven by shareholders. But the viral spread of the Christchurch shooting video shows the limits of the content moderation machine in the face of technologies that have been designed to be attention traps. Stricter moderation or filtering systems are not the answer. It must be a priority to redesign technology to respect the common good, instead of ignoring it.
There is a special urgency when it comes to mass killings, since media amplification can inspire copycat killings, and only so much can be done in a crisis where every hour counts.
Filtering systems have been relatively successful where time is not of the essence — copyright infringement never kills anyone, even if it stays up for a week. On longer time scales, moderation works reasonably well.
For about a decade or longer, the tech companies have automatically filtered out child pornography in a partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a database of "fingerprinted" videos. Starting in 2016, major platforms adapted that technology to filter for "terrorist" content.
But this kind of filtering only works when new content matches known banned content through a form of digital fingerprinting. Although the video of the New Zealand attack was fingerprinted immediately, countless thousands of people beat the filter over and over again by recutting, editing, watermarking and modifying the video itself. While harder to find on major social media platforms, copies of the video are still easily found online.
Keeping the internet, or at the very least social media, free from vile content is grueling work. The experience of content moderators for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health.
Repeated exposure to conspiracy theories — say, that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn't happen — turns out to sway content moderators, an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large. Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side. Turnover is high, pay is low, and although they have access to on-site counselors, many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job.
The killer in New Zealand sought to hijack the attention of the internet, and the millions of uploads of his video — both attempted and achieved — were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users: the desire to make content go viral.
In the midst of the crisis this weekend, YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos. It's not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy. In July, WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of lynchings fueled by rumors spread by users of the service. The change became global in January in an effort to fight "misinformation and rumors."
What happened last weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be. Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary, and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction. The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach, even if that comes at the cost of some profitability.
Unfortunately, it's also the outcome least likely to happen.

YouTube declined to give numbers, although its chief product officer told The Washington Post that at times, a copy of the video was being uploaded every second.
After decades of shunning responsibility for user content, Big Tech is slowly making its products safer for society — banning anti-vaccine misinformation, for instance, and cracking down on political disinformation. More moderation comes with heavy risks, of course. Decisions about the limits of free speech would shift to companies whose priorities are driven by shareholders. But the viral spread of the Christchurch shooting video shows the limits of the content moderation machine in the face of technologies that have been designed to be attention traps. Stricter moderation or filtering systems are not the answer. It must be a priority to redesign technology to respect the common good, instead of ignoring it.
There is a special urgency when it comes to mass killings, since media amplification can inspire copycat killings, and only so much can be done in a crisis where every hour counts.
Filtering systems have been relatively successful where time is not of the essence — copyright infringement never kills anyone, even if it stays up for a week. On longer time scales, moderation works reasonably well.
For about a decade or longer, the tech companies have automatically filtered out child pornography in a partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a database of "fingerprinted" videos. Starting in 2016, major platforms adapted that technology to filter for "terrorist" content.
But this kind of filtering only works when new content matches known banned content through a form of digital fingerprinting. Although the video of the New Zealand attack was fingerprinted immediately, countless thousands of people beat the filter over and over again by recutting, editing, watermarking and modifying the video itself. While harder to find on major social media platforms, copies of the video are still easily found online.
Keeping the internet, or at the very least social media, free from vile content is grueling work. The experience of content moderators for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health.
Repeated exposure to conspiracy theories — say, that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn't happen — turns out to sway content moderators, an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large. Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side. Turnover is high, pay is low, and although they have access to on-site counselors, many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job.
The killer in New Zealand sought to hijack the attention of the internet, and the millions of uploads of his video — both attempted and achieved — were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users: the desire to make content go viral.
In the midst of the crisis this weekend, YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos. It's not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy. In July, WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of lynchings fueled by rumors spread by users of the service. The change became global in January in an effort to fight "misinformation and rumors."
What happened last weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be. Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary, and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction. The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach, even if that comes at the cost of some profitability.
Unfortunately, it's also the outcome least likely to happen.

Texto completo: One ... solitary ... vote.
Switch it from thumbs down to thumbs up and everything changes.
Thumbs up and Donald Trump isn't spitting on the grave of John McCain.
Thumbs up and the earnest media aren't defending McCain's honor.
History turned on an axis in the early hours of July 28, 2017, when McCain approached the Senate clerk and voted against his party — a thumbs down to Obamacare repeal.
Had it gone the other way, Donald Trump would not be expectorating. He'd be repairing the McCain image.
Because if McCain had voted to repeal Obamacare, the left would have savaged him two years ago and framed the McCain legacy in the worst possible light. How do I know?
Because liberals had started to waste John McCain, not when he was deceased, but when he was merely cancer stricken and facing the prospect of imminent death.
You think McCain didn't know who they were? He did.
The Democrats and their media mouthpieces revealed themselves explicitly in the days before thumbs-down when they misread a couple of procedural votes and believed McCain would repeal Obamacare.
That John McCain wasn't a war hero and maverick. He was was a war-monger and fat cat who cared nothing for the poor. He had his solid-gold health plan. The poor could take an aspirin.
Here's how New York Times columnist Paul Krugman put it: "... can we take a moment to consider the awfulness of Senator John McCain? In case you haven't been following the story, what has been going on in the Senate these past few days is one of the most shameful episodes in that body's history."
James Fallows, wrote in the Atlantic that McCain would be remembered for "steering American politics down the path that led to Donald Trump by choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate."
The Los Angeles Times editorialized:
"It's hard to ignore the irony of Sen. John McCain returning to Washington from cranial surgery at the Mayo Clinic just to keep alive a bill that would make health insurance unaffordable to millions of Americans."
Adam H. Johnson of the hyper-left Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, used an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times to remind readers in the middle of a health-care debate that McCain is "a reliable partisan conservative who loves war ... (has) never met a war he didn't like ... advocated for an Iraq invasion that caused 500,000 to 1 million deaths ... (and) selectively cares about 'human rights' when it permits him to lay the groundwork for U.S. aggression."
A day later McCain voted their way to preserve Obamacare. As that American woman of letters Emily Litella once observed, "That's very different. Never mind."
Now the left champions John McCain. Ana Navarro, a formerly closeted liberal who used to masquerade as a Republican, said, "I don't care if you like John McCain or couldn't stand [him.] [Trump] is attacking a dead national hero and that's plain disgusting. [I]t is abominable ... inhumane ... indecent ... immoral and everybody should condemn it."
You know what's abominable? Wasting the CO2 that produces articulate speech on that. Donald Trump isn't worth two seconds of rebuttal.
Has anyone noticed our president is a blowhard? That he doesn't value truth or consistency or the niceties of high office? He doesn't play by convention. He's there to destroy it.
Have you noticed the vapid tweets and playground put-downs? That Trump is apt to lie not daily, but on the hour?
Who cares what Donald Trump says about John McCain? It means nothing.
CNN's Chris Cillizza assures us Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce would never have said what Trump said of McCain. Damn straight.
And had they said it after the passing of a national hero, the earth would have shook. Because back then a president's words held weight. They meant something. Trump's words don't.
Our Western allies finally figured this out. It took them a year, but they learned they could stop striking a match to themselves every time the president fired off a tweet.
The spoken word in the Trump White House is a spent vehicle for moving ideas and promoting policies. He drove it into the ditch.
When Trump speaks ill of John McCain, you don't need a rebuttal. You don't need a sermon. Five words will suffice: "Thank you for your input."

OVERHAUL THE FAA AFTER MAX 8 BUNGLES, THE AGENCY LACKS PUBLIC TRUST

Texto completo: As the international investigation into two fatal airline crashes continues, the Federal Aviation Administration is looking less like a regulatory agency than a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Co.
Most countries moved quickly to ground Boeing's 737 Max 8 after it became clear that the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 was disconcertingly similar to that of Lion Air Flight 610 about five months earlier off the coast of Indonesia.
Not so the United States. The FAA was still insisting on the Max 8's airworthiness late March 12 - two days and who knows how many flights after the Ethiopian Airlines crash - then regulators abruptly changed course March 13 and grounded the plane after nearly everyone else had done so.
The FAA's close relationship with the industry, especially the agency's employment of many ex-Boeing employees, immediately surfaced as a possible explanation for the agency's lethargy. But the situation seems to be a lot worse than originally feared.
According to The Seattle Times, federal regulators turned over much of the safety analysis work on the Max 8 to Boeing as the company, in competition with Airbus, pushed the plane to market about two years ago. Boeing's safety analysis was flawed, the paper reported, partly because it underestimated the power of a flight-control system that might have been responsible for forcing the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air planes downward.
That isn't all. The flight-control system on the Max 8 is new, but Boeing didn't offer pilots special training because the company considered it reasonably similar to that on other 737s. That's why pilots could qualify to fly the Max 8 merely by taking brief training on an iPad. The Seattle Times noted that Boeing marketed the Max 8 to airlines partly by citing the low training costs.
Airlines don't mind skimping. The New York Times reported Thursday that Boeing offered airlines extra safety measures that might have helped pilots on the doomed flights figure out what was happening with the flight control system, but Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air opted not to purchase the upgrades.
After the Lion Air crash, other pilots reported flight-control problems with the Max 8. Some even filed complaints in a federal database. The FAA should have responded with alacrity to those complaints- it's unclear if it responded at all- and regulators should have leaned hard on Boeing to complete a flight-control system update the company knew was needed after the Lion Air tragedy.
Which leads to more troubling questions:
If U.S. airlines knew their own pilots had concerns with the plane, why did they keep it in service?
If the FAA knew that Boeing was working on a needed software update after the Lion Air disaster, why didn't it ground the Max 8 fleet until the fix was in place? At the very least, why didn't the agency immediately recognize the significance of a second disaster involving the plane? The U.S. should have been the first nation to idle the Max 8, not the last.
The Lion Air disaster killed 189, and the Ethiopian Airlines crash killed 157. The FAA's slipshod regulation put countless other lives at risk. The agency needs a thorough overhaul - one that includes a more neutral relationship with the industry and reclaiming responsibilities foolishly delegated to Boeing.

Texto completo: HARMONY KORINE AT THE METROGRAPH (Opening on Friday) Korine was only 22 when Larry Clark's "Kids" (on Monday and Tuesday), for which he wrote the screenplay, became a cultural flash point because of its depiction of sex and H.I.V. among New York City teenagers. He was only 24 when Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, declared his feature directorial debut, "Gummo" (on Sunday and Monday), the worst film of 1997. Whether Korine should be seen as a juvenile troll or a bold fringe artist has continued to be a subject of debate, with "Trash Humpers" (on Friday and Saturday), a VHS-shot provocation that chronicles the antics of a group of wrinkle-masked mischief makers, offering the best evidence for both positions. The delightful "Spring Breakers" (on Friday and Saturday), starring James Franco (above), opened a path to mainstream appeal, a direction Korine heads further down with his new stoner comedy, "The Beach Bum," starring Matthew McConaughey and opening on March 29.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee revealed information on Thursday that he said showed Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner used private messaging services for official White House business in a way that may have violated federal records laws.
The chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, said that a lawyer for Ms. Trump, President Trump's daughter, and Mr. Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, told the committee late last year that in addition to a private email account, Mr. Kushner uses an unofficial encrypted messaging service, WhatsApp, for official White House business, including with foreign contacts.
Mr. Cummings said the lawyer, Abbe Lowell, also told lawmakers that Ms. Trump did not preserve some emails sent to her private account if she did not reply to them.
Democrats have barely been able to contain their frustration at what they see as a dark irony in the findings -- and in earlier news reports about the couple's use of private email accounts. Mr. Trump made Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state a central line of attack in his 2016 campaign for president. Even after the F.B.I. declined to charge Mrs. Clinton for her practices and handling of classified information, Republicans in Congress have continued to pick away at the case.
Mr. Lowell could not say if Mr. Kushner had communicated classified information on the messaging service, WhatsApp, telling lawmakers that was "above my pay grade." He asserted that because Mr. Kushner took screenshots of the communications and sent them to his official White House account or the National Security Council, his client was not in violation of federal records laws.
In a letter on Thursday disclosing the new information, Mr. Cummings said the findings added urgency to his investigation of possible violations of the Presidential Records Act by members of the Trump administration, including Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump. He accused the White House of stonewalling his committee on information that it had requested months ago, when Republicans still controlled the House.
"The White House's failure to provide documents and information is obstructing the committee's investigation into allegations of violations of federal records laws by White House officials," Mr. Cummings wrote. He said he would "be forced to consider alternative means to obtain compliance" if documents he requested about White House communications and record keeping were not shared with the committee, an indication he could subpoena them.
Steven Groves, a White House lawyer, said the White House would review Mr. Cummings's letter and "provide a reasonable response in due course."
Mr. Lowell, in a letter of his own, accused Mr. Cummings of misrepresenting parts of what he told lawmakers last year and disputed suggestions that either of his clients had broken the law.
The oversight committee first began scrutinizing the use of private communications services at the White House in 2017 amid news reports that Mr. Kushner had used a private email account for government business and then that Ms. Trump had done the same.
Mr. Kushner's use of WhatsApp was also reported earlier in at least one instance, but its scope was not previously known. CNN reported in October that Mr. Kushner had communicated with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, using WhatsApp.
Mr. Lowell confirmed details of Mr. Kushner's private messaging use -- though not his communications with Prince Mohammed -- during a meeting in December with Mr. Cummings and the committee's chairman at the time, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. Asked if Mr. Kushner had been cleared to use the messaging app to communicate with foreign leaders, Mr. Lowell recommended that the lawmakers ask the National Security Council and the White House, Mr. Cummings said.
On Thursday, Mr. Lowell said that contrary to what Mr. Cummings's letter asserted, he had not confirmed that the president's son-in-law was communicating on WhatsApp with foreign "leaders," merely that he messaged with "some people." More broadly, Mr. Lowell said he had told lawmakers that he was not privy to many details of Mr. Kushner's use of WhatsApp, instructing them, "that is a question for the White House counsel, not me."
Mr. Lowell also took issue with Mr. Cummings's account of what he said about Ms. Trump.
In his letter, Mr. Cummings said that after speaking to Mr. Lowell, he believed Ms. Trump could also potentially be in violation of the Presidential Records Act because of her use of a private email account. Specifically, he said Mr. Lowell had told the committee that although Ms. Trump forwards work-related emails received on her personal account to an official government account, she only does so if she responds to the message.
Mr. Lowell, though, said that was oversimplifying his response. In the exchange highlighted by the chairman, he had been referring to Ms. Trump's practices before September 2017, he said. Since then, he said, "she always forwards official business to her White House account."
Mr. Cummings's committee is separately investigating the circumstances under which Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, and other administration officials, received security clearances. The New York Times reported last month that Mr. Trump had personally intervened to secure a top-secret clearance for Mr. Kushner despite legal and national security concerns raised by his advisers.
Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump do not appear to be the only current or former White House officials in Mr. Cummings's sights for their personal email use. He wrote on Thursday that he had also obtained documents apparently showing that K. T. McFarland had used a personal AOL account for official business while she served as deputy national security adviser and that Stephen K. Bannon had done the same while a White House adviser.
Mr. Cummings set an April 4 deadline for the White House to comply with his latest requests. To what extent it will do so, though, remains to be seen.
The White House has generally been resistant so far to satisfy requests from House Democrats.
On Thursday, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, rejected another request from Mr. Cummings and the chairmen of the Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees for information about Mr. Trump's private communications with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In a letter, he said that the Constitution and the courts had granted the president broad authority to conduct foreign policy and that presidents of both parties had rightly fought to protect their communications with foreign leaders.
"While we respectfully seek to accommodate appropriate oversight requests, we are unaware of any precedent supporting such sweeping requests," Mr. Cipollone wrote.

Texto completo: The man who allegedly conspired with the likes of James Comey and Andrew McCabe to overthrow a sitting president is still garnering approximately $20,000 a month in taxpayer-funded salary, along with all the government benefits that come with it.

On Sept. 24, 2018, Axios reported that Rosenstein verbally offered to resign after The New York Times published a story claiming that he actively pushed the idea of secretly recording President Trump and conspiring to invoke the 25th Amendment, something Rosenstein himself has yet to deny.

Months later, Rosenstein still hasn’t vacated his office. On Jan. 9, multiple outlets reported that Rosenstein would resign before the next month, but Feb. 9 came and went with Rosenstein remaining second-in-command at the Department of Justice. New Attorney General Bill Barr was sworn into office on Feb. 14, yet Rosenstein is still there.

Then we were told to expect his departure in “mid-March.” On Tuesday we were told he'd be staying longer. This is the longest exit-stage music ever.

How can a man who’s allegedly lied to Congress and obstructed congressional investigations still be employed at one of the highest levels of government?

Seeking an answer to that very question, the Senate Judiciary Committee is demanding that the DOJ turn over documents pertaining to discussions among top officials, including Rosenstein, about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.

In a letter to Barr last Friday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that his panel intends to investigate the allegations and gave Barr a two week deadline to turn over any documents relating to conversations between FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and Rosenstein about the 25th Amendment or about covertly recording Trump.

Ironically, had it not been for former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s interference in 2018, the House likely would have already impeached Rosenstein for his conduct. Several Republican lawmakers filed articles of impeachment against Rosenstein for withholding documents and making misleading statements to Congress. While Ryan acknowledged difficulties getting the DOJ to comply with congressional requests, he refused to hold a vote on the impeachment effort.

In addition to allegedly stonewalling congressional investigators on multiple occasions, Rosenstein is also the subject of a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, which alleges that the DOJ has failed to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests seeking documentation of Rosenstein’s actions immediately preceding his appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel.

Despite all of this, Rosenstein remains in office. Anyone else facing such extensive and egregious accusations would almost certainly have been removed long ago or simply resigned, but Rosenstein's disdain for Trump is no secret, and the establishment has evidently circled their wagons around him.

As long as Rosenstein has the protection of the DOJ, the public may never get the answers they deserve about his role to oust Trump, nor the confidence in our most important law enforcement agencies that they once had before the last presidential election. We deserve to trust in the legitimacy of our government at every level.

Texto completo: LIMA, Ohio - Less than a month after General Motors dealt a blow to the state by shuttering its Lordstown facility, President Donald Trump took shots at union leadership while touting the jobs returning to northwest Ohio thanks to his investment in a storied Army tank plant.
"If it weren't for me, this place would be closed," Mr. Trump said at the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, the last place in the country that makes the Abrams battle tank.
After boasting about his investment in Ohio-made tanks, he laid into GM: "What's going on with General Motors? We've got the best economy we've ever had. We have the lowest unemployment we've had in 50 years. What's going on with General Motors? Sell it to somebody or open it yourselves, and the UAW will help you."
He continued: "I want to deal with the people in the union. Not the heads of the union. You gotta stop with the dues. You pay too much dues. They could have kept General Motors in that gorgeous plant in Lordstown. They could have kept it."
The president was speaking at a plant with United Auto Workers membership. The crowd of workers and soldiers were silent after his union remarks until he clarified that he was speaking about the people in charge, not the rank-and-file members.
The president took heat last weekend for tweets about UAW Local 1112 president David Green after the Lordstown union leader appeared on Fox News. Mr. Trump blamed him for the closure, which directly affects 1,400 GM workers and thousands more across its northeast Ohio supply chain.
To illustrate economic growth and what he says is the imminent elimination of ISIS, Mr. Trump referred to charts he was holding that no one in the audience could see.
"You don't have to know what's on it. You don't have to know what the hell is on it. All you have to know is that's the good line," he said.
The president heaped praise on workers at the plant, which is hiring some 400 more, bringing its total workforce to the highest point in nearly a decade.
Mr. Trump took full credit for funding the plant's gradual resurgence.
His proposed 2020 defense budget includes $1.75 billion to speed production in Lima and build 165 Abrams tanks.
Mr. Trump and the speakers who warmed up the crowd pointed out the plant's near closure under President Barack Obama. Its workforce hit a low in 2014, and production slowed to just one tank per month to keep the line warm.
Before a group that included members of the military, Mr. Trump attacked the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former Navy pilot who spent 5½ years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. It wasn't the first time Mr. Trump attacked Mr. McCain, who requested before his death last year that Mr. Trump not attend his funeral.
"I gave him the kind of funeral he wanted," the president said. "I didn't get a thank you."
Earlier in the day, the Ohio Democratic Party held a news conference at a Lima union hall to blast Mr. Trump as anti-union.
Others waited until afterward to criticize his remarks about unions and Mr. McCain.
"President Trump claims he wants to help workers and support our military, yet his actions tell a different story," Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a statement.
"The president is hurting military missions by taking money away from Ohio military installations to pay for his vanity project. He attacks Sen. McCain, a war hero and a patriot. ... While the president promises one thing, he continues to pursue policies that betray Ohio service members, veterans, families and workers."

Texto completo: THURSDAY
Palace country
Dwight Yoakam, one of the finest singers to ever emerge from the country scene, will make a tour stop at the Palace Theatre, Greensburg.
The honky-tonk singer and actor from Bakersfield, Calif., debuted in 1986 with "Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc." and released his most recent album, "Swimmin' Pools, Movie Stars," in 2016.
He brings such classics as "Guitars, Cadillacs," "A Thousand Miles From Nowhere," "Fast As You," "Honky Tonk Man," "Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Loose" and "Little Ways."
Opening the show is Americana soul singer-songwriter Noah Guthrie, who played Roderick Meeks on the TV show "Glee."
It begins at 8 p.m. Tickets are $48 to $118; www.thepalacetheatre.org.
THURSDAY-SUNDAY
'Doll's House' continued
It begins with a knock at the door. It's been 15 years since Nora walked out that same door, leaving her husband and children to pursue an independent life at a time when women just didn't do that. Now she's back and forced to confront the family she left behind.
"A Doll's House, Part 2," Lucas Hnath's award-winning sequel to Ibsen's masterpiece, is directed by Ted Pappas in his return to Pittsburgh Public Theater, with a cast comprising Daniel Krell, Helena Ruoti, newcomer Marielle Young and, as Nora, Lisa Velten Smith.
It's at the O'Reilly Theater, 621 Penn Ave., Downtown (leave yourself some time; the Trust has recently added metal detectors and bag inspections there), through April 7. 7 p.m. Tuesdays; 8 p.m. Wednesdays-Fridays (plus 2 p.m. April 4); 2 and 8 p.m. Saturdays; and 2 and 7 p.m. Sundays (2 p.m. only April 7). Check ppt.org for exceptions. Tickets: $30-$80 ($16.50 for 26 and younger); ppt.org or 412-316-1600.
FRIDAY
Hot Dogs and Angels
"She's small, practical and fun. She makes a lot of sense, but not too much sense, just enough to be hilarious."
That was Jerry Seinfeld talking about Kathleen Madigan, who pulls into the Palace Theatre, Greensburg, on her Hot Dogs and Angels Tour.
The St. Louis native, a longtime regular on the late-night shows, was recently seen in the Netflix special "Bothering Jesus," also the title of her sixth comedy album.
It begins at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $29.75-$45.75 ($5.25 additional day of the show); www.thepalacetheatre.org.
FRIDAY-SATURDAY
Building 'The Wall'
Lost in all the talk about the border wall is the fact that this is the 40th anniversary of "The Wall," the one Pink Floyd built in 1979.
Brit Floyd, the leading Floyd tribute band, will mark that anniversary by going heavy on the rock opera at its show at the Benedum, Downtown.
Frontman Damian Darlington told the Chichester Observer, "It was the first Pink Floyd that I can remember being aware of, and it also produced a very unlikely Christmas No. 1. That was one of my first memories of the band. I was still only about 10 years old, and I was not really into music in that sense."
Once he started playing guitar, he gravitated to the album and became a member of Australian Pink Floyd before forming Brit Floyd in 2011.
Shows begin at 8 p.m. Tickets are $44.25-$89.25; trustarts.org.
FRIDAY-SUNDAY
Oh, the Humanities
Kevin Kwan, the best-selling author of "Crazy Rich Asians," and the hosts of "Last Podcast on the Left" are two of the highlights of the Pittsburgh Humanities Festival, taking place in the Cultural District this weekend.
Among the other talks will be "Drawing the Line: A Conversation With Rob Rogers," "The Human Cost of Fracking With Eliza Griswold," "How Not to Save the Planet With Michael Goodhart," "Scratching the Surface With DJ Perly" and "Lee Terbosic - Making Magic: Pittsburgh, Houdini and History."
More details are available at trustarts.org.
SATURDAY
Retro style
The Senator John Heinz History Center in the Strip looks back in style with the seventh annual Vintage Pittsburgh retro fair, an afternoon of fashion and treats.
Dozens of local vendors will be on hand selling vintage clothing, accessories and home decor, plus handmade goods such as jewelry, candles and artwork.
Providing local flavor will be the Bulldawgs food truck, Piebird Pastry Kitchen, Sinful Sweets Chocolate Company, Zeke's Coffee, and Wigle Whiskey and Threadbare Cider and Mead.
Guests can make their own retro "shrinky dink" creation, play a vintage game or two, and enjoy the History Center's exhibitions, including the fashions of Catherine Baker Knoll.
Presented in partnership with The Neighborhood Flea, it runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The discounted admission is $10; $9 students and children ages 6-17; 5 and under free; heinzhistorycenter.org/events.
D-Jammin'
Once again, Jeff Mattson, guitarist for the leading Grateful Dead tribute band, Dark Star Orchestra, will join Pittsburgh jam band theCAUSE for the 20th annual D-Jam, a concert at the Rex Theater to benefit Just Harvest's anti-hunger work in Allegheny County.
TheCAUSE - bassist-singer David Tauberg, guitarist-singer Eric Weingrad, singer Jill Simmons and drummer Mike South - also will be joined by pianist Randy Baumann from WDVE-FM for an opening acoustic set and later by keyboardists Bill Maruca and Kip Lieber.
The previous 19 shows have raised more than $100,000 for charity, according to the band.
It begins at 7 p.m. at the South Side venue. Tickets are $20; justharvest.org.
Redbone's roots
The Calliope series rolls on with Martha Redbone, a blues/soul/roots artist from Kentucky playing the Carnegie Lecture Hall, Oakland.
Her music reflects growing up with a gospel-singing African-American father and Cherokee/Shawnee/Choctaw mother.
According to The New York Times, "Martha Redbone's voice held both the taut determination of mountain music and the bite of American Indian singing."
It begins at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $45, $20 full-time student; calliopehouse.org.
Mac back
TobyMac, who came along in the late '80s as a member of DC Talk before becoming a Grammy-winning solo artist, brings his Hits Deep Tour to the Petersen Events Center, Oakland.
In October, the Christian singer-rapper released his seventh album, "The Elements," and told Billboard, "I have to experience some things, struggle with some things, overcome some things and get in the trenches before I have enough to write about. That's why it takes me a few years because I want to write about what's really going on in my life. I find when you write about what's really happening in life it resonates more with people than fictional stuff."
He will be joined by Jeremy Camp, Jordan Feliz, Ryan Stevenson, We Are Messengers and Aaron Cole.
It begins at 7 p.m. Tickets are $16 to $89; ticketmaster.com.
Power of love
Quantum Theatre goes to HIP at the Flashlight Factory, North Side, to explore "the enduring power of love" for its Q Ball, a dance party with DJ Big Phill and a selection of desserts, beginning at 8 p.m. ($50).
The VIP party begins at 6 p.m. ($250) with the sounds of the Afro Yaqui Music Collective, food from Kate Romane's Black Radish Kitchen and specialty cocktails from Lo Bar.
It's at 831 W. North Ave. Information at quantumtheatre.com.
SUNDAY
Metheny's Side Eye
Jazz pioneer Pat Metheny takes the stage at Carnegie Lecture Hall in Oakland with his latest project, Side Eye.
As he explained, "I wanted to create an ongoing setting to feature a rotating cast of new and upcoming musicians who have particularly caught my interest along the way.
"I hear regularly from new players on the scene who have professed an influence from my records and tunes, and I often invite them up to my house to play. Very often, it is really natural and organic to the music to play with them. They have literally grown up with it. I find myself inspired by how they deal with the musical challenges that come with the territory of some of those older tunes, and at the same time I find myself intrigued with the possibilities of what might be possible in writing new music just for them. This band setting is what that will be all about."
This first edition of Side Eye features keyboardist James Francies and drummer Nate Smith.
It's at 8 p.m. Tickets are $27-$30; ticketmaster.com.

Texto completo: COMEDY SPECIAL "Amy Schumer Growing" WHEN | WHERE Streaming now on Netflix
WHAT IT'S ABOUT Amy Schumer taped this show - her second for Netflix - at the landmark Chicago Theatre  in December. Topics include her pregnancy, recent marriage, current affairs and sex. It's raw - very raw - so not for everyone.
MY SAY A lot has happened to Rockville Centre-raised Schumer in between Netflix concerts, as their respective titles indicate. The 2017 "Leather Special" featured her in a patent leather black jumpsuit. With a little imagination - or matching mask - she could've easily morphed into Batwoman.
On "Growing," she's wearing a  dark maternity swing dress - stylish, sure, but also functional, practical and (to use another word that's rarely, possibly never, associated with her) sensible. This also works as a prop when she hikes it up at one point to reveal that bump and a swollen belly button she has covered with a couple of bandages.
So add one more word: It's serviceable.
Amy does as Amy is, and what's she's done in the intervening years is get married and get pregnant. Per "Growing," both have been fulfilling and complicated. As intended, they also lend extra meaning to the title. She's grown since 2017, and that's complicated, too.
In fact, "Growing" feels a little like a show that's been engineered to manage fan expectations, or literally stage-manage them, as if to say, this is the new Amy Schumer who's a lot like the old Amy Schumer but new nonetheless. Approaching 40 (she's 37) and motherhood, some evolution is expected and probably necessary. But the transition can't be easy - especially for Schumer.
Consider all the baggage, which a recent New York Times profile did. She's heard (and how) from some disaffected fans who were confused - or felt betrayed - by an earlier iteration of her comic self that has since been deemed racially insensitive. She found herself on the wrong side of the #MeToo revolution when she supported one of her accused male writers from "Inside Amy Schumer." She's still trying to get people to believe that the "Lemonade" video from 2016 was a tribute to Beyoncé, and not a spoof, or appropriation. Even the Times piece had to run a correction that said it had "mischaracterized" the video in an earlier version of the story.
"Growing" ignores this part of her recent past, perhaps out of necessity. She's moved on, she seems to be insisting, even if the disaffected haven't.
There are almost two shows in one here, both yoked together at the halfway mark. The more familiar Schumer arrives in the second half: Raunchy, topical, political. A familial Schumer turns up in the first half.
Unsurprisingly, she's less sure-footed over this stretch. There are riffs about pregnancy and drinking, and pregnancy and sex, and pregnancy and Meghan Markle. Change the name of the princess and you could almost imagine Midge Maisel working some of the same material.
She talks about her well-documented struggle with hyperemesis - severe nausea ("I throw up an exorcist amount everyday") and about husband, Chris Fischer, who is a chef. ("I married a chef because I'm a [expletive] genius!") She says he's on the autism spectrum - while carefully and accurately discarding the old Asperger's label - then explains that "once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me [that] all the characteristics are all the reasons I fell madly in love with him."
True love finds Amy Schumer? You heard on "Growing" first.
The flamethrower arrives in the second half. She torches a couple of senators, a new Supreme Court justice, the NFL - the usual suspects - then gets right to heart of what she does best and always will.
"One in three women will be assaulted" in their lifetime, she says. "I know how scared we are as women all the time," then adds that when she takes the subway at night then gets off at her local station, "I will run home."
Picturing Schumer on the F train may require a creative leap, but the point is important and the follow-up joke is one of the better ones of the entire special.
It's also a fleeting reminder that Schumer - married or single, in Bat suit or maternity dress - was one of the most influential comics in the world not all that long ago. In moments like this, she almost still is.

Texto completo: West Virginia is trying something new in the war on clerical sex abuse: It’s leveling its consumer protection laws against a former bishop and the state's sole diocese.

State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, has sued former Bishop Michael J. Bransfield and the Wheeling-Charleston Diocese for having “knowingly employed pedophiles."

Such a civil case — as opposed to a criminal one — has the possibility of massively opening up the church's secrets and opening up the church to liability.

His office filed its suit under West Virginia’s Consumer Credit and Protection Act, alleging on the first count that the diocese engaged in false advertising when it promised to provide “a safe learning environment” for children enrolled in its schools and camps. The second count alleges the diocese failed to “warn of dangerous services” when it employed priests that church officials knew had been credibly accused of sexual abuse “and intentionally failed to warn the purchasers of educational and recreational services.”

Morrisey's lawsuit is notable for two reasons. First, it shows a state attorney general’s office going after an entire diocese, as opposed to individual priests. We should probably expect that to become the norm.

Secondly, filing the suit under West Virginia’s consumer-protection law is an undeniably big development in law enforcement officials’ ongoing efforts to shine a light on the cancer of clerical sexual abuse, something the notoriously secretive Church itself has been unable (or unwilling) to do. By using the consumer law, West Virginia officials stand a better chance of “[unlocking] the church’s files through legal discovery,” the Washington Post explained.

The New York Times explains elsewhere, “Criminal prosecutions of individual abuse cases have often been hampered by statutes of limitation, but the West Virginia lawsuit is a civil action, and is directed at the church’s handling of the problem.”

“It’s the logical next step after the [Pennsylvania grand jury report],” Villanova University’s Charles E. Zech told the Post. “The consumer fraud is just to get the foot in the door. And then you can open up all kinds of avenues, once you’ve established that. The diocese is unwilling to provide it, this is the only way to do it.”

The lawsuit, which is the culmination of an investigation that launched back in September 2018, alleges the diocese and Bransfield, who has been barred from performing his priestly duties following an investigation into allegations he sexually abused adults, failed to disclose “the inherent danger to parents who purchased its services for their children.” The diocese also failed to conduct adequate background checks” for people employed by diocesan Catholic camps and schools, reads the attorney general's complaint. Worse, it adds, the diocese often worked to cover up the alleged abuses.

For example, the diocese covered up the abuses of Father Patrick Condron, who admitted to church officials that he had "groomed" a minor in the 1990s for “genital sexual intercourse." Condron remained in active ministry, serving at Wheeling Catholic Elementary School until 2001.

The diocese also took on a priest who even admitted on his 2002 application for employment that he had been “accused of sexual abuse of a child in 1979.”

Then there was Victor Frobas, who worked for the diocese from 1965 through 1983. Frobas came to that job even with an allegation of child sexual abuse dating back to 1962 trailing behind him. He was eventually promoted to the role of director of Camp Tygar, where he reportedly abused several children. The dioceses neither removed him nor informed the parents of his abuses. Frobas was indicted eventually in St. Louis for “inappropriate contact with two minors,” the West Virginia complaint reads. “He pled guilty and agreed to a five year prison term, of which he served about two years. Frobas died in 1993.”

"Parents who pay and entrust the Wheeling-Charleston Diocese and its schools to educate and care for their children deserve full transparency,” Morrisey said in a statement.

Author, former Colorado journalist links marijuana to mental illness

Texto completo: Alex Berenson didn’t return to Colorado to argue for pot prohibition, but people who think marijuana is medicine and a safe alternative to alcohol are fooling themselves, he said.
The industry’s money and political influence, along with the media’s acquiescence, have obscured the scientific links between marijuana and mental illness, said the author and former reporter at The New York Times and previously The Denver Post.
“The problems are real and right in front of people,” he told a crowd at the History Colorado Center in Denver on Wednesday. It was his third Colorado talk in two days to discuss his new book, “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.”
“It’s like we all need glasses. ... The connection to psychosis is real.”
Colorado voters and legislators agreed to legalize recreational marijuana provided the state do all it can to keep consumption safe. Berenson’s book questions whether that’s happening.
Critics of his work say the author tossed aside the preponderance of known science to sell books.
But most of those critics have a financial stake in the pot game, Berenson said. A public policy change isn’t the best solution, he said, but educating people about the risks is vital.
“That sounds like a cop-out, but that’s the only really good answer,” he said.
Berenson cited a new study published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal that found people who use cannabis daily are three times more likely than non-users to eventually have a psychotic episode. Those who use high-potency pot are four times more likely, and those who starting getting high before age 15 carry even more risk, the study found.
“This is more evidence that the link between cannabis and psychosis matters,” Krista M. Lisdahl, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, told National Public Radio.
Berenson’s book makes the case that not enough has been done scientifically to explore whether pot poses serious mental health risks for its users, especially younger ones.
The author, a father of two and husband of a forensic psychiatrist, said the data tells him that pot could lead to psychosis and schizophrenia for heavy users.
Yet most people have embraced marijuana as safe, if not medicinal, Berenson said.
“I was a pretty good investigative reporter, because I often saw the way companies would deceive, especially when there’s money on the line,” he said. “I mention that because I think this story of cannabis legalization is a story of deception, but it’s also sort of self-deception.”
At the Arapahoe High School talk Tuesday night in Centennial, Kent Osborn recalled how his son Tom was caught driving while impaired on pot.
After he dropped out of the University of Utah, Tom worked in a movie theater at The Streets at SouthGlenn in Centennial and stayed clean for two years while he was on probation, Osborn said.
“The first day he was off probation, he went right to a marijuana dispensary,” the father said.
A psychiatrist warned Tom that if he didn’t stay off pot, he risked developing schizophrenia. Tom Osborn later stabbed himself through the heart after his mother wouldn’t give him money to buy pot, his father said.
The only drug in his system was THC, the psychoactive chemical in pot.
“Marijuana killed my son,” Osborn said. “That’s what I have to say.”
Said Berenson, noting the public health catastrophes induced by opioids and alcohol, “I’m not sure why we think cannabis is any different. I’m not sure how we convinced ourselves of that, although ... a lot of very smart lobbying went into it.”
Audience members in Centennial booed Tuesday night when Berenson was questioned by Peter Marcus, a former Colorado Politics reporter who now represents the Boulder-based Terrapin Care Station, a national cannabis company.
Before the Colorado events, Marcus said most scientists have rejected Berenson’s methods as over-simplifying complex data to improperly link marijuana to mental illness.
Seth Boster reported Tuesday in The Gazette: “The Nation and Rolling Stone called the book ‘fear-mongering’ and ‘trolling,’ respectively. Vox wrote it off as ‘an exercise in cherry-picking data and presenting correlation as causation.’ But The Marshall Project, the nonpartisan investigative reporting center, deemed it ‘an intensively researched and passionate dissent from the now prevailing view that marijuana is relatively harmless.’”
Marcus called the book “Reefer Madness that relies on observations and anecdotes, not on rigorous scientific analysis,” referring to the 1936 movie that sensationalized the effects of marijuana use.
Berenson’s three Colorado events were sponsored by The Gazette, Colorado Politics and Children’s Hospital Colorado.

Texto completo: Su familia no tiene hogar, tras llegar a Nueva York como refugiados desde Nigeria.
Pero eso no ha sido impedimento para que con apenas 8 años de edad el niño Tanitoluwa Adewumi ganara el primer lugar en el campeonato de ajedrez del estado de Nueva York sin una sóla derrota, en su grupo de edad.
“Me gusta el pensamiento profundo”, dijo Tanitoluwa a NBC News.
El estudiante de 3er grado comenzó a jugar ajedrez hace un año y según Shawn Martínez, su entrenador en P.S. 116 (Midtown East), practica el juego de mesa todos los días durante varias horas, por su cuenta.
Tanitoluwa se mudó a la ciudad de Nueva York con su familia hace dos años como refugiados de Nigeria. Sus padres temían ataques del grupo terrorista Boko Haram y por ello están buscando asilo religioso.
La familia ha estado viviendo en un refugio para personas sin hogar y sus padres dicen que allí el niño sólo puede practicar en el suelo. Pero eso no ha detenido la inquebrantable dedicación de Tanitoluwa para mejorar su destreza en el ajedrez.
Hace uno días Tanitoluwa ganó el torneo de Ajedrez Primario del estado de Nueva York en su grupo de edad y se llevó a casa un gran trofeo para demostrarlo. “Sus ojos se iluminaron”, dijo Martínez.
Después de la victoria de Tanitoluwa, Russell Makofsky, quien supervisa el programa de ajedrez en su escuela, lanzó una página en GoFundMe para ayudar a la familia a salir del refugio.
En unos días, el esfuerzo de financiación colectiva superó su objetivo de recaudar $50 mil dólares y un donante le ofreció un apartamento a la familia. Hasta anoche, más de $180 mil dólares habían sido donados por 3,400 personas, más del triple de la meta de recaudación de fondos en tres días. Y la familia estaba lista para tener por fin su propio hogar en Nueva York.
Mientras tanto, Tanitoluwa se está preparando para el campeonato nacional en mayo. “Quiero ser el gran maestro más joven del mundo”, afirmó.
Y hasta fue entrevistado por The New York Times.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Mueller investigation. Heard of it?
After a year and 10 months of suspense, special counsel Robert Mueller is apparently nearing the end of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
It’s been a long time coming.
Thirty-four people have been indicted since Mueller opened his review in May 2017, including some of President Donald Trump's closest advisers and Russian intelligence operatives. Mueller’s investigation has already revealed many details about a sophisticated effort to influence the election and a campaign trying to benefit from that work.
But what his final report will look like remains a mystery.
Here’s your guide on what to expect from the Mueller report, whenever the moment we’ve all been waiting for arrives:
What will be in the report?
Mueller’s confidential report will explain why he filed the charges he did during the investigation, and why he might have declined to bring charges against anyone else. It could be short.
Sorry, but you probably won't see the report
After all the anticipation (and nail biting), you probably won’t get to see the Mueller report. At least for a bit.
Why? Justice Department rules require that Mueller submit a “confidential” report when his work is done. From there, his boss, Attorney General William Barr, gets to decide what happens. (Barr is the guy who will decide what the public can see, and when). The only thing Barr is required to reveal is whether Mueller’s bosses ever overruled him.
Trump has said he doesn't have a problem with the report becoming public.
More: Robert Mueller has spent two years investigating Trump, and he hasn't said a word. It's possible he never will.
Will we ever hear from Mueller himself?
Those who know him are betting on no.
Mueller isn’t required to make public statements about his work, according to Justice Department rules, so he doesn’t need to deliver a public record of his findings.
Plus, he’s stayed quiet since he was tapped in May 2017 to head the probe, despite intense public interest and scrutiny (including from the president).
Those who know Mueller say he's reluctant to speak publicly even when the circumstances seem to require it, so he's unlikely to do on his own at the end of this saga.
So, will Barr make the report public?
That's TBD.
Barr told lawmakers during his confirmation hearing in January that he wanted to be transparent, but he couldn't commit to releasing Mueller's report in full. Neither was he clear on whether he would permit Mueller to testify to Congress about his work, something Democratic lawmakers have hinted they might request. Some of what’s in the report could be information that’s required by law to remain secret. Instead, Barr has suggested he will prepare his own summary.
The claws are coming out
Congress wants to see Mueller’s findings and is preparing for a fight to see it.
Lawmakers from both parties — yes, both Republicans and Democrats — plan to press for access not just to the report but also to the evidence he gathered during the investigation. The demands would almost certainly set up a battle between Congress and the Justice Department.
More: What happens after Robert Mueller delivers his report? Congress braces for legal and political battles.
More: Rep. Adam Schiff: Democrats could sue if Robert Mueller's Russia report isn't made public
In particular, newly powerful House Democrats are exploring ways they could force the administration to turn over findings and evidence it might prefer to keep secret.
“We expect the full report," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y. , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "If we don’t get it, we’ll do what we have to do to get it. If that means subpoenaing it, we’ll subpoena it. "
Republicans have also embraced the idea of obtaining Mueller's conclusions. Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he expects a report that will reveal no wrongdoing by Trump. The House voted 420-0 in March to insist that they get a complete copy of whatever Mueller turns in.
Will that be the end?
No.
Mueller is just one of many potential legal problems for Trump and his inner circle. The list of investigations encircling the president seems to be growing by the day.
More: Michael Cohen's testimony prompts a new question: In web of Trump investigations, is anyone safe?
Both the targets and the total number of investigations is unknown, but we know various probes have examined Trump's campaign, family, charity foundation, inaugural committee and his businesses.
In New York:
The state attorney general subpoenaed two banks this week for financial records relating to several Trump Organization projects, the New York Times reported.
Federal prosecutors are still investigating campaign-finance violations within Trump's campaign even after his former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violations stemming from hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump. Cohen has said he made the payments at Trump’s direction.
Cohen said he’s been in “constant contact” with federal prosecutors in New York about other investigations, but wouldn’t elaborate.
Trump’s inaugural committee was subpoenaed in February as part of an investigation into the group’s fundraising activities.
State authorities in New York have been investigating Trump's private foundation.
In Washington and Maryland:
Attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging Trump violated the Constitution's Emolument's clause, which bans gifts and payments from foreign governments. The case could allow officials some insight into Trump's business dealings and potential conflicts of interests.
In Congress:
Lawmakers are just getting started. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee opened a sweeping investigation this month into Trump and his associates, requesting documents from 81 "agencies, entities, and individuals" connected to the administration and Trump's private businesses.
The House Oversight Committee is also examining a wide array of topics, including Trump's communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House efforts in a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, whether Trump played any part in securing top-secret security clearances for members of his family and whether Trump violated the Constitution by accepting profits from foreign governments. The Committee welcomed Cohen earlier this month, then laid out an investigative road map that could include other Trump Organization employees.
The House Intelligence Committee is expanding its own investigation of Russian election interference.

Texto completo: The Justice Department is considering whether to charge a prominent Democrat, who served as White House counsel during President Barack Obama’s first year in office, for failing to disclose work he did on behalf of Ukraine.

The lawyer, Gregory Craig, worked on behalf of the Russia-aligned government of Viktor Yanukovych in 2012.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan were considering whether to bring criminal charges against Craig last year as part of an investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The charges were referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York by special counsel Robert Mueller, CNN reported at the time.

The case was transferred to the Justice Department in January, the New York Times reported Monday. Federal prosecutors in Washington are expected to make a decision about charges in the coming weeks.

Craig would be the first Democrat to be charged in a case relating to Mueller’s investigation.

He served as White House counsel under Obama from 2009 to 2010. Craig also worked in former President Bill Clinton’s administration, helping Clinton coordinate his defense against impeachment. He joined law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP in 2010.

The investigation into Craig centered on whether he lobbied on behalf of a group linked to Ukraine without registering with the Justice Department as a foreign agent, which is required under the federal law known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Court filings alleged the law firm was solicited by Manafort on behalf of Yanukovych and the Ukrainian government's Ministry of Justice to write a report on the trial of a political rival of Yanukovych. Craig was the law firm’s partner who worked on the report and was involved in disseminating it to members of Congress and the media.

Craig left the law firm last year amid scrutiny over his connection to Manafort. Manafort was sentenced this month to seven and a half years in prison for crimes stemming from his work in Ukraine.

Skadden Arps reached a settlement with the Justice Department in January, agreeing to pay $4.6 million, in order to avoid prosecution. The law firm also had to retroactively register its work for Ukraine under FARA and cooperate with the government investigations.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is receiving the usual media condemnation for his weekend tweeting, including for his inaccurate commentary about the late Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) But reporters should acknowledge that an accurate recounting of the facts also shows ample grounds to criticize McCain's actions during his final years in office.
On Twitter, Mr. Trump criticized McCain for the 2017 breaking of his promise to support repeal of the Affordable Care Act and also for McCain's role in circulating the unverified Steele dossier with its claims of Trump-Russia collusion.
Mr. Trump tweeted that McCain embraced the dossier before the 2016 election when recent testimony suggests it was just after the election. Also, Mr. Trump claimed on Twitter that McCain finished last in his class at the U.S. Naval Academy when most reports indicate McCain actually finished fifth from the bottom.
Let's hope for more accuracy from the President in the future, but he and many other Americans seem to have every right to be angry. On Thursday Rowan Scarborough reported for the Washington Times:
David Kramer, the then-Sen. John McCain aide who leaked the discredited Christopher Steele dossier on President Trump, testified in a libel case that he spread the unsubstantiated anti-Trump material all over Washington during the presidential transition.
Mr. Kramer shared the Clinton-funded collection of unverified claims with numerous media outlets including BuzzFeed, which published it without verifying its contents. Mr. Scarborough continues:
Mr. Steele, whose mission was to sink the Trump campaign and then his presidency, believed Mr. McCain's involvement would give "the FBI additional prod to take this seriously," Mr. Kramer testified.
"I shared with [Mr. McCain] the document, and he took some time to review it, he asked me what I thought he should do, and I suggested that he provide a copy of it to the Director of the FBI and the Director of the CIA," Mr. Kramer testified.
Mr. McCain shared the document with the FBI's then-director James Comey, who had already seen it, while McCain's associate leaked it far and wide to the media. The litigation also reveals that according to Mr. Steele, one of his sources was nothing more than a viewer comment posted on CNN's website. Mr. Scarborough reports:
The libel lawsuit was brought by Russian businessman Aleksej Gubarev. Mr. Steele accused him of conducting the hacking into Democratic Party computers — a charge the Russian denied from the start.
Mr. Steele said the charge came from unsolicited information and that he tried to verify it on an internet site called CNN iReport. Mr. Steele testified that he relied on an article on XBT, Mr. Gubarev's firm, published on July 28, 2009.
Mr. Steele was asked by Mr. Gubarev's attorney, Evan Fray-Witzer, "Do you understand that they have no connection to any CNN reporters"?
"I do not," he answered.
The attorney added, "Do you understand that CNN iReports are or were nothing more than any random individuals' assertions on the internet?"
Mr. Steele: "I obviously presume that if it is on a CNN site that it has some kind of CNN status."
The dossier did not even meet the journalistic standards of CNN?
As for Mr. McCain's oft-repeated pledge to eliminate the so-called Affordable Care Act, it was the key to extending his Senate career. "In fight of his political life, McCain hammers Obamacare," said a Politico headline in 2016. The publication's Jennifer Haberkorn and Theodoric Meyer reported at the time:
John McCain is running for reelection like it's 2010.
The Arizona Republican has made his opposition to Obamacare — which dominated Senate races across the country six years ago — a central point of his campaign, by all accounts, the toughest reelection fight of his career.
... The issue helps him run to the right of his GOP primary opponent, while also taking a direct shot at his Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, who called her 2010 vote for the law the one she's "most proud about."
"I think it's a very strong issue," McCain told POLITICO about his focus on Obamacare.
It turned out to be strong enough to get him re-elected, but not strong enough to make him keep his promise.
As long as Americans remember the bravery of our military, they will recall the courage of John McCain during his captivity in the infamous "Hanoi Hilton" prison operated by the communist government of North Vietnam.
But Americans should also recognize that Mr. McCain's role in promoting unverified conspiracy theories generated by the President's political opponents was not the late senator's finest hour. And neither was his breaking of a signature campaign pledge.

Noteworthy
"Let's keep this simple. Parents who search out good schools for their children or pay tutors to instruct their children are not analogous to those who bribe crooked university staff. These are distinctions that need to be drawn. Instead, in their wandering but unceasing war on 'privilege,' the self-styled champions for social justice are vilifying parental behaviors that are more rightly regarded as normal, and even admirable.
"...It's a troubling window into the politics of resentment that so many have responded to this appalling scheme to buy indulgences from the college cartel by focusing and responding by, bizarrely, racing to condemn parents going about the mundane business of trying to help their children succeed..."

State judge: CCC lacks power over contents of local marijuana contracts

Texto completo: You might call it a spaghetti lawsuit.
Mederi, a would-be marijuana operator trying to open a retail shop in Salem, found out late last year that the city had decided not to award it a host community agreement, the contract every cannabis firm must sign with its host municipality before it can win a state license from the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission.
The company promptly sued to contest that decision, saying that Salem had acted arbitrarily, exceeded its authority, and — well, about 100 other things. Whatever might stick on the wall, right?
Luckily, we're not here to dissect the nap-inducing complexities of Mederi's claims. But just before I dozed off while skimming some filings in the case, one of the company's arguments caught my eye.
Mederi had complained in court that the other four applicants who were selected by Salem for its remaining retail pot shop slots (say that 10 times fast) had promised in their host agreements to pay the city illegally large sums of money — payments in excess of a cap in state law limiting the value of local “community impact fees" imposed on pot firms to 3 percent of each operator's annual revenue.
(Longtime friends of the newsletter may recall that we spotlighted Salem's questionable host community agreement terms last summer, plus those demanded by other communities.)
That, Mederi's lawyers said, meant the contracts were void. The company went on to name the cannabis commission as a new defendant in the case, contending the agency had a duty to reject the other four Salem agreements.
Of course, the commission last August voted against reviewing the contents of the host community agreements (or HCAs) signed by marijuana companies seeking licenses, and to instead only require a certification that each company has signed one. Four of the agency's five commissioners at the time essentially said that state marijuana law doesn't clearly give the commission the power to police such contracts, leaving their terms to be decided in negotiations between municipalities and cannabis firms.
Now, in a decision that puts new judicial weight behind the commission's decision, Essex County Superior Court Judge Timothy Q. Feeley has agreed that state law does not grant the commission explicit power to review host community agreements.
“As the [commission] argues, it has been its consistent position that it has no role under [state law] in reviewing the contents of HCAs, and the court agrees," the judge wrote in a ruling dismissing the commission as a defendant in the Mederi case. “The statute requires as part of a license application the inclusion of a certification that an HCA has been executed. The statute gives the [commission] no further role in looking beyond the certification to the contents of the HCA."
The ruling is a setback to advocates who have argued that municipalities are routinely (and unfairly) shaking down operators for large sums, and keeping smaller and disenfranchised players out of the industry. It's also a setback to the very lawmakers who came up with the cap on payments in the first place, as they have argued that the existing law already gives the commission authority over the deals.
The judge's decision doesn't completely close the door on further appeals or challenges to the commission's stance on not reviewing host community agreements, such as the one brought forward by the Massachusetts Growers Advocacy Council, but it sets a precedent that could be difficult to overcome. The commission declined to comment.
However, the commission recently voted to seek explicit authority over host community agreements from the state Legislature. And indeed, several bills are pending that would require the commission to review host community agreements, including one proposed by state Senator Julian Cyr, a Truro Democrat.
“I think it's important that local communities get to have a big say in these [marijuana] facilities," Cyr explained, “but you have to have standards around that control."
Cyr said municipalities should be free to work out the conditions under which a marijuana shop can operate within their borders, but said the state should set basic parameters, or a standardized contract, to provide consistency for businesses and local officials. He noted that the state already plays a similar role when it comes to health codes and other such regulations.
Cyr is also worried that expensive local fees could freeze out smaller companies and those participating in the state's equity and empowerment programs, which are trying to boost minorities and other entrepreneurs affected by the war on drugs.
He said the new ruling in the Salem case is “helpful," and could help prompt legislators to act on his bill.
“These are clearly businesses that are doing quite well, and there is a genuine impact on communities," Cyr said. “But on the other hand, I worry about having a very big, corporate industry here that doesn't allow for craft cultivation and entrepreneurs to succeed at a smaller scale. The law is explicit about the inclusion of certain communities, and we don't want these HCAs to be a further burden."

Privacy issue is spotlighted

Texto completo: The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies. New Jersey is not immune. More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud. Welcome to the new normal. Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age.
Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches – affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies – and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records – more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password – that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
At a hearing in Trenton last month, Gerard Keegan, vice president for state legislative affairs with CTIA, a trade association for the wireless communications industry, argued that the proposals would have unintended consequences and could undercut many of the products and services that people enjoy.
"Many news sites, online content providers, apps provide those services and products free of charge because they are supported by advertising," Keegan said.
"To force those companies to still provide those services and products to consumers who won't share identifying information with advertisers is wrong and will possibly lead to those companies' being shut down in the state."
The future of the bills remains uncertain, but their introduction reflects a growing awareness among residents and lawmakers about how information shared online can be used, abused or stolen.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said. "Make that decision carefully. Give it the thought and provide it the internal weight that it deserves."

Texto completo: ALGIERS, Algeria - Tens of thousands of Algerians packed the streets of the capital Friday in the largest protest yet against the rule of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a clear sign that they had rejected as insufficient his offer not to seek a fifth term as president.
"This wasn't even a proposal," said Chafika Kherici, a 42-year-old chemist who was there with her sister and nephew, with thousands of others in front of the city's historic main post office. "Nobody is satisfied with it. We want to be free, and we want the government to leave."
For a fourth straight week, the crowd chanted over and over that Bouteflika's time was up. The protesters said they were determined to carry on with what many called a revolution - a noisy, festive one of singing, chanting, drumming and shouting.
Bouteflika, who was paralyzed by a stroke, uses a wheelchair and has not spoken publicly in seven years, has ruled Algeria for two decades.
On Monday, his government offered a deal to quiet the protests, canceling the April presidential election scheduled for April, removing Bouteflika as a candidate, and promising a "national conference" to chart the country's future.
But the proposal would have left Bouteflika in power at least until a successor was chosen, and there was no timeline offered for that.
On Friday, the protesters gave the government their answer, shouting over and over that Bouteflika and his circle must go.
Many in the crowd said it was' simply not up to Bouteflika and his cronies to impose a solution to the country's crisis.
"We just want him to stop being our president," said Bouhalissa Narimane, a 23-year-old student. "He's clearly not going to leave until he's actually dead. They are all part of the problem. He can't be part of the solution."
"And they can't tell us who can be in the government," she added. "We decide."
Wave upon wave of youths descended the seaside capital's steeply pitched streets in tight ranks, chanting "Get rid of the clique, we'll be better off!" and "the street will never shut up" or simply, "Government, killers!"
Rows of impassive police officers stood by as the crowds surged through the streets of shabby, dust-covered buildings. "Take off your helmets, and join us," a band of youth chanted to them.
Police only looked down glumly.

Texto completo: The African-American woman who took control of an Alabama newspaper that once called for the Ku Klux Klan to "ride again" has stepped down because of continuing interference from the paper’s previous leader.
Elecia Dexter, who replaced Goodloe Sutton as publisher and editor of the Democrat-Reporter in February, told The New York Times on Friday that she was stepping down to maintain her “integrity and well-being. ”
“I would have liked it to turn out a different way, but it didn’t,” she told the newspaper. “This is a hard one because it’s sad – so much good could have come out of this. ”
Sutton, 80, sparked outrage around the country when he penned a Feb. 14 editorial calling for "the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again" to clean up Washington, D. C. , from "Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats (who) are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama. "
Goodloe Sutton: Alabama newspaper editor calls for the Ku Klux Klan to 'clean out D. C. '
‘I don’t care what they say’: Editor who called for KKK to 'ride again' won’t back down
He drew even more backlash when he doubled down on his comments in an interview with the Montgomery Advertiser.
"If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D. C. , we'd all been better off," Sutton told the Advertiser. "We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them. ”
Once a lauded newspaperman, nationally acclaimed in the 1990s for his and his wife's work in bringing down a corrupt local sheriff, Sutton’s peers in journalism stripped him of past commendations after his comments were published. State leaders resolutely condemned his comments and editorials, and local residents decried the way Sutton was representing the area to the rest of the world.
Sutton, who has worked at the paper since 1964, inherited the publication from his father. He handed over control of the Democrat-Reporter to Dexter on Feb. 21 but retained ownership of the paper.
Dexter was chosen to succeed Sutton in hopes that she would move the paper “into a new direction,” according to a press release from the Democrat-Reporter.
She told CNN that Sutton sent out an altered version of the Feb. 28 issue of the paper featuring a story defending his controversial editorial and attacking the Advertiser's reporting. Dexter also accused Sutton of interfering with Thursday's paper, the network reported.
"The decision to accept the role of Publisher/Editor of The Democrat Reporter was an honor and I have no regrets," Dexter wrote in a statement obtained by CNN. "I am not discouraged; healing will come to the wonderful and loving people here. "

Texto completo: Last September we published our first special section devoted to puzzles.
We expected positive feedback. Newspaper readers love puzzles. Just try leaving one out or replacing a popular one. You learn new cuss words.
What I didn't expect is to hear from puzzle constructors, especially local brain-game engineers. In this special section, we highlight three local cranial caretakers.
All three reached out shortly after publication of our last puzzle section, Cynthia Morris and Brian Thomas live in Spokane. Robert Morrissette lives in Coeur d'Alene. All three are passionate puzzlers with varying degrees of publishing success.
For Morris, 58, her introduction to puzzles was costly for her mom.
"She was a former schoolteacher who knew how important it is to exercise our brains every day," recalls Morris. "One year during summer break from school - I think I was about 8 - she offered to pay me $10 for every book of puzzles I completed, cover-to-cover, without peeking at the answers in the back."
Morris leaned toward acrostic puzzles, which she says "are a bit like solving a mystery, because solving the clues leads you to a quotation solution instead of just a grid filled with letters.
"I would always solve the acrostics first, and then solve the rest of the puzzles as fast as I could so my mom would buy me another puzzle book and I'd have more acrostics to solve. By the time that summer was over, I had a lot more money in my piggy bank, and I had developed what would become a lifelong affinity for word puzzles of all kinds, but especially acrostics."
Morris isn't satisfied with the status quo of acrostic puzzles. She takes the extra step of making her word list "mirror the theme" of the quotation solution.
"A hand-crafted puzzle like this takes about two days to construct," said Morris. "There are 50 puzzles in each of my volumes of acrostics and I publish two volumes a year, so I typically put in 12-hour days when I'm working on a new volume."
The long hours make it more than just a labor of love for Morris, who has published 12 volumes of puzzles with No. 13, CynAcrostics Volume 4: My Word!, on the way next month. Her books are available on her website www.acrosticsbycyn.com.
"I view puzzle construction as an art, and my goal with each puzzle I construct is to hone my craft. I've been constructing for 14 years now and I'm still learning to be a better constructor all the time, as both my skills and my understanding of what constitutes a good acrostic puzzle evolve."
Morris wrote Micronesian Blues, an account of six years living and working the far Pacific islands of Micronesia with her husband, Bryan, a university professor. The Morris' moved to Spokane in 2005 when Bryan took a position with Washington State University-Spokane.
"We were eager to get away from the crowds in Washington D.C. and back to a more natural environment," said Morris. "Spokane has a really good balance of city amenities and outdoor recreational activities.
"I not only love my work, I also get to chat online regularly with fascinating people from all over the world," said Morris. "Acrostaholics come from all walks of life - I've gotten to know musicians and woodworkers, scientists and businesspeople, fellow authors and puzzle constructors, cops and soldiers, artists and teachers, actors and newspaper columnists, historians and World War II veterans, and many others."
Like Morris, Morrissette, 56, doesn't settle for a regular crossword puzzle. From a young age, he zeroed in on unusual dimensions.
"Since I was a boy, I have been fascinated with optical illusions," said Morrissette, who has published four books on 3D crossword puzzles and optical illusions. "They boggle the mind, stretch the imagination, and make the impossible seem possible."
Morrissette has always loved books, especially those with drawings by Maurits Cornelis Escher. His bedroom walls weren't pasted with sports figures or rock stars, but rather with posters of optical illusions.
During the day, Morrissette is a computer programmer for Northern Quest Resort and Casino. In his spare time, he is a prolific puzzle constructor and writer. He published his first book in 2006 and has authored and self-published eight books ranging in topics from forgiveness, generational restoration, religion, garage sales and puzzles. He is currently working on an Instant Pot cookbook.
Morrissette said there was a bit of a learning curve to creating optical illusion puzzles. "You have to be very patient and willing to do a lot of trial and error in making words fit. There are times when you have to start over because it just didn't work."
Initially, Morrissette thought he had enough ideas to fill a book, but within two years he published four puzzle books, all available on Amazon and through his website at www.IllusionsByRob.com.
Thomas, 28, has his hands full with two young sons, but still manages to sneak in a few hours a week constructing puzzles. He has been published in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times.
"For the longest time I just assumed that there was someone at the newspapers whose job was to create a puzzle every day," said Thomas. "A few years ago I was reading something that mentioned that anyone could make and submit puzzles, so why not take a shot at it."

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."

Needless variants of predominant forms an unpleasant mistake; WORD WATCH

Texto completo: Q. Why do some people use the adverb "predominately" instead of "predominantly"? Is this an accepted usage? I saw "predominately" used in an academic journal article that I was reading just today. - Ronnie Stutes, Baton Rouge, La.
A. Cancel your subscription! Just kidding.
"Predominately" is what linguists call a "needless variant" - a word that starts out as a misrendering of another word yet soon gains common usage.
The correct word is "predominantly," but some folks mistakenly attach "ly" to the verb "predominate" to form "predominately." It doesn't help matters that "predominantly" and "predominately" sound so similar when spoken.
Even respected publications occasionally slip. The New York Times recently reported that President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines delivered "a speech that focused his ire on the Roman Catholic Church - a powerful political foil in this predominately Catholic country."
Some usage guides will tell you that "predominately" is an acceptable alternative to "predominantly." Ignore them. Using "predominately," while understandable and forgivable, smacks of carelessness and imprecision.
Q. Can you please explain the difference between "uninterested" and "disinterested"? I think there is a distinction. To wit, I am "uninterested" in the cricket scores from Queensland (I don't care about and do not follow cricket); however, if I were a judge, I would be "disinterested" in the cases before the bench (in the sense of unbiased, neutral). - David Anson, Bradenton, Fla.
A. Not interested in Australian cricket scores!? My stars! Then I won't even bother to share the exciting news that the Tasmanian Tigers defeated the Queensland Bulls by six wickets in a recent playoff game.
As for "uninterested" and "disinterested," you're completely right. An uninterested observer of a cricket match would take no interest in the match (unless, of course, a kangaroo bounded across the field), while a disinterested observer might take great interest in the match but would be neutral or impartial about its outcome.
As usage expert Bryan Garner points out, this distinct meaning of "disinterested" is worth preserving because it conveys a nuance expressed by no other word. "A disinterested observer," he explains, "is not merely 'impartial,' but has nothing to gain from taking a stand on the issue in question."
So a judge should indeed be both interested and disinterested - unless, of course, it's a kangaroo court.

THINK LIKE A LIBEL LAWYER IT'S THE BEST WAY TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN THIS ERA OF 'PICK YOUR SIDE AND STAY ON IT,' EXPLAINS LIBEL LAWYER DAVID MCCRAW

Texto completo: My job, when I am doing it right, is to please no one. I'm a press lawyer. I'm paid by The New York Times to vet stories before publication.
Think of me as a story's first and worst reader: doubtful, questioning, blind to subtlety, skeptical of the facts, regularly prodding editors and reporters to do something more or different. And if I have done my job well, many of the subjects of those same stories will be unhappy as well, but for all the reasons we want them to be: We got it right.
The basic idea of libel law is simple. A publisher can get sued for making a factual statement that proves to be false and hurts a person's reputation. For those of us charged with helping news organizations avoid libel suits, that means we learn to look at the world through the eyes of the person at the center of any tough story, often the bad guy in the tale.
I am all about the villains in many pieces - the doctor who botched the surgery, the insurance company that shafted its customers, the professor who hit on the student, the greedy industrialist who ground up workers to make a fortune. I try to look for the counternarrative that they could (and their lawyers will) build from the same set of facts. It's a counterintuitive form of reading. It's looking for the innocent explanation or the possibility that what appears to all the rest of the world to be nefarious may in fact just be a mistake made in good faith.
It's a tricky skill to take into the real world. When the guy at the grocery story with 17 items cuts in front of you in the express line, maybe you don't want to wonder whether he just honestly miscounted (17 can look a lot like 10). Or ponder the possibility that he sincerely thinks he is supposed to be counting food groups, not boxes. Or earnestly gauge the likelihood that he is a devoted father in a rush to get home to a sick and hungry child. Maybe you just want to go with irate and level a "I hope you die, sir" stare.
But for a libel lawyer, a little sympathy for the villain is almost an occupational requirement. And maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for all of us in the tribalized "pick your side and stay on it" era we are living in.
Most Times stories don't take much of a legal lift, or any at all. But my approach was never more tested than in the 2016 campaign. I had been a Times lawyer for a decade and a half by then. Week after week, I was alternatively in the tank for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, whoever happened to be the piñata on any given day, doing my part to make certain that our coverage was sound.
I have an old-school vision of the First Amendment: that journalists should tell stories straight, that readers can be trusted and that out of that process we as a country will get it right more often than not.
Libel lawyers don't serve as the fairness police. If anything, they are more like fact cops. Coverage can be wildly unfair and still be true. And that is what matters to the law. Still, as the campaign ended and the Trump administration took hold, and as much as I continued to cling to a blind faith in the power of facts, it was impossible not to get drawn into the white-hot debate over coverage in a politicized America.
It was a debate rippling across our democracy at a time when news operations were facing extraordinary financial challenges. Over the past half-decade, The Times and others had reoriented themselves to reader-centered journalism. The shift in attitude has been like opening a window after a long winter. Journalism should be done as if the readers mattered.
But in a divided America there was a risk, too - the risk that we would set our compass by what people wanted rather than giving them the journalism they needed. Among our readers, the appetite for stories that were unflattering to Mr. Trump and the people around him seemed insatiable. There were times, though, when we needed to tell other kinds of stories if we hoped to reflect the world as it was.
In late November 2016, Scott Shane of The Times' Washington bureau did a profile of Steve Bannon, at that time Mr. Trump's go-to aide. It was a well-reported piece of journalism done by the book, a profile of a newsmaker that had no ambition beyond letting readers know who this Bannon character was.
It set readers' hair on fire. Part of it was the digital headline that described Mr. Bannon as "combative" and a "populist" when many readers thought "racist," "white supremacist" or "xenophobe" might have done the trick.
If people wanted to see Mr. Bannon as a menace to America, the facts for getting there were to be found in the profile. But if readers preferred to see Mr. Bannon as an enigmatic figure with a most unlikely résumé for someone who ended up where he ended up, the article gave that narrative, too. It was discouraging that so many people apparently believed that the time-honored journalistic act of telling a story straight had become a problem and that The Times needed instead to take sides and coach readers on what to think.
Journalism is hard when people feel the failure to take sides is in and of itself a surrender. It is not an easy time to be speaking up for a journalism that follows the facts wherever they lead, even if our readers (or our president) don't want to be taken there.
By the time the profile of Mr. Bannon ran, the alt-right and its enablers had become the masters of trying to silence all the voices they found disagreeable. It was not a model I thought we should emulate. The great risk we face comes not in giving them voice but in taking their worst instincts and making them our own.
At least that is the free-press vision I tried to bring to my legal work, even as the president continued his toxic attacks on the press. But it wasn't always possible to hear the "fake news" drumbeat and shrug. In April 2017, the PR person for a gun-control group wrote to us with a strange cheeriness: "Just wanted to let you know that the NRA has released another unhinged video, this time targeting N.Y.T. Apparently, they're 'coming for you.' Happy Friday!"
The video was another release from the National Rifle Association's media outlet, NRATV, featuring its favorite over-the-top talking head, Dana Loesch, the go-to ringmaster for the group's propaganda circus. Wearing a white top offset by the all-black background of the NRATV studio, Ms. Loesch spewed out her not-quite-controlled rage about fake news, directly addressing The New York Times. "Consider this the shot across your proverbial bow," she announced. "We're going to laser-focus on your so-called honest pursuit of truth. In short, we're coming for you."
Many people at The Times found it chilling and pressed us to respond in some way. All of that was understandable. We have lived through many death threats to our people. But I questioned whether we really wanted to give the NRA and its fans the satisfaction of an official response from the company. The First Amendment gives a lot of protection even to nasty speakers. We stood down as a company. We were willing to let the hit piece fade into obscurity.
I was more than a little surprised, then, to pick up The Times a few months later and find spread across the Sunday Styles section a fairly glowing profile of none other than Dana Loesch. Online, the headline described her as "the National Rifle Association's telegenic warrior." The reporter and Ms. Loesch took what seemed like a lovely trip to the neighborhood shooting range.
I think, upon reflection, it spoke well of The Times. Ms. Loesch was a person in the news, and we write about people in the news, not just the people we agree with.
I never heard whether Ms. Loesch considered the profile fake news, but four weeks later she was once again lighting up the screen at NRATV - literally. A new video showed Ms. Loesch holding up a lighter to a copy of The New York Times. "You know, I don't even have to do this," she said. "You guys are doing a good enough job burning down your reputations all by yourselves."
Lovely.
But that is how the First Amendment works - thanks to our "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide open," as Justice William Brennan said in the landmark Times v. Sullivan case, which raised the bar for libel suits against publications. Speakers are allowed to be provocative, colorful, contradictory and wrong.
It is a beautiful thing. Bizarre some days, but still beautiful.

Texto completo: Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship this week sued a long list of national news outlets and media personalities - ranging from Fox News to MSNBC and from The Washington Post to Breitbart News - alleging they defamed him in their descriptions of the criminal mine safety conviction that landed Blankenship in federal prison for a year.
Blankenship claims that media coverage of his losing bid for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Joe Manchin amounted to "weaponized defamation that has "so smeared his reputation that he has been unable to pursue business opportunities that could have generated "returns of billions of dollars. The 33-page complaint was filed Thursday in Mingo Circuit Court, in Williamson.
Specifically, Blankenship notes repeated - and incorrect - references to him having been convicted of a felony or of manslaughter following the deaths of 29 miners in an April 5, 2010, explosion at Massey's Upper Big Branch Mine in Raleigh County.
Blankenship was convicted in December 2015 of conspiring to violate federal mine safety and health standards at the Upper Big Branch Mine in the months prior to the explosion. While he was not charged with causing the explosion, the accusations against him focused on rampant violations of longstanding safety rules - mine ventilation, dust suppression and roof control - that have been known for decades to prevent deadly underground blasts like the one that occurred at UBB.
Federal law makes violation of - or conspiracy to violate - mine safety and health standards a misdemeanor, punishable with a maximum of one year in prison.
Blankenship's complaint contains a lengthy footnote that references a recent concurring opinion in which U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called for revisiting "New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark 1964 ruling that makes it difficult for public figures to prevail in libel suits.
Blankenship is seeking damages of $12 billion, with $10 billion of that for punitive damages to "adequately punish the "massive media companies that are named as defendants.

Vigliotti: Of Bibles, faith, and the American president

Texto completo: Religious faith, particularly that of the Judeo-Christian tradition, was central to the founding of the United States of America, and religious faith remains critical to our identity, our character, and our lives to this day. Though some on the Left deny the importance of religion in American life, one need only look at the recent controversy surrounding President Trump’s signing of Bibles to be reminded otherwise.
While there is no state-established religion in the United States, Judeo-Christianity has always been established in the hearts and minds of Americans in some form or another.
John Adams believed that only a Biblically-based people could ever understand or live by the Constitution. Thomas Jefferson believed that man had a natural morality that only made sense, and was only truly expressed, through the lens of Christianity. George Washington, in his first presidential address, sought God’s intervention and blessings in the affairs and lives of Americans and the nation. Benjamin Franklin, whom many argue to be deistic, nevertheless believed God’s intervention and assistance was possible in the midst of stalemate at the Constitutional Convention.
Even often overlooked founders, from the Jewish Haym Salomon to the Catholic Charles Carroll, believed the United States of America was a land under God where their faiths could be practiced in pursuit of their own American destinies. They understood that America was an idea in becoming, one conceived in principles rooted in the faith of Judeo-Christianity.
The U.S. Constitution serves as the legal bulwark of our natural rights as American citizens. The philosophy which the Constitution practices is rooted in the Declaration of Independence, which transcribes our Judeo-Christian understanding of man as having natural rights gifted to us from God. When we talk about God, we are not talking about man’s laws or political balances. Instead, we are talking about moral truths.
Many argue that we cannot legislate morality, but what American law does not have some fundamental moral motivation at its core? If all our laws across this nation, from the most local to the federal level, can be traced back to, or are measured as being consistent with the Constitution, and the Constitution owes its existence to the principles defined in the Declaration, how can we say that there are no morally-founded laws in America?
And yet, there are still many who deny history and the evidence of our national documents to say that religion does not and cannot matter. The reasons are many, but all are somehow political, and many are self-conflicting. We have seen the debate play out sharply as sociocultural issues, with abortion and euthanasia most recently, but the president’s visit to tornado-torn Alabama has ignited a theological debate so fierce that one might mistake it for an eschatological fight over the end times.
Instead, the president signed some Bibles.
And suddenly, many of those same liberals who had once mocked and criticized small town Americans for “clinging” to their irrelevant Bibles became the champions of Biblical integrity.
The president’s decision to sign some Bibles was considered sacrilegious. It was labeled a political ploy. It was considered an affront to God and Christianity. The criticism went on.
In certain respects, it was an attempt by some on the Left to regain moral ground after the catastrophe of abortion expansion and the embrace of euthanasia.
Abortion and euthanasia aside, antisemitism is growing on the far Left. Calls for ideological war within and beyond the Democratic Party, inaugurated by so-called Democratic Socialists and Justice Democrats against moderates and liberals not far left enough, are gaining a growing number of supporters. Violent rhetoric is fast-outpacing calls for calmness.
And yet, the president signing some Bibles is the great moral scandal of the day.
I would pray that in a similar situation, any normal American of good faith in a leadership position would have signed essentially anything a victim of any tragedy asked of him or her - a shoe, a hat, a hand, a flyer, a book, or The Book. Even if not theologically correct, a simple gesture, meant to bring comfort to one in grief, a gesture done in good faith and not reprehensible or ethically questionable, certainly cannot be faulted.
I would imagine the president did not anticipate signing Bibles on his visit. If the president had refused the request, it can easily be predicted how the Left would have reacted. President Trump would be criticized for not signing the Bibles. Can one honestly imagine instead a New York Times headline that reads Trump Right to Not Sign Bibles of Disaster Victims?
And lost in the debate are the Alabamians - our fellow Americans - themselves. Those Alabamians who had suffered were suddenly not worthy of prayer or compassion, they were only political fuel. In one breath, the moral lessons of the Bible about generosity and charity for those in need were thrown out in favor of whether the president could sign a Bible.
The president was not asking for campaign contributions in exchange for autographs. He was not seated in the Oval Office for an elaborate, prime time-televised signing ceremony. He was on the ground, in person, seeing those people face to face, offering hope and simple compassion.
To be sure, there has been some honest debate on whether it is proper to add one’s name to the Bible in the manner of a signature or an autograph. And what the entire situation does prove beyond a shadow of a doubt is the central place that Judeo-Christianity retains in the American consciousness.
So if we are serious about Judeo-Christian faith in our daily lives (including our friends on the Left), then we should first try to understand and act on genuine moral motivation. After all, the president was only doing what John Adam’s Biblically-based American should.

Texto completo: By the time he was 29, Yared Getachew was the youngest captain at Ethiopian Airlines. Despite his relative youth, he had spent a decade with the carrier, eventually piloting wide-body jets that crossed continents and oceans.
Like so many of the airline's pilots before him, Getachew, who died Sunday in the crash of Flight 302, was a graduate of the Ethiopian Airlines Aviation Academy. The competitive school, which has been training pilots since 1964, has become an intrinsic part of the company's campaign to become Africa's dominant carrier.
Ethiopian, a member of global group of airlines known as the Star Alliance, is a so-called code-share partner with United Airlines, Lufthansa, El Al and many other airlines. This allows Ethiopian to book passengers on other airlines' flights and to carry their passengers. Ethiopian has aggressively established hubs in northwest and southeast sub-Saharan Africa and has added flights to Asia and the United States.
"We consider ourselves lucky to be part of this company, especially at this time of expansion and growth," said Capt. Yeshiwas Zeggeye, a pilot for Ethiopian and the president of the Ethiopian Airline Pilots Association. "It was a time when the airline expanded more than expected and being part of that growth is a very good feeling."
But the carrier suffered a blow when Flight 302, bound for Nairobi, Kenya, went down shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, killing all 157 people on board. An investigation is underway to determine why the plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, crashed into a valley southeast of the airport just minutes after takeoff.
Since the crash, Ethiopian and more than a dozen other airlines around the world have grounded the model, in part because another accident involving a Max 8, owned by Lion Air, occurred in Indonesia in October, killing 189. The Federal Aviation Administration said that the inquiry of the latest crash had just begun and that it did not have enough information to take any action.
Ethiopian Airlines' training academy, which 4,000 students pass through each year, trains not just pilots but also cabin crew, mechanics, and sales and management professionals. It draws those being groomed for jobs at Ethiopian and students from across Africa.

Piece found at Boeing 737 crash site shows jet was set to dive

Texto completo: A screw-like device found in the wreckage of the Boeing 737 Max that crashed last Sunday in Ethiopia indicates the plane was configured to dive, a piece of evidence that helped convince U.S. regulators to ground the model, a person familiar with the investigation said late Thursday night.
Federal Aviation Administration chief Daniel Elwell on Wednesday cited unspecified evidence found at the crash scene as part of the justification for the agency to reverse course and temporarily halt flights of Boeing's largest selling aircraft. Up until then, American regulators had held off as nation after nation had grounded the plane, Boeing's best-selling jet model.
The piece of evidence was a so-called jackscrew, used to set the trim that raises and lowers the plane's nose, according to the person, who requested anonymity to discuss the inquiry.
A preliminary review of the device and how it was configured at the time of the crash indicated that it was set to push down the nose, according to the person, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.
The jackscrew, combined with a newly obtained satellite flight track of the plane, convinced the FAA that there were similarities to the Oct. 29 crash of the same Max model off the coast of Indonesia. In the earlier accident, a safety feature on the Boeing aircraft was repeatedly trying to put the plane into a dive as a result of a malfunction.
All 157 people aboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 died early Sunday shortly after the plane took off. The pilot reported an unspecified problem and was trying to return to the airport. The plane crashed near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. The plane's crash-proof recorders have been sent to France to be analyzed.
The discovery of the jackscrew was earlier reported by NBC News.
Separately, The New York Times reported that doomed Ethiopian Airlines plane was in trouble almost immediately after takeoff as it lurched up and down by hundreds of feet at a time. The captain of the Boeing Co. 737 Max 8 asked in a panicky voice to turn back only three minutes into the flight as the plane accelerated to abnormal speeds, the newspaper reported, citing a person who reviewed the jet's air traffic communications.

Can liberals and conservatives unite around the college bribery scandal?

Texto completo: The college bribery scandal has rightly earned bipartisan censure.

Actresses Lori Loughlin of "Full House” and Felicity Huffman of "Desperate Housewives,” along with some four dozen others, allegedly participated in a scheme in which celebrities and CEOs conspired with coaches and SAT administrators to make sure high school students such as Loughlin’s daughter Olivia Jade Giannulli, a 19-year-old YouTuber, could make it into elite colleges.

Frank Bruni at the New York Times wrote that the “scandal is just the latest proof of a grossly uneven playing field.” Its message to kids is simple: “Just sit back and let entitlement run its course.” With a little bribery and fraud, we can all achieve our (parents') dreams.

Writing at National Review, Kevin Williamson says the fact that the story became so big reflects “how elite discourse always reflects elite interests and elite assumptions.” People who never thought getting into Yale or Stanford was important may not be shocked by the illegal steps taken by those who do.

But there’s a consensus between the Right and Left, though each side differs on the details. Some of the elite and out-of-touch upper class in America value the prestige of an education more than the education itself. The scandal is just more evidence of misaligned priorities and the loopholes our society offers to those with the money to buy them.

Last summer, before she started at the University of Southern California, Giannulli said on her YouTube channel, “I don’t really care about school.” Even before the cheating scandal, the backlash was bad enough that she released a new video to apologize for her “super ignorant and stupid” comments.

“It totally came across that I’m ungrateful for college … And it just kind of made it seem like I don’t care, I just want to brush it off. I’m just gonna be successful at YouTube and not have to worry about school,” she said. “I’m really disappointed in myself.”

Olivia Jade’s parents were both accused of paying $500,000 for their daughters to get into school as crew team recruits even though neither of them rowed. They had surely heard her express her distaste for education before they allegedly broke the law just so their daughters could party at USC.

But like bureaucracies, elites in America have to self-perpetuate. And to do so, they have to attend the right schools. Neither the Left nor the Right is particularly shocked that this is the case, and they can both agree that our collective attitude toward education must change.

The FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, Joseph Bonavolonta, said, “Everyone charged here today had a role in fostering a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for students trying to get into these schools the right way through hard work, good grades and community service.”

This type of scandal, the largest case of admissions bribery at elite schools, just shows what happens when your culture values image over education.

Social justice is coming for Beto O’Rourke’s head

Texto completo: Up to now, the national news media have only asked Beto O’Rourke “why are you so handsome?” and “how are you so cool?” So it’s unclear if he understands the beast that’s waiting to eat him alive.

We call it the social justice movement.

O’Rourke only announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday. By the next day, the grievance troops that form the movement had already begun their work. Noting O’Rourke’s three-minute web video declaring his campaign, a New York Times article described how they “were put off by how his campaign deployed an age-old trope in American political theater — the silent, supportive wife.”

Audrey Gelman, CEO of the women-focused “The Wing,” complained about O’Rourke’s silent wife Amy on Twitter. “I am so sick of wives being forced to silently gaze!!! why even include her?” she wrote.

Liberal activist Jamira Burley tweeted, “Sooooo Beto had his wife sit next to him in a more than 3min video, only for her to hold his hand and smile for the camera.”

In the sticky sweet Vanity Fair profile that accompanied his campaign announcement, O’Rourke said he was “born” to be in the race, which, according to the Times, exposed his white privilege, as “detractors pointed out that prominent black Democrats who lost their 2018 campaigns — including Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida — are not running for president.”

This is just the beginning. A CNN poll last week showed that there was “a lot of ambivalence” among Democrat voters in Iowa about the possibility of nominating a straight white male. Almost a quarter of them said a straight white male would not be a satisfactory nominee, with another 40 percent saying they were unsure about that frightening prospect.

Sorry, Beto, but unless you can somehow become a black lesbian, this is what you're up against.

Artist Carrie Mae Weems finds a home away from home at Grace Farms

Texto completo: One of the nation’s most influential artists of the last 30 years is coming to the Grace Farms center in New Canaan.
She is Carrie Mae Weems and if the name rings a bell but doesn’t conjure a clear image, that is because Weems is multi-dimensional. At first a dancer, she gained breakout fame as a photographer, most notably for her “Kitchen Table Series,” a collection of 20 staged photos with text first exhibited in 1990.
But her repertoire also embraces video art, performance art, public art projects and public speaking. She has been described as a crossover figure, bridging the gap between art and politics. A recent New York Times profile summed up the unsummable, asserting that Weems has entered “the cultural mythosphere.”
The winner of a MacArthur “genius” Fellowship, in 2014 she was the first African-American woman to have a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. She appeared as herself in Spike Lee’s Netflix series, “She’s Gotta Have it,” and has been cited as an influence on Beyonce’s storytelling “Lemonade” videos.
A hallmark of Weems’ own photography is to insert herself as a viewer into her pictures as she did in “Scenes & Take,” a recent series shot of the sets of hit television shows like “Empire” and “Scandal.” Many of Weems’ videos can be seen on her YouTube channel.
At Grace Farms’ Sanctuary on Saturday, March 23, Weems will appear as the narrator in “Past Tense,” her retelling in music, video and text of “Antigone,” Sophocles’ tragedy about a woman who sacrifices herself for the right to bury her slain brother.
First performed at the Onassis Cultural Center in New York in 2016, it is her response to the police shootings that gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. It was a companion of sorts to “Grace Notes: Reflections for Now,” a performance piece inspired by President Obama’s singing of Amazing Grace at the memorial service for victims of the mass shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C.
Weems’ visit to Grace Farms will not be limited to the two evenings of lecture and performance. She also will use it as a base to create a new work that may debut next year at the Park Avenue Armory.
She won’t be living in New Canaan as a true artist in residence would. Instead, Weems who resides in Syracuse and Brooklyn, will return often to work with as yet unidentified co-creators, says Pamela Ruggio, the arts initiative curator at Grace Farms.
The very landscape and architecture of Grace Farms is designed to encourage collaboration, or “convenings,” that bring together many minds, Ruggio says. She and Kenyon Victor Adams, founding arts initiative director and consulting co-curator, first approached Weems in mid-2017. “She is an artist we had on our minds. She’s asking complex and difficult questions,” Ruggio says.
In a blog post, Adams, who in February was named executive director of the Louis Armstrong House Museum in Queens, wrote that Weems' methods and concerns align with those of Grace Farms. In fact, her residency is part of new round of initiatives that will address issues of modern slavery, wildlife poaching and trauma recovery.
Ruggio says that whatever work emerges from Weems’ residency will likely flow from her continuing exploration of the history of violence in the U.S. and a mass project that concluded her 2017 residency at the Park Avenue Armory. Titled “The Shape of Things,” the day-long event featured talks and performances by dozens of artists and thinkers.
Weems’ visit will not be accompanied by a traditional exhibit. But Ruggio expects to put a collection of books related to Weems and her collaborators in the Grace Farms’ library. There may also be a link to Weems’ own website, carriemaeweems.net, which has an illustrated timeline of her life and work.
She was born in Portland, Ore., in 1953, had her first and only child at age 16, and got her first camera in 1973. She was living in Northampton, Mass., and teaching at Hampshire College when she made her “Kitchen Table Series,” according to an article about the 2016 publication of the series as a stand alone book.
Considered a major work of American art, it can be read almost like a book even in a museum gallery, where the viewer walks past the mostly wordless chapters. Last year it was on display at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In the black and white photos, Weems casts herself as the protagonist of the story, acting a woman’s part. It is at once intimate and detached, specific and universal.

Texto completo: It was a momentous vote for the United Methodist Church, as the future of the country's second-largest Protestant church hung in the balance. In a former football stadium in St. Louis last month, church officials and lay leaders from around the world voted to strengthen their ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy, a decision that could now split the church.
But at least four ballots were cast by individuals who were not authorized to vote, according to interviews and a review of the church's records. The individuals were from African delegations whose votes were critical to restricting the church's rules on homosexuality.
The final 54-vote margin against gay clergy and same-sex marriage exceeds the number of unauthorized votes discovered so far. But the voting irregularities raised questions about the process behind the divisive decision, which devastated progressive members. Some have discussed leaving the denomination and possibly creating a new alliance for gay-friendly churches.
Church leaders are now discussing whether new votes should be called, Bishop Thomas J. Bickerton, who serves on the commission on the general conference, said in a phone interview.
"The findings that have come out have caused a serious impact on issues of trust and integrity about the whole process," he said.
A query by The New York Times last week prompted church officials to hire a consulting firm to examine whether people who were ineligible may have received credentials to vote at the church's general conference.
Church leaders who oversaw the conference said in a statement that the audit showed it was "possible that a very limited number of ineligible persons" had participated. These people were denied credentials by staff at the conference, the officials said, but were later able to procure them.
The Times found additional irregularities. For example, two delegates from South Congo, a church district in the Democratic Republic of Congo, are listed on the official attendance records. But they never traveled to the United States for the conference because of visa issues, according to a phone interview with one of the delegates and a message sent by the other to Rev. Kalaba Chali, an official translator for the conference, who did not support the decision to strengthen the ban on gay clergy. In addition, three people voted as delegates for South Congo but their names are absent from conference attendance logs and delegate election records.
One unauthorized delegate was Philippe Kasap Kachez, whose father is Bishop Kasap Owan, a prominent opponent of gay clergy. Three Methodists from the Congo region identified Mr. Kasap Kachez to The Times as a voter seated on the floor. Mr. Chali spoke with him in St. Louis and asked why he was present.
"He said he did not go to a Methodist church in Congo; instead he lives in Brussels," Mr. Chali said in a phone interview. "He said, 'I came here because my dad asked me to come vote against the lesbians."'
When contacted on Facebook and WhatsApp, Mr. Kasap Kachez declined to comment. Bishop Kasap Owan did not respond to questions.
"To learn that there were irregularities in the voting is distressing and of great concern," said Bishop Kenneth H. Carter, the president of the Council of Bishops, said in an interview on Thursday.
When asked what these findings meant for the result of the vote of the general conference, the Rev. Gary W. Graves, secretary of the conference, said, "That is a matter that would still be under review."
The United Methodist Church has detailed strict rules for how to conduct important votes, such as the one last month on gay clergy.
The church worldwide is divided into geographical units, called "annual conferences." Each one elects delegates to the church's global meetings, called "general conferences," and it also elects "reserves" in case a delegate is not able to attend. The list of delegates and the reserves for each region is published at the start of the general conference.
In the rare event that neither delegates nor reserves can attend, an annual conference can send a different individual, but only if that person was elected as an alternate for the process that elects bishops. Even then, those reserves would have to have followed the proper registration procedures to be allowed onto the floor.
There are no exceptions to this rule, which is codified in the church's Book of Discipline.
Experts in Methodist governance say it would be highly unusual for a delegate to be allowed on the floor who was not listed publicly as a delegate or reserve at the start of the general conference.
But there were examples of discrepancies between who voted and who was listed as eligible to vote.
Germain Unda Mupasa said in a phone interview that he was a delegate for East Congo, where his father is Bishop Gabriel Yemba Unda. His name is on the attendance record, but not on the authorized list of delegates or reserves. Records on the United Methodist website show that he was not elected as a delegate or alternate when the church community in East Congo decided its delegation last year.
"If my name was not on that list, it means my name was missed," Mr. Mupasa said. "In Africa, we can have many reserves, because there are visa issues."
Hassa Satshishinga Suzanne Malandji was listed as an elected reserve delegate for Lukoshi, another church district in Africa, but she told The Times she was a delegate for South Congo. She said that she supported the vote outcome because "we have the responsibility to do what the Bible says."
Voting integrity matters not just for the outcome of the vote, but for the fair representation of all churches. Some delegations, like South Congo, had delegates who could not travel because of visa issues. But in several cases, to abide by the rules, delegations like North Katanga, also a church district in Congo, voted with fewer than their allotted delegates, according to attendance records.
Church law does not allow proxy votes, and only elected reserves can replace absent delegates.
The United Methodist legal structure does not have a clear procedure on how to investigate or adjudicate improper election activity. The relevant ethics committee does not have jurisdiction when the general conference is not in session.
The system itself has not had to ask itself these types of questions, said Laceye Warner, a professor of Methodist studies at Duke Divinity School.
"The polity of the United Methodist Church presumes trust," she said. "The last several years, the ethos of the denomination has been characterized more by mistrust and misunderstanding."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Afghanistan's national security adviser on Thursday accused the American special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, of seeking personal benefit by sidelining the Afghan government during peace talks with the Taliban in a broadside in which he raised concerns about "a deal that doesn't end in peace."
The comments by Hamdullah Mohib, a senior Afghan government official, displayed Kabul's high distrust of the Taliban just as negotiators edged closer to an agreement on at least one major element of a final deal: preventing more terrorist attacks from being launched from Afghanistan.
Mr. Khalilzad was expected to brief military and diplomatic officials on the offer in meetings in Washington on Thursday and Friday. The Afghan government has not been part of the discussions because the Taliban refuses to meet with its representatives.
Speaking to a small group of journalists in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Mohib said that Mr. Khalilzad and other American diplomats involved in the talks had dribbled out only "bits and pieces" of the negotiations to the Afghan government.
"We don't have the kind of transparency we should have," he said.
The talks, Mr. Mohib said, are "increasing the legitimacy of the Taliban" and "decreasing the legitimacy of the Afghan government."
"We have sacrificed a hell of a lot," Mr. Mohib said. "What we're getting is a deal that doesn't end in peace."
He also suggested that Mr. Khalilzad had sidelined Afghan leaders because of his ambitions to be a "viceroy" in an interim government if the negotiations succeed.
"We see our relationship being impacted by what is going on, and we would like to rescue it," Mr. Mohib said.
A spokesman for the State Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.
American officials have long insisted that Washington will not accept a peace deal with the Taliban without direct talks between the extremist group and the Afghan government.
Before it was ousted in 2001, the Taliban controlled broad areas of Afghanistan, imposing harsh religious laws on its residents. The group has been accused of human rights violations and kept women from attending school.
In a separate meeting with The New York Times on Tuesday, Mr. Mohib said that any agreement with the Taliban that could lead to diminished freedoms for Afghan women would be a "red line" for the government in Kabul. Nor, he said, would Afghan leaders consider ceding administrative control to the Taliban in areas of the country -- mostly in the south -- that American auditors have concluded the extremists already either control or influence.
The negotiations between the Taliban and the American diplomats are expected to resume in the coming weeks; the latest round wrapped up on Tuesday in Qatar after two weeks.
In testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was "encouraged" by the latest round of peace talks. He also said the American military's recent increase in attacks on Taliban leadership had helped bring the group to the table.
"I think we're all cautiously optimistic that there is, for the first time, serious inroads made into reconciliations," General Dunford said, praising Mr. Khalilzad by name.
But for the Afghan military, which is fighting alongside American troops, Mr. Mohib said the negotiations, absent the Afghan government, have sown a level of mistrust among the ranks. Tens of thousands of Afghans have died since the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. Since 2014 alone, more than 30,000 Afghan troops have died fighting the Taliban.
"How do I convince my security forces they're not being sold out?" Mr. Mohib said.

Axne questions Wells Fargo on jobs

Texto completo: While Wells Fargo blamed declining workload when it announced hundreds of local layoffs late last year, U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne said the company appeared to be shipping American jobs overseas.
Axne, D-Iowa, questioned Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan during his testimony Tuesday in front of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. Sloan endured bipartisan criticism for the bank's handling of multiple scandals dating back to the 2016 revelation that the company opened 3.5 million bank accounts without customer authorization to meet aggressive sales goals.
The bank announced in November that it would eliminate 400 jobs in central Iowa as part of a national effort to reduce employment by as many as 26,500 jobs over three years.
But Axne said her office was contacted by a laid-off worker in Des Moines who was told on multiple occasions that her job was being moved to India. That employee requested funding from the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, a federal aid plan for workers who lose work or wages as a result of increased imports. In her petition for aid, the employee said Wells Fargo mortgage claims employees traveled to India to train their replacements.
"Are these recent layoffs really just you moving jobs overseas?" Axne asked the CEO.
"No," Sloan answered, "that's incorrect."
Axne noted that Wells Fargo continues to add jobs in other countries even as it cuts U.S. workers. She pointed to reports that the company has added more than 10,000 employees in India and the Philippines with plans to hire as many as 7,000 more Filipino workers.
"Can we expect that more of your planned layoffs are going to be jobs moved overseas?" she asked during the hearing.
"No, I don't believe that's going to be the case," Sloan said. He said the bank has 20,000 job openings — 90 percent of which are located in the United States.
With about 14,000 workers, Wells Fargo is the single largest private employer in the Des Moines metro area. Iowa's capital city is home to the bank's home-mortgage division and the company's third-largest concentration of workers, behind only Charlotte and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Axne, who said she wants to see the bank keep a steady employment base in Des Moines, was not satisfied with Sloan's answers.
"We're still laying people off in our own backyard in this country when we're shipping thousands of jobs over to another country," she said in an interview with the Des Moines Register. "I think we need to keep the jobs here."
She said she will investigate further to find out if the company has allowed laid-off workers to receive support under the federal Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which provides financial support and job training assistance.
Steve Carlson, a local Wells Fargo spokesman, said the Iowa layoffs were part of a larger company effort to evolve as more customers move to digital banking and self-service systems.
He also said improvements in the housing economy and lower customer delinquency had reduced the volume of claims handled by Des Moines workers by nearly 70 percent.
Carlson said the company would continue to look for "opportunities to streamline operations."
"This includes transitioning some work to different U.S. locations, and, in certain cases, our international locations to leverage a full 24-hour business cycle," he said Wednesday. "It's difficult to specifically correlate the reductions in the U.S. with the work being done in our international locations."
Carlson said the 400 affected employees who received pre-notices in November remain on the bank payroll and will for 60 days after their positions are eliminated. After that time, they will receive pay and medical benefits for a time period based on years of service.
About one-third of those who received pre-notices already found new roles within the company, Carlson said.
In Tuesday's hearing, Axne pointed to a New York Times story that found continued pressure on employees to squeeze money out of customers. The story quoted a Des Moines worker who said a "general fear of retaliation for speaking out" still exists.
Sloan told the committee the story was "patently not true" and said retaliation has no place at Wells Fargo.
Axne told the Register the company has created a "culture of stress" for workers in Des Moines. She said the bank had ended an aggressive incentive-based performance structure only to replace it with a framework that threatens workers with termination if they do not meet certain goals.
"So I am concerned that there are still issues with the company," she said, "because the employees are absolutely coming to the table saying so."
Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, has been engulfed in scandals since the fake account scheme was discovered. It sold auto insurance and other financial products to customers who didn't need them, charged service members higher rates on loans than allowed by law and improperly sold complex financial products to retail investors.
At the hearing, several lawmakers noted that Wells Fargo had been fined by every agency it is accountable to, and Sloan said the bank was currently under 14 consent decrees with those agencies.
Sloan testified that the bank was compensating customers who had been harmed, strengthening risk management and internal controls, and improving its culture.
Committee Chair Maxine Waters criticized what she called the bank's "ongoing lawlessness." She said the bank, which touts 260,000 employees and $1.9 trillion in assets, had grown "too big to manage," a major theme of the hearing.
Axne told the Register she's unsure whether the bank needs to be broken up. But she said she will continue to investigate the 400 layoffs in Des Moines and whether the bank has provided the proper assistance for those employees.
More broadly, she said Sloan's testimony that the bank had turned things around and improved its culture belied reports from front-line workers.
"It leads me to believe that we're not hearing the full truth with this," she said.
The Associated Press contributed to this story.

Texto completo: Beto O'Rourke announced his candidacy for president Thursday, following months of speculation after he lost a Senate seat in Texas.
Democrats need Beto, even though he embodies what they 'hate'
By Allie Beth Stuckey
Robert "Beto" O'Rourke should worry Republicans. With less baggage than Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren; more name recognition than Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg; greater likability than Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker; and better media support than former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, O'Rourke might just be a force to be reckoned with. Plus, he has gotten a few other unique things going for him.
Like most liberal candidates, he’s appealing to young voters. O'Rourke, 46, won 71 percent of the millennial vote in his unsuccessful Texas Senate campaign last year. But his age and his apparent "relatability" might be able to mobilize even more young people than older, experienced candidates like Biden. Seeing as millennials are soon to be the largest voting bloc, securing their widespread support is key.

O'Rourke might also be able to gain support from a more unlikely group: white evangelicals, many of whom seem to be increasingly sympathetic toward the leftist position on border policy and refugees. He was a guest on the podcast of Jen Hatmaker, a popular Christian influencer whose audience is largely made up this demographic. The New York Times ran a piece in October on the appeal he has to previously conservative evangelical women. This group, though typically Republican, could help lead Democrats to a 2020 victory.
Lastly, O’Rourke is from Texas. Democrats want Texas. If Democrats are able to flip the state the way they flipped California and Colorado, they can count on dominance for years to come. O'Rourke might have lost the senatorial election to Sen. Ted Cruz, but only narrowly. He could pick up more traction in a presidential race, which could be enough to win the state.
Of course, without these things, O'Rourke is a terrible candidate. He's inexperienced, professionally and politically unaccomplished, and is unable to accurately articulate his policy positions. He embodies everything the left says it hates: white, male, rich privilege.
Even so, for Democrats, the question isn't whether he or any of their candidates embody their values, or even whether or not any of them would make a good president. The only question is: Can the candidate beat President Donald Trump? For O'Rourke, the answer is, probably, yes.
Allie Beth Stuckey is the host of the podcast "Relatable," where she analyzes news, culture and politics. You can follow her on Twitter: @conservmillen.
What others are saying
Julian Zelizer, CNN. com: "As Beto O'Rourke enters the crowded field of Democrats running for president, the party's voters face a key question: Should they opt for the 'safe choice' — the candidate with the most experience, the most moderate positions and the one least likely to ruffle feathers by advocating controversial stances — or opt for someone such as the former congressman from Texas who might be perceived as riskier. . . . The best bet is anything but clear-cut. Democrats should not assume one candidate has a better chance than the other because he or she is the most conventional or risk-averse. "
Jennifer Rubin, The Washington Post: "The question for O'Rourke, the Democrats and the country is whether he has the discipline and tenacity needed for a long campaign. We don’t yet know if he has enough humility to know what he doesn’t know and learn what he needs to. He thinks he can reinvent presidential campaigning. Maybe he can. Maybe voters don’t so much care about policy proposals and ideological labels. Maybe they simply want to stop feeling angry and anxious. "
Nate Silver, Twitter: "(Out-of-state House moderates endorsing O'Rourke is) probably not great for Joe Biden, but there could also be some generational divides. I'd expect Beto to do well among relatively moderate members of Congress in swing/suburban districts first elected in the past couple of cycles. And Biden to do well among the old guard. "
What our readers are saying
Interesting move by Beto O'Rourke. I think he is running for the experience and, in essence, is auditioning to be the vice president on the Democratic ticket for 2020. O'Rourke is a rock star with the millennial group and would balance out the ticket if paired with a more experienced candidate. He is young enough to be patient for his turn down the road. Make no mistake, O'Rourke is a powerful weapon. He surprised the world with how well he competed against Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas.
— Martin Lopez
How did running for a bigger office work for O'Rourke in Texas? He couldn't beat Cruz, and O'Rourke had basically free media-induced commercials for the whole of his campaign and tons of support from Hollywood and others. He should've stayed in Congress longer and learned more about things before taking this step. There's too many people running.
— Matthew Brogowski
Bringing this country together means meeting conservatives halfway, in the center. It means bipartisan cooperation and seeking common ground. As an independent centrist who voted third party in the last election, I'm listening to O'Rourke. What is the plan? How is he fundamentally different than the pack?
— Debbie Latimer O'Neill

Yes, Trump is a target of ‘harassment’

Texto completo: President Donald Trump often complains that he is the victim of "presidential harassment" — or, as he sometimes puts it, "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" The president’s adversaries, of course, dismiss his protests as self-interested whining. But the fact is, Trump has a point. He is the target of an extraordinary combination not just of federal law enforcement and congressional probes, but a long list of less-discussed but potentially consequential investigations by state and local prosecutors and regulators. Together, it adds up to a pile-on of unprecedented proportions — by and large the work of blue-state Democrats.
Recently the New York State Department of Financial Services, the agency that regulates the insurance business, issued what The New York Times called an "expansive subpoena" to Aon, the insurance broker for the president’s companies. The agency leapt into action after former Trump fixer Michael Cohen told the House that Trump had at some point inflated his assets to an insurance company. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and faces serious questions about the truthfulness of his latest testimony, supplied no details. None were needed. "The subpoena that was served on Aon contains no indication that the company or any of its employees engaged in misconduct," the Times reported. "Nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry by state regulators." Also in New York, the State Department of Taxation and Finance announced last October that it is investigating Trump’s taxes going back at least 20 years.
Speaking of state law enforcement, the recent New York attorney general race was virtually a contest to see which candidate could vow to go after Trump the most aggressively. Outside of New York, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia are suing Trump, accusing him of violating the emoluments clause of the Constitution. Then there is the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan. Prosecutors there are said to be investigating the Trump Organization’s finances, the funding of the Trump inauguration, and the funding of the Trump super PAC Rebuilding America Now. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have long viewed Trump’s tax returns as a sort of Holy Grail of Trump investigations. Beyond that, there is the House Judiciary Committee’s recent decision to demand documents from 81 people associated with Trump — a request so wide-ranging that even some Democrats worry that their party’s investigators have overreached.
The point is, the scrutiny directed at the president from all sides — not oversight of his administration or even investigations into his election — so far exceeds anything in the past that it could well qualify as presidential harassment. Democrats would no doubt respond that Trump is singularly corrupt, or that he brought it all on himself. He did not. What has happened is that Democrats, in Congress and in some key blue states, saw investigation as a way to weaken a president they never thought would be elected and want to ensure is not re-elected in 2020. And Trump, with the most extensive business history ever brought to the presidency, presented a lot of avenues of investigation. When he complains about harassment, he has a legitimate case to make.

Texto completo: "If we had a mulligan, we'd
do it all over again."
Ed Stack
Dick's CEO
Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports. The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
It is unknown if the list of 125 stories includes any in the Southern Tier.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store. The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.
Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market. On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102.6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3.1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores — including ones in Binghamton, Vestal, Horseheads and Ithaca — along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores (including one in Big Flats), according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown Business Council for gun safety.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd
do it all over again."

Texto completo: BY ANTHONY FRENZEL
Tony.frenzel@thmedia.com
Angel and Marc Chernoff are best-selling authors, life coaches and bloggers who've reached hundreds of thousands of people with their advice and inspiration.
The origin of all that, though, is one that just about anyone can relate to: Loss, grief and learning to cope in a healthy way.
And that's the message they're bringing to Dubuque when they make a free appearance as part of the You Inspire Me series on Thursday, March 21, at the Hotel Julien Dubuque.
The series, organized by Jeff Lenhart, brings inspirational speakers and authors to Dubuque to share their messages. Much like prior speakers Will Bowen, Leon Logothetis, Garth Callaghan, Orly Wahba, Kim Dinan, Kute Blackson, Matthew Dowd and Carrie Morgridge, the Chernoffs have waived their appearance fee in order to spread their message.
"We were in our late 20s at the time and doing reasonably well," Marc said in a phone interview. "Then, we ran into a series of adversities that hit us back-to-back-to-back. One of those things was the loss of a mutual best friend when he was just 27 years old. Then, a few weeks after that, Angel's older brother took his own life. We were trying to cope with that and we weren't doing a good job of it."
Add in that this was happening during the Great Recession, and it becomes the picture of a struggle many people face in their lives. The most important question, though, is how you handle, according to Angel.
At the time, rather than "having the conversations they should have been having," they avoided dealing with their issues with TV binge-watching, alcohol and avoiding one another.
"We were struggling emotionally and financially," Marc said.
Starting with seeing therapists, the Florida couple eventually came to the conclusion that they needed some public accountability to keep them on task and honest in how they dealt with their problems.
The result was a blog, "Marc & Angel Hack Life." They started out writing about their story and the principles to which they were trying to stay accountable.
"People started reading and sharing on social media," Marc said. "Twitter and Facebook were just starting to take off as platforms. People were saying, 'Hey, I really resonate with your story. Let me tell you my story. What do you think I should do?' We basically started a free, online support group. The blog slowly transitioned into that, too."
That path led them to writing a book. "Getting Back to Happy" is a New York Times best-seller, and they will sign copies at the event. It's available at B-1 Yoga Studio, Ignite Power Yoga Studio, online and at most independent bookstores.
They also began teaching courses, coaching people one-on-one and doing live events.
"It's been a journey but it all started out of personal necessity," Marc said.
Angel emphasized that through that process, they've both remained very grounded thanks to their message and work.
"It happened very slowly," Angel said. "It's something we've been working on for many many years. As much a success as people might think we have, we still very much enjoy conversation with people and with our clients. That's what keeps us doing the work, is hearing the stories. Each and every one of us have a story that changed the trajectory of our lives. It's a continuous work in progress."
Marc agreed.
"I think the coaching and the live events keep you grounded," he said. "It might sound cliche, but some of the greatest people we've met are people we coach on a regular basis. The people who are willing to tear down their walls."
The trip also is a chance for them to check an item off their bucket list. One of their goals is to visit every state, and this will be their first opportunity to visit Iowa. A friend who will accompany them is particularly hoping to hit the slopes.
"It's funny that you guys want the winter to be over, and we want it to be still going on," Angel said, laughing. "We're excited to see the community and do new things. We just want to be a local for a couple days."

Trump ordena suspender vuelos de Boeing 737 como el que se estrelló en Etiopía

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo que firmará una orden de emergencia para aterrizar todos los vuelos de aviones Boeing 737 Max 8 y 737 Max 9 de las aerolíneas estadounidenses.
De este modo, cualquier avión similar al que se estrelló en Etiopía que actualmente se encuentre en el aire irá a su destino y se mantendrá en tierra hasta nuevo aviso.
“Esos aviones serán aterrizados de inmediato “, dijo Trump en la Casa Blanca. “La seguridad es nuestra principal preocupación” .
Estados Unidos fue la única nación que pilotea aviones Boeing 737, después de que Canadá anunció el miércoles que estaba aterrizando dichas naves. Esta decisión afectaría, aún indeterminadamente, vuelos programados.
La Unión Europea y varios países ya habían tomado la decisión el fin de semana de retirar las aeronaves mencionadas, pero el CEO del fabricante de aviones buscaba evitar que el presidente Trump tomada una decisión similar, luego del siniestro con una aeronave de de Ethiopian Airlines.
Dennis Muilenburg , director ejecutivo de Boeing, con sede en Chicago, habló con el presidente Trump por teléfono el martes por la mañana para evitar que sus aviones fueran retirados, informó The New York Times.
El Times citó a dos personas familiarizadas con la llamada, sobre lo cual Muilenburg afirmó que expresó al mandatario estadounidense que las aeronaves eran seguras.
Desde el fin de semana, el valor de las acciones de Boeing se han desplomado y se espera que bajen más tras el anuncio del presidente Trump.
El martes, el presidente Trump abogó por aviones “más simples”, pero no habló de suspender las operaciones de los Boeing.
“Los aviones se están volviendo demasiado difíciles para volar. Ya no se necesitan pilotos, sino científicos informáticos del MIT”, dijo en su cuenta en Twitter, en referencia al Instituto de Tecnología de Massachusetts. “Lo he visto todo el tiempo con varios productos… siempre buscando pasos innecesarios…”
Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are….
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
“Las decisiones en décimas de segundo son necesarias y la complejidad crea peligro. Todo esto por un gran costo pero muy pocos beneficios. No sé tú, pero yo no quiero que Albert Einstein sea mi piloto. ¡Quiero excelentes profesionales de vuelo que puedan tomar el control de un avión de forma fácil y rápida!”, afirmó.
….needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2019
El siniestro en Etiopía murieron 157 personas; se reportó que las víctimas son de al menos 35 nacionalidades, incluyendo al menos un estadounidense y 18 canadienses, algunos de los cuales viajaban a ese país a buscar sus orígenes, ya que sus familiares migraron a Estados Unidos hace varios años.

Texto completo: A whirlwind of excitement swept through TD Garden Wednesday night, where hundreds of high school students cheered for their teams in the state basketball tournament.
Against this backdrop, the uproar over a nationwide college admissions scandal seemed like a world away. Many students interviewed by the Globe said they were either unaware of the issue or not thinking about it on such a big night.
But a couple of students said they were dismayed about the scheme in which wealthy parents allegedly bribed a college consultant, coaches and others to get their children into top colleges.
“I think it is very insane that someone could take advantage of a school system like that, while we're out here, paying all of that money, going into debt, " said Hunter Realini, a senior who has been accepted to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
“I'm not surprised honestly that wealthy people are doing this because I feel they do a lot of shady things and there's a lot of corruption and I'm glad that this is coming to justice," said Bella Martin, a high school junior, who is thinking of applying to American University and George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
Other students who recently went through the college application process, the outright flaunting of wealth for a spot at an elite university was a slap in the face.
“It's discouraging," said Kendra Allen-Gerald, 18, a senior at New Mission High School in Hyde Park. “These people have all these resources to buy their kids' way into college and to pay for it, when there are so many kids who don't have a way to pay for it even if they get into those schools."
“I think how brazen it was is kind of insulting," said Josh Solomon-Culp, a second-year student at Northeastern University who hails from Albany, Calif. “With how widespread it was, it definitely does feel like a slap in the face."
The scheme allegedly centered on California businessman William “Rick" Singer, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy and other charges Tuesday in federal court in Boston. Singer used two main ways to give his clients' children a leg up: by fixing their SAT or ACT scores to submit to colleges, and by bribing sports coaches to recruit them. Singer was paid anywhere between $100,000 and $6.5 million, but the majority of parents paid him between $250,000 and $400,000 per student, officials said.
RELATED: Here's how the nationwide college bribery plot worked
For Allen-Gerald, she feels the sting doubly. Growing up, she says, her parents were not involved in her education.
“I only had the people at my schools," she said.
After her GPA took a nosedive in her first two years at Boston Latin Academy, she transferred to New Mission, where she pushed herself to bring up her grades before applying to college.
It paid off: She doubled her GPA, she said, from a 1.4 to 2.8, and focused on studying for the SAT, where she earned a score of 1220 out of 1600.
“That's not something I thought was capable of doing, and there were a lot of life situations that made it even harder to get that GPA," she said.
Of the 12 colleges she applied to, she has already received acceptance letters from four. She is currently eyeing UMass Boston, which gave her the most financial aid.
“I know that, academically, I would be in a much better place if I had privileges like that," she said, referring to the parents named in the nationwide scheme. “I know a lot of kids who came from the same socio-economic background as me who go to elite universities have to make lot of sacrifices and make education their first priority to get to where they are."
High schoolers aren't the only ones reeling from the injustice. Kiera Bohen, 19, a second-year Northeastern University student who was recruited for a spot on the school's rowing team, said she was appalled by how actress Lori Laughlin's daughters allegedly were accepted to the University of Southern California as rowing recruits, despite having no experience.
“I just honestly think it's awful," Bohen said. “I trained 20 to 30 hours a week in high school to get a spot on a collegiate rowing team. To hear people are getting in, saying they're on sports teams, is really disappointing to me and my teammates — it's just really hard to hear."
Bohen, who grew up in Medfield before moving to Buffalo, N.Y., said that during high school, she would get up at 4:30 a.m. to practice before classes, and then practice some more in the evenings.
“It's like having a full time job — it's really hard to balance," she said, adding that she sacrificed nights out with friends and travel plans in the summer to train. “We put so much effort in, not just physical but also mental."
Bohen also described the USC rowing team as “strong competitors," and said that her Northeastern roommate was originally hoping to get recruited there, but was ultimately told she could only come aboard in the spring semester. Bohen pointed out that incident happened to be in the same year one of Laughlin's daughters was “recruited."
“I don't know if there's a correlation, but it's hard to think that my friend, who trained her whole life, could have been denied a spot at a school she really wanted to be at because of money," Bohen said.
Meanwhile, Solomon-Culp, the Northeastern student, said while he wasn't necessarily surprised at the revelations — rich parents, after all, often donate money legally in hopes of receiving favorable treatment — he did feel disheartened by the scope of the scheme.
“I think the scale of it, and some of the monetary amounts being given to coaches or proctors or whoever, it's kind of astounding how high they are," he said.
Solomon-Culp, who grew up in a competitive school district just north of Berkeley, Calif., said he felt pressure to get into a good college, and worked hard in high school so that he could get into a competitive school like Northeastern.
To him, seeing University of Southern California student Olivia Jade Giannulli — one of Loughlin's daughters — publicly say that she doesn't care about school is especially disparaging. (Giannulli was criticized in August after posting a video with the title “basically all the tea you need to know about me" in which she said that she was only going to college for “gamedays" and “partying": “I don't really care about school, as you guys all know," she said.)
“I'm sure I could find thousands of kids who would die to be able to go to USC," he said. “That, to a lot of people, is pretty insulting."
And despite Northeastern being implicated in the scheme — false test scores were submitted there, and one of the parents charged allegedly used his sway to try and get one of Singer's clients admitted — Solomon-Culp says that the view of his school hasn't been altered.
“For the most part, with everyone I have interacted with in classes and on projects, it's rare that I'm like, 'Oh, how'd you get into this school?"' he said.

Texto completo: Action Bronson: rapper, chef, cannabis enthusiast, your basic man about town and now, cookbook author.
Written with Rachel Wharton of the New York Times, "F*ck, That's Delicious: An Annotated Guide to Eating Well" (224 pages, Harry N. Abrams, $27.50) is less a catalog of recipes than a collection of anecdotes from his fascinating life peppered with the flavors that have defined him.
Born and raised in Flushing, Queens, to an Albanian father and Jewish mother, Action got his start cooking in his father's Middle Eastern restaurant before moving on to the culinary program at the Art Institute of New York.
After an injury briefly sidelined his kitchen career, he used his free time to concentrate on his music. That fateful choice soon grew into a full-time career.
While on tour around the world, he and his cohorts Mayhem, Body and DJ the Alchemist would search their various stops for local culinary delights. Their high jinks were amusing enough to earn them a TV show on Viceland, appropriately titled "Fk, that's Delicious!"
Action calls the book his "list of 100 amazing things the moments that got to me, the meals I ate, the places, the people, the artifacts, the accessories." Many of the recipes found in this book are culled from his travels, but the really great stories in here are from his childhood, his upbringing in and around New York and his life experience, which seems to be a perfect storm of talent, personality and good old fashioned luck. Recipes his mother and grandmother made alongside descriptions of local restaurant treasures and the comfort food he craves give this cookbook the feel of an intimate food journal. It's a bit cacophonous but so worth it, filled such as it is with numerous corners of foodie delight.
I had as much fun reading this book as I did re-creating the recipes, which are surprising and delicious. He writes with exuberant honesty and humor, warmth and a true love of food. Just pure fun.
Cookbook Critic runs Wednesdays in the Zest section. This week's Cookbook Critic is Tanya Pray of San Anselmo, who finds comfort in food and a sort of peace in preparation and handling, and isn't surprised that her friends always seem to drop by at dinnertime.

Texto completo: Award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, the first Latina to anchor a PBS “Frontline” report, will give the 50th Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture next month in Riverside.
Hinojosa is executive producer of “Latino USA,” a Peabody Award-winning program aired on National Public Radio. She has worked for CNN, PBS, CBS during a 30-year news career. Hinojosa’s 2011 “Frontline” report, called “Lost in Detention,” analyzed alleged abuse at immigrant detention centers.

Protestan frente al NY Times por cobertura “anti Trump” de la crisis humanitaria venezolana

Texto completo: Un grupo de lectores, mayormente venezolanos, se reunió el lunes al mediodía frente al edificio del diario The New York Times para protestar lo que calificaron como política editorial “tendenciosa” y “desinformativa” sobre la crisis humanitaria y política que se vive en ese país suramericano.
En particular la protesta fue motivada por un reporte publicado el domingo donde acusaban a la oposición venezolana y el gobierno del presidente colombiano Iván Duque de ser responsables de la quema de un camión con ayuda humanitaria en la frontera el pasado 23 de febrero, acción que el mandatario Donald Trump adjudicó a seguidores de Nicolás Maduro, opuesto a la entrada de auxilio internacional en un tono hostil.
De hecho, la vicepresidenta de Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez, confesó al día siguiente que la violencia vivida en la frontera fue sólo “un pedacito de lo que nosotros estamos dispuestos a hacer”.
Pero The New York Times publicó que su investigación había determinado lo contrario. En el pasado, el diario neoyorquino, el más importante de Estados Unidos, se ha destacado por su crítica al gobierno de Trump, tanto en política interna como exterior.
Al bajar a conversar con los manifestantes, la reportera Deborah Acosta afirmó que lo publicado había sido producto de una investigación exhaustiva de análisis de videos, aunque admitió que la situación ese día fue confusa y que el diario estaba enviando más periodistas a la zona para cubrir la tensa situación.
Además del reporte en sí, los manifestantes cuestionaron que haya sido publicado justo el fin de semana, mientras en Venezuela se vivía una “situación desesperada” de muertes en hospitales, saqueos e incomunicación durante el mayor apagón en la historia del país; algo que, según ellos, The New York Times no había desplegado de manera proporcional “por su oposición permanente a Trump”, comentó la activista Gloria Requena.
Acosta insistió ante los presentes que el reporte se había publicado el domingo 10 de marzo porque fue entonces cuando habían concluido su investigación.
“¿Cómo se refieren ustedes a Guaidó?”, preguntó Acosta a los presentes sobre el presidente del Parlamento, que declaró ilegal el mandato de Maduro. A coro, la mayoría respondió: “Es el presidente encargado de Venezuela”. Y la reportera tomó nota.
“Pedimos al New York Times que dejen de usar nuestra crisis en su juicio político en Estados Unidos”, declaró a la agencia EFE Erick Rozo, coordinador en Nueva York del partido venezolano Voluntad Popular, al que pertenece el ingeniero Guaidó,
Rebeca Zambrano, miembro de la asociación “Independent Venezuelan American Citizens”, denunció que “en vez de hablar de cuánta gente está muriendo en Venezuela, de cuántos niños necesitaban esa ayuda, el New York Times decidió hablar de un video no concluyente”.
“Maduro dijo que no los iban a dejar entrar (los camiones con ayuda humanitaria), la canciller Delcy Rodríguez dijo que lo que vimos era sólo una muestra de lo que eran capaces de hacer”, resumió la activista, preguntándose entonces cómo en su reportaje el New York Times los eximió de culpa, por acción u omisión.
En septiembre pasado, un venezolano se desnudó frente a la sede del New York Times, también reclamando una cobertura a la crisis de su país que no fuese usada como excusa para juzgar a Trump.

Texto completo: In Rome, the college of cardinals is gathering to mourn one pope and select his successor. An ambitious rogue cardinal arrives on the island of Malta seeking ancient documents from the secretive Knights of Malta that will pave his way to the papacy. These are just two strands of the convoluted plot of "The Malta Exchange” (Minotaur Books, 393 pp. , ★★ out of four), the 14th novel by Steve Berry featuring Cotton Malone, a retired Justice Department operative turned rare bookseller.
Malone arrives in Lake Como, Italy, in pursuit of letters exchanged between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini that British intelligence fears will reveal some embarrassing dealmaking aimed at preventing Italy from joining forces with Germany in World War II.
Why is this so urgent in the 21st century? You got me. But Berry is a New York Times best-selling author, so to quote Pope Francis, “Who am I to judge?”
As Malone arrives at a villa to nab the letters, bullets zing by, bodies are strung up and, inexplicably, a bear rumbling through the villa attacks Malone. Soon, Malone is entwined in the case of Cardinal Gallo, the papal wannabe, and a murderous subsector of the Knights of Malta, a Catholic humanitarian group with its own agenda for the new pope. Gallo’s estranged identical twin, Pollux, has been temporarily placed in charge of the Knights, seeking to thwart his brother’s ambitions.
Author Berry has a passion for history and historical preservation, so look for long passages about the Catholic Church, Constantine, Mussolini and various other European conquerors. You’ll find yourself wondering about several key plot points: Is any of this really true? For the most part, Berry confesses in an epilogue at the end, it isn’t.
If you can make your way through a tortuous plot with dialogue that can be as wooden as a church pew, Berry makes some interesting points about religion and how powerful men created the tenets of faith (manufacturing the concepts of ideas of heaven, hell and the devil) to control the masses. But in the finale, good old Cotton shows he has a taste of his own for some righteous religious vengeance.

Texto completo: Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-MN) comment that the influence of the Israeli lobby in Washington pushes lawmakers to take a pledge of "allegiance to a foreign country" was bad enough. A watered-down House resolution condemning, not Omar, but "all hatred" was as tepid as denouncing drunk driving.
After heated debate within their caucus, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership released a separate statement: "Congresswoman Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive. We condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments."
Omar complied, but this is not the first time she's had to walk back controversial comments about Israel.
In 2012, Omar tweeted: "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."
The implication was that Israel and its backers are being manipulated to support the Jewish state. This old anti-Semitic trope will be familiar to anyone with a minimal understanding of the history of the Jewish people and the genocidal goal of their enemies. Yes, Omar apologized, but not until she got to Congress. This assumes her apology was more political, than sincere. Consider her appeal to "Allah." Why would she, or any Muslim, disobey Allah?
Sarah Stern, who heads Endowment for Middle East Truth, which bills itself as "a Washington, D.C.,-based think tank and policy center with an unabashedly pro-America and pro-Israel stance," emailed to say, "We Jews have learned from our long and painful history that words matter. Violence against Jews does not erupt in a vacuum; and the increasing ease with which anti-Semitic comments are uttered within certain segments of our society is deeply painful and disturbing."
That truth can also be seen in Israel where Palestinian Arafat Irfayia, the prime suspect in the murder of Israeli teenager Ori Ansbacher, was indicted last week. World Israel News reports his explanation for stabbing and then raping the girl: "Because she was a Jew." The publication says Irfayia left his home in Hebron with "the express intention of killing a Jew."
You have to be taught to hate, as Oscar Hammerstein wrote in the musical "South Pacific," and hatred is at the heart of anti-Semitism, most notably in radical Islam. It can only get worse if those who harbor anti-Semitic sentiments — like Omar and her colleague and fellow Muslim, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) — are elected to Congress.
According to The Daily Caller, Maher Abdel-qader, a key fundraiser for Tlaib, shared an anti-Semitic video which described Jews as "satanic." The clip included this comment: "Research the truth about the Holocaust, and you'll definitely start to question what you thought you knew." The video's narrator went on to question whether 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust. The Caller writes, "Abdel-qader shared the video both on his personal Facebook page and within the group that now includes Tlaib."
Morton A. Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America(ZOA), the oldest pro-Israel group in the U.S., told Mark Levin on Levin's radio show: "...the Democrat party has shown a lack of will to tell the truth of the Arab-Islamist war against Israel. In a recent BDS vote to stop BDS, boycotting Israel, the innocent Israel, half of the Democrats voted against that bill. Virtually every Republican voted for it. ...So we have a real problem with the Democratic party."
In a New York Times column last week, Bret Stephens, who is Jewish, wrote: "If Pelosi can't muster a powerful and unequivocal resolution condemning anti-Semitism, then Omar will have secured her political future and won a critical battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. At that point, the days when American Jews can live comfortably within the Democratic fold will be numbered."
I wish, but the history of Jewish loyalty to the Democrats is long, which is a mystery since in the end we are again talking about their survival, not just as a Middle East nation, but as a people.

Texto completo: The first time I picked up the Italian writer Elsa Morante's 1957 novel "Arturo's Island," in this new translation by Ann Goldstein, the gifted translator of Elena Ferrante's novels into English, I put it down after 75 pages. Morante's vision is so baroque, and her prose so operatic, that after reading her I needed some alone time, with cucumber slices over my eyelids.
"Arturo's Island" is about a semi-orphaned boy's coming-of-age on the island of Procida in the Bay of Naples in the years just before World War II. The book's themes -- incest, misogyny, narcissism, homosexuality -- slide across the pages like lava.
Morante delivers epic emotions. Her people don't talk so much as they exclaim "with a contemptuous sneer" or "a loud, haughty cry of derision." They tremble with violent disgusts and savage attitudes. They strike poses of fear, loathing and, in the words of one character, "aggressive, insolent vehemence." They rattle the cutlery and they rattle each other.
"Arturo's Island" kept calling out to me, however. It had set its brutal hooks. Before I picked it up again, I found Lily Tuck's slim and sophisticated biography of Morante, "Woman of Rome" (2008). Reading it is an experience I recommend. Morante led a striding, unconventional life; a life that helps put the soaring cadenzas of feeling in her novels in context.
The unlikely details arrive right from the start. Morante's stepfather was a probation officer at a boys' reform school. He was found to be impotent on his wedding night, and his wife often made him stay, as punishment, in the basement of the family's house in a working-class section of Rome. Morante's mother was often hysterical, and attempted suicide. Family photos had faces scratched out.
Morante didn't attend college. She lived in poverty, sometimes resorting to prostitution, while struggling to become a journalist then a novelist. In 1938, she prepared a pot of boiling oil, intending to pour it on the heads of Hitler and Mussolini, who were passing in a convertible limousine under her apartment windows. Her future husband, the novelist Alberto Moravia (1907-1990), talked her out of this suicide mission.
Moravia found that he was on the wanted list of the fascist police. He and Morante were each half-Jewish. The pair went on the run in 1943, hiding for nearly a year in a small town, in a one-room hut built against a large stone.
Back in Rome after the war, they became something akin to the Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir of the Italian intelligentsia. Their friends included the writer Italo Calvino and the directors Pier Paolo Pasolini and Luchino Visconti, with whom Morante had an affair. (She had to share him with the actress Anna Magnani.)
Her table talk was famous. The filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci told his father, who begged him to go to college, "My university is having dinner every night with Elsa Morante, Alberto Moravia and Pier Paolo Pasolini."
Morante wore trousers, a rarity for Italian women at the time. She did not suffer fools. Woe to those who referred to her using her husband's surname and not her own.
Her novels, enormously influential in her home country, include "House of Liars" (1948) and "History" (1974), which was a landslide best seller in Italy. About its impact, Paul Hofmann wrote in The Times, "For the first time since anyone can remember, people in railroad compartments and espresso bars discuss a book -- the Morante novel -- rather than the soccer championship or latest scandal." The translations of her novels made little impact in the United States.
Ferrante was among those who devoured Morante's novels. She chose her pen name because of its echoes with Morante's own.
In interviews, Morante often claimed she wished she'd been born a boy, so that she could have heroic adventures. About the young male hero of "Arturo's Island," she commented: "Arturo, c'est moi!"
The island of Procida, in this novel, feels stolen from myth. An enormous prison looms over the island, as if it were Alcatraz. Arturo's own house is a crumbling, spider-webbed 20-room palazzo. The boy roams the island with his dog, and the sea in his small boat.
Arturo's mother, who was 17 and illiterate, died in childbirth. His father, whom he idolizes, is mostly cold and aloof, spending much of his time away from the island on trips that he refuses to talk about.
Arturo grows up in a woman-scorning world. The house's previous occupant, a wealthy and apparently gay man, threw elaborate parties and refused entrance to women. His father, who inherited the house from the man, also inherited most of his opinions.
"According to my judgment, real women possessed no splendor and no magnificence," Arturo says. He adds: "They were ashamed of themselves, maybe because they were so ugly; and they went around like sad animals."
One day, Arturo's father brings home a new wife, a teenage peasant named Nunziata. Father and son treat her abysmally. ("Shut up, you ugly, slovenly devil," the father says to her, in a typical snippet of dialogue.) When she has a child, however, Arturo is jealous of the attention the baby gets. He realizes that he has never been kissed. He slowly falls in love with his stepmother and asks her to run away with him.
Arturo's growing up plays out against the reader's awareness of the onrushing war. There's a tragic sense that the heroic dreams of his youth are about to be tested in ways he did not anticipate. Arturo's sense of himself, and of his father, are shaken when he realizes that his father is in love with a male prisoner on the island.
The men in this novel are knives, and the woman meat. There are few happy or fulfilled women in Morante's oeuvre. Yet Nunziata keeps the fires lit in the kitchen; she makes fresh pasta every day; she cares for her child and tries to stay above the fray. She is luminous, a kind of saint.
Morante's themes are not subtle. "Arturo's Island," even in Goldstein's adroit translation, is a sledgehammer performance. But her writing, once you acclimate to its gargoyle extravagance, has the power of malediction.

Texto completo: Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Larry Page didn't get board approval before he awarded a $150-million stock grant to Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile software, while the company helped cover up allegations of misconduct by Rubin, according to a lawsuit.
Eight days after granting the payout to Rubin, Page got "rubber stamp" approval for the equity compensation package from a board leadership committee, according to a revised investor complaint made public Monday in California state court in San Jose. Rubin eventually left the company with a $90-million severance agreement.
The suit was originally filed in January, but some claims were blocked from public view at the time

The new allegations shed light on Page's power to compensate top executives and could add fuel to criticism that the company's board isn't strong enough to keep management accountable to shareholders. They could also pull Page deeper into the controversy around how Google has handled sexual misconduct complaints, though it's not clear if he knew about the investigation when he gave Rubin the equity.
The Alphabet co-founder has generally stayed behind the scenes, while Google CEO Sundar Pichai has been left to deal with criticism of the company's culture.
In the lawsuit, investors say the board failed in its duties by allowing harassment to occur, approving big payouts and keeping the details private. The complaint targets top executives and committee members, including co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist John Doerr, investor Ram Shriram, Alphabet Chief Legal Officer David Drummond and others.
"It's confirmation of the fact that there were these large payouts" to Google executives and that the company's "own internal investigation had shown there was misconduct and harassment," Louise Renne, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Monday. "Nonetheless," Renne said, "rather than just being terminated, they were terminated with hefty reimbursement and gifts."
The $90-million severance package was first detailed by the New York Times in October 2018, and it sparked a firestorm of criticism from both inside and outside the company. Soon after, thousands of Google employees walked out to protest how the company handles sexual harassment complaints. Since then, Google has changed its policies, including ending the practice of barring employees from suing the company and shunting them into private arbitration. People fired for sexual harassment haven't gotten severance payments in the last two years, Google has said.
"There are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at Google," a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. "In recent years, we've made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority."
Google declined to comment further.
The sections of the lawsuit revealed Monday were initially redacted at the request of Google lawyers, but the company has since changed its position. Google declined to comment on why it reversed that decision.
"My hope is this is a step toward transparency," Renne said, referring to Alphabet's decision to not fight the unsealing of the information. "The reason we brought this shareholder lawsuit was to have some transparency governing corporate affairs."
One allegation unsealed Monday is that Amit Singhal, a top Google executive who left the company in 2016, was allowed to resign after accusations that he sexually harassed a female employee were found credible and he was given an exit package worth $35 million to $45 million. Singhal joined Uber Technologies Inc. but resigned after Recode reported that he hadn't told Uber about why he left Google. Singhal, who has denied the harassment claims, didn't respond to a request for comment.

No, AIPAC was not going after AOC

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has some startling news for her followers: The American Israel Public Affairs Committee is targeting her and her freshmen colleagues, Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.

The only problem is: It’s not true, according to the Times of Israel. But don’t blame Ocasio-Cortez for this bogus narrative. Blame the New York Times.

“It’s official,” reads a fundraising appeal published last week by the New York congresswoman's office. “AIPAC is coming after Alexandria, Ilhan, and Rashida.”

“Rashida, Ilhan and Alexandria have at times dared to question our foreign policy, and the influence of money in our political system,” it adds. “And now, lobbying groups across the board are working to punish them for it.”

The fundraising pitch focuses on a New York Times article titled, “Ilhan Omar’s Criticism Raises the Question: Is Aipac Too Powerful?” The report, which was published last week, concludes with one source, Stephen Fiske, saying of Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar that they “are three people who, in my opinion, will not be around in several years.” Fiske, whom the paper bills as an “AIPAC activist,” is featured prominently in both the Times report and in Ocasio-Cortez’s fundraising email. In fact, his concluding quote is the entire basis for the congresswoman’s claim that she and her cohort are being targeted by AIPAC.

The problem here is that Fiske “has not been associated with the pro-Israel lobbying group for several years,” the Times of Israel reports. “The hardball he counsels in dealing with those who depart from centrist pro-Israel orthodoxies is not the style of the lobby, which discourages alienating safe incumbents.”

Fiske himself reportedly confirmed in a phone interview with the Times of Israel that he hasn’t been associated with AIPAC for “three or four years." He also confirmed he is no longer a member.

None of this is mentioned in the New York Times article, which includes lines like:

"- "Mr. Fiske, a longtime activist with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee"
- "Stephen Fiske, a longtime activist with Aipac"
- "The story of how Aipac became one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington is, in large part, the story of how it has managed to harness the passions of thousands of people like Mr. Fiske"
- "Mr. Fiske’s Florida Congressional Committee is one of a string of political action committees with anodyne names … that operate independently of Aipac but whose missions and membership align with it."
It’s impossible to read the above excerpts and not come away thinking Fiske is in some way connected to AIPAC and that he may even speak for it. But he isn't and he doesn't, according to the Times of Israel. But don’t blame Ocasio-Cortez’s team for her fundraising pitch’s dubious assertion. I would have drawn the same false conclusions from reading just the New York Times article.

For what it's worth, the reporter who authored the Times story maintains her story is clear enough.

“Stephen Fiske told me he volunteered for AIPAC 10 years ago and took over his PAC because they asked him to. He said he is ‘a little less’ involved with AIPAC now because he doesn't have the patience to sit through policy conference. He did not say he is uninvolved,” she tweeted.

I'm not sure how we reconcile this "little less" claim with Fiske's reported claim he's not even a member of AIPAC and that he hasn't been associated with the group in roughly four years.

“Aipac activists don't speak for Aipac. They don't work for Aipac. They are volunteers. Marshall Wittman speaks for Aipac and he is quoted in my story,” the Times reporter added.

Wittman said only, “Aipac does not rate, endorse or contribute to candidates. We encourage our members to participate in the legislative and political process exercising their democratic rights as Americans.”

Texto completo: You wouldn’t expect democratic socialists to hit the brakes when it comes to social justice.
But in late February members of Inland Empire Democratic Socialists of America learned how to fix brake lights so they could offer that bit of auto repair service, for free, at an upcoming community event. Working tail lights, they reasoned, would mean fewer police traffic stops and, possibly, fewer fatal outcomes for people of color.
Auto repair is just one part of the chapter’s public outreach about an ideology that, increasingly, is finding a more receptive public audience. Polling shows more Americans, especially Democrats, view socialism more favorably than capitalism, even if they have sometimes wildly different ideas of what socialism is.
“It just doesn’t have the same stigma,” Kimberley Coles, a political anthropologist at the University of Redlands, said of the word “socialism.”
“It doesn’t mean there won’t be … rhetoric and seeing what sticks in terms of the insults.”
A Gallup poll from last summer found that for the first time in 10 years, Democrats had a more positive view of socialism (57 percent) than they did of capitalism (45 percent). That shift among Democrats drove down the overall view of capitalism.
“A majority of Americans have retained a positive view of capitalism over the past eight years, but this year’s 56% positive rating is by four points the lowest recorded since 2010,” Gallup reported. “Americans’ positive views of socialism have varied only between 35% and 39%, with (2018’s) reading of 37% right at the trend average.”
Gallup also found that among young people (ages 18 to 29) capitalism had slipped from 68 percent approval in 2010 to 45 percent approval last year.
Gallup isn’t the only pollster seeing that trend.
Thirty-one percent of Democrats in a YouGov poll from last August said they would be “comfortable” with a socialist presidential candidate, compared to just 8 percent for Republicans.
The same YouGov poll found 44 percent of Americans had a favorable view of capitalism, down from 52 percent in 2015. Americans age 18 through 29 are likelier to see the word “socialist” as a compliment while Americans age 65 and older are more likely to consider it an insult, although the 65-and-up group views socialism more favorably now (25 percent) than in 2015 (15 percent), according to YouGov.
Capitalism’s polling dip — and the corresponding rise in approval for the label “socialism” — coincides with ballot box gains by politicians who are connected with the political organization Democratic Socialists of America.
Running as Democrats, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib in 2018 became the first Democratic Socialists of America members to win congressional seats. Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders’ stronger-than-expected 2016 presidential campaign fueled an effort to turn the Democratic Party leftward, a trend that’s continued with Ocasio-Cortez’s celebrity status.
Nationally, Democratic Socialists of America had just 5,000 members prior to November 2016, but passed the 40,000-member mark following Ocasio-Cortez’s upset in New York’s June 2018 primary, according to published reports.
The organization’s Southern California connections include chapters in the Inland Empire, Orange County and Los Angeles. “Our chapter is continuing to grow and evolve from its humble roots,” the Inland chapter collectively wrote in response to emailed questions. “Fresh faces appear at every monthly member meeting.”
It’s not just about faces and personalities, either.
Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal for a Green New Deal, along with proposals from many candidates for universal health care, higher taxes on the rich and other socialist-favored ideas, figure to loom over the crowded race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
It’s also already become a rallying cry — perhaps even the central theme — of Republican election efforts.
During last month’s State of the Union address, President Donald Trump drew applause from supporters when he invoked socialism as a pejorative.
“We are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said before declaring that “America will never be a socialist country.”
Fears of socialism “could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of (President Trump’s 2020) campaign that sounding the alarm about ‘criminal illegal aliens’ was in 2016,” The New York Times reported.
“Socialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, told the Times.
Socialism replaced Hillary Clinton as the main villain at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, which featured a “bread line” mocking Ocasio-Cortez.
“They want to take away your hamburgers,” former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka warned conference-goers. “This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved.”
What is socialism?
Americans fight not only over whether socialism is good or bad, but over what it means. Seventeen percent defined socialism as “government ownership of the means of production,” that was about half the number of Americans who used that definition of socialism in 1949, Gallup reported last October.
“Americans today are most likely to define socialism as connoting equality for everyone, while others understand the term as meaning the provision of benefits and social services, a modified form of communism, or a conception of socialism as people being social and getting along with one another About a quarter of Americans were not able to give an answer.”
The Democratic Socialists of America is “a ‘big tent’ organization,” the Inland chapter said. “Members may embrace a variety of tactics, theoretical frameworks, and emphases, but ultimately work toward a classless society undergirded by an economy in which production and the fruits of production are shared by all.”
To fight what the chapter sees as misconceptions – socialism is “inherently totalitarian” or a “mere matter of welfare state programs,” for example – members stress that socialism is organized from the bottom-up, outside of government, and that socialism emphasizes freedom, including “the ability of working people to resist the private tyranny of the firm and its owners,” the chapter said.
Socialism made Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, not the other way around, the chapter said. “Their ideas were popular because the moment was right for a socialist alternative, after a major recession, stagnant wages, and widespread discontent with the status quo.
“Our chapter as a whole is sympathetic to Bernie/AOC, but we seek also to hold them accountable to their promises, and members may find that their views do not completely overlap with theirs. This being said, among elected officials, their reform agenda is the closest in spirit to our movement …”
Besides fixing brake lights, the Inland chapter, which estimates it has 30 to 40 active members, also stumps for Medicare-for-all at events like Riverside’s monthly Public Arts Walk. It also hosts movie screenings with discussions afterward – “Sorry to Bother You” was a recent feature – and members have traveled to Mexico to help migrants at the border.
“A new idea”
Coles and Harold Clarke, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, think socialism’s surging popularity, especially among millennials, is rooted in recent history.
“Socialism’s kind of a new idea for them and it’s detached from a lot of the economics and brutal politics of the past,” Clarke said.
Millennials “aren’t shaped by Cold War politics, much less attachment to political parties,” Coles said. “They’re interested in a la carte political ideas, rather than being labeled as Republicans or socialist.”
They also grew up during the Great Recession of the late 2000s, when capitalism’s flaws “were highlighted in political rhetoric,” Coles added. “Socialism has historically always offered a critique of capitalism and highlighted the inequality of economic and political power.”
The Trump backlash also might be a factor. “With his hotel empire, numerous side businesses, and history of shortchanging employees and contractors, current President Donald Trump perhaps encapsulates capitalism at its worst … ,” Eillie Anzilotti wrote in an article about the Gallup poll results for Fast Company magazine.
She added that Trump alone likely doesn’t explain the drop in capitalism’s popularity, especially among young people. “Since the 1970s, wages (adjusted for inflation) have barely risen, while (the) cost of living has skyrocketed across the U.S. Meanwhile, the top 1% of earners in America … has captured 85% of income growth that’s occurred since 2009.”
The uptick in socialism’s popularity could be a lasting trend, Coles said.
“I feel that these millennial voters are … more interested in learning from others (and are more) cosmopolitan in being willing to take ideas from lots of places,” she said. “It seems that people are interested in new ideas and socialism is offering one set of solutions.”

NEW YORK TIMES WRITES ARCHITECT JULIA MORGAN'S OBIT 62 YEARS LATER

Texto completo: Looking back, the first Saturday of February in 1957 was a newsy day on the international front, but not much was happening around this country. According to OnThisDay.com, the United Nations adopted a resolution calling for Israeli troops to leave Egypt. And the play "Candide" closed in New York after just 73 performances.
But somehow, the New York Times managed to overlook the death of one of the country's most famous architects, Julia Morgan, the designer of the legendary Hearst Castle.
Last week, the newspaper of record made amends for that oversight.
As part of its "Overlooked No More" series, the paper published an extensive obituary feature on Morgan 62 years after her Feb. 2, 1957, death in San Francisco.
The introduction reads: "Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked,' we're adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times."
The article by Alexandra Lange chronicles Morgan's life and career, from her birth in San Francisco and upbringing in Oakland to her civil engineering studies with Bernard Maybeck at UC Berkeley and the challenges she faced as a pioneering architect.
"As the first woman to receive an architect's license in California, in 1904, Morgan early on was used to skepticism about her abilities," the article says. "But she came to allay those doubts by building a sterling reputation with projects now known around the world, including the Asilomar conference grounds on the Monterey Peninsula and, most notably, the Hearst Castle at San Simeon. By the time she retired in 1951, at 79, she had designed hundreds of buildings and sites."
One early challenge came after the 1906 earthquake left the Fairmont Hotel in ruins just days before its opening. The owners hired Morgan, based partly on her success with an earlier project in Oakland.
"Only three years earlier she had built a bell tower on the campus of Mills College, and it had withstood the earthquake unscathed proof that Morgan was as experienced in reinforced concrete as she was in European design," Lange wrote.
But skepticism about her work persisted, and the San Francisco Call sent reporter Jane Armstrong over to the building site in 1907 to talk with the foreman.
Lange quoted the Call article: "Yes, the foreman answered, it was in the charge of a real architect, and her name happens to be Julia Morgan, but it might as well be John Morgan.'"
A decade later, Morgan was designing buildings at Asilomar for Phoebe Apperson Hearst, when she undertook the commission of her career, the Hearst Castle project with William Randolph Hearst, which would last 25 years.
Besides those landmark projects on the Central Coast, she notably designed the Berkeley City Club, San Francisco's Chinatown YWCA and hundreds of other buildings. In the South Bay, a piece of her legacy is currently on the market. The 1910 home-turned-office, located at 1650 The Alameda in San Jose, has been listed for $3.4 million by Cushman & Wakefield.
So why did the Times fail to write about her death? "In the 1950s, the emphasis was on the new, the modern, and the heroic not to mention on architecture to house the masses," Lange wrote. "Morgan was largely forgotten."
Thanks to the efforts of biographer Sara Holmes Boutelle and other architects, Morgan's "reputation was restored" years after her death, the obituary says. In 2014, she was posthumously awarded the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal a first for a woman.
Morgan is buried with other California luminaries at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

Texto completo: Federal disability recipients may want to watch what they post on social media.
The Trump administration could soon use websites like Facebook and Twitter to help find people who claim Social Security disability benefits who are not actually disabled, The New York Times reported.
About 10 percent of Westmoreland County residents under the age of 65 identified as having a disability between 2013 and 2017, according to the Census Bureau. Between the same years, 9 percent of Allegheny County residents under the age of 65 identified as having a disability.
The number of people receiving disability benefits in both counties was not immediately available Monday.
According to the report, social media would be used to identify fraud and to increase the integrity of the program.
The New York Times said administration officials have been working on the proposal with Social Security, calling social media a possible "treasure trove of information" about people applying for benefits.
On Monday, President Trump announced a $4.75 trillion budget proposal, The New York Times reported, proposing to spend "$26 billion less on Social Security programs, including a $10 billion cut on the Social Security Disability Insurance program."
To apply for disability benefits, a Social Security number must be provided for the applicant, spouses and any kids, along with a routing number from a bank.
Information about the applicants medical condition like dates of treatment for all doctors, hospitals and clinics; names of medications taken and the name of the doctor who prescribed them; and the names and dates of all medical tests done much be provided in the application.
Trump also proposed new work requirements for recipients of federal housing support, food stamps and Medicaid, which could reduce spending by $327 billion on the programs over a decade, according to the newspaper.
About 41,000 people in Westmoreland County and 148,000 people in Allegheny County receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program, also called food stamps, according to December state figures.

SXSW Sports: Bleacher Report hopes to keep expanding reach over sports market

Texto completo: What makes the American sports fan tick?
Bleacher Report certainly knows. At least that’s the message delivered Sunday during the South by Southwest interactive festival in downtown Austin by Bleacher Report’s Ed Romaine, who serves — wait for it — as the company’s chief branding officer.
Romaine spent his allotted 45 minutes at a panel entitled “The Heart of the American Sports Fan” explaining how Bleacher Report’s mix of social engagement, rapid-fire updates, live feeds and expanding attention to betting has helped the company grow from a startup in a San Francisco basement 10 years ago to an international media force valued in the multi-millions.
“To us, it’s more about what the fans think of the game than what some TV anchor says the next day,” said Romaine, appropriately dressed in retro Stan Smiths and skinny black jeans befitting his target demographic of Premier League-watching millennials and Gen Zers.
And Romaine came with the slideshow to prove it.
The gospel, according to Bleacher Report: Ninety-six percent of its Instagram followers are using another device while watching live sports; 63 percent of its followers are using Instagram while watching live sports; and there were 1.3 billion social video views across what Romain referred to as “Bleacher Report’s ecosystem.”
The success of Bleacher Report in a market saturated with sports can’t be ignored. The company, owned by Turner Sports, is now ubiquitous, as evident by everything from their sponsorship of Champions League broadcasts in the U.S. to the notifications that ping on the coworker’s phone two cubicles over.
As the New York Times pointed out in a recent article, Bleacher Report’s House of Highlights — an Instagram account that the company bought from a college student in Florida a few years ago — has 12 million followers.
But Bleacher Report wants to be all things to everyone. Romaine pointed out that gambling content has the highest growth rate of followers among BR’s youngest audience, but he also says “we’re mindful of how we promote it, especially to a younger audience.” He shows snippets of videos the company has produced with Carmelo Anthony, who apparently has plenty of time on his hands between occasional stints with NBA teams. He says long-form narrative is important, but “we don’t want to lose anyone who just wants scores.”
“How are we drawing consumers into our ethos and identity?” Romaine asked the listeners inside the JW Marriott hotel.
But what exactly is that identity for Bleacher Report 10 years into its existence? Perhaps that’s a question Romaine and other executives will have to answer soon.

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders lead a new poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers released this weekend, underscoring how the nomination process for the Democratic Party has, to this early point, been defined by the two figures with the largest national profiles.
The poll, which was conducted by The Des Moines Register and CNN, had Biden as the top choice for 27 percent of respondents, leading all candidates. Though Biden's advisers have signaled that he intends to run for president, he has yet to announce his candidacy. Sanders, who kicked off his campaign recently in New York City, was the top choice for 25 percent of those asked.
Poll numbers have fallen sharply, however, for the other major holdout: former US representative Beto O'Rourke, who lost a Senate bid in Texas in 2018 and could announce his candidacy in the coming weeks. Only 5 percent of likely caucusgoers now call him their first choice for president, down from 11 percent in December.
The Iowa caucuses will be held in early February 2020.
The next closest figure to Biden and Sanders, according to the poll, was Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was among the first to announce her presidential candidacy. Warren was the top choice for 9 percent of respondents, followed by Senator Kamala Harris of California, who was favored by 7 percent of respondents and had soaring favorability ratings.
Other candidates — including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — have struggled to make an imprint, the poll found.
New York Times
Cheney blasts Trump plan that allies pay for US troops
A top Republican blasted the Trump administration's potential demand that countries pay the full cost of hosting US troops and then some, saying it's a "wrongheaded" move that would jeopardize both national security and relationships with allies.
"It would be absolutely devastating," Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who heads the House Republican Conference and serves on the Armed Services Committee, said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."
Cheney was responding to a Bloomberg News report on Friday that the administration is developing so-called "cost plus 50" plans to force countries to pay the full price of American soldiers deployed on their soil, plus an additional 50 percent or more for the privilege. Nations hosting American forces could see their tab climb five to six times their current costs.
"We benefit tremendously" by stationing soldiers in South Korea, Japan, Germany, and other countries, Cheney said. "The notion that we are now going to somehow charge them 'cost plus 50' is really — it's wrongheaded, and it would be devastating to the security of the nation and our allies."
Trump's planned proposal is in line with his efforts to encourage US allies to boost their defense spending. But it has stoked concerns among diplomats and security experts who fear any "cost plus 50" demand would be an affront to allies in Asia and Europe who already question the depth of Trump's commitment to them.
Cheney vowed to oppose the move in Congress. Asked whether fellow Republicans would join her in rejecting the plan, given their tendency to acquiesce to the president on most matters, she said politicians must be aware of the security dividends the United States gets from having troops stationed abroad.
"It's going to be very important for us to make sure that people understand the danger that that will do to our relationships and to our fundamental security," Cheney said.
Bloomberg News
'The ISIS threat will remain,' John Bolton says
National security adviser John Bolton said Sunday that the Islamic State remains a threat and that it is "growing in other parts of the world" besides Syria and Iraq.
The statement by Bolton in an interview on ABC News' "This Week" is at odds with claims by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence late last year that the militant group, which is also known as ISIS, has been defeated.
"The president has been, I think, as clear as clear can be, when he talks about the defeat of the ISIS territorial caliphate," Bolton said. "He has never said that the elimination of the territorial caliphate means the end of ISIS in total. We know that's not the case."
He added that Islamic State fighters are "scattered still around Syria and Iraq, and that ISIS itself is growing in other parts of the world. The ISIS threat will remain."
The White House has delivered mixed messages on the matter.
Friday night, at an outdoor fund-raiser at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., Trump said the caliphate was 100 percent destroyed, according to an attendee.
In a December tweet, Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from Syria, declaring, "We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency." Trump appeared to slightly shift course later that month, stating on Twitter that the extremist group is "mostly gone." He has since agreed to maintain a presence of about 400 troops in Syria.
Pence, meanwhile, said in a speech at the State Department in January that "the caliphate has crumbled, and ISIS has been defeated."
Bolton was responding to a statement by General Joseph Votel, the commander of US forces in the Middle East, who said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week that the fight against the Islamic State "is far from over."
Bolton said Sunday that he is "very optimistic" that US allies such as Britain and France will help in battling the resurgence of the group.

Schiff says Mueller should be interviewing Trump
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was making a "mistake" by not demanding that President Trump testify as part of his investigation, which by many accounts may soon be nearing its end.
Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, acknowledged that it might be expedient for Mueller to avoid subpoenaing Trump's testimony because the president could fight it and Mueller's new boss, Attorney General William Barr, might oppose such a move.
"But I do think ultimately it's a mistake, because probably the best way to get the truth would be to put the president under oath," Schiff said. "As he's made plain in the past, he feels it's perfectly fine to lie to the public. After all, he has said, 'It's not like I'm talking before a magistrate.' Well, maybe he should talk before a magistrate."
Schiff also said he is deferring to Mueller on whether Erik Prince, a former Navy SEAL who created the controversial Blackwater security company, lied to Congress about his involvement in the Trump campaign.
The House Intelligence Committee spoke with Prince in 2017 about his meeting in January that year with Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund; the meeting in question was organized by the United Arab Emirates in the Seychelles. Prince presented the meeting to congressional investigators as a series of coincidences and insisted to the committee that he played no role in Trump's campaign or transition team.
But it is an August 2016 meeting in Trump Tower, which Prince admitted to participating in during an interview with Al Jazeera last week but never disclosed to the Intelligence Committee, that has revived suspicions that Prince lied to Congress under penalty of perjury.
In the Al Jazeera interview, Prince insists that he disclosed the August meeting to investigators, despite no mention of it in the public transcript, something Prince explained by suggesting the transcript must be wrong.
"He's certainly not telling the truth in that interview," Schiff said.

Got the job? Don't stop being curious, engaged

Texto completo: You hardly slept the night before and arrived to the meeting 25 minutes early. You were wearing your favorite outfit and were fully prepared to put your best foot forward. No, I'm not talking about your first date, but rather that job interview that landed you your gig.
Think about how you were fully present, asked thoughtful questions, and did everything you could to shine. Realizing the importance of the meeting, you went above and beyond to demonstrate your value and position yourself as a linchpin.
The problem for many of us is that we significantly reduce our efforts once the job is ours. Yet if you really think about you, you're always interviewing.
The way you perform in a meeting will establish how colleagues view you. If you under-deliver for a client, your reputation for mediocrity spreads. When you mail it in thinking no one will notice, frankly everyone notices.
On the other hand, each touch point with others is an interview opportunity. Those who regularly demonstrate the same professionalism, intensity, curiosity and focus they exhibited during their interview are the ones who achieve greatly. While daily interactions lack the formality of a job interview, isn't our responsibility to perform just the same?
When a musician, actor, or dancer auditions, he or she is committed to showcasing their best work. After the audition, the ones who continue to view every performance a new audition for future possibilities are the ones who make history, while the ones that get caught in the daily grind are the ones whose careers eventually get ground up and spit out.
Whatever your craft may be — from delivering keynote speeches to selling insurance —each time you take the proverbial stage should be a treasured moment to perform at your best. Even if you have that particular situation in the bag, think of it as an interview to win the next one.
To reinforce your passion and focus, so that your value is undeniable. While we can't prepare as many hours as we did for the big job interview, we must make sure we bring the same intensity and commitment to putting our best foot forward on a consistent basis.
Every day is a new interview, even if you've been on the job for 20 years. Each professional interaction is the opportunity to audition for something more, even if it doesn't seem obvious. When we realize that we're always interviewing, we elevate our impact on others, and in turn, we realize our full potential.

A war of words over 'enemy of the people'

Texto completo: Not too long ago a man with a knowing look on his face approached me in the parking lot of a local grocery store and said in a way that was both cordial and ... not, "Did they know in there that they just did business with an enemy of the people? Or did you use one of your aliases."
"Christopher Paul Hasson," I said.
"Who?"
The name didn't ring any bells with the gentleman, who laughed and went on his way.
How about you?
Hasson?
He was in the news briefly last month. Way too briefly if you ask me. (Though no one did.)
However, if Hasson had accomplished what he allegedly set out to accomplish, it's likely we'd ALL know his name. For a little while, anyway. And there's even a chance President Donald Trump and his most worshipful sycophants would temper their use of the word "enemy" to describe Democrats and members of the news media.
Then again, maybe not.
The language Trump uses trickles down.
For example, the current head of the Arizona Republican Party, Kelli Ward, tweeted during her failed campaign for a U.S. Senate seat:
The #FakeNews media balks at the notion that they're the enemy of the people all while continuing to oppose the #AmericaFirst agenda. If you don't like the moniker, drop the left-wing policies like open borders & sanctuary cities which result in MORE CRIME! ...
In January, Navajo County Republicans elected a man named Mac Rojo as their first vice chair.
Rojo said at the time, "Our domestic enemy is the Democrats."
Not our political adversary.
Not our philosophical opposites.
"Domestic enemy."
Political people like Ward and Rojo feed off Trump, of course. And before long the language of politicians becomes the language of choice in supermarket parking lots.
And it's perpetually reinforced.
After Democrats didn't stand and cheer during the president's State of the Union address Trump said, "They were like death and un-American. Un-American. Somebody said treasonous. Yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn't seem to love our country very much."
Treason?
For not standing?
Trump is relentless about this on twitter. As in:
THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
And:
The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
The publisher of the Times, A.G. Sulzberger, said, "It is particularly reckless coming from someone whose office gives him broad powers to fight or imprison the nation's enemies. As I have repeatedly told President Trump face to face, there are mounting signs that this incendiary rhetoric is encouraging threats and violence against journalists at home and abroad."
There already has been violence against journalists at home and abroad.
There have been deaths.
And there might have been a lot more if Christopher Paul Hasson hadn't been nabbed before he had the chance to carry out the massacre authorities say he planned.
After the Navajo County Republicans first vice chair said, "Our domestic enemy is the Democrats," the White Mountain Independent printed an op-ed by Sheryl Eaton, chair of the White Mountain Democrats, who wrote in part, "We are not enemies; we are all people who want the best for our country. We just have to work together on how to do what's best."
That's true for elected officials, though it doesn't seem likely, given the language used by some politicians — by the president.
It's dangerous.
Democrats are not the enemy. The media is not the enemy.
I read comment a while back by Washington Post editor Marty Baron that explains the situation simply and precisely.
Commenting on Trump's rhetoric he said, "We're not at war with the administration, we're at work."

Texto completo: Libraries are vital anchors in their communities. As the mission of Hartford Public Library says, libraries "provide free resources that inspire reading, guide learning, and encourage individual exploration." We asked eight Connecticut authors and poets to tell us why libraries matter, from their personal perspective. Here are their stories.
Research, community - and serendipity
By Wally Lamb
Sometime next year, my second novel, "I Know This Much Is True," will air as a six-episode HBO series starring Mark Ruffalo in a double role as troubled identical twins. The story began in 1992 on the fourth floor of UConn's Homer Babbidge Library. I wrote a lot of it in longhand with a Bic pen and a thick folder of loose-leaf pages.
Whenever the story stopped flowing, which often happened, I'd get up from the study carrel I thought of as mine and wander the stacks where, frequently, serendipitous "accidents" happened. When the novel was in its nascent stage, I knew, for instance, that its central characters, Dominick and Thomas Birdsey, were brothers. However, it wasn't until I pulled a book from some miscellaneous shelf and a photocopied essay by anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss titled "Harelips and Twins" fell out and onto my shoe that it dawned on me that these brothers were identicals. The discovery felt like lightning striking.
It struck a second time when Italian writer Gabriele D'Annunzio's collection of short stories, "Tales of My Native Town," demanded my attention and led me to "I Know This Much Is True's" story-within-the-story about the Birdsey brothers' immigrant grandfather. His voice flowed out of my Bic faster than a rushing river and became the beating heart of the novel.
At the Babbidge Library, research librarians helped me to discover what the weather had been like in Groton on the day in 1954 when first lady Mamie Eisenhower christened the USS Nautilus, what might happen to the insides of an abusive husband whose wife was sneaking ground glass into his food, and what happens to a family when paranoid schizophrenia and sudden infant death syndrome descend. All of the above was woven into the tapestry of the twins' story.
Throughout my writing life, I have relied on libraries for research, solitude, community and serendipity. The springboards for my fiction wait quietly and patiently for me in these gloriously democratic institutions.
Wally Lamb is the author of six novels, including two New York Times No. 1 best-sellers. He is the editor of two nonfiction anthologies, collections of autobiographical essays that evolved from a writing workshop he facilitates at Connecticut's York Correctional Institute, a maximum-security prison for women. A third collection is scheduled for publication in October.
Celebrating libraries
By Kate Rushin

I had been under the impression that "the library" had always been there and would always be there. My first memory of a library book was a thick tome that I would take down from my grandmother's bookcase; I'd sit on the rug, leaf through it and read. The book was the original 1941 hardcover edition of "The Negro Caravan: Writings by American Negros," an anthology of poems, songs, short stories and essays, edited and written by Sterling A. Brown, Ulysses G. LeeJr. and Arnold P. Davis.
Many years passed before I could appreciate the historical significance of the collection or the ink stamp on the inside cover: Property of The Camden Public Library. I did not dream, in long ago South Jersey, that one day I would study poetry with Michael S. Harper, Sterling Brown's friend and editor. Or that professor Harper would lead me to the John Hay Library at Brown University, where I would hold a 19th-century edition of the poetry of Phillis Wheatley in my hands. All I knew, as a kid, was that I loved the book and that it was probably long overdue.
Our neighborhood library branch was a storefront, in walking distance, just off The Avenue. It was there that I checked out "Mary Poppins," "Little Women," "Champion's Choice," "Wind in the Willows," "Little House in the Big Woods," "The Yearling" and joke books. I got quite a jolt when I came home from college to find that "my library" had been closed. The bigger shock came as I drove to downtown to find the old, stately, Main Branch (across from where I had cashiered in the drugstore one summer) boarded up too. The library closings signaled a shift. Something had changed; something was not right in our city.
The library has always been a place for knowledge of other places, other times, other worlds; for me, it has also been a place of refuge, a place for poetry and celebration. My book "The Black Back-Ups" was honored by the New York Public Library at "The Donnell" branch. I've had the opportunity to read at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.
I realize that during my time in Connecticut, I've visited more than two dozen public libraries, whether as a poet, patron, workshop leader, audience member or as a writer looking for just the place to work for a few hours. I'm ever grateful to poet Bessy Reyna for her Hartford Loves Poetry program. I am honored to have been commissioned to write the 125th Anniversary Poem for the Hartford Public Library. Through the life and work of Caroline Hewins, "The First Lady of The Library," I am reminded that libraries weren't always open to everyone; I am reminded of what would be lost if we, as a community, ever take the public library for granted.
Kate Rushin, a poet and educator, is the author of "The Black Back-Ups," a poetry collection. Her work has been widely anthologized. She has served on the James Merrill House committee in Stonington and the poetry advisory committee of the Sunken Garden Poetry Festival at the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington.
Reading in the stacks: Heaven on earth
By Amy Bloom

I love my local Branford library - the Willoughby Wallace Memorial Library. I love the Blackstone Library, which is its big sister. But the library of my heart and my childhood, the library that is the standard for all libraries great and small, is the Arrandale Public Library of Great Neck, N.Y., and it is no longer.
It was a big building - like a squashed Greek temple. The floors were wood, and there was a treacherous metal spiral staircase to the stacks, where I spent much of my life.
Every Saturday afternoon, my father would drop me off at the library, claiming that he had a haircut, and I would read in the stacks until he came back to get me two or three hours later. This was an arrangement that suited us both entirely and which we never revealed to my mother. I worked my way in fiction from Louis May Alcott to Emile Zola.
The librarians carefully stepped over me as I spread myself out with my red licorice whips, my dirty pink glasses and my saddle shoes on the cool slate floor. It was, for me, heaven on earth.
Amy Bloom is the author of four novels and several collections of short stories. She has been a nominee for both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Her stories have appeared in "Best American Short Stories," "Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards," and numerous anthologies. She is Wesleyan University's Shapiro-Silverberg professor of creative writing.
In the land of libraries
By Frederick Douglass Knowles II
My memory of a local library sends me sailing across the waves of my youth back to the shores of Thomas W. Mahan Elementary in Norwich. It was there, beyond the threshold of a quaint four-cornered alcove, where I discovered literary wonderment. A haven of hidden books inspired me to emulate Ms. Fitzgerald's melodic whispers of adventure in reverence.
She read endlessly. The weekly ventures from her kindergarten classroom, down the hall, past the main office, and a slight right after the cafeteria fed my passion for poetry.
Libraries led me to poetry. Poetry to the appointment as poet laureate. Adults encourage children to follow dreams. Though how would they know where to begin without a colossus of words navigating them? There is an astounding treasure in the land of libraries - a treasure that, much like a chest, can only be discovered by cracking the cover of a hidden gem.
Frederick Douglass Knowles II is the inaugural poet laureate for the city of Hartford. He is an associate professor of English at Three Rivers Community College in Norwich.
Libraries aren't buildings but people
By Susan Schoenberger

Each library I know brings with it the vivid memory of a librarian who put a book in my hands that changed my life.
The best example is my elementary school librarian, Patricia Myruski, whose voice I can still hear reading Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach" aloud almost a half-century later. Miss Myruski would look you in the eye and, without hesitation, pull a book off the shelf as if she could see right into your thirsty little third-grade soul.
Miss Myruski was the reason I wanted to write books, if only to attempt to bring to others the kind of joy and total immersion that reading brought to me. We all need a Miss Myruski in our lives and a great library at which to make that connection.
Susan Schoenberger is the author of two novels, "A Watershed Year" and "The Virtues of Oxygen." She is director of communications at Hartford Seminary.
A sacramental quality
By Rand Richards Cooper

Over the decades, I've made sporadic visits to the Norman Williams Library, a beautiful library in an 1883 stone building on the Woodstock, Vt., town green, beginning when I was a kid vacationing with my family. More recently, I visited when my wife and I brought our young daughter to a summer day camp 20 minutes away. The cabin we rented was blessedly beyond the reach of internet, and I'd drive to Woodstock to check email on the library computers.
The building's graceful charm begins with the twin columns and triad of ornately filigreed arches at its entrance. Inside you'll find a double-wing transept and stained-glass windows, a mezzanine bordered by intricate wooden balustrades, and massive curved oak beams high above. An elongated central atrium runs nave-like through the building, books on either side in wooden shelves arranged like pews. These borrowed elements of church architecture suggest a miniature cathedral and confer a sacramental quality upon the library's function.
The Norman Williams is the first library where, many years ago as a young writer, I discovered a book of mine on the shelves. That makes the place even more sacred to me.
Rand Richards Cooper is the author of two works of fiction. He is contributing editor at Commonweal Magazine, and his writing has appeared in The New York Times, The New Yorker, Harper's, Esquire and The Atlantic. He writes a column, "In Our Midst," for Hartford Magazine.
Finding Gold
By Jeff Benedict

Books are a luxury. At least they were in my childhood home. With six children packed into a three-bedroom cottage, my parents had neither the money nor the space for books.
But my mother viewed reading and writing as a top priority. So she took us to the Waterford Public Library on a regular basis. While my younger siblings played in the children's section, I made friends with the librarian in charge of archives. At age 11, I wasn't much of a reader. However, I loved Sports Illustrated. The librarian started bringing me back issues.
Pretty soon, I was reading about Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Joe Namath, and Bear Bryant - sports figures that were before my time. The concepts of archives and back issues were foreign to me. All I knew was that it felt like I was traveling back in time every time the librarian brought out another short stack of old magazines. It was so much fun that I would rather go to the library than anywhere.
Then one day, the librarian gave me two large boxes of Sports Illustrated to take home. Apparently, the library needed to create space, and the magazines would otherwise have been discarded. I still remember the stamp on the covers said: "Waterford Library." I felt like she had given me boxes of gold.
Thirty years later, I wrote my first cover story for Sports Illustrated. When I saw my name on the cover of my favorite childhood magazine, I thought back to my childhood librarian and the incredible impact she had on me. She helped me fall in love with archives, research and magazines. I'm so glad my mother brought me to the public library.
Jeff Benedict is the author of 15 nonfiction books, a Sports Illustrated contributor, and a television and film producer. In 2018, he published "Tiger Woods," with Armen Keteyian, which was a New York Times No. 1 best-seller. He is a writer-in-residence at the Garde Arts Center in New London.
A path to publishing success
By Julia Tannenbaum

As an avid reader and writer, I've always felt a strong connection to libraries. My local library, the Noah Webster Library in West Hartford, is no exception. I moved to West Hartford when I was 3 years old, and since then it has been like my second home. From Storytime in the Kid's Corner to middle school book groups to challenging writing workshops, the Noah Webster Library has played a significant role in strengthening my love for books.
This September, I published my debut novel "Changing Ways," a contemporary young adult story about a 16-year-old's journey to overcome mental illness. The Noah Webster Library staff was very supportive, with the teen librarian Kari Karp even offering to edit my manuscript prior to publication. They celebrated this accomplishment by hosting an author's talk for me. As I stood in the conference room, sharing my story with an audience of at least 30 people, I realized how fortunate I was to belong to such an incredible library.
I'm 18 now, and in a few months, I will be leaving for college. But I know that regardless of where my life takes me, I will always remember the Noah Webster Library.
Julia Tannenbaum is the author of "Changing Ways," a novel about teen mental illness. She is a senior at Hall High School in West Hartford.

Texto completo: The five most-viewed listings on The New York Times's Find a Home site in February included a home in Texas surrounded by lush landscaping and a New Hampshire shack that will probably be torn down to build something bigger.
1. Windows on Park Avenue
$2.95 Million | 1133 Park Avenue, No. 3 West, Upper East Side
Holding onto the top spot for the second straight month -- but now with a $345,000 discount -- was a three-bedroom, two-bathroom corner apartment in Manhattan. Eric Cohler, an interior designer, created the space for his mother, complete with pocket doors, high ceilings and a decorative fireplace.
Broker: Brown Harris Stevens
______
2. In a Forest of Oaks
$995,000 | 2212 Bowie Drive, Corsicana, Tex.
In second place was a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath house with a three-car garage on 7.5 acres, with a koi pond and landscaping that includes nearly every Texan oak variety.
Broker: Giordano, Wegman, Walsh and Associates, Christie's International Real Estate
______
3. Beaux-Arts on Fifth Avenue
$50 Million | 854 Fifth Avenue, Upper East Side
Holding at third place from January was an over-the-top Gilded Age townhouse with 17 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms. The ornate interiors are hard to stop clicking through, though they are out of reach for most buyers.
Broker: Douglas Elliman
______
4. A Home With Everything
$750,000 | 1612 Norristown Road, Maple Glen, Pa.
Next up was a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom house with an additional bedroom in the walkout basement. With 5,029 square feet, it is being sold fully furnished -- including a pool table and a pair of comfy looking leather sofas.
Broker: Coldwell Banker Preferred, Blue Bell Office
______
5. It's Not About the House
$2 Million | 445 Marcy Street, Portsmouth, N.H.
In fifth place was a house with a surprising price -- until you realize the land is what's really for sale. It's described as the last large lot (0.36 acres) available in the south end of Portsmouth, where less modest homes abound.

Concept is clear, transition isn't

Texto completo: The Brits and Canadians I know certainly love their single-payer health care systems. If one of their politicians suggested they should switch to the American health care model, they'd throw him out the window.
So single-payer health care, or in our case "Medicare for all," is worth taking seriously. I have just never understood how we get from here to there, how we transition from our current system to the one Bernie Sanders has proposed and Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and others have endorsed.
Despite differences among individual proposals, the broad outlines of Medicare for all are easy to grasp. We would take the money we're spending on private health insurance and private health care, and we would shift it over to the federal government through higher taxes in some form.
Then, since health care would be a public monopoly, the government could set prices and force health care providers to accept current Medicare payment rates. Medicare reimburses hospitals at 87 percent of costs while private insurance reimburses at 145 percent of costs. Charles Blahous, a former Social Security and Medicare public trustee, estimates that under the Sanders plan, the government could pay about 40 percent less than what private insurers now pay for treatments.
If this version of Medicare for all worked as planned, everybody would be insured, health care usage would rise sharply because it would be free, without even a co-payment, and America would spend less overall on health care.
It sounds good. But the trick is in the transition.
First, patients would have to transition. Right now, roughly 181 million Americans receive health insurance through employers. About 70 percent of these people say they are happy with their coverage. Proponents of Medicare for all are saying: We're going to take away the insurance you have and are happy with, and we're going to replace it with a new system you haven't experienced yet because, trust us, we're the federal government.
The insurance companies would have to transition. Lots of people work for and serve this industry. All-inclusive public health care would destroy this industry beyond recognition, and those people would have to find other work.
Hospitals would have to transition. In many small cities the local health care system is the biggest employer. As Reihan Salam points out in The Atlantic, the United States has far more fully stocked hospitals relative to its population and much lower bed occupancy than comparable European nations have.
If you live in a place where the health system is a big employer, think what happens when that sector takes a sudden, huge pay cut. The ripple effects would be immediate - like a small deindustrialization.
Doctors would have to transition. Salary losses would differ by specialty, but imagine you came out of med school saddled with debt and learn that your payments are going to be down by, say 30 percent. Similar shocks would ripple to other health care workers.
The American people would have to transition. Americans are more decentralized, diverse and individualistic than people in the nations with single-payer systems. They are more suspicious of centralized government and tend to dislike higher taxes.
The Sanders plan would increase federal spending by about $32.6 trillion over its first 10 years, according to a Mercatus Center study that Blahous led. Compare that with the Congressional Budget Office's projection for the entire 2019 fiscal year budget, $4.4 trillion. That kind of sticker shock is why a plan for single-payer in Vermont collapsed in 2014 and why Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected one in 2016. It's why legislators in California killed one. In this plan, the taxes are upfront, the purported savings are down the line.
Once they learn that Medicare for all would eliminate private insurance and raise taxes, only 37 percent of Americans support it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. In 2010, Republicans scored an enormous electoral victory because voters feared that the government was taking over their health care, even though Obamacare really didn't. Now, under Medicare for all, it really would. This seems like an excellent way to re-elect Donald Trump.
The government would also have to transition. Medicare for all works only if politicians ruthlessly enforce those spending cuts. But in our system of government, members of Congress are terrible at fiscal discipline. They are quick to cater to special interest groups, terrible at saying no. To make single-payer really work, we'd probably have to scrap the U.S. Congress and move to a more centralized parliamentary system.
Finally, patient expectations would have to transition. Today, getting a doctor's appointment is annoying but not onerous. In Canada, the median wait time between seeing a general practitioner and a specialist is 8.7 weeks; between a GP referral and an orthopedic surgeon, it's nine months. That would take some adjusting.
If America were a blank slate, Medicare for all would be a plausible policy, but we are not a blank slate. At this point, the easiest way to get to a single-payer system would probably be to go back to 1776 and undo that whole American Revolution thing.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Don’t blame the rain for deaths at Santa Anita, the problem is much more complicated

Texto completo: It wasn’t just the stormy weather that led to the deaths of 21 horses in less than three months at Santa Anita racetrack. More likely, it was a perfect storm, one that’s been brewing for years.
The heavy rains since December contributed, certainly, but an analysis of two decades of horse racing statistics published by the California Horsing Racing Board shows the world renowned track has weathered worse with fewer fatalities.
Just two years ago, 17 inches of rain — 2 more inches than this year — fell from December to March. Eleven horses died at the Arcadia facility in that time period.
Only two of Santa Anita’s five deadliest years from 1997 to 2018 correspond with higher-than-usual rainfall. The worst year, 71 deaths in 2011-12, was during the drought.
In this case, the various factors at play include the types of horses, the track, the training and racing schedules, and the weather’s impact on each of those, said Rick Arthur, equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. Necropsies on the horses will also determine if the animals had any pre-existing conditions or medication in their systems.
“It’s like a plane crash,” Arthur said in an earlier interview. “There’s seldom one factor that explains everything, and I wouldn’t expect that to be the case here.”
New protocols announced
On Friday, Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita and several other racetracks, announced a series of new protocols to increase safety when racing resumes later this month.
Consultants are still reviewing the weather’s impact on the main track, but the initial changes extend far beyond the rainy season. Under the new rules, Santa Anita will scrutinize horses’ medical records — even during training — and control the number of horses on the track for high-speed exercises.
On Saturday, Santa Anita announced its main dirt track would reopen at 5 a.m. Monday for limited workouts — “joggers and gallopers” only.
“Over the past four days, we’ve been able to do a great deal in terms of amending the soil and inspecting it,” said Dennis Moore, who served as track superintendent at Santa Anita until Dec. 31 and recently returned to analyze the racing surfaces.
“Things can happen even under perfect circumstances,” Moore said, “but from everything we’ve been able to learn, this track is in outstanding condition and it’s ready for training.”
Santa Anita’s fixes mirror successful changes made by the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, which cut back on horses on the track in the mornings and tightened up its inspections in the aftermath of a disastrous 2016 summer season, with 17 deaths in 23 days.
Experts: Overuse of track a factor
The increased traffic at Santa Anita is likely one of the main factors in the deaths, according to experts.
Bad weather can upset the consistency of a track, but it also forces horses into the barns, sometimes for days, according to Richard Tedesco, a veteran track consultant with experience as a superintendent at most of Southern California’s racetracks.
Disruptions make trainers and owners anxious to get their horses back out as soon as possible. Once the gates reopen, there’s a flood of horses all at once on a track already weakened by rains.
“You’ve got all of these guys foaming at the mouth to get their horse ready again,” Tedesco said. “The dirt gets pretty well chewed up.”
Too many horses running at the same time is an accident waiting to happen, he said.
Santa Anita shut its track down for two days at the end of February in response to outcry over the first 19 deaths. Track expert Mick Peterson, of the University of Kentucky’s Agricultural Equine Programs, examined and cleared the course as “100 percent ready” before the track reopened Feb. 28.
The horse racing statistics website Equibase tracked 862 workouts in the six days following the reopening. On March 1, 326 horses hit the track before the afternoon races began. Then another 70 ran in those events. The 20th horse died in a race the next day. On March 5, 273 horses worked on the track where the 21st horse died.
“That’s quite a bit,” Tedesco said of the workouts. He estimates an average day is about 150 horses.
In Europe, horses exercise at training centers and race mostly on the weekends, Tedesco said. But in Southern California, the loss of venues has condensed much of the thoroughbred racing to Santa Anita. Trainers say they don’t change locations as often as they did in the past.
Santa Anita scaled up and extended its season when Hollywood Park closed in 2013.
“The bulk of the dates went to Santa Anita,” said Jack Liebau, the director of Los Alamitos Thoroughbred Racing in Orange County. “You have a lot more stress on the track and it’s difficult.”
‘Real art form’ to maintain a track
Heavy rains, a well-worn track, and even the loss of Moore as track superintendent may have all played a part, Liebau said.
Moore, who most recently has been serving as a consultant at Del Mar and Los Alamitos, helped Del Mar with its crisis in 2016. He returned to Santa Anita as a consultant earlier this month to help with the track inspections.
“It’s a real art form to maintain a track in a safe manner,” Liebau said. “Everybody seems to be very happy that Dennis is back.”
Fewer deaths at Los Alamitos
At Los Alamitos Race Course, which runs quarter horses and thoroughbreds, 10,354 horses raced last year, compared to 8,922 at Santa Anita, according to statistics compiled from reports by the CHRB.
Los Alamitos also uses a dirt main track, like Santa Anita, and in the past three months experienced heavier rain. At both venues, the track is tightly compacted to keep out moisture. This creates another potential risk as the harder-than-expected surface can throw off a horse’s fragile footing.
Since Dec. 26, only three horses have died on the track at Los Alamitos, compared to the 21 at Santa Anita. That’s despite the fact that the state’s data shows Los Alamitos had 23 percent more deaths per year on average in the past decade.
Though the tracks share similarities, the big difference between the two venues is the daily traffic. Nine of Santa Anita’s 21 deaths occurred during training on the dirt track, seven were during races. The other five happened on the venue’s storied turf track.
Los Alamitos has added more thoroughbred racing in recent years, but the majority of horses at the venue are quarter horses. These sprinters of the racing world have less intensive training regimens than thoroughbreds, Santa Anita’s bread and butter.
Los Alamitos had less than 200 workouts in the same six day period as Santa Anita’s 862, according to Equibase.
‘Everybody worried’
Last week, the New York Times reported that trainers at Santa Anita appear to be more demanding than counterparts elsewhere in the state. Santa Anita averages 3.02 workouts per start, compared with 0.88 workouts per start for horses running at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 0.42 at Aqueduct in New York.
“Ninety-nine percent of the trainers take very good care of their horses, there’s less than 1 percent that you have to watch,” said Tedesco, the track consultant. “Owners spend a lot of money, the trainers want to win races. It all comes down to, ‘Let’s keep them going.’ “
Everyone at the track is working to ensure safety of horses during training and the races, he said. Tedesco said he’s fielded concerned calls from racetrack officials across the country..
“What is going on is really bad for the industry,” he said. “It’s gotten everybody worried, everywhere.”

In 1935, the animated cartoon character Porky Pig first appeared in the Warner Bros. animated short “I Haven't Got a Hat."
In 1945, during World War II, US B-29 bombers began launching incendiary bomb attacks against Tokyo, resulting in an estimated 100,000 deaths.
In 1954, CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow critically reviewed Wisconsin Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy's anti-communism campaign on “See It Now."

How Democrats emboldened anti-Semites this week

Texto completo: Doctors warn you to finish complete rounds of antibiotics, even if an infection feels better, in order to prevent the bacteria from developing antibiotic resistance.

Shame has the same relation with racists and anti-Semites. That's why halfhearted critiques of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, only empowered his racism, to the point that he was came to equate Mexicans to "dirt" on the campaign trail and defend white supremacy to the New York Times.

Well, congratulations, Democrats. You didn't finish your medicine. You passed a pathetic excuse of an "All Lives Matter" denunciation of hate on all sides, and now the sickness is catching. You didn't teach Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one lick of empathy or humility. Instead, her anti-Semitism has gained mainstream support in the Democratic Party. It is now shame-resistant, and she'll be more vocal than ever with it.

Don't believe me? It's already happening. The vote on the "anti-Semitism" resolution occurred not 24 hours ago, and Omar's already hit the ground running on her victory lap.

In a joint statement with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. (the only sitting congresswoman to openly support the eradication of Israel) and Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., Omar celebrated the "historic" day. Why? Because "it's the first time we have voted on a resolution condemning anti-Muslim bigotry in our nation's history."

Remember: Omar's anti-Semitism was the reason for this resolution. Instead of learning a lesson from it, she's learned she is untouchable.

A few hours after that, Omar retweeted Mehdi Hasan mocking Meghan McCain for becoming visibly upset on television regarding Omar's comments.This disgraceful result is really the result of Nancy Pelosi's abrupt cowardice. She would have done less harm by delivering a milquetoast critique and, say, simply avoided posing on a national magazine cover with her. By calling out Omar and then chickening out, she handed Omar a major political victory instead of the rebuke she deserved.

Congresswoman Omar won. Less than a month ago she was coerced into a half-hearted apology. Now she's brimming with unabashed pride over her ability to shut down the saner denizens of her party.

Any veneer of contrition from Omar has been shot to hell by the Democrats' dereliction of duty in calling out hate in their ranks. Omar's first apology following the "Benjamins" catastrophe was "unequivocal." Her second was a big, fat sorry to anyone whose feelings she hurt. Now there is none. Just sheer glee and giant "up-yours" to every Jew in the country who felt rattled by her invocation of multiple anti-Semitic stereotypes.

It will only get worse. Just as we saw strains of the French protectionist Right migrate across the Atlantic into the 2016 election, the Corbynization of the Democratic Party is well underway. Even the nominal facade of Jewish and Israeli tolerance has been shed, not just by one member of the House, but by every hateful hack who enabled her.

Yes, the anti-Semitism of the Left that percolated from college dorm rooms to the Women's March and finally to the hallowed halls of Congress is at last shame-resistant, and it's here to stay.

Preventive Medicine: A breathless end to diet doubts

Texto completo: Within just the past week or so, expert commentary in the New York Times told us first that we need better nutrition answers, and then, that we need artificial intelligence to feed Homo sapiens well. Personally, I doubt the advent of artificial intelligence excuses use of the natural version.
And so, with a bow to the native, natural intelligence for which our species is known, I propose you join me in a thought experiment before you decide what, or whether, to eat. Let’s think about breathing the way we are so often goaded to think about eating.
We hold this truth to be self-evident: that humans are adapted to breathe air, not water. But should we, really, hold that as self-evident truth? After all — there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to clinch the matter.
These days, on the topic of nutrition in particular, authorities compete to be first in line to advocate more RCTs. We have been told we are confused, misled, and mired in doubt — all for want of those definitive RCTs, and now — a missing pinch of artificial intelligence (A.I.) too.
If that’s true, and if what’s good for the gut of the goose is just as good for the lungs of the gander, then we must question the brazen conclusion that we should be breathing air, not water. We have no randomization to lean on; no double-blinding; no testing with placebo air. And while we are at it, we also have no data about conferring with our microbiome; no applications of artificial intelligence to the topic; no probing consideration of the subtleties of genetic predisposition (“pneumogenomics”).
It’s premature to conclude we should breathe air. There’s just so much we don’t know. Much as it feels good, maybe breathing air is a bad idea. Much as it feels bad, maybe breathing under water is better. All we have to argue the other way is…anecdotes. We all know what those are worth.
Even if breathing air is better, that leaves far too much detail unaddressed to just start inhaling. Is there interaction between the air and the microbiome? We really ought to hit pause on breathing until we sort out the all-important preferences of our resident bacteria. Do they prefer fast or slow? Hot or cold? Misty sea air, or rarefied mountain air?
Adaptation, you say? Sure, there is the mix of gases native to the atmosphere of this planet, and that’s just what our species has always been breathing. But that’s obviously a very feeble perch from which to make the mad leap of faith that the native air of Earth is what’s “right” for us. Our kind of creature, to borrow from The Martian, needs to science the “expletive” out of something before getting to the sense of it. We can’t take this stuff for granted.
And the idea that the same kind of air might be good for all of us? Well, that’s just so last-news-cycle. Almost offensive, really. These days, our air really ought to be customized, personalized, and precision before we can deign to breathe the stuff. One-size-fits-all air is just not…inspiring.
So much for the thought experiment; what does all this hot air have to do with diet? Well, what we know about air and breathing, we know about food and eating — for all the same reasons, and in all the same ways. Except that in the case of food and eating, we actually do have RCTs, too. And vast troves of evidence in many other flavors, besides — from basic, mechanistic research, to observational epidemiology at the level of whole populations over generations. All of that nutrition science first begins where our understanding of human breathing ends — with simple observation of what’s what.
Since despite the addition of science to sense experts keep telling us — again, and again, and again — that we are clueless about the basic feeding of Homo sapiens, how much more so when it comes to breathing — where we only have sense and some misguided infatuation with what’s obvious, but much, much less science?
My advice, then, is also obvious. We need not wait for a new, national institute or advances in artificial intelligence to embrace and apply the fundamental truths of healthful eating. Those who do feel obligated to wait have all the same reasons to hold their breath while they’re at it.

Guac and the meaning of life When we last left Pastor Dave Jahn of Advent Lutheran Church, he was offering drive-through blessings for motorcyclists. The eclectic Jahn is back this time to discuss "The Big Questions" in front of a nice bowl of salsa at a Mexican restaurant.
Jahn will lead a no-holds-barred discussion of faith's gnarly issues during weekly sessions at 7:30 p.m., March 13 to April 10 at Fiesta Azteca, 6765 N. Wickham Road, Suntree. He is using the guac and the chips to more comfortably and casually engage with believers, non-believers and seekers.
"Compared to all that there is to know, even the most brilliant among us knows nothing, so we need to begin every discussion with humility and openness," he said.
The Lutheran minister has been an open-minded student of the mysterious and sacred, scientific and secular, for more than 50 years and is the author of "Faith on the Edge of the Universe."
For more information, call 321-259-8515 or visit AdventBrevard.org.

Texto completo: By Steve Contorno, Times Staff Writer

For two months during Venezuelas civil crisis, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio has spotlighted the countrys plight using the biggest platform available to him: his Twitter account.

Through it, Rubio promotes reports of protests against disputed president Nicolás Maduro (an illegitimate tyrant, he tweeted). In English and Spanish, Rubio posts minute-by-minute updates of tensions on the ground, often sharing local videos of violent skirmishes with his 3.8 million followers.

Time running out for certain (Venezuela) leaders to make their choice, Rubio recently wrote. It will soon be too late.

To some, Rubios Twitter campaign has helped keep American attention on a humanitarian emergency in an often overlooked part of the world. Others have accused the Florida Republican of stoking civil conflict there.

Its a debate that couldnt have existed in a pre-social media world, but the emergence of Twitter has allowed a single U.S. politician to directly campaign for foreign policy action on a worldwide pulpit previously reserved only for a president.

I cant think of an example of a sitting senator effectively bypassing the White House on a key foreign policy issue and drumming up support via social media. It is the first time its happened on this scale, said Chris Meserole, an expert on foreign policy and emerging technology at the Brookings Institution. To some extent, hes giving (President Donald) Trump a taste of his own medicine and following that playbook to put an issue on the map in a way he controls. And hes been savvy in doing so.

Venezuela so far has been an exception to Trumps predisposition to authoritarian regimes.

His administration has spearheaded an international coalition of Western and Latin America countries to pressure Maduro through sanctions and calls for a transition in power.

Many credit Rubio for this. A front-page New York Times story dubbed him Ouster in Chief and claimed that he is filling a vacuum while Trump is preoccupied with Asia and the Middle East.

Coming from a state with the countrys largest Venezuelan-American population, Rubio has tweeted alarms about Venezuela since 2014. His influence has come through more traditional methods too  floor speeches, Sunday political talk shows and legislation. This week, hes leading a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Venezuela.

But its clear there is a Twitter audience hungry for Rubios Venezuela diplomacy. His posts on Venezuela often are shared by thousands, while tweets about China or Florida politics or Hurricane Michael get far less circulation.

And Rubio has responded to this appetite. He has mentioned Venezuela in tweets more than 380 times this year. The word Florida? Seventeen times. Maduro has 230 mentions in Rubios timeline since Jan. 1. Trump? Just 20.

Rubios use of social media to reach millions could become a blueprint for influencing foreign conflicts. While Congress and even individual lawmakers have always had a role in shaping United States policy abroad, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram allow American politicians to directly broadcast and mobilize a world audience.

As Rubio has demonstrated, these social apps arent just for speaking to constituents. Rubios tweets have penetrated a country where Internet access is blocked and the news is controlled by state-owned media. Many of his posts, particularly those in Spanish, are shared widely by Venezuelans and in Latin American countries.

Some of Rubios critics warn that hes sowing confusion and inciting violence. As a humanitarian aid package headed from Colombia to Venezuela, Rubio tweeted an unverified report that Maduro allies fired into Colombia. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said that Rubio was ramping up the crisis with his tweets.

Maduro is evil, and the U.S. should pursue a strategy to undermine him and prompt new elections, Murphy tweeted. But its quite a different thing for the U.S. to incite a civil war with no real plan for how it ends.

The next day, Rubio cryptically posted a picture of a bloody Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader captured and killed by his own people. The insinuation was that Maduro would suffer the same fate if he didnt turn over power to Juan Guaidó, elected interim president by the National Assembly in December, and it immediately drew international condemnation.

Rubio also has antagonized countries and regimes sympathetic to Maduro, like Russia and Cuba, as well as the United Nations and some of his Democratic critics.

Guaidos coalition has the backing of large swaths of Venezuelans, many of whom have suffered from food shortages, hyper inflation and humanitarian atrocities under Maduro. Dozens of countries, including the United States, have recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader.

But Erica Chenoweth, an international relations professor focused on political violence at Harvard University, cautioned that even the perception of foreign intervention can cause popular unarmed movements to lose support, particularly in Latin America, where theres a sordid, bloody history of U.S. entanglements.

The thing that makes it especially problematic is the person tweeting and the country he represents wont pay any price at all for the fallout, Chenoweth said. Encouraging a group of people to take more risky actions, it looks like conspiracy to the regime theyre targeting.

Rubio has persistently rejected similar arguments. Dany Bahar, an economist who specializes in Venezuela, said Maduro would spread that propaganda independent of Rubios tweets.

While his tweets may be correctly perceived as provocative, they in no way eclipse the situation of Maduros thugs burning humanitarian assistance, said former Venezuela embassador Patrick Duddy.

Regardless, its a concern few could imagine 20 years ago, before a lawmaker in D.C. or Florida could instantly broadcast a message of peace or violence to recipients thousands of miles away. Its a reality future administrations and diplomats will have to closely monitor.

Im not worried Rubio is going to start World War III, said the Brookings Institutions Meserole, but it starts a template and a precedent that could be dangerous if it becomes a playbook for other senators to disrupt the president on foreign policy.

Texto completo: After spending two years carefully studying President Donald Trump’s rhetoric — listening to his speeches, watching videos of his political rallies, and analyzing his tweets — I came to one unambiguous conclusion: Sean Hannity is the most powerful and dangerous person in America.
After the 2016 presidential election, many people feared that Fox News would become a mouthpiece for the president, amplifying his message of division and hate. The truth, however, is significantly more alarming. The president has become a mouthpiece for Fox News generally and Sean Hannity specifically.
Consider what we know. First, the president is driven by his ego, not some commitment to a core set of beliefs. He is neither a principled person nor a person of principles. Second, the president is notoriously disinterested in matters of policy. He is too intellectually lazy to read reports, study issues, learn facts, or even listen to his advisers.
Third, the president spends significant portions of his day in “executive time,” meaning he obsessively watches television, principally Fox News. Fourth, the president’s staff regularly present him with printed copies of the chyrons, the all-caps text at the bottom of the screen, from his favorite television programs. He apparently really enjoys seeing his name (as if this weren’t already clear from his buildings). And fifth, the president not only watches Hannity regularly, he also speaks with Hannity regularly. In fact, he has even had Hannity on stage with him at political rallies.
Read more commentary:
Sean Hannity calls reporters covering Donald Trump rally 'fake news'
2020 Dems should test their mettle in a Fox News debate instead of running scared
Fox News went all in for Donald Trump. In its eyes, the president can do no wrong.
Considering these facts and given that the president often tweets things he has just seen on Fox News, is there anyone who genuinely believes that Trump is the one telling Hannity what to say? The president is clearly not a person of ideas; he’s barely a person of coherent thought, as his recent two-hour rambling “off-script” speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference reaffirmed. Simply put, Sean Hannity is not spreading Donald Trump’s endless stream of lies, self-aggrandizing delusions and wild conspiracy theories, he’s authoring them. And Donald Trump is obediently repeating and tweeting them.
That should be alarming to every American. It should be alarming not simply because Hannity was never elected by the American public to lead anything, but also because Hannity is widely trusted. As Adweek recently reported, Hannity was the most widely watched program on cable news in 2018 (for the second year in a row), drawing 3. 2 million viewers on average. But the popularity of Hannity is based on a fundamental deception. Hannity has convinced a wide swath of the American public that he is a journalist and that his show on Fox News is a news program. Both of these things are demonstrably untrue.
Hannity is not fake news or any news at all
To be clear, I’m not suggesting that Hannity is “fake news” or even biased news. I’m pointing out that Hannity is not news at all. As both Sean Hannity and Fox News have somewhat reluctantly acknowledged, Hannity is a political opinion program. Sean Hannity told The New York Times in August 2016, for instance, that he has “never claimed to be a journalist,” and he affirmed that fact on Twitter in October 2016 when he tweeted he’s a “talk host” and “not a journalist. ”
Hannity’s employer, Fox News, concurs, and on Nov. 15, 2017, the network noted that, “Shep (Smith) is an outstanding journalist, and Sean is an outstanding opinion commentator. ”
But Hannity has also claimed to be a journalist, albeit an "advocacy journalist. " This idea, combined with the fact that Hannity airs on a network with “news” in its title is, to put it mildly, frightening.
This is the state of American politics and democracy: We have a political opinion commentator on the far right (who’s not a journalist, has no journalistic credentials, and follows no journalistic code of ethics) accusing real news outlets like CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post of being “fake news. ” Meanwhile, that same right-wing opinion commentator is telling the sitting president what to say and think. Welcome to President Hannity’s America.

Texto completo: A black man from Detroit is suing three white women for making up lies about him to police in order to keep him away from a community park.
Marc Peeples said the women falsely accused him of crimes from July 2017 to May 2018 as he built a garden in Hunt Park and worked to improve the surrounding neighborhood.
Peeples alleges that the women — Deborah Nash, Martha Callahan and Jennifer Morris — had their own plans for the park and wanted to see him "incarcerated or seriously injured by law enforcement."
The women told Detroit Police administrators in March 2018 that Peeples had stolen from houses near the park and threatened to burn down their homes and kill them, according to the lawsuit filed Feb. 25 in Wayne County Circuit Court.
Two months later, as Peeples was in Hunt Park teaching a group of homeschooled students about gardening, one of the women called 911 and falsely reported that Peeples was a convicted pedophile and wasn't legally allowed near kids, the complaint said. Police arrested Peeples in the park.
The allegations led to Peeples being charged with three counts of stalking. As a condition of his bond, he was barred from park. The women removed or covered some of the improvements Peeples had put in place, according to the lawsuit.
A Wayne County Circuit Court judge eventually tossed the case. The judge said the three women harassed Peeples, according to a report in the Detroit Metro Times.
NBC News reported that Peeples and his attorney, Robert Burton-Harris, describe what happened as a case of "gardening while black."
Nash, Callahan and Morris have unlisted phone numbers and could not be reached by the Free Press late Tuesday.
Nash told the New York Times in October that she called police because Peeples was damaging property.
"I am not a racist. I was all for the garden and even helped with supplies at first, but he threatened me several times, in person to my face, that I needed to leave my neighborhood or I would be put out one way or another," she told the Times. "I called the police because he was destroying property in the neighborhood and painting graffiti. No one had the right to paint park trees."
In the lawsuit, Peeples is seeking $300,000 in damages, plus costs and attorney fees.
A status conference has been scheduled for May 28.

THE WORLD; Chinese tech giant sues U.S. over ban; In a multi-pronged campaign, Huawei denies it poses a risk to federal agencies.

Texto completo: Huawei is suing the U.S. government over a law banning federal agencies from using its equipment, the latest maneuver in the Chinese tech giant's global offensive against American pressure and criticism that it poses a national security risk.
Huawei's inexpensive, effective technology is attractive to many countries planning 5G wireless networks, but U.S. officials have been touring the world arguing it poses an unacceptable security risk , particularly for allies with which the U.S. shares intelligence.
The White House says Beijing could exploit the technology to carry out cyberspace intrusions and espionage, and Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo recently warned European partners not to use Huawei to equip 5G networks.

But Huawei, desperate to protect its share of a crucial market, has been fighting back.
"Congress acted unconstitutionally as judge, jury and executioner," Huawei executive Guo Ping said Thursday after announcing the court action.
The lawsuit filed in federal court in Plano, Texas -- home to Huawei's U.S. headquarters -- targets a U.S. ban on government agencies using its equipment or dealing with third parties that use its equipment.
"The U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products," Guo said at a news conference in Shenzhen, China.
At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last week, Huawei boasted it had already signed up 64 countries for 5G equipment. Governments in important markets such as Britain, Germany, Canada and India are still deciding, and some telecommunications firms in France, Japan, Germany and Britain have expressed concerns about using Huawei technology in their 5G networks.
Huawei has been trying to shrug off its reputation for having a closed, opaque corporate culture. In Brussels this week, the company launched a cybersecurity transparency center. It has taken to social media and recently launched the English-language website Huawei Facts with an "Open Letter to the U.S. Media," saying, "Don't believe everything you hear. Come and see us."
Huawei has also been wooing journalists, according to Reuters, which reported that 10 of its senior staffers were offered salaries of up to $200,000 to jump ship and work for Huawei's public relations department.
It took out a full-page ad in New Zealand newspapers after that country barred its equipment from 5G networks. And it paid for a sponsored column by cybersecurity analyst Henry B. Wolfe published by the New York Times' T Brand Studio calling on Australia to reverse a similar ban.
The company has urged its foreign employees to post glowing comments about Huawei, to send the company headquarters any positive commentary they can find online and to share the Huawei Facts website and Twitter handle with clients, customers and partners.
Last week, a slick video featuring schoolchildren singing "Huawei Is Beautiful" circulated on Chinese social media; the company said the video was made by supporters on the internet without its participation. Huawei "appreciates customers' attentions and concerns," a company statement said.
In his news conference at Huawei's Chinese headquarters, Guo, who serves in the company's rotating chairmanship, accused U.S. agencies of hacking Huawei servers and stealing emails and source code.
The allegation that the National Security Agency hacked Huawei's servers in 2007 surfaced in 2014, based on documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Huawei is not the first company the U.S. government has barred over national security concerns. In September 2017, government agencies were barred from using software from the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab. The company sued, but its case was dismissed.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Thursday that he was unaware of Huawei's legal action against the U.S. government but that it was "totally reasonable and totally understandable."
Concern about Huawei is based partly on a 2017 Chinese law requiring Chinese companies to cooperate with that country's national security agency.
Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has said he would rather close the company than compromise clients' security or give national security officials access to data.
But European Commission Vice President Andrus Ansip has said that Huawei being subject to China's national security authorities was troubling. He said at a news conference last month that the task was not to look for evidence of past breaches by Huawei but to assess the risk of a future threat, Reuters reported.
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull -- who led the government when it barred Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE, from participating in its 5G rollout -- gave much the same assessment Tuesday during a speech in London.
"It is important to remember that a threat is the combination of capability and intent," he said. "Capability can take years, decades, to develop and in many cases won't be attainable at all. But intent can change in a heartbeat."
Australia is part of the "Five Eyes" network with which the U.S. shares intelligence, including Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Turnbull said pressure from Washington played no part in Australia's decision on Huawei.
Huawei has been at the center of accusations of intellectual property theft from U.S. companies, a core grievance in the U.S.-China trade war. In January, U.S. prosecutors indicted the company in two cases -- over allegations of intellectual property theft and fraud over hidden dealings with Iran. They accused Ren of repeatedly lying to U.S. officials over business dealings in Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.
Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, Ren's daughter, was arrested in Canada in December and has been indicted by the U.S. on charges of fraud over business dealings in Iran. She faces a May 8 extradition hearing in Vancouver in a case that has outraged Chinese officials. Meng is suing Canadian authorities over what she alleges were breaches of her rights during her arrest.
The vehemence of Chinese officials' reaction to Meng's arrest has raised questions about the closeness of company executives to state officials.
China's pressure on Canada to release Meng was swift and intense. Chinese authorities arrested two Canadians, whom it has accused of stealing state secrets, and boosted the 15-year drug sentence of another Canadian to the death penalty. Authorities this week banned imports of Canadian canola seeds by a major supplier.
Meng's lawyer Richard Peck raised concerns in a Vancouver court Wednesday that the U.S. case against her is politically motivated. He also suggested her arrest involved abuse of process.
He raised comments by President Trump, who said in December that he would be willing to intervene in the Meng case if it helped secure a trade deal.
New Zealand, which banned Huawei from its rollout of a 5G network, and Australia have seen recent actions from China that some suspect may have been in retaliation.
A New Zealand commercial airliner was turned back on its way to China for "technical reasons" because it lacked registration, Australian coal shipments to a Chinese port were delayed for "quality checks" and an Australian writer was arrested in China.
Meanwhile, news came that Australia's Parliament had been hacked by a "sophisticated state actor," although the country's identity has not emerged.

Texto completo: The often-coarse lyrics in rap music have increasingly been the target of legal battles, which is why a cadre of popular rappers - including Killer Mike , Meek Mill , Yo Gotti , Fat Joe , 21 Savage and Chance the Rapper - alongside several industry professionals and academics, filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
The brief encourages the court to hear the appeal of Jamal Knox , a rapper known as Mayhem Mal, who went to prison for threatening two police officers in a song. It also serves as "a primer on rap music and hip-hop" to educate the Supreme Court justices on the genre.
Knox was "found guilty of making terroristic threats and witness intimidation for writing and performing a 2012 song titled 'F - the Police.' According to the opinion, the song named and threatened two officers, Daniel Zeltner and Michael Kosko, and a music video for the song also featured photos of them," The Washington Post reported in August 2018, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld Knox's conviction, arguing the song and its threats weren't protected speech under the First Amendment.
The brief's purpose, they wrote, is "to put rap music, which is a heavily stigmatized form of expression associated with negative stereotypes and often subject to misinterpretation, in the context of the history and conventions of the genre."
The brief specifically examines other songs that include fictional threats against police officers, including Ice-T 's "Cop Killer." "Ice-T defended himself, saying, 'I'm singing in the first person as a character who is fed up with police brutality . . . If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut,'" wrote the brief's authors.
The brief also examined the song in question, calling it a "work of poetry" that is "not intended to be taken literally, something that a reasonable listener with even a casual knowledge of rap would understand."
In an interview with the New York Times, Killer Mike said that "outlaw country music is given much more poetic license than gangster rap, and I listen to both. And I can tell you that the lyrics are dark and brutal when Johnny Cash describes shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die and when Ice Cube rapped about a drive-by shooting early in his career."
"It's no different from stop and frisk," he said. "It's another form of racial profiling."

Stopover is a Savannah institution

Texto completo: One day in early February, two strangers at Foxy Loxy were talking about Stopover within earshot.
Both of them (I assume locals) were equally excited about the festival, but both proudly claimed they had no idea who was playing. They chatted about buying tickets, making sure they were each getting a full three-day pass. One even remarked that most of the bands aren't even in his "wheelhouse." He prefers brass bands like theRebirth Brass Band, which was playing a Savannah Music Festival event that weekend.
But he also remarked that despite not knowing the bands, or even caring for most of the genres, he still finds something every year that he likes, while he follows his "nerdy" friend around the festival.
Here is what's great about Stopover. For those really into music, this is a great festival to see, live in concert, indie or underground bands they love or have been following. For both the nerds and the neophytes (people who perhaps aren't as interested in following the music industry on a daily basis), Stopover provides a chance at discovering a new favorite band.
For those who follow indie labels like Kanine Records or Merge, there are a number of acts from those labels this year. Surfer Blood was an incredible late addition. There are punk bands, rappers, folks singers, indie-pop bands, and on and on, as it is every year.
It's all very fresh. Even industry stalwarts like headliners Deerhunter have a brand-new, highly acclaimed album. As Mugato would say, "Lucy Dacus is so hot right now." A number of the acts have been featured in major media outlets like NPR, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and The New York Times. Many are, as Stopover's mantra has also always been, on the verge of breaking out.
The Beths are an incredible band from New Zealand that are not to be missed. Mike Krol is bringing girlfriend and bassist Alison Crutchfield with him. Crutchfield played solo at Stopover in 2017, and along with her twin sister Katie, form the great Waxahatchee.
Stopover is awash with new music, of what musicians are doing now - not 10 years ago, or even five years ago. It's not, however, an ode to the Top 40, thankfully. Stopover is showcasing what young legitimate musicians are doing these days.
Some national publication once said Stopover was "South By Southwest's (SXSW) grungy little sister." Perhaps that was true, but SXSW isn't what it once was and even though Stopover was founded as a stop for bands headed to the infamous gargantuan, heading into its ninth year, it's so much more than that now.
Stopover is a solidified annual Savannah institution.
Beyond being an obvious economic and cultural asset, Stopover has increased the city's visibility within the music industry, cultivated a regional and local following and opened the door for major bookings of great bands outside the festival's three days. Mitski played solo at El-Rocko last year in part due to Stopover's influence, for example. Even some of the bands Stopover booked early on, were later booked for repeat Savannah gigs by the city's stalwart music festival, The Savannah Music Festival.
It feels now like Stopover is the Music Festival's grungy little sister, if SMF is that refined older brother in a button-down shirt and nice slacks who likes the indie stuff, but prefers to sit down and listen to an aged Jeff Tweedy sing amazing solo songs. (That April concert will be amazing!)
Stopover is Wilco in the late 90s.
In this hyperbolic analogy, I suppose, Savannah Voice Festival would be Savannah's very sweet grandparents. AURA Fest is that weird cousin who's nice, but into some wild stuff. The Savannah Jazz Festival is the cool uncle, who on sultry summer nights taught you to gamble and drink.
For such a small town, it's amazing that we have such an array of different music festivals. We cover all of those in Do, because they're great for different reasons. But they all offer incredible live music for all tastes and flavors, to adoring fans, music nerds, and tourist stragglers.
This is a great city and Stopover is now as much a part of it as any festival. So buy a ticket. See a bunch of shows. Have some fun. Find a new favorite band. Find me. Let's talk about music.

Texto completo: SHEBOYGAN - Theater for Young Audiences will continue the celebration of its 30th season by mounting the fully staged production of "Junie B. Jones The Musical Jr" on the John Michael Kohler Arts Center theater stage.
TYA's production, which features 25 youths, is based on four of Barbara Park's best-selling books which are brought to life in an adaptation created specifically for Broadway Junior performers.
Barbara Park was best known as the creator and author of the New York Times best-selling Junie B. Jones series. The stories feature an outrageously funny young student who has kept kids and grown-ups alike laughing for decades. The series has sold over 60 million copies in North America alone and is a staple in elementary school classrooms around the world.
In this production, Junie B. experiences her first day of first grade when she discovers she has trouble reading the blackboard and she may need glasses. Add in a friendly cafeteria lady, an intense kickball tournament and a "Top-Secret Personal Beeswax Journal" ... first grade has never been more exciting.
TYA's artistic director Hannah Benton is the stage director and choreographer. Katy Ries is director and music director, Kiyohe Lopez is set and property designer, Isabel Wills is costume designer and Valerie Hoffman is lighting designer.
"Junie B. Jones The Musical Jr." will be performed at JMKAC with a 6:30 p.m. show on March 15 and 2 p.m. shows on March 16 and 17. Tickets may be purchased online at www.tyasheboygan.org. Audience members are cautioned to secure tickets early as shows may sell out. The performance run time is one hour.
The talented cast features numerous newcomers to the stage but TYA veteran actor Lucy Thoresen plays the title and lead role of Junie B. Jones.
Other principal roles are filled by Bella Szyman, Jack Feider, Abby Wetzel, Brady Baker, Jonah Wieland, Owen Traas, Emma Annis, Kasey Levinsohn, Molly Rankin, Ellie Turcotte, Aliyah Huerta, Natalie Huerta, Elsa Schuette, Isabel Brennan, Rebecca Shvartsman and Olivia Vue.
Rounding out the ensemble, playing Junie B.'s classmates, are Ashton Ehlert, Audrie Hall, Audrey McMullen, Nozomi Nichols, Liv Pothast, Lauren Radke, Juliana Wetzel and Hope Wills.

Trump se burla de Hillary Clinton por declinar competir en 2020… y ella ¿recula?

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump se burló de Hillary Clinton , después de que ésta afirmara en una entrevista que no competiría por la presidencia en 2020.
“La (corrompida) Hillary Clinton confirma que no se postulará en 2020, descarta una tercera candidatura para la Casa Blanca” , escribió el mandatario “¡Maldición! ¿Eso significa que no volveré a competir contra ella? ¡Ella será muy extrañada!” .
“(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for White House.” Aw-shucks, does that mean I won’t get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 5, 2019
Sin embargo, menos de 24 horas después de que Clinton apareciera ante la cámara de News12 Westchester y descartara postularse para la presidencia en 2020, fuentes afirman que la demócrata estaba sorprendida de que su anuncio ¡se tomara en serio!
“No estoy compitiendo” , dijo.
Aunque fuentes del New York Times afirman que afirman que ella sigue analizando participar en la contienda electoral, en espera de los resultados de la investigación de Robert Mueller sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016.
Según la periodista del Times, Maggie Haberman , una persona cercana a Clinton le confirmó esa información.
“Hablé con alguien cercano a Clinton que estuvo en contacto con ella hoy. Dice que ella no estaba tratando de ser enfática al cerrar la puerta sobre competir cuando se dirigió a un periodista local ayer, y que se sorprendió de cómo fue tratado el tema”, escribió Haberman. “La persona también dice que es extremadamente improbable que compita, pero que le molesta que se espere que cierre la puerta cuando, digamos, John Kerry no lo está. Ella le ha dicho a su equipo que está esperando al menos ver el informe de Mueller”.
The person also says she is extremely unlikely to run, but that she remains bothered that she’s expected to close the door on it when, say, John Kerry isn’t. She has told her team she is waiting at least to see the Mueller report. 2/2
— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) March 6, 2019
Clinton perdió las elecciones presidenciales de 2016 ante Trump y dijo que planeaba tomar un papel activo en el Partido Demócrata ante la próxima elección.
Se reportó que la exsecretaria de Estado ya se reunió con algunos de los aspirantes a candidato del 2020 y ofreció consejos para no dar “nada por sentado” ante el actual mandatario.

Texto completo: Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg unveiled a major strategy shift on Wednesday, declaring that the world's largest social network will develop a highly secure private communications platform based on the company's popular Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp services.
The new platform will complement the original Facebook service, an open forum where over 2 billion people exchange news and information, but also marks a significant pivot for the company and the social media industry.
The billions of dollars spent annually by advertisers to reach Facebook users have made Zuckerberg one of the world's wealthiest men. But users are growing increasingly uneasy with the underlying premise of the company's business model: tracking their personal data and selling it to advertisers and others.
On Wednesday, Zuckerberg said consumers are now demanding a more private, more personal online experience.
“I believe the future of communication will increasingly shift to private, encrypted services where people can be confident what they say to each other stays secure and their messages and content won't stick around forever," Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post. “This is the future I hope we will help bring about."
The move follows a brutal series of crises at Facebook. The company has been implicated in efforts by the Russian government to tamper with the 2016 US presidential election. Personal information on about 50 million users was illicitly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Data on millions of other Facebook users was stolen by hackers, and Facebook was used to spread hateful and misleading messages that may have inspired murderous violence in the nations of Myanmar and India.
The scandals have hammered Facebook's reputation. Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook and author of “Zucked," a highly critical book about the company, said that Zuckerberg's announcement is partly intended to break the cycle of bad news. “Their brand is getting crushed," said McNamee. “They need a PR win."
David O'Brien, assistant director of research at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, compared Zuckerberg's statement to the 2002 “Trustworthy Computing" memo issued by Microsoft Corp.'s cofounder Bill Gates. Back then, Microsoft had developed a terrible reputation for building insecure, easily hacked software. The top-to-bottom transformation of the company's security practices announced by Gates helped rescue its image.
“This is the Trustworthy Computing moment all over again," said O'Brien.
Zuckerberg said that all the messaging services would use end-to-end encryption to ensure that nobody — not even Facebook — could view the contents except senders and recipients. This would make it impossible for Facebook to use the information for marketing purposes, raising questions about how the company will profit from the service.
In addition, Facebook will redesign Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram so that they will seamlessly communicate with one another, instead of operating as separate, incompatible services. This part of the plan was previously announced in January. Critics of the company said that it was intended to fend off a possible demand by US antitrust regulators that Facebook divest one or more of its messaging services. If the three messaging networks are tightly connected, such a divestiture could become almost impossible.
But Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, thinks app integration is also paving the way for Facebook to become a financial powerhouse. The New York Times has reported that the company is looking to establish its own cryptocurrency, a potential rival to bitcoin. Cusumano said that this could enable Facebook to become an international currency exchange system, enabling users to instantly shift money anywhere in the world through the merged instant messaging network. Facebook could profit either by charging fees or by earning interest on money deposited by users.
If it works, Facebook would make a fortune off the messaging system, even without advertising revenues, Cusumano said.
The new network would also embrace the concept of self-destructing messages first popularized by Snapchat. A user could order the software to wipe any message after a month or a year. Or it could be programmed to archive old messages indefinitely.
Snapchat's parent company, whose stock was already trading about 40 percent below its March 2017 initial public offering price, fell 2 percent on Wednesday. Facebook rose less than 1 percent.
Zuckerberg also promised that Facebook would only store its users' information in countries that respect human rights, especially privacy. “Upholding this principle may mean that our services will get blocked in some countries, or that we won't be able to enter others anytime soon," Zuckerberg said. “That's a trade-off we're willing to make."
By contrast, Apple has agreed to store information about its Chinese customers in China, raising the possibility that the Chinese government might force the company to hand over information about political dissidents.
It's unclear whether the proposals will lead to changes at the original Facebook service. The company has said it will soon enable Facebook users to delete their entire usage history. But it's unknown whether they'll be given the option to delete data selectively — for instance, by wiping out their comments and posts after a year has passed.
Longtime Facebook watchers reacted to the news with a mixture of praise and skepticism. “Privacy safeguards for Facebook users are long overdue," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Nonetheless, Facebook dominates the Internet messaging market. To ensure competition and innovation, there should be other companies, and Facebook should be required to divest WhatsApp."
McNamee said that better private messaging does little to change the fact that Facebook uses a variety of other methods to monitor the behavior of billions of Internet users.
“They track people everywhere," said McNamee. “So until they stop tracking people everywhere, they're going to remain a huge challenge for consumers."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Senators on Wednesday warned that Saudi Arabia is committing a growing list of rights abuses, citing the detention and alleged torture of a U.S.-Saudi physician, adding to pressure on the Trump administration to reconsider its close ties to the country's rulers.
In a hearing to appoint new ambassadors to Saudi Arabia and Iraq, both Republicans and Democrats listed complaints, from Riyadh's role in the Yemen war to the grisly murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, to the detention and torture of women's rights activists.
The senators also discussed the case of Dr. Walid Fitaihi, a dual Saudi-American citizen who has been held in a Saudi prison since November 2017 without charge, advocates said this week. The Freedom Initiative, an advocacy group, said Saudi officials may have tortured Dr. Fitaihi, who is now in a prison hospital in a deteriorating state of mental and physical health.
"Despite Dr. Fitaihi refraining from political commentary, his influence and prominence landed him in prison," the statement said.
The State Department said it had provided consular assistance to Dr. Fitaihi.
"We also call on the government of Saudi Arabia, and all governments, to treat prisoners and detainees humanely, and to ensure that allegations of abuse are investigated quickly and thoroughly," a State Department official said in a statement.
Saudi officials didn't respond to a request for comment. They haven't publicly addressed Dr. Fitaihi's case.
Senators grilled retired U.S. Army Gen. John Abizaid, the nominee for ambassador to Saudi Arabia, for details on how he planned to manage the relationship with the country and with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said Saudi Arabia is the most difficult U.S. partner and is testing the limits of the relationship by committing "grotesque" human rights violations at home and abroad. He described Prince Mohammed as "ruthless," "reckless" and increasingly untenable.
"He's gone full gangster. And it's difficult to work with a guy like that no matter how important the relationship is," Mr. Rubio said.
The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Prince Mohammed likely ordered the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, who was lured into a consulate in Istanbul and dismembered by a hit squad.
Saudi officials have denied Prince Mohammed had any role in Mr. Khashoggi's death and said they are seeking justice.
President Trump has disavowed the U.S. intelligence assessment and nurtured close ties with Saudi Arabia as part of a wider strategy to counter Iran's influence in the region and rally Arab support for a long-awaited solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Senators also questioned Saudi Arabia's role as an ally in the region and said the country continues to export a radical interpretation of Islam that fuels extremism and terrorist groups.
"Saudi Arabia historically has been both a firefighter and an arsonist when it comes to the fight against terrorism," Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) said. "They also have exported a version of Islam that forms the building blocks of extremist movements."
Gen. Abizaid told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the relationship with Saudi Arabia was bigger than the crown prince and represents a "vital national interest." He insisted that Saudi Arabia has made progress on rights and has recognized the need for societal change.
"The situation is getting better," Gen. Abizaid told the committee. "I believe the country's leadership is committed to that."
In another case that has stirred concern, a relative of American Bethany Vierra said this week that she is unable to leave Saudi Arabia with her four-year old daughter after divorcing her Saudi husband.
Nicole Carroll, the relative, told The Wall Street Journal that Saudi guardianship laws prevented Ms. Vierra from either renewing her residency papers or traveling overseas with her daughter without her ex-husband's permission. Despite the divorce, he legally remains Ms. Vierra's guardian. The case was first reported in the New York Times.
Ms. Vierra wants the U.S. to help her become her own legal guardian, to give her an opportunity to fight for access to her daughter, Ms. Carroll said. The State Department said it was aware of reports about Ms. Vierra's case and declined to comment further due to privacy considerations.
Amnesty International, an advocacy group, said Wednesday that women face systematic discrimination in the Saudi guardianship system, and female rights advocates in Saudi Arabia had been detained, tortured and sexually abused in jail.
"Saudi Arabia must urgently grant independent monitoring bodies immediate and unfettered access to the detained activists to investigate these shocking torture allegations," regional director Heba Morayef said in the statement. "The international community has a duty to hold Saudi Arabia to account for its grim human rights record."

Amazon's hard bargain extends far beyond New York

Texto completo: SEATTLE - When Texas officials pushed Amazon to pay nearly $270 million in back sales taxes in 2010, Amazon responded by closing its only warehouse in the state and scrapping expansion plans there. Two years later, the officials agreed to waive the past taxes in exchange for Amazon opening new warehouses.
A similar scene played out in South Carolina, where officials decided in 2011 to deny Amazon a sales tax break. After threatening to stop hiring in the state, the company got the tax exemption by promising to hire more people.
And last year in Seattle, the company's hometown, Amazon halted plans to build one tower and threatened to lease out one under construction when local officials pushed a tax on large employers. The City Council passed a smaller version of the tax, but the company helped finance a successful opposition to repeal it. Now, Amazon plans to lease out its space in the tower under construction anyway.
In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio called it a "shock to i the system" when Amazon, facing criticism for the deal it reached to build a headquarters in the city, abruptly dropped the plans. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is still trying to woo them back. But the reversal mirrored the company's interactions with officials in other states.
Virtually all of America's largest businesses drive a hard bargain with governments, angling for benefits and financial incentives. Amazon, though, often plays politics with a distinctive message: Give Us what we want, or we'll leave and take our jobs elsewhere.
The tactics help Amazon squeeze as much as possible out of politicians.
"They are just as cutthroat as can be," said Alex Pearlstein, vice president at Market Street Services, which helps cities, including those with Amazon warehouses, attract employers.
New York's experience with Amazon also exposed the company's limited experience with building community relationships. The company did not hire any local employees or lobbyists to connect with New York residents in advance of announcing the deal. Until recent years, almost no one at the company worked full time in community or government relations, though it now has more than 100 lobbyists registered in state-houses to push its priorities.
That lack of a significant on-the-ground strategy helped doom the deal in New York, and it is causing headaches elsewhere.
Amazon's promise to deliver practically any item within two days means that it needs warehouses near major population centers, not just where it gets the best deal. In Edison, New Jersey, noise complaints pressured the company to spend $3 million to build a high wall around a warehouse. Outside of Chicago in Joliet, Illinois, Amazon pays for an extra police officer to help manage traffic - and lawmakers want the company to do more.
"Amazon doesn't like any friction," said Margaret O'Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who researches the history of tech companies. But the desire for more urban locations, she said, means "it can't be my way or the highway."
The company's initial pitch is usually simple, saying that its offices and warehouses will deliver quality jobs. And it banks on the public's widespread trust in the company's low prices, wide selection and fast delivery. Many politicians and locals are delighted when Amazon arrives and say that the company delivers the jobs it has pledged.
Overall, the company has collected more than $2.4 billion taxpayer subsidies for its offices, warehouses and data centers, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit organization that tracks corporate tax breaks.
A company spokeswoman said, "Amazon has created more than 250,000 full-time American jobs and has invested hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy." She added, "We are active participants working to support the communities where we operate."
Asked recently by a business publication if Amazon would change anything about the headquarters search in retrospect, Holly Sullivan, the Amazon executive who led the search, said: "You know, no. I think it was rewarding for us internally." - (The New York Times)

ProPublica’s “Blood Will Tell” Wins Scripps Howard National Journalism Award

Texto completo: The Scripps Howard Foundation announced Tuesday that ProPublica won the Scripps Howard National Journalism Award in human interest storytelling for “Blood Will Tell,” a two-part investigation jointly published by ProPublica and The New York Times.
ProPublica senior reporter Pamela Colloff, also a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine, reported the story of Joe Bryan, a beloved high school principal whose wife, Mickey, was shot to death in their Texas home in 1985. While not initially considered a suspect, Bryan was arrested and charged with her murder. The prosecution’s case rested largely on the testimony of a “bloodstain-pattern analyst,” a police detective whose interpretation of the bloodied evidence made the state’s circumstantial case against Bryan seem plausible. In the end, jurors found him guilty. Now 78, Bryan has been behind bars for 31 years.
Colloff used an inventive approach to investigate both the case and the forensic science at its heart: She became an expert in bloodstain-pattern analysis herself. All it took, she learned, was a 40-hour class. Police officers around the country who had taken just such a class, including the detective who testified at Bryan’s trial, had been deemed experts by courts around the country.
After enrolling in a weeklong class in the subject, Colloff soon discovered that she and her classmates — all law enforcement officers or crime lab technicians — were being schooled less in the scientific method than in the art of being expert witnesses. Her immersion in the discipline allowed her to understand the otherwise forbidding-sounding jargon that analysts often wield in court, which ultimately gave her the authority to challenge the prosecution’s findings in the Bryan case.
Colloff’s dissection of the case and the practice of bloodstain-pattern analysis had real-life repercussions. Days after the article’s publication, the Texas Forensic Science Commission retained an independent expert to re-examine the bloodstain-pattern analysis used to convict Bryan. The commission found that the expert whose testimony helped secure the conviction was “entirely wrong,” and that his claims were “not accurate or scientifically supported.” The state’s case unraveled further when the expert admitted that his conclusions were incorrect. Texas’ highest criminal court is now considering whether or not to overturn Bryan’s conviction.

Texto completo: Anyone who considers themselves a fan of popular music has maybe found themselves in a similar scenario to one I've encountered many times over the past year and a half. That's roughly the amount of time since the Harvey Weinstein allegations and the #MeToo and Time's Up movements opened the floodgates to new misconduct allegations against public figures and resurfaced damning allegations that had previously been on record.
Repeatedly, I've been confronted with disturbing accusations about artists and their alleged violence against their accusers. Some of these musicians are among my all-time favorites, like David Bowie, whose association with underage groupies was mythologized decades ago and has recently been more critically re-examined. The list of accused artists includes names whose songs meant a great deal to me in the past, or soundtracked some of my most cherished musical memories, like the indie bands I loved in college – Real Estate, Das Racist and more – who have had members accused of sexual assault.
Other implicated bands or artists have music that's held up as the best of their genres and is so widely played that even if I wanted to completely escape their influence, I couldn't. Think Michael Jackson, accused of molesting underage boys, or The Beatles, with John Lennon's self-described domestic abuse, or Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones, with both bands having plenty of ill-advised lyrics and histories of reportedly bad behavior in their legacy.
I'm speaking as a music listener raised on these rock 'n' roll greats, but my experiences extend to any XXXTentacion fan who connected to the rapper's raw-emotion lyrics while feeling horrified about the domestic violence charges against him, as well as to Ryan Adams' devout followers who have made the singer-songwriter a cult favorite, who was faced with The New York Times' recent damning story about his alleged misconduct – and especially to R. Kelly's loyal fandom, left to reckon with the horrifying alleged crimes by an artist who has made some of R&B's most enduring tracks.
So how do we decide when to turn someone's music off, and where do we go from there? I'm not here to tell anyone that they're a monster for not turning off a Chris Brown song when it comes on the radio, or that every song with a lyric that aged poorly should be banned. But I've learned to be a more conscientious music fan because I believe that listeners' choices can make an impact.
It's about empathy
The question of whether fans can separate the art from the artist is nothing new. Why do I necessarily need to stop listening to a musician's songs at all if I'm able to appreciate the art while condemning the artists' actions?
For me, it's a matter of empathy – that I believe accusers' stories about these harmful (almost exclusively) men in music. And if I believe that Ryan Adams' accusers are telling the truth, and I still make the conscious decision to stream his music or buy a concert ticket, I see that as a selfish act, signifying that I value these women's stories less than I do a pleasurable listening experience or a night out for myself.
After reading many victims' stories, I've realized that separating the alleged abusers from their art becomes complicated because in many cases, their music gave them the platform and resources to commit their alleged crimes.
In the cases of Adams and R. Kelly, both men allegedly dangled promises of mentorship in front of teenagers interested in music careers, which, if true, were just a bait-and-switch to involve them in underage sexual relationships.
The new Michael Jackson documentary "Leaving Neverland" alleges the singer used his wealth and fame to gain the trust of families of the accusers, which he exploited to allegedly commit sexual crimes. And a common refrain among the participants in "Surviving R. Kelly," the Lifetime documentary outlining the singer's alleged misconduct that likely contributed to his arrest, was how powerful the network was around him at protecting him from scrutiny and disempowering his accusers.
For me, there's no way I can consume music made by alleged abusers and not feel like I'm part of the problem, like I'm just another listener choosing to ignore the reports against the artist and continuing to pay them money and attention, while upholding the power structure that contributes to these crimes happening in the first place. Whether that means choosing not to stream an R. Kelly song or including a footnote of Michael Jackson allegations when I write about his undeniably beloved catalog, these actions take a conscious effort, and I'm working to get better at being more conscientious.
Leaving behind a musician doesn't mean letting go of your memories
I'm still grateful for the musical education I received from the rock greats whose behavior, glamorized at the time, has rightfully been re-contextualized in recent years as potentially abusive. I don't feel guilty about the times in my life that I enjoyed a song, having no way of knowing that a decade later, the artist would be outed as an alleged criminal.
And yet, fans' deep emotional attachment to these artists complicates how they respond to these stories. On social media in the hours after the Ryan Adams story broke, people wrote about how his music got them through serious illnesses and other trials in their lives. Kelly's music has been a staple of graduations, weddings and other joyful events his entire career. And how many scores of artists were inspired to make music by Michael Jackson?
Instead of feeling ashamed about the meaningful moments in my life that I wish I could retroactively change the soundtrack to, all I can do is try, moving forward, to engage with music that doesn't elevate these artists further.
Musical canons can be reconsidered
Particularly when it comes to rock 'n' roll, canceling the classic artists with misconduct allegations in their pasts may seem like canceling an entire genre.
But, while I can't change the fact that the same 1960s greats who potentially committed atrocious acts against women also made some of rock's most influential music, I've been inspired by the ongoing conversation about re-emphasizing the works of female artists in the popular music canon.
Rather than declaring that half a generation of rock stars are canceled and unlistenable, why not shift the attention to the great women who should be just as celebrated as their male peers?
That was the thought behind NPR's groundbreaking "Turning the Tables" series, which began in 2017 and continued through 2018, which argued that female artists have generally been seen as less influential in their respective genres, and that a correction is needed that places classic works by women more centrally in music history.
The series emphasized classic works by Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Joni Mitchell, Alanis Morrissette, Shania Twain and Lauryn Hill, all artists that I'd listened to, sure, but not as much as I had the same few male rock stars with allegedly violent pasts. Diving into their lesser-known works, I felt like an idiot for having deprived myself of the greatness of these women for so long and for not doing enough in the past to challenge what kind of artists I've always considered the greats – i.e., mostly white men.

Texto completo: Not long after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y, was elected last November, she began gathering support for a "Green New Deal," mobilizing young climate activists and pushing Democratic leaders to pursue the concept. The idea, which was first floated by New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in 2007, is modeled on Franklin D. Roosevelt's sweeping Depression-era New Deal and proposes tackling climate change as a massive job creator to boost the American economy. In its current form, it also marries climate action with a host of other progressive aims. On Feb. 7, Ocasio-Cortez introduced a nonbinding resolution articulating what a Green New Deal might include, from eliminating fossil fuels entirely to establishing universal health care and ensuring stronger rights for Indigenous people and nations. Here's the proposal - and some context - by the numbers:
68 Number of co-sponsors of the nonbinding resolution as of Feb. 15.
Zero Number of Republicans who have signed on.
35 Percentage of co-sponsors who come from Western states, including California, Washington, Colorado and Arizona.
$4.03 Average hourly wage for a U.S. worker in January 1973.
$23.68 Equivalent hourly wage in today's dollars, in terms of purchasing power.
$22.65 Average hourly wage of a U.S. worker as of July 2018.
457,169 Estimated number of jobs in the wind and solar energy industries as of 2017.
11.3 Estimated percentage of the energy Americans used in 2017 that came from wind, solar, hydropower and biomass.
80 Estimated percentage of the energy Americans used in 2017 that came from fossil fuels.
Zero Percentage of the energy mix in the Green New Deal resolution that would come from fossil fuels.
10 Number of years the resolution proposes for achieving that goal.
Just over one Number of centuries fossil fuels have dominated U.S. energy consumption.
8 Percent by which natural gas production is expected to rise in 2019, projected to be the highest year on record.
$500 billion Projected annual cost of climate change to the U.S. economy by 2100, if temperatures increase by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or more.
$1 trillion Projected cost of climate change-related infrastructure and coastal real estate damage in the U.S., if temperatures increase by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or more.

U.K. royals to block internet trolls on social media sites
LONDON | Britain’s royal family warned Monday that it will block internet trolls posting offensive messages on its social media channels — and may report offenders to police.
Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace spelled out the policy banning offensive, hateful and racist language. The royal households say they reserve the right to determine who is violating their guidelines, and whether or not comments could be blocked.
Pharrell to launch music festival in April
NEW YORK | Pharrell is heading home to Virginia Beach to launch a new music and culture festival.
The Grammy-winning superstar announced Monday SOMETHING IN THE WATER, a multi-day event he’s calling a “cultural experience” that will debut April 26 to 28. He will perform on a stage set on the beach; other performers include Missy Elliott, Travis Scott, Migos, Dave Matthews Band, Janelle Monae, Diplo, SZA, Lil Uzi Vert and Pusha T.
Ryan Adams’
tour canceled
NEW YORK | Singer Ryan Adams’ upcoming tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland is canceled following reports of psychological abuse and sexual misconduct.
The cancellation comes after The New York Times recently reported the misconduct allegations against Adams made by multiple women, including his ex-wife Mandy Moore. Seven women have claimed Adams offered to help them with their music careers but then turned things sexual, sometimes becoming verbally abusive. Adams has denied the accusations.
Disney cuts future potential earnings for CEO
NEW YORK | The Walt Disney Co. is cutting $13.5 million of CEO Bob Iger’s annual future potential earnings ahead of the closing of Disney’s $71.3 billion acquisition of Fox’s entertainment assets.
The move comes ahead of Disney’s annual shareholder meeting Thursday. A year ago, shareholders voted against Iger’s pay package at the shareholder meeting in a non-binding vote that the company said it would take into consideration for future compensation.
The company is cutting an annual base salary increase of $500,000 that Iger was set to receive when the Fox deal closes and maintains his current base of $3 million. It cuts the annual bonus he was set to receive by $8 million to $12 million. It also cut his annual target long-term incentive award by $5 million to $20 million.

Democrats get nothing from Ilhan Omar other than her anti-Semitism

Texto completo: I'm going to make a rare concession about someone who I think fundamentally does not understand basic economics, has no respect for constitutional liberalism, and is second only to President Trump in her onion-thin skin and relentless hostility toward the press.

I get why people like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

It's objectively impressive that she beat out a Democratic stalwart and became the youngest woman ever elected to the House. After five years of Obamacare further consolidating the health insurance cartel and corroding consumer power, nearly a decade of Republicans promising they'd repeal and replace Obamacare the moment they took power, and two years of Republican power resulting in nothing serious, I understand why well-intentioned young people would gravitate toward the radicalism of "Medicare for all."

Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is attractive, and much like President Trump, she can be charming in spite of a propensity to get defensive at times. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will have to handle her policy radicalism, but there are also benefits to keeping her around.

But there's another Democratic FreshFace TM whose value I fail to understand. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., another democratic socialist, checks off all the progressive check boxes, but unlike Ocasio-Cortez, her only contribution to the debate since entering Congress has been to spew anti-Semitic drivel about once a fortnight.

Here's an incomplete list of Omar's greatest hits of Jew-bashing and genocide-baiting:

In 2012, Omar invoked the classic anti-Semitic trope of the vast Israeli conspiracy "hypnotiz[ing] the world," asking Allah to "awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."

In 2013, Omar blamed terrorism on American "involvement in other people's affairs" during a radio interview with Ahmed Tharwat, who previously equated Hamas to Holocaust victims and referred to Israel as the "Jewish ISIS."

On her very first day in the House, Omar palled around with Linda Sarsour. Sarsour has ardently defended Rasmea Odeh, a terrorist convicted of murdering two Jews, and Louis Farrakhan, who has compared Jews to termites.

After Bari Weiss of the New York Times called out Omar for her past of anti-Semitic rhetoric, the congresswoman finally apologized for the 2012 tweet and for not previously "disavowing the anti-Semitic trope I unknowingly used."

But then the next month, she claimed that AIPAC controls Congress' support of Israel, evidently because it pays members to support Israel. As she put it, "It's all about the Benjamins."

Pelosi and the Democratic House leadership condemned the remarks, demanding an apology from Omar, who issued a milquetoast equivocation that Democrats tepidly accepted. But later in February, at a public event, an audience member shouted, "It's all about the Benjamins!" Omar smiled along knowingly.

Over the weekend, Omar sparred with fellow Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, who called out the congresswoman for continuing to peddle anti-Semitic tropes. Omar responded by doubling down on the notion that American Jews who support Israel hold dual "allegiance" to "a foreign country."

For all the fracas, what benefit has Omar given the Democratic Party? She's currently riding on the coattails of Ocasio-Cortez while failing to provide any tangible policy benefit to the party. Omar has outright humiliated herself in public appearances, most notably during her questioning of Elliott Abrams in the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She not only failed to address him by the proper name and employ correct pronunciation and enunciation, but she also advanced an aggressive narrative that was inaccurate and perhaps even anti-American.

Either the Democratic Party leadership has ceased to care about anti-Semitism, or they're scared that enough of their base has come around to embracing it that they'd rather remain silent than do something of substance. And that's a prospect that's far more horrifying that anything Omar has said herself.

Did Bolton blow North Korea talks?

Texto completo: President Trump’s second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last week was criticized by both parties in Washington long before Air Force One even touched down in Hanoi. Washington’s political class seemed terrified that the nearly 70 year state of “war” with North Korea might actually end. In the end the only positive thing they could say about the meeting was that Trump apparently walked away with nothing to show for it.
The location of the meeting – Hanoi, Vietnam – serves as a great example of what can be won in peace versus what is lost in war. After losing nearly 60,000 US service members in an unnecessary war that took a million Vietnamese lives, the US loss of the Vietnam war resulted not in a communist takeover of southeast Asia but something very different: the domino theory failed because communism was destined to fail. Now we are close trading partners with an increasingly pro-market Vietnam. The result of trade and exchange versus war is a better life for all.
Unfortunately for Washington, the real lesson of Vietnam has not been learned. That is why the Republicans, Democrats, and the entire mainstream media spoke as one against President Trump’s decision to take a bold step and actually meet again, one-on-one, with one of our “enemies” to see if we can avoid nuclear conflict.
One leading Democrat, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), attacked Trump for meeting with Kim because speaking to the North Korean “gives him legitimacy.” Does it make any sense that we should not even speak with our nuclear-armed adversaries because it gives them “legitimacy”? He’d rather have a nuclear war as long as Kim remains “illegitimate”? This is sadly the kind of thinking that prevails in Washington.
The media reported that Trump walked away from the meeting before the scheduled signing ceremony and closing press event. The talks broke down, it was reported, because Kim demanded an end to all sanctions before any reduction in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. Washington sighed with relief and said all together, “better no deal than a bad deal.”
Meanwhile the North Koreans held a rare press conference clarifying that they only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling one of their main nuclear facilities. Further, press reports began to surface that National Security Advisor John Bolton threw additional demands on the table which led Kim to draw the meeting to an early close.
Who’s telling the truth? We likely won’t know. But given Bolton’s strong opposition to any kind of peace agreement with North Korea it’s hard to doubt that he had something to do with the blow-up of the summit. As the New York Times reported over the weekend, while Trump’s advisors were shocked when he decided to meet Kim face-to-face the first time for negotiations, John Bolton wasn’t worried at all. As the Times writes, “Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.” And so they did.
Will Trump continue to allow his diplomatic efforts to be undermined by his own staff? Let’s hope the president will ignore Washington, ignore the neocons, and continue to work for peace with North Korea.
Dr. Ron Paul is a former member of the House of Representatives. This article was written for and published by the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity.

Texto completo: With his eleventh novel, "The Feral Detective," Jonathan Lethem seems to have returned to the detective story, his third in that genre. But the narrator of his latest novel isn't a hard-boiled detective like the "private inquisitor" in "Gun, with Occasional Music," or like the detective with Tourette's syndrome in "Motherless Brooklyn." No, this narrator is a 33-year-old woman named Phoebe Siegler, a New York liberal whose "mouth won't quit." Phoebe is so angry about the 2016 election of the "orange monster" that her story becomes the rarer detective-political allegory. If you're a fan of Donald Trump, you are not going to like this book.
Phoebe quits her job as a "decorative editorial flunky" at The New York Times, and in January, just before the inauguration, goes west in search of her friend's daughter Arabella Swados. Arabella, a fanatical fan of the singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, has dropped out of Reed College in Oregon and has gone to California to find Cohen. He was rumored to be living in Los Angeles County on Mount Baldy with Buddhist mystics. It turns out Cohen has been living in "Los Angeles proper, among the Jews and pop stars." But Cohen dies just before the election, and Arabella disappears and has been missing for three months, since sometime in September.
Phoebe tracks Arabella from Oregon to L.A., where the police offer little help in finding the missing 18-year-old. The cops, however, do direct Phoebe to a social worker who recommends that she contact Charles Heist, nicknamed "the feral detective." She enlists Heist's help. Heist is a 50-ish big-headed fellow with bushy eyebrows and sideburns. He wears a red leather cowboy jacket with white leather-trimmed vest pockets and cuffs like a uniform or an emblem. Instead of a bottle of Scotch and a gun, Lethem endows Heist with a sickly possum in his desk drawer, and a young, wild, rescued girl in his office. Phoebe calls Heist "attractive, with an undertow of disgust." Naturally, she develops a yen for him.
The two set out in the area around Los Angeles called the Inland Empire, with its deserts and mountains, to find Arabella. Lethem must have had fun playing with character names and literary allusions. The name "Charles Heist" sounds suspiciously like "Jesus Christ," and Phoebe is 33 years old, the age of any number of literary Christ figures (and considered by scholars the age Jesus may have been when he was crucified). Lethem, who divides his time between Brooklyn and Blue Hill, isn't sure you'll get the Christ-figure business, so he describes a minor character as "Christ-bearded" and another guy with "Jesus-y hair" so you make the connection. But it takes the both of them to create one Christ figure. "We might each have a separate fight and a separate fighter whose pain was our own," Phoebe says, "yet this incoherence made us one thing together." Together Charles Heist and Phoebe are one savior: they save Arabella and they save each other.
The two eventually come across desert people called Bears and Rabbits. The Bears are predominantly men - ex-cons and bikers - and a few female groupies; the Rabbits are generally females with some mostly mild-mannered males. They all began as hippies, one of the Rabbits says, and adds, "Humans are born polymorphous and free." Some other shifty and dangerous folks are out there, too, motley off-the-grid misfits, kidnappers and human traffickers who've taken advantage of and even murdered runaways, abused children and teens caught up in cults. The Bears began as the "Bear-Killers," whose original king was Howard Burkhardt. Now, they have a new, potential king, the crazy Solitary Love who claims to be an "Enduring Storm vet." But Heist was born in the desert and lived in Viscera Springs for a few years. He's part Bear, part Rabbit, and he eventually sets out to meet and challenge Love in a brawl-to-the-death for the title of Bear King that turns into a tag-team match.
Like any good detective story, there's plenty of adventure, violence, some sex, and there's that opossum, too. Everyone loves opossums, don't they? But this allegory disguised as a detective story portrays political division in America - between rural and city folk, men and women, old and young. The characters are fleshed out as Bears and Rabbits with Heist as that middle-of-the-road creature with a foot in each tribe. As Phoebe and Heist search for Arabella, Phoebe imagines her mission is to "infiltrate and explicate" the Great Out There and to write a glorious op-ed piece for the Times or Harper's about the "monster in the tower" and "insane (expletive) Trump supporters." It's an interesting story with lots of the usual Lethem touches, but it offers no easy or certain resolution to the dissension in the country. Still, to paraphrase Phoebe, this story trumps anything I possibly could say in a review. And to quote her, "I hate how that word is ruined, among so many other ruined things."

The great hypocrisy of the Green New Deal

Texto completo: Not ready for prime time. That was the consensus reaction to the Green New Deal, released last month by freshman Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
The Economist called the proposal “deeply unserious.” A Washington Post editorial labeled it as “fantasy.” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote that it would result in “the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the Washington elite in our history.”
But the Green New Deal isn’t just lousy policy. It’s incredibly hypocritical.
In boosting the plan, for instance, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “the world will end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.” It was a hyperbolic summary of an alarmist and scientifically unsound United Nations report on greenhouse gas emissions.
Enter, the hypocrisy.
If a climate change-induced existential crisis were, indeed, just around the corner, the most rationale response would be to gin up all the nuclear power the world can get. After all, in 2017 nuclear provided more than half (56 percent) of the country’s emissions-free electricity — more than triple the amount we get from wind and 18 times more than solar generates generation.
But, according to the now-deleted FAQ sheet from Ocasio-Cortez’s office, “The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear plants unnecessary.” Launching “a massive mobilization of all our resources into renewable energies,” while eliminating emissions-free nuclear power is the most inefficient and expensive approach to carbon reduction possible.
The hypocrisy doesn’t end there.
Green New Dealers are trying to sell their policies in the name of economic security and justice. However, policies that take away affordable, reliable power from American families are highly regressive. Higher energy costs hit low-income households hardest, because they spend a higher percentage of their budget on energy. The higher these costs climb, the more they are forced to make difficult choices between keeping the heat on or providing food for their family or perhaps going to the doctor.
Higher energy prices mean more than just having less money available for other necessities. It means having to spend more for all of the goods and services you purchase. That’s because energy is a critical component of manufacturing, communications and transportation—all of which are involved in getting goods and services to your household.
The Green New Deal doesn’t lead to more economic security and justice. It leads to greater economic strain, with low-income families being stressed the most.
And where’s the justice in cronyism and corporate welfare. The Green New Deal would open the floodgates of both.
Ocasio-Cortez rightly blasted New York’s special tax breaks for Amazon’s proposed HQ2. Offering up billions in state and city special tax breaks left a sour taste in many peoples’ mouths.
Cronyism works for big companies because they can offer a lot: investment, jobs and prosperity. But it is not a strategy for long-term economic success because it comes at the expense of other investments and opportunities. The investments will come when there’s an attractive, level-playing field for all companies to compete.
The Green New Deal would introduce significantly higher level of cronyism because Ocasio-Cortez wants the federal government (i.e., American taxpayers) to pay for the whole thing.
Remember Solyndra, the half-billion dollar solar boondoggle that went belly up? That’s just a small taste of things to come under a Green New Deal that puts potentially trillions of dollars up for grabs. As was the case with Solyndra, when the feds start picking energy technologies and companies to fund, they are essentially gambling with other peoples’ money. And there is never a guarantee the bet will pay off.
Solyndra is merely one example of a failed company that could not survive even with the federal government’s help. And there are many other examples of green cronyism that even more closely parallel New York’s erstwhile deal with Amazon, which Ocasio-Cortez found so distasteful. Taxpayers gave money or government-backed loans to companies that already enjoyed large market capitalization and/or substantial private investors. Federal “investment” wasn’t needed. But, hey, who’s gonna turn down free money?
The economic pain of green cronyism cuts deeper than wasted taxpayer money. When Washington steers money to — or away from — “favored” businesses or technologies, private-sector investment follow. This not only stifles competition and innovation, it also centralizes control in the hands of politicians, elites and lobbyists.
That’s the big picture. But the Green New Deal has very personal ramifications as well. It would change the way you live your life — from what car you drive, to how cool or warm you you’re your home, to what you eat.
The stench of hypocrisy makes it all that much worse.

Cloud over Kushner clearance; Refusal to produce documents could lead to subpoenas

Texto completo: Top House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to its security clearances process by Monday, an escalation of the yearslong fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.
The move follows an explosive report that President Donald Trump interceded to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from top intelligence officials. The president directed his then-chief of staff, John Kelly, to approve the application - a move Kelly, who had expressed concerns about the entire process, later detailed in a memo.
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with outstanding requests the panel had made related to security clearances for much of the past two years.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word subpoena in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggested he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
The White House still has not given the panel documents, arguing instead that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters.
Cummings' frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith - and in private - to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Cummings' letter cited reports that Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner a long-delayed clearance and that Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem early last year. Trump's push to get Kushner clearance - and the chief of staff's concerns about it - was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance. The Washington Post later reported on Trump's actions.
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told The New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News earlier this month that her father was not involved in the process.
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about Kushner's lack of a permanent clearance. Indeed, Democrats on Capitol Hill are also now questioning why Kushner had such trouble attaining that status.
"These new reports raise grave questions about what derogatory information career officials obtained about Mr. Kushner to recommend denying him access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, why President Trump concealed his role in overruling that recommendation, and why General Kelly and Mr. McGahn both felt compelled to document these actions, and why your office is continuing to withhold key documents and witnesses from this committee," Cummings wrote Friday.
The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings even garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of beating his ex-wife, had been denied a clearance but still worked in a top position.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings' pleas to subpoena the information.

Ruffling Feathers in a Global Conversation on Income

Texto completo: AMSTERDAM -- First, Rutger Bregman came for the globalists.
In late January at Davos, the Swiss resort where the world's political and financial elites gather each winter, Mr. Bregman bluntly asked why his hosts do not pay more tax.
"It feels like I'm at a firefighters' conference and no one is allowed to speak about water," he said. "We've got to be talking about taxes," he added. "Taxes, taxes, taxes."
Three weeks later, the young Dutch historian came for the nationalists.
Invited on Fox News by Tucker Carlson, who described his earlier outburst as "one of the great moments in Davos history," Mr. Bregman quickly questioned his host's sincerity and accused him of being a mouthpiece for the billionaire class.
"You're all like: 'Oh, I'm against the globalist elite, blah, blah, blah,"' Mr. Bregman, 30, told Mr. Carlson, who responded with a foul-mouthed rant. "It's not very convincing."
To the extent that bookish economic historians can rampage, Mr. Bregman is on one. And the world has taken notice: Videos of the two incidents have been watched millions of times across dozens of websites, and Mr. Bregman has been inundated with hundreds of interview requests. (In a statement, Mr. Carlson said no one has ever told him what to say on the air.)
On a cloudy recent day in Amsterdam, Mr. Bregman was bashful about the reasons for his newfound celebrity.
"It's entertainment, right?" Mr. Bregman said. "Someone taking down Tucker Carlson is just good fun, let's be honest."
Then again, Mr. Bregman has been saying these kinds of things for years -- calling for higher taxes, a shorter working week and a universal basic income -- and never captured the global imagination the way he has this past month.
That, he said, is because "of something bigger that is happening."
Mr. Bregman is part of a wider wave of young activists, thinkers and politicians that includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old new Democratic congresswoman, and Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate protester, whose radical alternatives have, crucially, begun to garner mainstream acceptance.
"The success of these kind of things, and the extraordinary rise of someone like A.O.C., are all symptoms of the times," Mr. Bregman said. "The whole zeitgeist is shifting."
But what is specific to thinkers like Mr. Bregman is the ideological context, or lack thereof, in which they came of age.
He grew up in the decades either side of the millennium, in which grand ideological battles were considered to be a thing of the past.
Centrist politicians like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair -- and here in the Netherlands, Wim Kok -- instead sought to triangulate between Left and Right, and to tinker here and there with the status quo rather than articulating bold visions of the future.
But when the economic crisis struck in 2008, revealing how that status quo was not nearly as inevitable as previously assumed, it left an ideological vacuum. The far right has filled part of it, but so have parties and thinkers on the left, among them Mr. Bregman, who combines a detailed approach to economic policy with a utopian vision of a better future.
"He is a very practical person," said Bas Heijne, a leading Dutch essayist and commentator. But "he wants to reinvigorate idealism, and in that sense he's very much part of his generation."
His prominence over the past month is, nevertheless, something of an accident. His fiery performance at Davos was a last-minute decision. He didn't initially intend to talk about tax.
His Fox appearance also almost never saw the light of day. Mr. Carlson refused to broadcast it, and Mr. Bregman was ambivalent about releasing his own recording on social media, wary of endorsing a kind of confrontational public discourse that leaves little room for dialogue.
At the same time, his piercing of the global consciousness has been a long time in the making.
Mr. Bregman is already the author of four books -- most notably, "Utopia for Realists," which was published in the Netherlands in 2014, reached the United States two years ago, and has been translated into 32 languages.
In the book, which careens between anecdote, academic research and statistics in the manner of a more politically-radical Malcolm Gladwell, Mr. Bregman sets out an idealistic vision that many would dismiss as pure fantasy.
He argues for a 15-hour working week, a world without borders and a basic salary for every citizen (the Utopian part), while highlighting examples of how these policies have already been partially implemented in recent history (the realist bit).
He tells readers of how a universal basic income, a concept now considered far-fetched, was in fact almost introduced in the United States during the Nixon presidency, and how an iteration of it was supported by Milton Friedman, the neoliberal economist.
He cites the example of a Canadian town where all citizens received a basic annual income of $19,000 in the 1970s -- a program that barely dented their enthusiasm for work, but which was accompanied by a drop in crime, truancy, hospital attendance, domestic violence and poverty.
In the eyes of Rob Wijnberg, Mr. Bregman's editor at The Correspondent, an online journalism portal, it is this work that provides "a way better reason to put him in The New York Times than the controversy that made him well-known in the last couple of weeks."
The son of a pastor (his father) and a teacher (his mother), Mr. Bregman grew up in a town in southern Holland, before studying history at Utrecht University at both the undergraduate and master's level.
After briefly teaching at Utrecht, Mr. Bregman felt he would find life as an academic historian too dry. He opted against embarking on a doctorate, and instead joined The Correspondent at its launch in 2013.
While most historians conduct their research at universities, Mr. Bregman is a kind of in-house historian at The Correspondent, an innovative Dutch outlet whose reporters are encouraged to take their time, write about topics far from the news cycle and keep their readers informed of their research.
He works like an academic researcher, plunging for weeks into the history of policies like the universal basic income, surfacing every month or so with a new article. The ensuing work provided him with the basis for "Utopia for Realists."
Unsurprisingly, he has attracted some brickbats, even from the left.
Mr. Heijne, the essayist, admires Mr. Bregman, but feels his focus on economic solutions comes at the expense of questions of identity and belonging that have become central to current social tensions.
Other leftist critics fear Mr. Bregman's version of a basic income would mean an end to the welfare state -- or just wouldn't work in practice.
"When his self-styled utopia is widened to include completely open national borders," wrote John Harris in the New Statesman, a British political magazine, "everything threatens to fall apart."
Mr. Bregman is not immune to such doubts himself. But, ultimately, he argues that it is only by dreaming about what seems to be unachievable that society can make good things possible.
"It's pretty clear that 30 years from now things will be considered common sense that are seen as completely bizarre nowadays," Mr. Bregman said.
"The question is: Will history move in the right direction? And I'm not sure about that. But I'm doing my best to contribute."

Texto completo: Democrats step up
demands in probe
New questions aboutWhite House clearance House investigators are demanding that the White House turn over documents related to the security clearances of top officials by Monday, an escalation of a fight between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration that could lead to subpoenas in the coming days.
The move follows the revelation that President Trump interceded to give his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a top-secret security clearance despite concerns from intelligence and White House officials about Kushner's contacts with foreign individuals and his failure to disclose them on his clearance application. Both of those factors ordinarily would all but guarantee that an applicant not be given access to government secrets.
Overriding those concerns, the president in May 2018 directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to approve the clearance application. Kelly, who had already stripped Kushner of an interim, temporary clearance, documented the president's intervention in a memo.
House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), in a letter to the White House on Friday, urged "full and immediate compliance" with requests the panel had made related to security clearances over the past two years. Cummings's staff in a Friday phone call with White House officials tried to confirm the existence of the Kelly memo and a second written by former White House counsel Donald McGahn. The White House refused three times to confirm or deny the documents' existence, Oversight Democrats said.
"I am now writing a final time to request your voluntary cooperation with this investigation," Cummings said in the letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
While Cummings did not use the word "subpoena" in his letter, his recent correspondence with the White House suggests that he is open to one: Cummings told the White House in early February to let the committee know "whether you intend to comply voluntarily or whether the committee should consider alternative means to obtain this information."
U.S. officials who were charged with investigating Kushner's suitability to hold a security clearance grew concerned before Trump's son-in-law arrived at the White House. Law enforcement officials focused on meetings Kushner held in December 2016 with the Russian ambassador and a banker from Moscow, according to people familiar with the matter.
The meetings - with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Sergey Gorkov, the head of Vnesheconombank - were not initially reported on Kushner's security clearance forms.
Kushner held an interim clearance for much of the first year he worked in the White House. But his extensive foreign contacts, his complex business arrangements and his failure to disclose all the contacts on his form - which he amended three times - kept him from obtaining a full clearance, according to current and former officials familiar with the process, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive administration deliberations.
Adding to concerns, U.S. intelligence also intercepted conversations of foreign officials discussing how Kushner could be influenced because he was searching for financing to salvage a troubled real estate investment, according to people with knowledge of those intelligence reports. They also remarked that Kushner was naive about foreign policy, which made him pliable, these people said.
In February 2018, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein told McGahn that significant information developed in the course of Kushner's background investigation would delay his obtaining a permanent clearance, people familiar with the matter said. It's not clear that Rosenstein mentioned any specific problems.
But current and former U.S. officials said Kushner's debts were of particular concern at the time, including hundreds of millions he owed on an office building in Manhattan. When determining whether to grant a clearance, officials look for ways that foreign governments might exert leverage on a U.S. official, and financial distress is one red flag.
While he held an interim top-secret clearance, Kushner was able to get access to even more highly classified intelligence, known as sensitive compartmented information. Generally, that information comes from the government's most sensitive human or technical sources. In Kushner's case, he was able to read the president's daily intelligence briefing, sit in on meetings where classified information was discussed and issue orders, or tasking, to intelligence agencies, according to people familiar with the matter.
That all changed in late February 2018, when Kelly changed the rules for holders of interim clearances, stripping Kushner of his access. Then, in May, Trump ordered Kelly to make Kushner's clearance permanent.
Today, Kushner has a top- secret clearance, but he doesn't have the more sensitive compartmented clearances, according to U.S. officials.
The White House has argued that the president traditionally has broad authority over his executive staff and clearance matters. It has also sidestepped the House panel's request to interview employees in the White House Personnel Security Office, which oversees the clearance process.
Cummings's frustration with the lack of response was clear in his Friday letter.
"Since I sent my letter on January 23, I have been negotiating in good faith - and in private - to try to obtain the information the Committee needs to conduct its investigation," Cummings wrote. "However, over the past five weeks, the White House has stalled, equivocated, and failed to produce a single document or witness to the Committee."
Both Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump, Kushner's wife, have publicly denied that the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told the New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News last month that her father was not involved in the process.
A spokesman for Abbe Lowell, the lawyer for Kushner and Ivanka Trump, would not discuss the ABC interview or what clearances she holds.
"Whatever the accuracy or not of recent news stories, Mr. Lowell was not aware of nor told of any request for or action by the President to be involved in the security clearance process," said Peter Mirijanian, the spokesman. "Again, officials affirmed at the time that the regular process occurred without any pressure."
A person familiar with Ivanka Trump's account said she maintains that she spoke accurately to ABC.
The White House security clearance process has been a major focus for Oversight Committee Democrats over the past two years. Cummings garnered bipartisan support for his bid to investigate the matter in the wake of reports that Rob Porter, a former White House aide who had been accused of domestic violence, continued to work in a top position while holding only an interim security clearance.
At the time, Republicans controlled the House, and then-Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) joined Cummings in requesting more information about the process. When the White House ignored the requests, however, Gowdy refused Cummings's pleas to subpoena the information.
Now, with Democrats in charge of the House - and Cummings wielding expansive subpoena authority - the White House won't be able to ignore Congress's questions without the potential for an adverse response. Already, there has been an intense back-and-forth between the panel and the White House, as Cummings relaunches his own investigation and increases the pressure on the administration.
In his Jan. 23 letter to Cipollone, the lawmaker asked for a series of documents to be handed over to the panel, including the policy governing how the White House grants security clearances and any recent changes to the policy, particularly those to give classified information to people convicted of crimes or under investigation by law enforcement.
The panel also asked for all communications between Trump's transition team regarding background investigations, clearance applications and the outcomes for nearly 10 top officials it wanted to home in on. That list included Kushner as well as national security adviser John Bolton; Bolton's predecessor Michael Flynn; Flynn's son; and Sebastian Gorka, a former White House official.

Texto completo: Prosecutors may be looking into Assange's release of military logs
Chelsea Manning has been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury in the investigation of Julian Assange, officials said, one of several indicators that prosecutors remain interested in WikiLeaks' publication of diplomatic cables and military war logs in 2010.
Prosecutors in Virginia have been pursuing a case based on conduct that predates WikiLeaks' publication of hacked emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, and it's not clear investigators are interested in that activity. Officials discussed the investigation of Assange, who founded WikiLeaks, on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy of the grand jury process.
Manning, whose subpoena was first reported by the New York Times, is a former Army private who served seven years in a military prison for passing secret State Department cables and military documents to WikiLeaks before rece iving a commutation from President Barack Obama.
Manning's attorneys have filed a motion to quash the subpoena.
"I object strenuously to this subpoena, and to the grand jury process in general," Manning said in a statement. "We've seen this power abused countless times to target political speech. I have nothing to contribute to this case and I resent being forced to endanger myself by participating in this predatory practice."
The subpoena was signed last month by Gordon Kromberg, a national security prosecutor on the Assange case. Kromberg last month persuaded a judge to leave sealed an indictment against Assange despite its inadvertent exposure in an unrelated court filing last year.
Under Obama, Justice Department officials had decided not to pursue charges against Assange and WikiLeaks after concluding that to do so could set a precedent that paved the way for prosecuting news organizations for publishing classified information. But the case got a fresh look under President Trump.
Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said the Justice Department likely indicted Assange last year to stay within the 10-year statute of limitations on unlawful possession or publication of national defense information, and is now working to add charges. "There's nothing else that would make sense," he said.
"The heart of the controversy is, there's never been a successful prosecution" for publishing classified information, Vladeck said. "There has always been the specter of a First Amendment defense."
Peter Zeidenberg, a national security defense attorney, said he cannot see grounds for Manning to refuse the subpoena. "She's already been prosecuted, she's been convicted, she served a sentence," he said. "She has no Fifth Amendment privilege over self-incrimination. If she doesn't testify then she'll be held in contempt."
Manning appears to be the latest individual subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury investigating Assange in the Eastern District of Virginia.
Last July, computer expert David House, who befriended Manning in 2010 at a hacker space in Boston he founded, testified for 90 minutes before the grand jury. In an interview, House said he met the WikiLeaks founder in January 2011 while Assange was under house arrest at Ellingham Hall, a manor house 120 miles northeast of London. Assange was fighting an extradition request by Sweden, where he faced an inquiry into allegations of sexual assault.
Assange asked House to help run political operations for WikiLeaks in the United States. "Specifically, he wanted me to help achieve favorable press for Chelsea Manning," he said.
House, who testified in exchange for immunity, said the grand jury was interested in his relationship with Assange. "They wanted full insight into WikiLeaks, what its goals were and why I was associated with it," he said. "They wanted explanations of why certain things occurred and how they occurred. . . . It was all related to disclosures around the war logs."
The grand jury seemed interested in whether Assange had solicited Manning to hack on WikiLeaks' behalf, but did not press "very hard" on that, he said.
During her trial, Manning testified that she acted on her own to send documents to WikiLeaks and no one associated with WikiLeaks pressured her into giving more information.
House was not asked about WikiLeaks' 2016 release of Democratic emails, which U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed were hacked by Russians. Nor did he have personal knowledge of that, he said.
He was never told what charges prosecutors were contemplating.
House said his last contact with Assange was in 2013 and his last contact with WikiLeaks was in 2015.
House said he fears retribution for being associated with WikiLeaks and Manning in 2010 and does not believe the U.S. prosecution is warranted.
"This is not an investigation borne out of a concern for national security," he said. "It is an investigation borne out of retribution and revenge against Mr. Assange over the [2010] leak that he precipitated, and how this leak impacted the careers of politicians in Washington, D.C."
Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a onetime WikiLeaks spokesman who has grown estranged from Assange, said in an interview he was contacted by the German federal police in October 2017 and told that U.S. authorities wished to talk to him "about the Manning-Julian connection." He also received a March 2018 letter repeating the request from then-U. S. attorney in the Eastern District, Dana Boente.
He said the German police told him the FBI was interested in "what possible contact - possible coordination'' occurred between Assange and Manning, he said. The Americans appeared to be interested in "possible solicitation" by Assange of Manning, he said.
Domscheit-Berg told the German police he was not interested in speaking to the FBI.

Resumen: "The idea is to have a cultural, educational, as well as commemorative institution," Nasser al-Kidwa, chairman of the Yasser Arafat Foundation, which pioneered the $7 million project with funds allocated by successive Palestinian Authority governments, told The New York Times at the opening. The museum asserts that the Palestinian leader was born in his grandfather's house in the Old City of Jerusalem, overlooking the al-Aqsa Mosque, on August 24, 1929, situating his birth at the contested heartbeat of the conflict. There are 27 photos of Palestinian leaders allegedly assassinated in world capitals by Israeli security services.

Texto completo: For a Jew, visiting the Yasser Arafat Museum in Ramallah is an unsettling experience.
Arafat, who would have turned 90 this year, is the closest thing Palestinians have to a Founding Father - their George Washington or David Ben-Gurion - except that his dream of an independent Palestine still is not realized 14 years after his death, and many believe that his violent form of leadership hindered the cause instead of helping it.
This museum, which opened in 2016 and retains the shine and hush of a brand-new building, is the closest thing Palestinians have to an actual tourist attraction in the West Bank territories now occupied by Israel, a gleaming contrast to Ramallah's haphazardly maintained buildings and scruffy streets.
I imagine that, for Palestinians, the museum stands as a monument to a heroic past and a taste of what a future Palestine could offer. Adjacent is the Palestinian president's headquarters. At the entrance is Arafat's tomb, a solemn landmark guarded by two stiff uniformed men.
"The idea is to have a cultural, educational, as well as commemorative institution," Nasser al-Kidwa, chairman of the Yasser Arafat Foundation, which pioneered the $7 million project with funds allocated by successive Palestinian Authority governments, told The New York Times at the opening.
But for this Jew, the museum presents a steady narrative that is both seductive and troubling. Some of its omissions and assertions are ridiculous, true, but the overall tone is not as bombastic and offensive as I thought it would be. Instead, the visitor is exposed to a storyline that quietly defies the Zionist narrative with which I was raised, and cleverly frames Arafat as a simple, courageous prophet leading his people in the Promised Land.
From birth to death, Arafat's life is not so much sugarcoated as subtly reconstructed.
The museum asserts that the Palestinian leader was born in his grandfather's house in the Old City of Jerusalem, overlooking the al-Aqsa Mosque, on August 24, 1929, situating his birth at the contested heartbeat of the conflict. But Israelis and many historians say he was born in Egypt and that he arrived in Jerusalem only after the death of his mother, when he was 4 years old.
Similar controversy surrounds his death. The museum asserts that Israel tried to assassinate him numerous times, and finally succeeded near Paris in November 2004 by poisoning him, based on evidence from medical reports "as well as official statements by Israeli officials." Israel, however, has denied involvement in his death, and French authorities have reaffirmed that he was not poisoned.
But clearly these claims serve a purpose, as do the origin mythologies of any national leader.
That mythology is dramatically advanced at the end of the historical exhibit, when visitors are led through an enclosed footbridge to the cramped, austere quarters where Arafat lived from 2001 to 2004, while he was under siege and surrounded by Israeli tanks and rubble.
A single, metal-frame bed is tucked into a corner, a bedside lamp shining halolike on a plain, nondescript covering. Opposite, four of Arafat's trademark khaki military uniforms are displayed hanging in an open closet. A Muslim prayer rug is folded on a wuuden chair. There is a pile of keffiyehs, his signature Arab headdress.
The mood is solemn, the message obvious: Forget the allegations of massive corruption and patronage that swirled around Arafat's rule and, arguably, deprived his people of what they deserved. Here is a revolutionary hero, living a Spartan existence. His wife, Suha Arafat, is not even mentioned; the only nod to his personal life are several photographs of Yasser Arafat with the couple's young daughter.
This repositioning is no more egregious than the lengths to which we Americans have gone to erase the distasteful aspects of our own Founding Fathers' lives. What I found more troubling was how, in Arabic and English, the museum presents the narrative of Arafat's life, juxtaposed with the Palestine Liberation Organization's chronology, in such calm detail that you could easily miss the omissions and storytelling twists.
The waves of Jewish immigration to British Mandate Palestine are seen as evidence of the growing power of "Zionist colonization" - particularly because when partition is proposed in 1947, there are twice as many Palestinians living there than Jews, and Jews get the majority of the land. But somehow, the Arab refusal to acknowledge Israel's existence and to accept the proposed sharing of the land is missing.
Massacres of Arab villages are sympathetically portrayed, as they should be. They were horrific and inexcusable. But Arab violence against Jews is underplayed.
The museum adopts a sort of passive rhetorical distance when describing certain events, as if Arafat and his supporters were somehow absent. The 1967 war, prompted by multiple Arab invasions of Israel, is described thusly: "The Arab-Israel War erupts and Israel occupies the remainder of mandated Palestine."
When Palestinians commit acts of terror, Arafat seems to bear no responsibility, and somehow the rescuers or victims are held to account.
So, in September 1972, "during the Summer Olympics in Munich, members of the Israeli Olympic team are taken hostage by members of the Black September Organization. German and Israeli security forces attempt a rescue, resulting in the deaths of all the hijackers and nine Israeli athletes. In retaliation, Israel bombs Lebanon, killing 400 civilians."
Or, in March 1978, a Fatah naval unit "storms the coast of Tel Aviv killing and wounding many Israelis. [Most] members of the unit are killed fighting the Israeli Army. Israel retaliates by sending 3,000 soldiers into Lebanon, occupying the south of the country and causing many casualties."
There are 27 photos of Palestinian leaders allegedly assassinated in world capitals by Israeli security services. But there's no personal reference to the individuals murdered by Palestinian terror directed or abetted by Arafat.
By the beginning of the 1990s, Arafat shifted his tactics toward negotiations and eventually embraced his onetime enemy with that famous, if reluctant, handshake with Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn, after signing the Oslo Accords in 1993. Two years later, Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli right-wing extremist, and the hardfought dream of peacefully ending the conflict began to unravel.
With the ensuing Palestinian intifadas and acts of terror, the construction of Israeli barriers and checkpoints and the continued occupation, Israelis and Palestinians know even less about each other than before. Israeli citizens (with the exception of the military) are not allowed in Ramallah, so the Arafat museum's version of their communal history - as flawed as it is - is not accessible, even to be hotly debated.
Perhaps, then, more American Jews should visit. It's certainly affordable: The entrance fee for a family is 2 dinars, the equivalent of less than $3. A visit will make you uncomfortable, defensive, maybe very angry. Or it could leave you impressed by the sophisticated presentation of a complicated story.
"Museums are not neutral!"proclaims a campaign to encourage museums to be more socially aware and inclusive. The same critique could apply to museums that offer hagiographical portrayals of national leaders and liberation struggles. That lack of neutrality may be infuriating, but it is also immensely educational and revealing.
I didn't leave Ramallah that day any more admiring of Yasser Arafat as when I arrived. I wished the museum grappled with the complexity of the Palestinian story more honestly, to puncture the fiction that Arafat's devotion to violence led to anything constructive and to face the fact that his autocratic rule of terror brought his people no closer to statehood.
But it also made me question whether the same intellectual honesty ought to be applied to the way we tell our own stones.

The Secret Jewish History of... HAWAII

Resumen: While the overthrow of the monarchy brought an end to the position of court Jew, in more recent times, and despite the fact that their population on the archipelago tops out at a mere 10,000, Hawaiian Jews have enjoyed success in the uppermost reaches of state government via the democratic ballot box: The first mention of Jews in Hawaii appeared in 1798, when a sailor on the whaling ship Neptune recorded in his ship's log that the Hawaiian king had come aboard with a "Jew cook." The Jewish population declined when military forces were moved closer to Europe with the advent of World War I. The growth of the University of Hawaii, founded around that same time, also accounted for a rise of American Jewish immigration; it also helped the population reach enough critical mass to establish a few small communal organizations and a Jewish cemetery.

Texto completo: There once was a land ruled by a King David. And unto the king from beyond the land came a wise man who was learned in the traditions of an ancient, foreign people; skilled at fortune-telling, and able to read the stars. The king took a liking to the man and spent many hours alone with him, learning the secret language of the scholar, listening to him chant his Holy Scriptures, and just generally enjoying male bonding with him over copious amounts of intoxicating beverages.
The resh, or holy scholar, flattered the king, and the king repaid the resh with a high position in the king's court, with a royal residence and with the spiritual ceremonial title of Big Kahuna, which the resh recognized as close kin to his own people's ceremonial high priests, the kohanim.
But opposition to the king's autocratic ways grew, and along with it envy and jealousy over the king's newly adopted foreign prince. The king's enemies objected to their ruler's imperial manner and took to mocking his counselor, calling him "Holy Moses" but not in a good way. Like Daniel in the lion's den, the resh read the writing on the wall, and he warned the king about his imminent downfall before fleeing to the land from whence he came; there he passed away within a month. True to the predictions of the resh, in short order the king was stripped of his powers and left a mere ceremonial figurehead. The king died within four years; his sister ascended to the throne as its final possessor, but within two short years, and with the backing of a great and powerful empire to the northeast, the monarchy was overthrown.
Yet for one brief, shining moment - perhaps only a matter of months, a half-year at the most - the most influential man in all of Hawaii was Elias Abraham Rosenberg, who arrived in Honolulu from San Francisco in 1886, bringing with him a Torah scroll and a yad, or pointer, and swiftly ingratiating himself with King David Kalakaua. Rosenberg's origins are a matter of some debate; some say he was born in Russia and that he apparently lived in England and Australia. Others say he originally fled San Francisco for Hawaii after selling one too many counterfeit lottery tickets.
Sixty years ago, in March 1959, Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act, which U.S. President Eisenhower signed into law; this paved the way for statehood status for the Polynesian archipelago, which became official in August of that year.
While Rosenberg may have been one of the most colorful Jews in Hawaii's history, he was certainly not the first prominent member of the tribe to make a mark on the region, nor was he the last. His service to King David was predated by that of Paul Neumann, who, like Rosenberg, was an emigre from San Francisco. Neumann, as the first Jew in Kalakaua's court, may have paved the way for Rosenberg. He and the king were known to enjoy many a good game of poker, and the king hired him to be his personal attorney. While the overthrow of the monarchy brought an end to the position of court Jew, in more recent times, and despite the fact that their population on the archipelago tops out at a mere 10,000, Hawaiian Jews have enjoyed success in the uppermost reaches of state government via the democratic ballot box: Linda Lingle became Hawaii's first Jewish (and first female) governor when she was elected to her first of two terms in 2.002, and Hawaii's Jewish current senior U.S. senator, Brian Schatz, moved with his family to Hawaii from Michigan when he was 2 years old.
The first mention of Jews in Hawaii appeared in 1798, when a sailor on the whaling ship Neptune recorded in his ship's log that the Hawaiian king had come aboard with a "Jew cook." Whether the menu included matzo balls and gefilte fish is not known. Jews first began arriving in Hawaii from the United States in the mid-19th century, when a steady flow of San Francisco-based Jewish merchants saw opportunities for trade between the islands and California, especially in sugar and coffee. As was the case historically, Jews also came to Hawaii and, catering to the influx of white North Americans to the island, set up shop selling dry goods in general stores.
The Jewish population of Hawaii ebbed and flowed over the years. In the early years of the 20th century it swelled to several hundred, most of whom arrived from the United States as part of the growing military contingent on the island. The Jewish population declined when military forces were moved closer to Europe with the advent of World War I. The growth of the University of Hawaii, founded around that same time, also accounted for a rise of American Jewish immigration; it also helped the population reach enough critical mass to establish a few small communal organizations and a Jewish cemetery.
Hawaiian Jews have risen to positions of prominence in other fields besides business and politics. Although born in Brooklyn, contemporary novelist Allegra Goodman was raised in Hawaii, where her parents taught at the University of Hawaii. Goodman's Hawaiian Jewish upbringing is often reflected in her writing. Her parents figured prominently in religious life on the island, where they were instrumental in forming the first Conservative Jewish congregation.
Oahu-born Makua Kai Rothman, widely regarded as the world's greatest Jewish surfer, was crowned Big Wave World Champion in the World Surf League in 2015. Rothman credits his Jewish father, Eddie Rothman, for instilling in him the can-do spirit needed for surfing big monster waves. Hawaii is also home to Alvin Wong, a Jewish convert whom The New York Times dubbed in 2011 "the happiest man in America."
But there is probably no better-known Hawaiian of Jewish descent in history than global pop star Bruno Mars. The Honolulu native's father, Peter Hernandez, was born in Brooklyn to a Puerto Rican father and to a Jewish mother whose family hailed from Ukraine and Hungary. Mars's second album was called "Unorthodox Jukebox," and it contained the song "Locked Out of Heaven," co-written, like many of his songs, by Ari Levine.
Still, it was Rosenberg's legacy that was most strongly felt in the Jewish community up until the time that the first synagogue was established on the archipelago. The yad and Torah scroll that Rosenberg left behind when he fled Hawaii in 1887 had fallen into the possession of the royal family, whose heirs loaned it to the local Jewish community for High Holy Day services and such in the early 20th century. The yad was given to the Reform synagogue Emanu-el upon the synagogue's dedication in 1960, and the scroll was handed over to the Jewish congregation in 1972.

Texto completo: Members of the press praised freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this week for how she questioned former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen Wednesday.

Cohen appeared before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday to testify after being sentenced to three years for lying to Congress and violating campaign finance laws. Ocasio-Cortez is one of the Democrats on the committee who questioned Cohen, and she won rave reviews from members of the press for how she asked her questions.

Washington Post congressional reporter Paul Kane lauded her questioning as the “very best,” and said other lawmakers should “watch and learn.”

“Here's clip of @AOC questioning, which was among the very best, drawing out information & possible further investigative leads. Others should watch & learn from her, from veteran Rs to freshman Ds (including some of her own friends/allies),” Kane tweeted Wednesday.

Ocasio-Cortez focused her questions on whether Trump ever inflated the value of his assets to an insurance company, and whether he tried to undervalue those assets to reduce his tax bill. An MSNBC analyst said her interrogation of Cohen was better almost everyone else's effort.

“.@AOC just got there and she is asking better questions than 90% of members. Short, specific, factual, with no speechmaking. (Maybe it's because she just got there.)” he tweeted.

Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, wrote an op/ed that appeared the New York Times Thursday that outlined how she believes Ocasio-Cortez “won the Cohen hearing.”

“[Her questions were] well thought out. Like a good prosecutor, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was establishing the factual basis for further committee investigation,” Fredrickson wrote. “She asked one question at a time, avoided long-winded speeches on why she was asking the question, and listened carefully to his answer, which gave her the basis for a follow-up inquiry.”

CNN political commentator David Axelrod linked to Fredrickson’s piece in a tweet where he praised Ocasio-Cortez for producing “real news.”

“I agree with this. @AOC asked incisive questions of Cohen on the tax and legal implications of how Trump values his properties. Real news,” Axelrod tweeted.

The Huffington Post called Ocasio-Cortez’s questioning “masterful.”

“The freshman New York congresswoman ‘expertly laid a trap’ to get President Donald Trump’s tax returns, and ‘won’ the Cohen hearing, according to two raving press accounts,” the Huffington Post reported.

A reporter with HuffPost said that Ocasio-Cortez “made it look easy.”

Ocasio-Cortez has entered Congress as a trailblazer and has drawn a lot of attention ever since winning in an upset primary challenge in 2018 that took out 10-term incumbent Democrat Joe Crowley.

New transplant policy may mean life, death

Texto completo: The change, enacted in December by the
organization overseeing all organ
procurement organizations in the U.S.,
replaces local and regional geographic boundaries that were used to match liver candidates. The new policy prioritizes cases based on concentric circles around
transplant centers and medical necessity.
This story is the second of two parts.
One of the biggest changes in liver transplant policy in years – set to take effect in April – could greatly affect Iowans on waiting lists for the lifesaving surgery.
But some of the state's top transplant surgeons disagree about whether it will actually help or hurt.
The change, enacted in December by the organization overseeing all organ procurement organizations in the U.S., replaces local and regional geographic boundaries that were used to match liver candidates based on donor location. For years that meant, barring emergency cases elsewhere, local patients received preferential access to the limited number of livers donated in their areas.
The new policy prioritizes cases based on concentric circles around transplant centers and medical necessity. In practice, many believe that would favor those who have been on waiting lists longer, often those in bigger cities in a given region.
In late January, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Joni Ernst and 20 other senators sent a bipartisan letter to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services questioning how the policy change will affect rural and low-income Americans.
Grassley's staff inquired in part because of concerns raised by Dr. Alan Reed, who heads the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics' Transplant Center.
Reed said the policy change will harm those with liver disease in Iowa who are awaiting donors and could threaten the viability of the center's liver transplant program.
UIHC is the only transplant center of four in the state that performs liver transplants — about 23 last year.
"Patients selected for liver transplants have to meet a number of requirements, including the ability to locate near their transplant center just to be placed on the transplant waiting list," Reed wrote.
Reed said under the new policy, patients in Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis would have to turn down a liver recovered in Iowa before it would become available to a patient on the center's waiting list.
The odds that would happen is high given the disparity in population bases under the new rules, he said. "So high that I fear for the sustainability of our program," he said.
Reed added: "If UI Health Care either receives fewer livers for transplant or has to close our liver transplant program due to lack of sustainable volume and ability to maintain our transplant team, Iowans will have to travel elsewhere for transplants."
Not everyone agrees But most Iowans already leave the state for liver transplants, and most livers recovered in Iowa go to patients elsewhere, statistics obtained from the Iowa Donor Network show.
The UIHC imports only a small number of livers recovered outside Iowa, and it used Iowa-donated livers in the 23 transplants conducted last year. Thirty-five livers recovered in Iowa went to patients outside the state.
Iowa's waiting list for livers is shorter than many, and included 28 this month.
The distribution change enacted on a federal level was initiated in part because of legal action facing organ procurement programs with longer waiting lists and poor track records.
Investigative reports in the past year in both the New York Times and the Washington Post have highlighted those failings.
Last summer, reporters at the New York Times found New Yorkers donate organs at a much lower rate — about 15 percent — than anywhere else in the country. That's despite the fact the city boasts world-class hospitals and transplant surgeons.
Problems meeting minimum performance standards were so great at LiveOnNY, New York's procurement organization, that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which oversees all such organizations, threatened to let its certification lapse. It opted not to.
LiveOnNY loses a quarter of its most promising cases because workers are unable to secure consent from the families of prospective donors — a loss of about 3,000 donors a year, the Times found.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has repeatedly found that organ procurement programs "do a poor job of recovering enough organs to meet the need," the Times report said.
The bipartisan letter drafted by Grassley's staff said the distribution change ignores the recommendation of the Liver and Intestine Transplantation Committee, whose members include leading transplant experts.
The change also failed to take into account regional variations in liver donation rates and disparities in the performance of organ procurement organizations, the letter said, and it appears to reward procurement organizations with histories of performance problems, like New York's.
But Qasim Chaudhry, who heads Iowa Methodist Medical Center's transplant program, said the distribution changes could ultimately save more lives.
Because transplant centers will compete in a wider region, they will have to take steps to procure more marginal organs to reduce wait times for patients, he said.
Chaudhry said both Iowa's procurement program and the UIHC have a reputation for being more conservative when it comes to placing donors' organs.
The University of Nebraska Medical Center's program in Omaha, where he trained, performs about twice as many liver donations in a year as the program at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, national statistics show. That's even though Nebraska has roughly 1.2 million fewer residents.
UIHC's waiting list is longer than other transplant centers in the region. As a result, most Iowans needing liver transplants leave for centers with shorter waiting lists, Chaudhry said.
Next up: Kidney transplants? Methodist has greatly increased its kidney transplants, obtaining donations from other Midwest states, Chaudhry said.
The center accepts some marginalized kidneys turned away by other transplant programs, but focuses more on patient care to assure strong outcomes after the transplant, he said. He acknowledges the hospital takes on a bit more risk, but says it's consistent with the mission of better outcomes for patients.
"It has to do with the leadership of the transplant center's philosophy," he said. "Until they change their mindset, it won't improve. Then the machinery kicks in to make more transplants happen."
Nine years ago, Methodist performed about 15 kidney transplants a year, he said. Now it does about 55 to 60, he said.
"We transplant people from New York, California and Alabama," he said. "People find us through Google because of the shorter waiting times. For a kidney, our wait is about a year or a year and a half. At Mercy, it's about five years. At the UIHC, it's about three years. Without competition, you can't raise your game."
But Suzanne Conrad, who heads the Iowa Donor Network, Iowa's only procurement program, said criteria for organ distribution depend on the organ. "And what may be fair for liver or heart may not be fair for kidney," she said.
The United Network of Organ Sharing, UNOS, which oversees all procurement programs, also has been exploring a concept of "continuous sharing" for kidneys, or sharing in concentric rings starting at 150 miles and going up to 500 miles from transplant centers.
Dr. Cass Franklin, who heads the transplant program at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines, said the reason is that organs are considered under law a national resource, and the government is responsible for the distribution. UNOS has been trying to strike a better balance between necessity and equity.
But under the new liver policy, there will be a larger radius of potential recipients under consideration, and decisions will hinge more on on medical necessity.
"The bar is so high, you have to be sicker to get the organ," Franklin said. "A lot of us would agree you don't want to wait until you are so sick, you run the possibility of not doing well after a liver transplant."
Franklin said transplant surgeons generally have "less better outcomes" using more marginal donors. "Not only that, if a patient presents earlier in their disease, it gives you an opportunity to select better donors and a better outcome."
Franklin said many liver transplants happen in Nebraska because that program has a long pedigree, and Iowans on the western end of the state are often referred there.
The bottom line, he said, is the nation needs more organ doors. "If we don't increase the resource, we're just dividing the pot differently."
Terri Doocy, a 44-year-old home health care worker in Algona, said people like her who are on waiting lists have to become their own experts, including researching average wait times.
Doocy was diagnosed at 30 with polycystic kidney disease, a genetic disorder shared by her brother.
She said she tried beginning last May to get on a kidney waiting list at Mercy Medical Center, but the process was taking too long.
She said it took less time — about two months — to be placed on the transplant list at Iowa Methodist.
"Methodist told me 18 months was the average wait," she said. "Mercy told me four to five years."

Texto completo: By the time Andre Previn became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, he had long rejected the trappings of Hollywood, where he had launched his career.
The four-time Oscar-winning composer had made a decisive switch to the classical music world, conducting the world's great orchestras, performing as a pianist and composing music for the concert hall.
Still, a bit of show business seemed to accompany his time in Pittsburgh. When his PSO tenure started in 1976, billboards announced "Previn!" was in town. Hollywood or not, he was a star, and he delivered a shot of energy into the orchestra and the city.
Andre Previn, the esteemed conductor, composer and pianist, died Thursday morning at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by his manager, Linda Petrikova, according to The New York Times.
Mr. Previn's arrival in Pittsburgh was greeted with such enthusiasm that the PSO added Thursday concerts and still sold out the season on subscriptions alone. And his style quickly made an impact, eliciting a transparent, warm sound from the orchestra.
The partnership soon after resulted in the Emmy-nominated show, "Previn and the Pittsburgh," produced by WQED-TV, which featured interviews; performances by the orchestra and Mr. Previn, who was an accomplished jazz and classical pianist; and appearances by guests such as Oscar Peterson, Yo-Yo Ma and Ella Fitzgerald.
Under his baton, the PSO hired several principal musicians, initiated a composer-in-residence program, garnered new recording contracts, and went on international tours for the first time in more than a decade, renewing the PSO's stature both locally and abroad.
Mr. Previn lived on Mount Washington during his time in Pittsburgh. His open-necked white shirt and sleeveless black tunic vest became a trademark of his style, at the same time that his attire raised eyebrows among conservative audience members. In 1980, one New York Times critic wondered whether the brawny Steel City was compatible with the Previn elegance and lightly textured musical style.
As the city's mood and spending power declined with the collapse of the steel industry, attendance at Heinz Hall followed suit. The sold-out houses, further tested by construction in Downtown, sank to 80 percent capacity in the 1982-83 season. The honeymoon was cut short, too, by criticisms of his interpretations and narrow preferences for repertoire of France, England, Russia and Eastern Europe.
The tension came to a head in 1984, when Mr. Previn suddenly resigned after an acrimonious power struggle with PSO managing director Marshall Turkin. He was released from his contract two years early and accepted the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, thrusting the PSO into a period of artistic insecurity.
For the man who had spurned Hollywood, Hollywood-level drama thus accompanied his sudden split from Pittsburgh. But the wounds would heal, and he returned to Heinz Hall as a guest conductor, most recently in 2012, when he led the world premiere of his Triple Concerto for Trumpet, Horn and Tuba, featuring three principal musicians.
"I never had a happier eight years," he told The Pittsburgh Press in 1984, after his resignation. "Not only will I never forget the audiences and this great orchestra, those memories will never dim. Things here were as good as I can imagine."
Born in Berlin as Andreas Ludwig Priwin, Mr. Previn studied at the Hochschule fur Musik and the Paris Conservatoire. His Jewish family fled from the Nazis in 1938 and settled in Los Angeles, where, as a teenager, Mr. Previn arranged music for MGM Studios and played chamber music with violinist Joseph Szigeti, according to "Play On," a book about the PSO by Hax McCullough and Mary Brignano.
He studied conducting with Pierre Monteaux while stationed in San Francisco with the U.S. Army. He won four Oscars for his music for "Gigi," "Porgy and Bess," "Irma la Douce" and "My Fair Lady."
He soon tired of the Hollywood world, however, and devoted his focus to classical music.
"I stayed in the movies too long," he told The Press in 1975, after he was named the PSO music director. "Hollywood is a dead-end street. Its music is dictated by the film, and that's the way it has to be. I cut way down in 1960, and have done nothing for the movies since 1964. That's a long time."
In 1963, he made his professional conducting debut with the St. Louis Symphony and held top conducting positions with the Houston Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in addition to Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.
Among his numerous prizes, he won lifetime achievement awards from the Kennedy Center and the Recording Academy, having won Grammys in various categories.
He married five times, including to actress Mia Farrow and violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. Mr. Previn's other wives were Betty Bennett, Dory Previn and Heather Hales.
His compositional output included the violin concerto "Anne-Sophie," written for fifth wife Ms. Mutter, whom he divorced in 2006, and the opera "A Streetcar Named Desire," which starred Renee Fleming as Blanche DuBois. He played piano with artists such as Ms. Mutter and cellist Lynn Harrell, and wrote several books about music.
In the twilight of his career, Mr. Previn was asked whether he felt he sometimes spread himself too thin.
"It's been thrown up to me most of my life: 'Why don't I just concentrate on conducting or composing or my own playing or on jazz?'" he replied.
"But the thing is that I'm naturally curious about a lot of different disciplines in music and I enjoy doing them. And as long as people are nice enough to let me, I'll keep on trying."
His motto, according to his website, was "A day without music is a wasted day," and by that mark, he wasted very few of them.

Don't write off bad boss Klobuchar for 2020 yet

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar sounds like a strange and unpleasant boss. New reporting on her management style is especially striking given her outward persona as a "Minnesota nice" next-door neighbor.
The record shows Klobuchar has consistently high staff turnover. Accounts in HuffPost, BuzzFeed News and The New York Times, based on reviews of documents and internal emails as well as interviews with as many as 20 former staffers who insisted on anonymity, suggest Klobuchar can be volatile, abusive and paranoid — dressing down aides in public and in humiliating emails copied to many others, calling their work "slop," suspecting them of sabotage, making it hard for them to find other jobs, making them pick up her clothes and wash her dishes (including a comb she used to eat a salad after berating an aide who didn't bring a fork).
Is it sexist to discuss this topic? Is it irrelevant? Is it unfair, given the deficiencies of the "manager" now in the White House? And is it so damaging that Democrats should write off Klobuchar as a presidential contender?
The answer in every case should be no.
Klobuchar is relatively centrist in a party moving left. This makes her the type of Democrat many Republicans and independents are hoping will win the 2020 nomination — that is, one they can vote for because they can't abide President Donald Trump. It also makes her the great hope of Democrats who believe that the overriding imperative in 2020 is to nominate the candidate who has the broadest appeal — particularly in the industrial Midwest's battleground states — and best odds of winning the White House.
In that respect 2020 is shaping up like 1992, when Democrats were determined to end 12 years of Republican presidencies. In focus groups and interviews I did for The Associated Press in New Hampshire, the overriding theme was electability. "I love (liberal populist Iowa Sen.) Tom Harkin but we have to win so ..." "I love (wildly unconventional Vietnam War veteran) Bob Kerrey but we have to win so ..." "I love (even more wildly unconventional former and future California Gov.) Jerry Brown but we have to win so ..."
The electable choice was a moderate Southern governor. The end of the sentence was always "I'm voting for Bill Clinton."
Klobuchar could bridge Democratic divides Of the major Democrats now running, Klobuchar most resembles that candidate in the abstract. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and others could eventually join her in the center lane.
Klobuchar has so far handled the party's left-center split in ways that reflect preparation and, one hopes, authenticity. Medicare for All? "It could be a possibility in the future. I'm just looking at something that will work now," like allowing the public to buy Medicare or Medicaid coverage, she said this month in her CNN town hall. Green New Deal? "An aspiration in that (it's) something we need to move towards," starting with immediately rejoining the Paris climate accord and restoring Obama-era clean power rules and gas mileage standards.
Nor did Klobuchar appear fazed when Bob Gigliotti, an assistant professor of business management at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, asked whether she is "a difficult person to work for." She replied that she had managed "hundreds of prosecutors" as Hennepin County attorney in Minneapolis and that, on Capitol Hill, "My chief of staff has worked for me for six years, my state director for seven years, my campaign manager for 14 years."
But even in Klobuchar's Hennepin County attorney days, there were oddities and complaints, and she knows she still has a lot to prove. She suggested the presidential campaign will be her crucible: "That's a pretty good way to judge people and how they manage something."
Volatility yardstick is crucial, not sexist bias She's right about that. One reason for Barack Obama's 2008 successes is that he demonstrated solid, disciplined management of his campaign from February 2007 to November 2008. That aura of steady competence, through crises as personal as his controversial pastor and as terrifying as Wall Street's meltdown, helped him beat the best known woman in the country in the Democratic primaries and the experienced (but sometimes impetuous) Arizona Sen. John McCain in the general election.
And it was not a bait and switch. Obama's presidency had its problems, but he ran an orderly, fact-based, minimal-drama administration that "the best people" did not flee or trash.
Are Klobuchar's apparent management flaws disturbing? Yes. Are they disqualifying? Not yet. In the next 20 months, she has a sustained chance to show she has learned and changed — that she can run a drama-free Senate office and a stable, even-keeled presidential campaign.
It's not biased to apply this yardstick. It has nothing to do with Klobuchar's gender or any double standard. Trump shows us every single day why competence, discipline and management skills are absolutely essential in the next president. It is a top consideration on my check list for all candidates, as it should be for every American desperate to end the Trump era.

Texto completo: One thing I learned while driving the Mobile Library in the area's Mardi Gras parades is that the people of Shreveport-Bossier really love books! Forget beads. Chants of "throw me a book" were heard at every turn of the parade route. While I could not throw any books, it was exciting to know that books were in high demand. And why shouldn't they be? Reading is amazing. At Shreve Memorial Library, we love our books and encourage everyone to read.
It doesn't surprise me that the people of Shreveport-Bossier love books. Thanks to them, Shreve Memorial Library was one of the top 40 participants in the Second Annual Beanstack Winter Reading Challenge. The challenge was sponsored by billionaire investor and Shark Tank personality, Mark Cuban, who pledged to donated $35,000 to the top-performing libraries and schools if a collective goal of reading at least five million minutes and 75,000 books during the month of January was achieved. Overall, schools and libraries across the country read over 13 billion minutes and 153,000 books. No, Shreve Memorial Library won't receive all of the $35,000 donation from Mark Cuban, but the library will receive a donation of $1,000 to be used for future programming and reading programs, like the new Read Around the World Reading Challenge beginning March 1.
The Read Around the World Reading Challenge is a new year-long reading program for children designed to broaden their appreciation and understanding of other cultures. The Read Around the World Challenge will continue through March 1, 2020. Children between the ages of 6 to 10 are encouraged to celebrate diversity by reading about unique people, places and cultures. The library has partnered with Fourteen Foods and Dairy Queen to provide tasty treats as incentives to reach reading goals.
Children and teens can also cast their votes for the Children's & Teen Choice Book Awards at any Shreve Memorial Library branch from March 1 through May 6. The Children's & Teen Choice Book Awards are the only national book awards voted on only by kids and teens. Launched in 2008 by the Children's Book Council and Every Child a Reader, the awards provide young readers with an opportunity to voice their opinions about the books being written for them.
Book lovers are also going to want to save the date for two great events taking place at the library, the Shreve Memorial Library Friends Book Sale and the Second Annual Shreve Memorial Library Children's Book Festival. The Shreve Memorial Library Friends Book Sale will take place April 6 and April 7 at the Main Branch in downtown Shreveport. The Book Sale will feature thousands of books, DVDs, CDs, and Collectibles at low, low prices (some even free!).
The Children's Book Festival will take place on Saturday, May 4 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the campus of LSUS. Headliners for this year's festival include Nick Bruel, author and illustrator of New York Times bestselling series Bad Kitty, and Anica Mrose Rissi, author of the Anna Banana chapter-book series, along with Don Tate, Brenda Maier, and Bethany Hegedus.
Books are great, and, of course, the library has many to choose from. Check out these new titles available at Shreve Memorial Library:
"Letters from Peaceful Lane" by Janet Dailey (fiction)
In the rugged Ozarks of beautiful Branson, Missouri, a woman struggles to save her marriage – and find answers from an unexpected source... Allison felt like she'd stepped into a fairy tale when she married widower Burke Caldwell. But after less than a year of marriage, he's become removed and distant. His friends see Allison as little more than a trophy wife, his only daughter regards her as the enemy. With everyone so devoted to the memory of Burke's first wife, Kate, how can Allison possibly compete? Then a harrowing car crash leaves Burke badly injured. But it becomes achingly clear that the woman Burke wants by his side is the wife he lost... No longer able to dismiss the power Kate still holds, Allison can't resist reading a trove of hidden letters from Kate to Burke. What she discovers sets her mind reeling. The letters give Allison an enlightening window into her husband's heart. But will she have the courage to put aside her own fears, and grab hold of a love as big and bold as the man she once dared to marry?
"A Delicate Touch" by Stuart Woods (fiction)
Stone Barrington uncovers a societal minefield in the exhilarating new adventure from #1 New York Times bestselling author Stuart Woods. When an old acquaintance reaches out to Stone Barrington requesting assistance, the job seems easy enough. She needs an expert in an esoteric field, someone with both the knowledge and careful dexterity to solve a puzzle. But the solution to one small problem blows the lid open on a bigger scandal going back decades, and involving numerous prominent New Yorkers who would prefer the past stay buried. With this explosive information in-hand, Stone Barrington is caught between a rock and a hard place, his only options either to play it safe to the detriment of others, or to see justice done and risk fatal exposure. But when it comes to Stone Barrington, danger is usually just around the corner... so he may as well throw caution to the wind.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- The University of Maine at Presque Isle will present its next Salmagundi Film Series screening on Tuesday, March 12, at 6 p.m. in the Campus Center Multi-Purpose Room.
In honor of Women's History Month, the series will feature "Hidden Figures," the 2016 film based on a true story about the black female mathematicians at NASA who helped launch an astronaut into orbit. All are invited to attend this film screening.
This semester, the Salmagundi Film Series will feature a "dinner and a movie" option. Attendees will be able to purchase an all-you-can-eat buffet dinner in Kelley Commons for a reduced fee of $9.50 and can bring their meal in to the MPR to eat while they watch the film.
Based on the 2016 New York Times best-selling book by Margot Lee Shetterly, "Hidden Figures" tells the untold story of three brilliant African-American women and the gender and racial lines they crossed while working at NASA. Their calculations helped to launch astronaut John Glenn into orbit, an incredibly important achievement during the early years of the U.S. space program.
Directed by Theodore Melfi, the film is rated PG, is 2 hours and 7 minutes, and has a 93 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
The Salmagundi Film Series focuses on a new film each month followed by a conversation about the subject matter. Presentations take place on the second Tuesday of the month, unless otherwise noted.
Loosely translated, "Salmagundi" means "a little bit of everything," and it was the name of UMPI's school newspaper back in 1909. The series will present "Paper Tigers" on April 23.
To learn more about Hidden Figures, visit the official film website at www.hiddenfiguresmovie.com. For more information about this screening, contact Gayla Shaw at 768-9452 or email umpi@maine.edu.

Joe Biden takes heat for calling Mike Pence a ‘decent guy’

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has directed sharp criticism at President Trump, invited sharp criticism himself Thursday when he called his successor in the No. 2 office a “decent guy” during a speech in Omaha.

“The fact of the matter is it was followed on by a guy who's a decent guy, our vice president, who stood before this group of allies and leaders and said, 'I'm here on behalf of President Trump,' and there was dead silence. Dead silence," Biden said of Mike Pence, referring to how the international community reacted to the vice president’s speech at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month.

Liberal activist and actress Cynthia Nixon was quick to take issue with Biden’s description of Pence.

“You’ve just called America’s most anti-LGBT elected leader ‘a decent guy,” she tweeted at Biden. “Please consider how this falls on the ears of our community.”

Biden told Nixon that she was right. “I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage,” he said.

“But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President,” he wrote.

Biden acknowledged in January that his affinity for Republicans has gotten him in hot water with Democrats.

“I get in trouble,” Biden said at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Washington, D.C. “I read in the New York Times today that one of my problems is if I were ever to run for president is I like Republicans. OK, well bless me, Father, for I have sinned,” he said as he made the sign of the cross.

Biden is expected to join a growing field of Democratic candidates who are vying to take on Trump in the 2020 election. He revealed earlier this week is family is urging him to run for president.

The Seattle-based tech giant had originally planned on splitting its second headquarters between Crystal City in Virginia’s Arlington County and Long Island City in New York’s Queens borough, but dropped the New York half after complaints from left-wing lawmakers.

Cuomo is now furiously lobbying Amazon to reconsider and has told Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and other Amazon executives that he would personally guide the company through the process of re-establishing plans for a Queens-based headquarters, according to the New York Times.

An open letter, signed by multiple interested parties, is expected to appear in Friday’s issue of the Times. The letter will strongly urge Amazon to reconsider its decision to concentrate its entire second campus in Arlington and implore the company to build half of the headquarters in Long Island City.

In addition to local businesses, unions, and other community organizations, signatories to the letter are also expected to include Democratic New York Reps. Hakeem Jeffries and Carolyn Maloney.

Amazon’s original decision to move to Long Island City faced backlash from some progressive activists and politicians. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., argued against the $1.5 billion in incentives aimed at luring the headquarters to New York. She said the money should instead be used on subways and affordable housing.

Others, including JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, argued that the headquarters would have created job growth and furthered the economy of the region.

"It wasn't just the 25,000 jobs that Amazon was going to do. It was probably going to be about 100,000 jobs supporting it," Dimon said at the National Governors Association Winter Meeting last weekend. “And they would have gone from low skill to high skilled to consultants to lawyers to restaurants to barbers and construction workers.”

As of yet, Amazon does not appear to be reconsidering. It is focusing its efforts on the 25,000-person office planned for Arlington, and 5,000-employee operations center in Nashville, Tennessee.

Texto completo: Disgraced Trump lawyer Michael Cohen dropped a series of bombshells Wednesday with his salacious testimony on Capitol Hill, which members of Connecticut's all-Democratic congressional delegation say pulls back the curtain on illegal activity and corruption at the White House.
Trump's onetime fixer presented the House Oversight and Reform Committee with a personal check from the president, saying it was reimbursement for hush money payments made to Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels, with whom Trump had an alleged affair. Cohen said he used a home credit line account to keep the original payments secret.
It was part of a trove of documents provided by Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to Congress and financial crimes in a New York City federal court and could serve up to three years in prison.
"If the canceled checks were provided, we have a situation where the president of the United States was breaking the law while he was president of the United States," said Rep. Jim Himes, who represents southwestern Connecticut.
Himes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, will get his turn Thursday to question Cohen in another hearing. That proceeding will be closed to the public and television cameras, a stark contrast to Wednesday's spectacle, which Himes made light of on Twitter.
"I know there are fireworks and porn stars and Wikileaks and Moscow towers down the hall, but don't miss the monetary policy oversight and review of accounting principles just next door!" he tweeted from his seat at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.
Himes said Cohen's guilty plea for not being truthful with Congress during his previous testimony is not an automatic disqualifier.
"I wouldn't take Michael Cohen just on his word, but if his testimony can be corroborated with paperwork or other people, it's valuable," Himes said.
Cohen characterized Trump as deceitful, manipulative and bigoted at the start of the nearly seven-hour hearing.
"Mr. Trump is a conman," Cohen said. "Since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself."
The now-disbarred lawyer divulged Trump's personal financial statements that he said exaggerated Trump's net worth as part of the real estate mogul's failed bid to purchase the Buffalo Bills.
He stopped short of saying there was collusion between Trump and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, but said that Trump was deeply involved in a thwarted hotel project in Moscow.
"Michael Cohen's testimony today before the House Oversight and Reform Committee is a painful reminder of the depths of the corruption surrounding this administration," said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who is not a member of either committee. "The culture of corruption within this administration is astonishing - from hush money payments and hacked emails to meetings with Russians at Trump Tower, and the list goes on. We cannot allow this to become normal."
Republican committee members, relegated to the minority in the House after last November's midterm elections, attacked the credibility of Cohen.
"He's a fake witness," said Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn.
Himes said Cohen can shed light on Trump's Russian contacts and will be asked about his being paid by a bank in Kazakhstan after the election.
"When everybody is lying about something, you want to spend some meaningful time on what Russians were involved and what precisely happened," Himes said.
Cohen's testimony upstaged Trump's trip to Hanoi for summit talks with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, which he said was ironic because of Trump's efforts to quash stories about how he used a medical deferment to get out of military service during the Vietnam War.
"You think I'm stupid, I'm not going to Vietnam,'" Cohen quoted Trump as saying.
Cohen's portrait of Trump as a draft dodger came just hours after Trump mocked U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal for mischaracterizing his military record during the Vietnam-era, which was reported by the New York Times in 2010.
Blumenthal was a member of the Marine Corps Reserve during the war but remained stateside. He apologized for the misrepresentation, which did little to derail his election to the Senate.
In a statement Wednesday night, Blumenthal termed Cohen's testimony as a bombshell.
"These facts, if corroborated by other witnesses and documents, are completely damning and overpowering in impact," Blumenthal said. "If true, Michael Cohen's testimony reveals that the president of the United States has brazenly and repeatedly violated the law and lied to the American people, and that there should no longer be doubt in anyone's mind that collusion with Russia links directly to President Trump himself."
Trump has used the line of attack against Blumenthal, one of his most ardent critics on Capitol Hill, at least half a dozen times since taking office.
"It's just shameless," Himes said. "Sen. Blumenthal apologized for shading the truth. I don't think President Trump has ever apologized for anything."
Cohen further testified that Trump tasked him with threatening schools he attended from releasing his grades or SAT scores. He also called Trump a "racist" during his opening statement to the committee.
"He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't an [expletive]," Cohen said.
GOP lawmakers said Cohen's deception went far behind trying to help the president and that he lied on many occasions to enrich himself.
"You have a history of lying over and over and over again," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the committee's ranking member and a founder of the conservative Freedom Caucus.
Himes said he expects fewer "histrionics" Thursday because it will be a closed-door hearing.
"Whenever cameras are running, and I don't just point fingers at Republicans on this one, members of Congress are aware of those cameras running," Himes said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — As Democrats swing left, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for America. The presidential candidates endorse a variety of far-reaching proposals that, if adopted, would represent the largest expansion of government since Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. The added spending, taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions.
Are these sound economic policies or partisan pipedreams?
Let’s review the main proposals. For context, remember the following: The U.S. economy (gross domestic product) is about $20 trillion, so a federal program costing $200 billion would be 1 percent of GDP. It would also be about 5 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget.
Here’s the rundown:
• Guaranteed job program: Several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn’t find one. Economists at Bard College estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at $15 an hour; health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent. The initial cost would be around $300 billion annually.
• Medicare-for-all: Bernie Sanders proposed this, and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage. Its cost is unclear (in 2017, there were an estimated 27 million uninsured), says a report from PolitiFact of the Poynter Institute. Sanders thinks replacing private insurance with Medicare could cut expenses. Other experts disagree. There would be pressures to sweeten benefits. In a recent New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman wrote that “we’d need a lot more [tax] revenue” to implement for Medicare-for-all.
• “The Green New Deal”: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., propose putting the country on a war footing to purge U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions over a decade. The costs aren’t known, because the “new deal” manifesto contains no concrete proposals. However, it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize “clean” energy and suppress fossil fuels.
• Everything else: There are smaller proposals that, in other years, would seem large. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of $70 billion. Sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students. That’s perhaps another $50 billion. Then there’s “infrastructure” spending — more billions — and a proposal to raise Social Security benefits.
Counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates, the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit ($779 billion in 2018). The actual amount could be more — or less. No one really knows.
How would Democrats pay for this? Some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy. Krugman doubts these would suffice. Adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in “payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class,” he writes.
Of course, there is another choice: more deficit spending. Last week, I tried to educate myself on so-called “modern monetary theory.” Embraced by some Democrats, its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we’ve been led to believe. Here’s the case for that view, as best I can determine.
“The biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household” that has to repay its debt, says Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and an adviser in 2016 to Sanders.
The United States won’t default on its governmental debts, because it can always create more dollars — through the Federal Reserve — to honor U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, she says. She rejects the argument that the Fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money. To prevent that, inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates, just as occurs today.
The obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment, she contends. This may or may not be good economics, but it’s certainly expedient. No one likes to raise taxes and cut spending, and that may explain why benign neglect of deficits is now going mainstream.
Check out the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. “Washington should end its debt obsession,” urge Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, top economic officials in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Interest rates are low. It’s better to borrow and spend on “education, health care and infrastructure.”
What’s missing from this picture is old-fashioned prudence. True, the government doesn’t have to default on its debt in a legal sense. But if financial markets worry about the escalating debt, Treasury bonds will lose value. If the fall in confidence is great enough, it might trigger a panic, made worse by the reality that the dollar is the main international currency.
Our ever-ascending debt increases our vulnerability to a future crisis that we cannot see but, almost certainly, awaits us.

Texto completo: Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called for a re-examination of the case that is arguably the bedrock of modern journalism.
OK, well maybe not the bedrock. The First Amendment is pretty important and fairly solid. Still, the rights and role of a free press, and its ability to seek transparency and hold the powerful accountable as it pertains to the past half century of journalism, was established in a 1964 Supreme Court case called Times v. Sullivan.
The case set precedent that made it difficult for public figures, especially in government, to seek damages from news outlets for libel or defamation. The decision would prove crucial as a check on government in coverage of the Vietnam War and Watergate, and remains important today.
So why is Thomas looking at it now? It came from a case the court declined to hear regarding one of the accusers of former comedian and now convicted sex offender Bill Cosby. The woman was claiming Cosby's legal team had defamed her by leaking a damaging letter that she said distorted her character.
In the decision, Thomas went into an odd side rant about Times V. Sullivan, saying that the decision was "policy driven and was "masquerading as constitutional law.
That's worrying for a few reasons, not the least of which is that President Donald Trump has, despite his constant criticism and attacks on others' character, claimed he wants to make it easier to sue publications like The Washington Post and The New York Times for what he sees as unfair coverage of his multiple scandals and potentially illegal actions.
Trump and other public officials with thin skin often fail to realize that what they construe as "negative coverage is really journalists doing their jobs, making information available for the American people so they can be informed about what is taking place in their government.
Trump has autocratic tendencies, and he's put two justices on the Supreme Court since becoming president, setting up a conservative majority. He's also leaned on staff, current and former, who he sees as not doing enough to protect him, whether their actual duty is to the American people or not.
In Thomas, perhaps there's a bit of a kindred spirit, as lurid details of sexual harassment dogged the justice's confirmation hearings and were highly publicized by news organizations at the time. Of course, Trump has been accused of multiple instances of sexual harassment, and even assault, and his own language on the topic has been unsettling.
The idea of limiting the press, in an administration that has already been so antagonistic toward journalists, is troubling.
In his missive, Thomas suggested perhaps turning control of libel laws back to state governments, which makes absolutely no sense, because every newspaper, television station or website serves millions of readers or viewers in all parts of the globe. Tracking the cases and establishing jurisdiction would be a nightmare for overburdened state courts.
All that aside, public scrutiny is what Thomas and Trump signed up for. If Trump can't let a "Saturday Night Live sketch skewering him roll off his back without suing someone, he's in the wrong line of work (which, by the way, he is anyway). The free press has to remain free. As the saying goes, democracy dies in darkness. That would probably suit Trump and Thomas just fine.

Let's fight for universal child care

Información de publicación: Chicago Tribune ; Chicago, Ill. [Chicago, Ill]. 27 Feb 2019: 17.

Texto completo: A few weeks ago, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt wrote a compelling New York Times piece endorsing "day care for all." Noting that child care is "one of the biggest costs a family faces," often surpassing even college tuition, Pollitt argued that a lack of affordable child care is a problem on par with challenges that receive far more attention from leading progressives. "So why isn't it on the front burner of the revitalized left?" she asked.
The question turned out to be prescient. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., unveiled her proposal for universal child care in the United States. While other candidates have discussed the need for affordable child care -- and it was one of Hillary Clinton's priorities in 2016 -- Warren's plan is clearly the most ambitious proposal to date. It would establish a network of federally funded, locally run child care centers across the nation. Enrollment would be completely free for millions of children and affordable for all, with the total cost per family capped at 7 percent of a family's income, no matter the number of kids.
The centers would be staffed by qualified care providers, who would be paid similarly to teachers. Access would be guaranteed, but families with the means to choose other options would be free to do so. And it would be fully paid for with revenue from the wealth tax Warren has called for on households with a net worth greater than $50 million.
Warren's proposal should spark an overdue and necessary conversation about a problem that leaders in both parties have long neglected. More than half of Americans now live in child care "deserts," according to the Center for American Progress, including significant majorities of rural and Latino families. Compared with the rest of the world, the United States spends pathetically little on family benefits, ranking second-to-last among developed nations. "This dearth of family benefits leads to two cruel outcomes," writes Matt Bruenig, whose People's Policy Project recently published its own set of ideas for addressing the child care crisis. "It denies many people the ability to have the families that they want and inflicts financial ruin on many of those who go through with parenthood despite the lack of social support."
Women especially suffer the consequences of this neglect, often sacrificing their careers and other opportunities to pick up the slack. Yet while it is fitting that universal child care would gain traction at a time when women are playing an increasingly vital role in the national debate, Warren's proposal would not only improve the lives of women or even parents. Its impact would also ripple outward, benefiting all Americans. In fact, Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi estimates that Warren's plan would generate twice as much growth per year over a decade as Trump's corporate tax cut at less than half the cost -- and that's if the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts were paid for, which of course they were not. So, in addition to proposing good family policy, Warren is offering a boost to the economy that deserves to be covered and debated accordingly.
Predictably, Warren's idea has been lambasted on the right as "socialism" and even as a sinister ploy to increase immigration. But the United States has experimented with universal child care before with great success. In the 1940s, when millions of women joined the workforce to support the war effort, the government temporarily offered subsidized child care through a law known as the Lanham Act. The program was hugely popular and, studies later showed, effective. Not only did it empower more women to work, but also the children who participated went on to see increased high school and college graduation rates, better employment prospects and higher earnings. Years later, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to establish a national child care system, but President Richard Nixon vetoed the bill, warning that it would create "a new army of bureaucrats" and condemning its "family-weakening implications."
"I think when we ran the sword through (child care) in '71," Nixon adviser Pat Buchanan boasted in 2014, "it may have killed it for more than half a century." Now that it's alive again as a serious policy goal, let's fight for universal child care. It's good for the economy, it's consistent with our values, and its time has come.

Texto completo: As Democrats swing left, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for America. The presidential candidates endorse a variety of far-reaching proposals that, if adopted, would represent the largest expansion of government since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The added spending, taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions.
Are these sound economic policies or partisan pipedreams?
Let's review the main proposals. For context, remember the following: The U.S. economy (gross domestic product) is about $20 trillion, so a federal program costing $200 billion would be 1 percent of GDP. It would also be about 5 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget.
*Guaranteed job program: Several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn't find one. Economists at Bard College estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at $15 an hour; health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent. The initial cost would be around $300 billion annually.
*Medicare-for-all: Bernie Sanders proposed this, and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage. Its cost is unclear (in 2017, there were an estimated 27 million uninsured), says a report from PolitiFact of the Poynter Institute. Sanders thinks replacing private insurance with Medicare could cut expenses. Other experts disagree. There would be pressures to sweeten benefits. In a recent New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman wrote that "we'd need a lot more (tax) revenue" to implement Medicare-for-all.
*"The Green New Deal": Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezand Sen. Edward J. Markey propose putting the country on a war footing to purge U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions over a decade. The costs aren't known, because the "new deal" manifesto contains no concrete proposals. However, it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize "clean" energy and suppress fossil fuels.
* Everything else: There are smaller proposals that, in other years, would seem large. Sen. Elizabeth Warren backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of $70 billion. Sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students. That's perhaps another $50 billion. Then there's "infrastructure" spending - more billions - and a proposal to raise Social Security benefits.
Counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates, the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit ($779 billion in 2018). The actual amount could be more. No one knows.
How would Democrats pay for this? Some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy. Krugman doubts these would suffice. Adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in "payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class," he writes.
Of course, there is another choice: more deficit spending. Last week, I tried to educate myself on so-called "modern monetary theory." Embraced by some Democrats, its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we've been led to believe. Here's the case for that view, as best I can determine.
"The biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household" that has to repay its debt, says Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and an adviser in 2016 to Sanders.
The United States won't default on its governmental debts, because it can always create more dollars - through the Federal Reserve - to honor U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, she says.
What's missing from this picture is old-fashioned prudence. Our ever-ascending debt increases our vulnerability to a future crisis that we cannot see but, almost certainly, awaits us.

U.S. officials inviting South American teams for tourney; Messi could be back in America in 2020 event

Texto completo: U.S. soccer officials were so happy to host Lionel Messi and the South American national teams three years ago, that they want to do it again next summer.
In what would be a reprise of the 2016 Copa America Centenario, a wildly successful international tournament staged at 10 American venues, U.S. Soccer Federation President Carlos Cordeiro has extended invitations to the 10 members of the South American confederation to return in 2020.
The news was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by The Washington Post. The Chicago-based USSF said it did not want to comment right away. The sides are expected to begin discussing the matter over the next two weeks.
Like the 2016 event, which celebrated the 100th anniversary of South America's famed Copa America, the competition would include all 10 teams from CONMEBOL, the region representing the continent.
Six participants would come from Concacaf, the governing body for North and Central America and the Caribbean.
The United States would receive an automatic berth, joined presumably by Mexico and Costa Rica, as well as three others.
Concacaf said in a written statement: "We view this opportunity positively ... and (it) complements our vision to continue providing opportunities for our member associations to play competitive football at the highest level."
In 2016, Chile defeated Messi and Argentina in the final at sold-out MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The United States won its group and defeated Ecuador in the quarterfinals before losing to Argentina in the semifinals and Colombia in the third-place match.
The tournament was a massive success, drawing big crowds to NFL stadiums and generating millions in profit for the USSF and sponsors. National federations also made out well, collecting millions in rewards for participating and advancing.
The proposed 2020 tournament would fall a year after CONMEBOL and Concacaf conduct their own championships: This summer, Copa America will take place in Brazil, and the Gold Cup will be held primarily in the United States.
The new event would also fall in the buildup to 2022 World Cup qualifying and provide a test run for organizers ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which last year was awarded to the United States, Mexico and Canada. It would also provide stiff competition for the U.S. team, which is rebuilding in the wake of its failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.
The USSF and CONMEBOL have for the past year discussed interest in staging a U.S.-based tournament every four years. But with little progress and time running out to organize a 2020 competition, Cordeiro decided to take the lead and extend the invitations. The USSF would underwrite the tournament.
The federation also sees a major tournament as a way to continue growing the sport in the United States and build momentum toward the 2026 World Cup.

Lawmakers setting up an outbreak of measles?

Texto completo: Last week during a hearing at the state Capitol a pro-vaccine lawmaker spoke about being "bombarded" by negative comments from anti-vaxxers who, among other things, called her a Nazi.
Democratic Rep. Alma Hernandez of Tucson said in part, "I will say one thing, comparing this situation to the Holocaust and calling me a Nazi is not going to help the cause and it is not who I am. And it is not right. I just wanted to bring that up. ... And all I have to say about that is don't confuse passion for facts."
Among the anti-vaccine crowd in the audience there were chuckles.
"You can laugh all you want," Hernandez said. "There are many people who will actually suffer by the decisions we make on this panel."
Just about every professional health association you can imagine agreed with her, urging the Republican-controlled House Health and Human Services Committee to reject three bills that even further weaken Arizona's already dangerously lax immunization requirements for schoolchildren.
The bills, sponsored by Republican chairwoman Rep. Nancy Barto, passed along party lines, in spite of warnings from Arizona Medical Association, the Arizona Academy of Family Physicians, Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, the March of Dimes and on and on.
Dr. Bob England, former director of the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, told The Arizona Republic's Stephanie Innes that declining vaccination rates have made metro Phoenix susceptible to a large, sustained measles outbreak.
Other communities are catching on to the danger.
Just last week, a senate committee in Washington state, which had lax vaccination rates and has seen increased spikes in measles cases, approved a measure to eliminate exemptions for personal or philosophical reasons.
Nor is the anti-vaccine danger limited to the United States. The New York Times reports that Japan is facing its worst measles outbreak in years, with the illness tied to a religious group that avoids vaccinations.
California eliminated vaccine exemptions for personal beliefs back in 2015.
Meantime, the Republicans in control of the Arizona Legislature are rushing in the opposite direction, putting untold individuals at risk if the vaccinated population falls beneath the 95 percent needed to preserve what is called "herd immunity."
This would include infants, pregnant women, people with compromised immune systems (like cancer patients), individuals allergic to vaccines and others. And, of course, the children themselves.
If the bills make it through the Legislature it will be up to Gov. Doug Ducey to prevent a potential health crisis. He has expressed support for vaccines in the past.
In the meantime the bills made it out of committee with the anti-vaxxers in the audience chuckling at the protestations of Rep. Hernandez.
And why not? They were getting their way.
An emotional Rep. Hernandez said in part, "And I'm not going to sit here and tolerate that, and you can laugh all you want. You can continue to laugh. But I will not tolerate that. ... I'm sorry, but maybe you all should get an education on the Holocaust and what happened. That was not an option for people. They were murdered. And that is all I have to say."
And just so the gigglers know, if they had bothered to check Rep. Hernandez's campaign website they would have read this line in her biography:
"She is an active member of the Jewish Community."

TRUMP: HOSTAGE RECOVERED

Texto completo: President Donald Trump announced Monday that the U.S. has recovered Danny Burch, an American citizen who was being held hostage in Yemen.
"It is my honor today to announce that Danny Burch, a United States citizen who has been held hostage in Yemen for 18 months, has been recovered and reunited with his wife and children," Mr. Trump tweeted. "I appreciate the support of the United Arab Emirates in bringing Danny home. Danny's recovery reflects the best of what the United States & its partners can accomplish."
He continued, "We work every day to bring Americans home. We maintain constant and intensive diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement cooperation within the United States Government and with our foreign partners. Recovering American hostages is a priority of my Admin, and with Danny's release, we have now secured freedom for 20 American captives since my election victory. We will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining American hostages back home!"
Mr. Burch, according to The New York Times, is an American oil worker who had spent years working as an engineer for a Yemeni oil company when he was abducted in Sanaa, Yemen, in 2017. According to Reuters, Iran-aligned Houthi forces were behind Mr. Burch's kidnapping.
More pressure on OPEC
President Donald Trump resumed his attacks on OPEC, saying the global economy is too fragile to handle a price hike and urging the cartel to "relax and take it easy."
Mr. Trump's war of words with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries punctuated big price swings last year, as he pressured the group to keep the taps open to help consumers. Futures in New York declined by the most in two weeks on Monday.
The president's intervention follows a price rally of about 23 percent this year due to production cuts from OPEC and its allies, diminishing fears about the economic impact of the U.S.-China trade war and Washington's imposition of sanctions on Venezuelan oil shipments. Now pressure from Mr. Trump once again puts Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC in a bind.
Mr. Trump "has been successful at talking the market lower, no doubt about that," said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. With oil close or in overbought territory, "you needed that spark, and that spark was his tweet this morning slamming OPEC more or less."
Barrick's hostile bid
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. is going hostile in its bid to acquire Newmont Mining Corp. and create the world's largest gold producer, offering $17.8 billion for the company in an all-share deal. Shares of both companies tumbled.
The proposed purchase, which is a discount to Newmont's closing price on Friday, raises the potential for a three-way fight between some of the world's largest gold miners. Newmont, based in Colorado, said its board would review the deal but made clear its previously announced plan to take over Goldcorp Inc. offers better benefits.
Gold miners have been merging as the price of the metal has gained in the past year. The Barrick bid, if completed, would derail Newmont's own $10 billion takeover of rival Goldcorp, announced last month, putting a big question mark over the future of three large gold miners. It would also put an end to years of on-again, off-again talks to merge Barrick and Newmont, the latest of which collapsed in 2014.

Texto completo: As Democrats swing left, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for America. The presidential candidates endorse a variety of far-reaching proposals that, if adopted, would represent the largest expansion of government since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The added spending, taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions.
Are these sound economic policies or partisan pipe dreams?
Let's review the main proposals. For context, remember the following: The U.S. economy (gross domestic product) is about $20 trillion, so a federal program costing $200 billion would be 1 percent of GDP. It would also be about 5 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget.
Here's the rundown:
• Guaranteed job program : Several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn't find one. Economists at Bard College estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at $15 an hour; health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent. The initial cost would be around $300 billion annually.
• Medicare-for-all : Bernie Sanders proposed this, and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage. Its cost is unclear (in 2017, there were an estimated 27 million uninsured), says a report from PolitiFact of the Poynter Institute. Sanders thinks replacing private insurance with Medicare could cut expenses. Other experts disagree. There would be pressures to sweeten benefits. In a recent New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman wrote that "we'd need a lot more [tax] revenue" to implement for Medicare-for-all.
• "The Green New Deal" : Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., propose putting the country on a war footing to purge U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions over a decade. The costs aren't known, because the "new deal" manifesto contains no concrete proposals. However, it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize "clean" energy and suppress fossil fuels.
• Everything else : There are smaller proposals that, in other years, would seem large. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of $70 billion. Sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students. That's perhaps another $50 billion. Then there's "infrastructure" spending -- more billions -- and a proposal to raise Social Security benefits.
Counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates, the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit ($779 billion in 2018). The actual amount could be more -- or less. No one really knows.
How would Democrats pay for this? Some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy. Krugman doubts these would suffice. Adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in "payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class," he writes.
Of course, there is another choice: more deficit spending. Last week, I tried to educate myself on so-called "modern monetary theory." Embraced by some Democrats, its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we've been led to believe. Here's the case for that view, as best I can determine.
"The biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household" that has to repay its debt, says Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and an adviser in 2016 to Sanders.
The United States won't default on its governmental debts, because it can always create more dollars -- through the Federal Reserve -- to honor U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, she says. She rejects the argument that the Fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money. To prevent that, inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates, just as occurs today.
The obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment, she contends. This may or may not be good economics, but it's certainly expedient. No one likes to raise taxes and cut spending, and that may explain why benign neglect of deficits is now going mainstream.
Check out the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. "Washington should end its debt obsession," urge Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, top economic officials in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Interest rates are low. It's better to borrow and spend on "education, health care and infrastructure."
What's missing from this picture is old-fashioned prudence. True, the government doesn't have to default on its debt in a legal sense. But if financial markets worry about the escalating debt, Treasury bonds will lose value. If the fall in confidence is great enough, it might trigger a panic, made worse by the reality that the dollar is the main international currency.
Our ever-ascending debt increases our vulnerability to a future crisis that we cannot see but, almost certainly, awaits us.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- Even with peace talks underway, the war in Afghanistan killed almost 4,000 civilians last year, including a record number of children, officials said Sunday, making it the single deadliest year for Afghan civilians since the United Nations began documenting casualties a decade ago.
In a report released Sunday, the United Nations attributed almost two-thirds of civilian casualties -- 63 percent -- to insurgent groups, primarily the Taliban and the Islamic State. Afghan and American forces were responsible for 24 percent -- 14 percent by Afghan national security forces, 6 percent by American forces and 4 percent by government-backed armed groups. Responsibility for the rest could not be established.
The single biggest cause of civilian casualties was suicide bombings and related attacks by insurgents, the report found. The numbers of civilian casualties caused by suicide bombings and by American and Afghan government airstrikes were each the highest recorded since the United Nations issued its first report in 2009.
The figures reflected a surge in fighting as both sides in the conflict, which is in its 18th year, stepped up attacks as they sought leverage in peace talks between the United States and the Taliban.
Islamic State attacks on civilians rose 118 percent for the year, the United Nations found, while Taliban attacks on civilians nearly doubled.
The report was released a day before the next round of peace talks between American and Taliban negotiators, scheduled for Monday in Doha, Qatar. The Taliban refuse to negotiate with the Afghan government, which they consider illegitimate.
It was a reminder that, even amid hopes for peace, civilians face a rising tide of threats.
[Two New York Times reporters from Afghanistan describe their dreams of what they will do if peace comes.]
Last year's tally of 3,804 civilian deaths was the highest ever recorded by the United Nations. Overall civilian casualties rose 5 percent, to 10,993, but that was slightly below 2015 and 2016.
Among the dead last year were 927 children, also the highest annual total reported by the United Nations. Insurgents were responsible for 44 percent of child casualties in 2018, with Afghan and American forces blamed for 34 percent. The number of children killed in airstrikes more than doubled in 2018 compared with 2017, the report said.
In a statement, Tadamichi Yamamoto, the United Nations secretary general's special representative for Afghanistan, called the figures "deeply disturbing and wholly unacceptable." Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called the record number of children killed "particularly shocking."
The United Nations urged the Taliban to stop indiscriminately bombing civilians and asked the Afghan government and the United States to more rigorously investigate allegations of civilian casualties and to provide reparations.
In a letter included in the report, the United States military command in Kabul, the Afghan capital, said "all feasible precautions" were taken to limit civilian casualties. Any allegation of civilian casualties considered "serious" resulted in "an inquiry and formal review process," it said.
The letter listed 62 confirmed deaths and 55 confirmed injuries from American combat operations last year. An additional 68 deaths and 66 injuries were listed as "disputed" because of insufficient information.
A Taliban letter rejected the United Nations' findings and denied that insurgents fired from civilian areas, used civilians as cover or engaged in "indiscriminate and disproportionate" attacks against civilians using homemade bombs.
A letter from the Afghan government said its tally of civilian casualties caused by Afghan forces was "significantly lower" than the numbers in the United Nations report. It called protecting civilians the Afghan government's "paramount duty."
Almost all of the civilian deaths and injuries attributed to American forces resulted from airstrikes. They caused a record 536 civilian deaths last year, more than the deaths from airstrikes in 2014, 2015 and 2016 combined, the report said.
American aircraft dropped more than 7,300 bombs, missiles and other munitions over Afghanistan last year, up from 4,300 in 2017 and 1,300 in 2016, according to United States Air Force data. The airstrikes were part of an effort to displace the Taliban, who control more territory now than at any time since the United States invaded in 2001.
The pace of ground attacks rose as well. American and Afghan commandos more than doubled the number of joint raids from September to early February, compared with the same five-month period a year earlier, military data show.
Civilian casualties attributed to Afghan and American forces rose 24 percent compared with 2017, the United Nations reported.
The report said government search operations had killed 284 civilians. It attributed many of those casualties to covert C.I.A.-backed units whose abuses were detailed in a New York Times report in December.
Insurgents also went on the offensive, carrying out an average of 1,700 attacks a month late last year, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a United States agency. The United Nations said ground clashes were responsible for nearly a third of civilian casualties in 2018.
The arrival of Islamic State militants in Afghanistan after 2014 posed a new threat to civilians, especially Hazaras, a mostly Shiite Muslim minority. The Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim group, considers Hazaras apostates and has targeted them for attack.
The only significant pause in civilian casualties last year came in June, when both sides agreed to a brief cease-fire during the Eid al-Fitr holiday.
Two large-scale insurgent campaigns contributed to high civilian casualty rates: a suicide ambulance attack in Kabul in January, and insurgent attacks against polling sites during the parliamentary election in October. The United Nations said nearly half of all insurgent suicide bombs and complex attacks in 2018 took place in Kabul.
Since 2009, the United Nations has reported 32,000 civilians killed and 60,000 injured.
"In addition to the lives lost, the dire security situation is preventing many Afghans from enjoying their economic, social and cultural rights, with thousands of children already handicapped for life because of attacks on schools and medical facilities," Ms. Bachelet, the United Nations official, said in a statement.

In the mid-1940s, a giant city sprang to life almost overnight in the dusty flatlands near the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River. There, 45,000 people gathered in a furious effort to build a weapon fearsome enough to end World War II.
Spokane author Sharma Shields makes this heady time and place the setting for her new novel, "The Cassandra," her first book since her debut novel "The Sasquatch Hunter's Almanac," which won the Washington State Book Award.
Shields will talk about her new book March 13 at the Northwest Passages Book Club, in conversation with Nancy Pearl, a best-selling author and perhaps the nation's best-known librarian.
The heroine of Shield's novel is Mildred Groves, star pupil from the secretarial school in tiny Omak, Washington, and the Cassandra of the book's title, gifted with knowledge of the future but doomed never to be believed.
At first, Mildred is just like her colleagues, thrilled to play a role in an important but highly secret part of the nation's war effort. But gradually Mildred is filled with foreboding as she has frightening visions of the horrible destruction that will be wrought by the atomic bombs being built with Hanford's plutonium, known only as the "product."
Shields initially had planned to write a novel based on Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," set in the Northwest, she said in an interview. But she says she pivoted to the Hanford project when, as someone diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, she learned that some people think the disease is especially common in the region because of radioactive waste that may have drifted downwind from the massive nuclear complex. More commonly, so-called "downwinders" have blamed Hanford for cancer that developed years later, resulting in several thousand legal claims that were finally settled or dropped.
Shields says she has no opinion on whether Hanford was responsible for her disease but was motivated to dive deep into the historical record after a tour of Reactor B, now a National Historic Landmark recognized for its critical role in the Manhattan Project.
"The history in that particular era is so fascinating, and its themes are so dark and have roots way back then to what I think we feel now about secrecy and silence, security and safety - all of those things," she said. "That really ended up driving the entire plot of the book for me."
Hanford became her monster, and the story seemed a perfect match for her lifelong love of Greek mythology. "The Cassandra message just seemed to pop into my head the second I really started looking into the research," she said. "I'm always sort of shocked by the way in which we as a species cannot listen to our own warnings about the world."
The book paints an affecting historical portrait of an era that forever changed Washington state and the world, and the central figure of the Cassandra book resonates in today's #MeToo era, when floodlights are being cast on the way women learn to endure and suffer in silence, or risk being disbelieved.
"For women it's a hugely uphill battle, and the ways in which we are taught to silence ourselves, the ways in which we continue to be silenced, is one of the major themes in the book," Shields said.
The book has moments of lightness and humor, but ultimately the plot takes a dark and tragic turn, echoing the horror of the bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed perhaps 200,000 civilians. In the novel, that darkness is echoed when an innocent man is cruelly victimized while a guilty man goes unpunished.
Shields acknowledges that this injustice will feel unfair to the reader.
"I know it's very dark and will feel unfair, but I feel like that unfairness is the truth, and I want people to grapple with that," she said.
Just before publication of the novel, Shields revealed another factor influencing how she crafted the plot, disclosing her rape at the age of 14 in an essay in the New York Times. In the essay, Shields draws comfort from Greek mythology and the story of Artemis, the Greek goddess who coldly gained revenge on Actaeon for spying on her while she was bathing. In previous novels and stories, Shields enacted literary revenge against such predatory characters, but not this time.
"For me, both in my personal life and what we see in the news, I think it's really common that the man is not punished for an act that he has done," she said.
Shields hopes the novel can be a clarion call for people who refuse to listen to clear warnings about climate change and other issues facing humankind.
"The novel is really intended to be a warning and a call to awareness for people - awareness of our history awareness of our obsession with militancy, awareness of our toxic masculinity . I think if people are willing to be up front with themselves and embrace that awareness I think then we can start to experience some major change in how we treat one another both in our interpersonal relationships and farther abroad."

Texto completo: "Because we are in this time of stability relative to the downturn a few years back, I believe we shouldn't be governing from chaos anymore, we should be governing from opportunity."
Sen. Amy Klobuchar
2020 presidential hopeful
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat vying for the 2020 presidency, made a campaign stop in Greenville on Saturday.
Here are the key takeaways from her visit.
More than 300 people attended event Klobuchar spoke to more than 300 people at the Greenville County Democrats' monthly breakfast. The event was held at Upstate Circle of Friends in Greenville. About an hour before the event started, the parking lot was already full to capacity.
Klobuchar mentioned President Donald Trump, but for the most part focused on her own accomplishments and her concrete ideas for policy changes. The candidate noted the need to bridge the country's divides.
"That includes all the hate-spewing going on, all the trying to turn people against each other based on race, based on ethnic background and based on religion," Klobuchar said. "We have to walk that sturdy bridge of our democracy to a higher ground in our politics."
Klobuchar focused on issues Klobuchar used the event to focus on some of her key campaign issues, including expanding the Affordable Care Act and lowering the price of prescription drugs by allowing the sale of those from other countries. She also touched on efforts to combat climate change, though she did not mention the recently proposed Green New Deal, which outlines broad goals to achieve environmental sustainability. The Green New Deal has been touted as extreme by Republicans and even some Democrats for its aggressive policy proposals.
Greenville was her first campaign stop in South Carolina The senator stopped in Greenville as part of her first campaign trip to South Carolina since announcing on Feb. 10 that she is running for president.
She was to visit Columbia later Saturday.
Klobuchar's pragmatism appealed to many in the Greenville audience. Nikki Smith, 40, a teacher at the collegiate level, liked Klobuchar's more incremental approach to universal health care, which she said seemed more practical and more plausible.
Klobuchar hopes to end 'divisive politics' As in previous events, Klobuchar emphasized her record of bipartisanship and focus on bridging the "rural-urban divide." She said Democrats need to widen their focus beyond their base, noting, "I'm not just going to the big metropolitan areas, I'm gonna go everywhere."
Klobuchar highlighted her pragmatic approach to accomplishing her goals. She cited her support for a more competitive corporate tax rate, but criticized the most recent Republican-backed tax reform bill. Klobuchar said that money could have been used to help pay for much needed infrastructure, from bridges and dams to roads and highways.
The story of the comb and the salad A previous visit to South Carolina by Klobuchar is getting renewed attention after a story published Friday in The New York Times on how the senator treats her staff. During a trip to the state in 2008, Klobuchar berated a staff member who lost the plastic silverware for her salad before they boarded a plane. Klobuchar then used a comb to eat the salad, according to the Times story.
Klobuchar seeks to 'govern from opportunity' "Because we are in this time of stability relative to the downturn a few years back, I believe we shouldn't be governing from chaos anymore, we should be governing from opportunity," she said. "What opportunity means to me is seizing those opportunities, it's taking on the challenges of the day, instead of just looking down and not wanting to see what this guy tweets every morning, or looking away.
"It is actually looking up and looking at each other and confronting these challenges of the day. Instead of wallowing in what's wrong, it is marching inextricably towards what is right."
"Because we are in this time of stability relative to the downturn a few years back, I believe we shouldn't be governing from chaos anymore, we should be governing from opportunity."

Don't Fight the Robots. Tax Them.

Texto completo: When Bill Gates floated the idea of imposing a tax on robots a couple of years ago, Lawrence Summers, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama, called the Microsoft co-founder "profoundly misguided." How do you even define a robot to tax it? And taxing innovation is a sure way to make a country poorer. Europe has also rejected the idea. In 2017 the European Parliament soundly defeated a draft motion, proposed by its committee on legal affairs, that recommended considering a tax on the owners of robots to fund retraining programs for workers displaced by the machines and shore up the finances of their social security system.
And yet properly constructed, a tax on automation may not be as destructive as it sounds. South Korea, the most robotized country in the world, instituted a robot tax of sorts in 2018 when it reduced the tax deduction on business investments in automation.
There are two sound arguments for taxing robots. The easiest is this: Governments need the money. In the United States, income taxes account for half of the $ 3 trillion collected every year by the Internal Revenue Service; payroll taxes account for another third.
Imagine that the fears about robots taking over jobs actually come true. Two years ago, the McKinsey Global Institute found that the job functions that are "most susceptible to automation" in the United States account for 51 percent of the activities in the economy and $ 2.7 trillion worth of wages. The institute estimates "half of today's work activities could be automated by 2055." If that happens, hundreds of billions of tax dollars would be lost every year.
And at the same time that the rise of robots shrinks government tax revenue, the fallout from automation will place more demands on government services. The United States will probably need more money to retrain workers bumped from their jobs by automation, to give them a shot at a new one. Welfare rolls could grow, as millions of workers are displaced to the bottom end of the service economy, where wages are low and robots are scarce.
To afford any kind of government services in the robot era, governments will have to find something else to tax. Why not the robots themselves?
The case for taxing robots is stronger when you consider that a lot of automation these days is not deployed to enhance economic productivity. Instead, many businesses are investing in automation simply because the tax code is urging them to do so.
The purpose of taxing robots is not simply to stop them from killing jobs. It is to level the playing field, to ensure that investments in automation raise productivity.
"The tax system incentivizes automation even in cases where it is not otherwise efficient," wrote Ryan Abbott and Bret Bogenschneider of the University of Surrey School of Law in Britain, in an analysis of tax policy toward automation in the United States and other rich countries. "The vast majority of tax revenues are now derived from labor income, so firms avoid taxes by eliminating employees."
Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explains that automation often produces benefits of dubious value to the business itself. More important, he suggests that the investment in technologies designed to replace workers has come at the expense of alternative investments that might find more productive uses for human labor. This may help explain the sluggishness in overall productivity growth across the economy.
One powerful reason that businesses deploy so many robots, despite their sometimes questionable contribution to the bottom line, is that automation is subsidized. "Subsidies induce firms to substitute capital for labor even when this is not socially cost-saving, though it is privately beneficial because of the subsidy," Professor Acemoglu and his co-author, Pascual Restrepo, wrote.
The tax subsidies to robots are varied. For starters, machines don't incur payroll taxes, which are used to fund Social Security and Medicare. For every worker replaced by a robot, the employer saves on payroll taxes. The federal tax code and many state governments allow companies to use "accelerated depreciation" for capital investments, which allows them to deduct the cost of their robots faster than they could deduct the wage of the payroll of the workers they replace.
This means that eliminating the tax break for robots would not hurt economic growth. It would, in fact, improve economic efficiency. By subsidizing capital investment, the government is encouraging businesses to use capital when they otherwise would not, to replace workers with machines. That might be rational for the individual business reaping the tax benefits. But as Professor Acemoglu put it, across the economy, this kind of spending on automation "shows up as a productivity loss."
What's more, curbing businesses' pumped-up enthusiasm for robots might help mitigate the broader social costs of automation, which has flushed so many workers into unproductive occupations where cheap labor still holds an edge and knocked many more out of the labor force entirely.
What is the best way to change the tax incentives for robots? One solution would be to disallow accelerated depreciation for investments in automation. Professors Abbott and Bogenschneider propose that businesses with high levels of worker automation could have their tax depreciation automatically reduced beyond a certain threshold.
Businesses that use robots to replace workers could also be required to cover the payroll taxes of workers knocked out by automation, as proposed by the technology analyst William Meisel. A tax calibrated according to the ratio of a company's profit to its employee compensation could match the wage taxes avoided by automation. Companies deploying robots could also be required to pay some kind of fee, just as employers that lay off workers must subsequently pay more into the unemployment insurance system.
In practice, taxing automation is likely to be difficult. Taxing robots would, first of all, require defining what robots are. Would a robot tax also apply to, say, machine tools? Regardless of where we drew the line, a robot tax could distort investment decisions in other ways.
Nonetheless, there is a wide gap between the way that the tax code treats human labor and the way it treats automation. The hole could be filled by reducing tax subsidies on capital investment altogether. Taxes on labor could also be reduced.
We may not want to tax innovation, but there is no reason to subsidize investments that are designed merely to take away jobs. At the very least, a tax on robots would force businesses to think harder about when and where to deploy them.

Warren sets the pace on child care

Texto completo: For millions of Americans with children, life is a constant, desperate balancing act. They must work during the day, either because they're single parents or because decades of wage stagnation mean that both parents must take jobs to make ends meet. Yet quality child care is unavailable or unaffordable.
And the thing is, it doesn't have to be this way. While other advanced countries spend, on average, about three times as much as we do helping families - so much for our vaunted "family values" - it's still a relatively small part of their budgets. In particular, taking care of children is much cheaper than providing health care and retirement income to seniors, which even America does.
Furthermore, caring for children doesn't just help them grow up to be productive adults. It also has immediate economic benefits, making it easier for parents to stay in the workforce.
Over the past 20 years, women's prime-age employment in the U.S. has lagged ever further behind the rest of the advanced world - at this point we're well below even Japan. And lack of child care is probably one main reason.
So child care really should be an important part of the progressive agenda. Hillary Clinton had a serious plan back in 2016, but the news media was too busy obsessing over emails to pay attention. And if you ask me, Elizabeth Warren's new proposal isn't getting as much attention as it should.
Among other things, unlike purist visions of replacing private health insurance with "Medicare for all," providing child care wouldn't require imposing big new taxes on the middle class. The sums of money involved are small enough that new taxes on great wealth and high incomes, which are desirable on other grounds, could easily raise sufficient revenue.
The logic of the Warren plan is fairly simple. Child care would be regulated to ensure that basic quality was maintained and subsidized to make it affordable. The size of the subsidy would depend on parents' incomes, but nobody would have to pay more than 7 percent of income.
Warren's advisers put the budget cost at $70 billion a year, or around one-third of 1 percent of GDP. That's not chicken feed, but it's not that much for something that could transform so many lives.
It is, for example, well under half the revenue lost due to the Trump tax cut. And it's a tiny fraction of what it would cost to replace all private health insurance with a public program.
So what are the objections to this plan?
I'm hearing from a few people on the left who complain that the plan doesn't go far enough - that it should involve free, direct public provision of child care, not subsidies to private provision. 
Meanwhile, on the right there are the usual cries of "socialism." 
More interestingly, I'm seeing at least some commentary on the right that doesn't just push back against the whole idea of making it easier for mothers to work, it wants us to go back to the days when families could "live on one income."
Realistically, of course, that's not going to happen, and not just because 30 percent of U.S. children live in single-parent households. 
The bottom line is that Warren's proposal is impressive: It's workable, affordable and would do a huge amount of good.
Right now, all the real contenders for the Democratic nomination are solidly progressive, but so far some seem either underbriefed on policy issues, or too committed to sweeping, maximalist policy visions to think seriously about what they might truly be able to do if their party takes the White House and Senate next year.
Visions and values are great, but Democrats also need to be ready to hit the ground running with plans that might actually turn into legislation. And so far, Warren is setting the pace.

In the Lineup: Female big-wave surfers face a dangerous threshold

Texto completo: In the windy, fearsome conditions of the World Surf League’s third annual women’s Big Wave Tour Jaws Challenge at Peahi, Maui, Nov. 26, only one surfer, Emi Erickson, kept her feet after making the sheer drops down the sheer, towering faces, turning and riding ahead of the whitewater to the shoulders. In the final heat she caught one wave and received the highest single-wave score, but placed third behind her sister Hawaii surfers, winner Keala Kennelly and runner- up Andrea Moller, who caught more and bigger waves, taking off deeper and falling in brutal wipeouts.
This was kind of frustrating, Erickson, 29, said last week in a phone interview from her North Shore home. “I was there to get waves. I was having fun, riding my favorite board, a single-fin (that) everybody said was old-fashioned and traditional.”
The WSL commentators snarkily gave Erickson “kudos for just her equipment choice” but praised her commitment and strategy. “She positioned herself in the lineup knowing what kind of wave she wanted, a little bit further over to the channel, but it’s put her in an opportunity to be able to complete this successful ride.”
In a New York Times Magazine cover story Feb. 7 entitled “The Women of Big-Wave Surfing,” Daniel Duane echoed the commentators. “Erickson stuck to the old traditionalist approach,” he wrote, “taking off where she knew she could make the drop, gliding beautifully across big walls to safety.”
Erickson said she took this more calculated approach because, in the first women’s Peahi Challenge in 2016, “I listened to what everyone said: ‘We want to reward you if you take off deep.’ ” She did, and the wind got under her board and she wiped out, tearing ligaments and muscles and sustaining cuts, bruises and “major emotional blockages. I was crippled for two years.”
She said she still wakes up incapacitated sometimes. That makes it difficult to support herself as a pro surfer without sponsors, teaching surf lessons and working in smoothie and coffee bars.
In a Star-Advertiser photograph of six riders having a free surf at Waimea Bay on a 12-foot wave (Hawaiian measure, with a 20-foot face) Dec. 5, there is a young woman — Erickson — wearing a leg brace.
The photo was “from the first warm-up swell we had this season,” she said, adding that she prefers bigger days with 18-foot sets, still crowded, but with “not that many people who want those big sets.” She does.
In the new big-wave contest world, a gladiator mentality — charging head-down into the biggest, hairiest pit — is glorified and rewarded, even if you wipe out. This differs from regular competitions where you are judged not only by wave choice (size always matters) but performance — speed, turns, sticking your aerials, emerging from barrels.
At Peahi in November, Kennelly, Moller and others suffered pounding wipeouts and hold-downs. Kennelly almost blacked out; Justine Dupont dislocated a shoulder; Bianca Valenti was disoriented, possibly concussed.
“In the end, you’re the one who pays,” Erickson said. She wondered, as Duane did in his article, if women are feeling too much pressure to risk their lives, to paddle like men into same-size waves in order to earn the same-size purses they demanded and won from the WSL in 2018. But women are mostly smaller and lighter than men, fewer in numbers and newer to the big-wave tour.
“I’m super feminist and have been pushing forever, but it’s a double-edged sword,” Erickson said. “We need to play on our strengths, not the men’s.”
Erickson started surfing at age 19, after being a runner, skater and boogie boarder. She took an old board from under the house of her father, Roger Erickson, a former lifeguard and big-wave surfer on the North Shore, and headed straight out into big waves with a female friend, Wrenna Delgado.
“We were surfing giant Sunset alone on the stormiest days, surfing big Waimea, Makaha. Without (flotation) vests. No money, no glory. We fed off each other’s energy.”
She’d like to feel that happy energy on the competitive side of women’s surfing.
Meanwhile, she’s an invitee to the first WSL women’s big-wave contest at Mavericks in California, in holding period until March 31, and hoping for more big Waimea swells.

El gran problema es que las imágenes que está transmitiendo como nuevas, son en realidad trabajos de reparación a estructuras existentes realizados hace cinco meses.
Nuevamente, a pesar de la sugerencia del presidente, esta no es una nueva sección del muro.
Es un trabajo de restauración y parte del Proyecto de Reemplazo del Muro Fronterizo del Proyecto Santa Teresa de $73.3 millones de dólares.
El trabajo está siendo emprendido por el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de Estados Unidos (USACE). Trump lo aprobó él mismo, cuando asumió el cargo por primera vez en enero de 2017.
“El segmento de la cerca fue construido y financiado por las autoridades de DHS / CBP con el Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército de Estados Unidos que proporciona la contratación / supervisión de la construcción a través de nuestra misión de apoyo interinstitucional”, d ijo a Task & Purpose la vocera del Cuartel General de USACE, Raini Brunson. “El video, que se filmó en septiembre de 2018, tiene el logotipo de USACE porque fue producido por USACE”.
El Cuerpo de Ingenieros del Ejército no pudo confirmar de inmediato dónde se originó la solicitud de las imágenes y cómo acabó en la cuenta de Twitter del presidente.
El New York Times informó el mes pasado que no se habían construido nuevas millas de barreras fronterizas bajo la administración de Trump.
Algo que Trump hizo bien, es que el reemplazo en las 20 millas de barreras que se muestran en el clip sí se terminó a fines de enero.
No es la primera vez que el presidente ha intentado este truco, para pasar el trabajo de reparación como el progreso en su promesa de campaña. Usó fotos de partes reconstruidas del muro existente de la misma manera en marzo de 2018, según
Entonces, como ahora, el presidente fue llamado por los verificadores de los hechos y la oposición, mientras que muchos de sus partidarios continuaron retuiteando sus falsas noticias sin críticas.

Is it any wonder that American news consumers are at the end of their ropes of patience with the "mainstream media"?

Three weeks ago, when I first documented troubling questions, contradictions and doubts about Trump-hating, attention-craving actor Jussie Smollett's absurd hate crime claims, few in the "professional" journalism herd paid heed. Now, with a grand jury investigation on the horizon, everyone's a Johnny-come-lately debunker.

And everyone's making excuses: How could we have known? Why would anyone lie about racism? What could have possibly prepared us for such a scandalous swindle?

I'm especially looking at you, Robin Roberts. You and ABC's "Good Morning America" willingly played public relations agents for Smollett last week while his story was already falling apart and he refused to be fully transparent with investigators. Now, you defend yourselves by hiding behind a veil of ignorance about hate crimes hoaxes.

Listen and learn, addled enablers of fraud. Fake Noose is a sick phenomenon that has run rampant across the country unchecked. I've chronicled the self-victimization pathology in my books, columns and blog posts for years:

* Columbia University, 2007. Remember black psychology professor Madonna Constantine? She made the rounds on none other than ABC's "Good Morning America," claiming she found a "degrading" noose (made of hand-tied twine) hanging from her office door. Constantine led fist-waving protests, decried "systematic racism," and prompted a nationwide uproar, as I reported at the time in the New York Post. Things didn't add up when Columbia initially blocked investigators from obtaining 56 hours of surveillance video. No culprits could be found on the militantly progressive campus obsessed with diversity and multiculturalism. It turned out that Constantine was desperately trying to distract from a brewing internal probe of her serial plagiarism, for which she was eventually fired. The hate crime probe hit a dead end and Constantine faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

* Baltimore Fire Department, 2007. Another manufactured outrage erupted when black firefighter-paramedic apprentice Donald Maynard claimed he found a knotted rope and threatening note with a noose drawing on it at his stationhouse. A federal civil rights investigation ensued and the NAACP cried racism -- until Maynard confessed to the noose nonsense amid a department-wide cheating scandal. A top official revealed that Maynard admitted "conducting a scheme meant to create the perception that members within our department were acting in a discriminatory and unprofessional manner." Maynard faced no criminal charges over the Fake Noose incident.

* University of Delaware, 2015. Black Lives Matter agitators and campus activists triggered a full alert when a student spotted a "racist display" of three "noose-like objects" hanging from trees. The UD president called it "deplorable;" protesters wept that they were not being taken seriously. After investigating, police discovered the "nooses" were metal "remnants of paper lanterns" hung as decorations during an alumni weekend celebration.

* Salisbury State University, 2016. Students, faculty and administrators were horrified when a stick figure hanging from a noose on a whiteboard was discovered at the school's library. The N-word and hashtag #WhitePower also appeared in the menacing graffiti. Campus authorities immediately launched an investigation, which exposed two black students as the perpetrators. Prosecutors declined to file criminal charges against the Fake Noosers.

* Kansas State University, 2017. A paroxysm of protest struck K-State after someone reported a noose hanging from a tree on campus. Black students lambasted authorities for not acting quickly enough. They stoked anger online with the hashtag #DontLeaveUsHanging and demanded increased security. But the "noose" was made of cut pieces of nylon parachute cord, which police believed had been discarded by someone who "may have simply been practicing tying different kinds of knots."

* Michigan State University, 2017. When a student reported a noose hanging outside her dorm room, MSU administrators went into full freakout mode over the racial incident. Cops and the Office of Institutional Equity were immediately notified. "A noose is a symbol of intimidation and threat that has a horrendous history in America," the university president bemoaned. But it turned out the "noose" was a "packaged leather shoelace" that someone had dropped accidentally.

* Smithsonian museums, 2017. NPR called the discovery of "nooses" lying on the grounds of two Smithsonian Institute museums the "latest in a string of hate incidents" after Trump's election. The African-American museum director called them a "reminder of America's dark history." But the museums refused to release surveillance video and my public records request filed last November yielded zero corroboration of any hate crime. The Washington Post, New York Times and ABC's "Good Morning America," which all splashed the story front and center, have yet to follow up.

* Mississippi State Capitol, 2018. ABC, CBS, CNN and Yahoo were among the media outlets that blared headlines about seven nooses and "hate signs" found hanging in trees by the capitol building before a special runoff election for U.S. Senate. The stories created an unmistakable impression that the nooses were left by GOP racists intending to intimidate black voters. In truth, the nooses were a publicity stunt perpetrated by Democrats.

In the wake of Smollett's folly, media sensationalists bluster that there's no way they could have known they were being strung along. Thanks for the valuable admission, elite news professionals, that you are not only dumb and blind but incompetent to boot. It doesn't take a fancy journalism degree to learn from the long, sordid history of Fake Noose:

When you've seen one social justice huckster, you've seen 'em all.

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Pianist Don Shirley, the subject of the Academy Award-nominated movie "Green Book", confronted racist Jim Crow laws when he performed in the South in the 1960s.
But when Shirley came to Wausau to perform in The Grand theater, he had to deal with another problem altogether: A guy dressed as a gorilla stepped on his birthday cake.
That's the way Barbara Lattimer of Wausau, a voice instructor at the Wausau Conservatory of Music, remembers it.
Barbara's husband of 50 years, businessman and music lover Tom Lattimer, arranged to have Shirley perform in central Wisconsin. She doesn't remember the exact year — she thinks it likely was in the early 1970s, after the era the movie portrays. But portions of that evening stuck with her for nearly 50 years, and the memories came flooding back when she went to see "Green Book."
Barbara enjoyed the movie, especially because it revived the time she met Shirley. It also brought back sweeping memories of Tom, who died in 2012 at age 75. It almost felt, Lattimer said, as if Tom were with her in the theater, or that he might show up as a character in the film.
"Seeing the film was so bittersweet for me," she said.
Tom Lattimer had a long career in business, but his passion was music. He especially loved classical and jazz piano.
A 1954 graduate of Wausau High School, Tom Lattimer was a freshman at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia when he began to follow the career of Don Shirley. Shirley was a stand-out musician, not only because of his world-class skills as pianist, but also because of the color of his skin.
Born in Pensacola, Florida, Shirley was the son of Jamaican immigrants and was a musical prodigy, playing standard concert classical pieces at age 10 and performing with the Boston Pops at age 18, according to his 2013 obituary in The New York Times.
Shirley, who is played by Oscar winner Mahershala Ali in "Green Book," initially yearned for a career as a classical pianist. But when he was in his 20s, he was counseled that American audiences were not ready for a black classical pianist. So instead he made his name performing pop music and jazz.
Shirley started playing gigs at nightclubs and, according to the Times, "invented what amounted to his own musical genre," a blending of pop, jazz, R&B and classical styles. Tom Lattimer likely first saw Shirley perform in Philadelphia, and the pianist's style enthralled him, Barbara said: "He began to follow the career of Don Shirley and heard him play frequently in East Coast clubs."
Following the career of Shirley also meant getting to know him as a person. Tom was the type of person who could easily insert himself into conversation and widely varying situations. He just had the ability to connect with people. So he would talk with Shirley after performances, likely peppering him with questions, and gradually become a casual acquaintance of the pianist, someone Shirley would recognize and chat with.
Tom Lattimer returned home to Wausau to become a successful agent for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and a community leader who is remembered for his support of the performing arts.
And he continued to follow Shirley's career. He collected all of his albums and whenever possible, went to see live performances. By this time he and Barbara had married, and she would sometimes go with him.
Tom also had an interest in bolstering the art scene in Wausau. He helped develop the Wausau Conservatory of Music, was a chairman for the Festival of Arts and was a leader in the effort to renovate The Grand theater and create downtown Wausau's ArtsBlock.
A costume party at The Wausau Club was truly smashing. It was natural for Tom to help arrange for Shirley to perform in Wausau.
And it was entirely in character for Tom to invite Shirley to a private party held at The Wausau Club later that evening.
Barbara remembers that it was a costume party, and Tom, after Shirley performed, went to change into a gorilla suit. "I remember Tom meeting Don, holding the head of the suit in his hand," Barbara said. "And Don was upset that he wasn't told it was a costume party. I don't know what he would have done for a costume."
Then Tom and Barbara were taken to the club via Shirley's limousine, and when he got in, Tom put his foot in a birthday cake Shirley had in the car.
But all was forgiven when Shirley got to the party. The pianist was the center of attention, with people buying him drinks and talking with him. He asked Barbara, at one point, how he ever got connected with Tom, and all Barbara could do was explain that was just how Tom was. She couldn't bring herself to tell the musician that her husband had been essentially stalking him for years.
The movie portrays Shirley as a serious, regal and sometimes difficult man who insisted on pushing racial boundaries, Barbara said. The Shirley she remembers was jovial, smiling and laid back.
But, she said, at one point in the evening Shirley did share with Tom that he had a higher purpose to his performing tours.
"He told Tom that 'what I do is not about the music. It's about civil rights,'" Barbara said. "And the movie shows that. He puts himself in danger, trying to cross these (racial) barriers."

'EMPIRE' CUTS SMOLLETT FROM 2 EPISODES

Texto completo: CHICAGO - Actor Jussie Smollett's character on "Empire" will be removed from the final two episodes of this season in the wake of his arrest on charges that he staged a racist, anti-gay attack on himself last month in downtown Chicago, producers of the Fox TV show announced Friday.
The announcement came a day after Mr. Smollett turned himself in to police, appeared in court on a felony charge of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report, and left jail after posting bond.
The series is on a midseason break and returns March 13 with nine episodes. The last two episodes of the fifth season were being made when Mr. Smollett was charged.
White House on Acosta
WASHINGTON - White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Friday declined to say whether President Donald Trump still has confidence in Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta after a federal judge ruled the Justice Department broke the law while Mr. Acosta was a U.S. attorney.
A judge said Mr. Acosta - then the U.S. attorney in Miami - signed off on a plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, the Palm Beach billionaire and serial sex abuser, without informing victims about what they were doing.
U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra ruled Mr. Acosta and other officials did not confer with Epstein's victims about the 2008 plea agreement.
Steve King blames media
Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said Thursday that he plans to run for re-election in 2020 and remained unapologetic for repeatedly making offensive remarks, some of which have been widely rebuked as racist and recently led to his being stripped of his congressional committee assignments.
The nine-term congressman has long weathered criticism for his inflammatory comments about race and immigration, but he appeared to take things a step too far in a Jan. 10 interview with The New York Times in which he was quoted questioning how terms such as "white nationalism" and "white supremacy" had become offensive.
The 29-word quote sparked fierce public backlash as Mr. King was condemned by members of his own party and faced numerous calls for his resignation. Then, just days after the interview published, Republican leaders voted unanimously to remove Mr. King from his committee posts.
When asked during an interview released Thursday by Iowa Public Television if he was "sorry for anything" he has said, a defiant Mr. King blamed the "dishonest" media for his problems.
Waterslide trial
KANSAS CITY, Kan. - A judge dismissed criminal charges Friday against a Kansas water park owner and the designer of a 17-story slide on which a 10-year-old boy was decapitated in 2016.
Wyandotte County Judge Robert Burns cited improper evidence in dropping second-degree murder charges against Schlitterbahn owner Jeff Henry, designer John Schooley, and general contractor Henry and Sons Construction Co. The judge also dismissed an involuntary manslaughter charge against operations manager Tyler Miles, The Kansas City Star reported .
They were charged after Caleb Schwab died while riding the waterslide.

Boy Soldiers Find Refuge, And Saudis Craft Message

Texto completo: MARIB, Yemen -- A display on one side of the doorway holds children's drawings of violence and gore: red scribbles of blood on pencil sketches of bombs, bullets and bodies; a machine gun firing across a stone wall into a tent; a detailed depiction in crayon of a Kalashnikov rifle.
A display on the other side holds happy visions of the future -- like a boy with his foot on a soccer ball holding up a trophy, and a smiling army officer with three big stars on each shoulder.
In between is the entrance to the center for the rehabilitation of child soldiers in Marib, Yemen, financed by Saudi Arabia. A photograph of King Salman hangs on the wall.
Open a little more than a year, the center has provided up to six weeks of schooling and play in a comfortable villa for more than 200 boys enlisted by armed groups fighting in Yemen.
Almost all were recruited by the Houthis, the Iranian-allied Yemeni group fighting against the Saudi-backed forces, the center's staff say.
But the center also doubles as a propaganda stage set, where its Saudi funders and their Yemeni allies have brought a long roster of Western news organizations to hear the children talk about Houthi abuses.
In a dusty yard behind a high wall, the center is a world away from the chaos of the dusty, overcrowded city.
Marib's prewar population of just 40,000 has absorbed nearly 1.5 million displaced Yemenis. In squalid camps, whole families live crammed into one-room cinder block huts.
Only the luckiest children attend any school.
By comparison, the Center for the Rehabilitation of Children Recruited and Impacted by the War in Yemen might as well be a five-star resort.
Its current class of 27 dress like British schoolboys, in black sneakers and pants, with sharply creased blue-check, button-down shirts.
They sleep on neatly made beds in spacious dormitories. They spend their days studying the Quran, drawing pictures, playing soccer or relaxing in a bright parlor furnished with board games.
Each boy is given a new tablet computer as well as about $200 worth of Saudi riyals -- far more than a Yemeni soldier might make in a month.
"You feel like a child here, you behave like a child," said Taher, who said he was 15 but looked younger than 13. (The New York Times is withholding the full names of the children because they are minors.)
Another boy, Rashid, said he was about 12 when he was recruited last year by the Houthis.
But a brief stay in even the most luxurious rehabilitation center, experts say, is unlikely to make much difference to the long-term welfare of the children. It can even complicate a return home by raising unrealistic expectations.
Aid groups instead recommend returning children to their families as soon as possible, followed by long-term support and education in their home communities.
"Where the rubber meets the road is when a person leaves a center like that and returns to their family and community," said Theresa Betancourt, a Boston College professor who has studied the problem.
At the Marib center, the boys are counseled by Mahoub al-Mekhlafi, who said in an interview that he held a doctorate in psychology from the American University in Cairo.
But he could not understand rudimentary English, and the university does not teach in any other language. Nor does it offer a doctorate in psychology.
Among the ways he treats the former child soldiers, Mr. Mekhlafi said, is "autohypnosis."
Aid groups say the recruitment of child soldiers is widespread on all sides of the Yemen conflict, not limited to the Houthis or any one group.
Unicef, the United Nations agency focused on children, has verified more than 2,700 cases of children enlisted in combat in Yemen and "this could just be a tip of the iceberg," the agency said in an emailed statement.
With Saudi visitors watching, the staff members of the rehabilitation center stopped an interview with a boy they said had fought for the Saudi-backed Yemeni forces, not the Houthis.
Ali, a soldier for the Saudi-backed forces who was interviewed at another location in Marib, said he was 16 and enlisted at 15.
The Yemeni director of the center, Abdul Rahmen al-Qubati, later acknowledged that the Saudi-backed forces often consider it a form of support for the family of a dead soldier to enlist his young son.
"It is a big problem," Mr. Qubati said. "In Yemen, the child is only a child until 12, and then he becomes a man. The society thinks very highly of children who carry arms."
Saudi officials arranged the visit by The New York Times to the center in part to rebut an earlier report that Sudanese militias fighting for the coalition had also included soldiers younger than 18.
Saudi officials insisted Sudan was responsible for providing the ages of all of its fighters, and that the coalition sent home any who were discovered to be under 18.
The Saudi officials acknowledged that both Yemeni factions had recruited some children, but they argued that at least their coalition was trying to end the practice.
Child recruitment "is a very important and serious issue and we hope to shine a spotlight on it," said Saud al-Kabli, an official of the Saudi Embassy in Washington. "That is why Saudi Arabia created the rehabilitation project."
But the coalition did not allow any contact or interviews with the Rapid Support Forces, the main Sudanese forces fighting in Yemen. It is a paramilitary group drawn primarily from the janjaweed militia that fought for the government in the conflict in Darfur.
Instead, the coalition arranged visits to two small camps in Saudi Arabia staffed by a smaller deployment from the formal Sudanese army.
Maj. Gen. Ahmadan Mohammed Khair al-Awadh of the Hazem Brigade had placed a yellow sticker in a military manual to mark a paragraph that showed a rule against recruiting soldiers under 18.
But General Awadh denied any knowledge of the larger militia deployment in Yemen. "Who in Sudan told you about that?" he said. "I am only responsible for the Hazem brigade."
As the generals and diplomats trade accusations, the Marib center is deluged with applicants.
In interviews overseen by a Saudi official, a half dozen boys under 15 said they had been lured away from their families by Houthi soldiers offering money, like a salary of $50 a month.
The soldiers invited the boys for military training or in one case asked them to help bury a dead soldier, but after that the boys were effectively abducted, they said.
The Houthis taught the boys how to use Kalashnikovs or heavy machine guns, the boys said, then put them to work carrying supplies to the front -- ammunition, food, tobacco and khat, the narcotic leaf Yemeni men habitually chew.
Two boys said they had brothers fighting for the Saudi-backed forces. All said the fighting had scared them into running away, in some cases after only a month or two.
Rassas, 15, said he had joined the Houthis more than three years earlier, in late 2015, when he had been 12. He said the soldiers ordered him to help retrieve an injured soldier from the front.
"I carried him from his shoulders and someone else from his legs," Rassas said. "Then we carried him on the back of a pickup truck to a military hospital in Sana, and it was at that moment I realized I had to flee."
While doctors tended to the injured man, Rassas took a taxi to the home of an uncle, who smuggled him to Marib.
He found his mother and four siblings in a camp for the displaced. Asked if they were happy to see him, he grew speechless, choking back tears.
Moments later, the center's staff gathered all the boys to sing for their visitors.
"We are living in peace at the King Salman Center," they sang. "We are the builders of tomorrow."

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders's most prominent message is economic, organized around a critique of capitalist inequality, an indictment of the ultrawealthy and a call for expansive new social programs. It helped propel him to a strong second in the 2016 Democratic primary campaign and has returned as the marquee message for his 2020 campaign, which he announced on Tuesday with a promise to "complete that revolution."
Unfortunately for his 2020 campaign, Sanders is less distinct on economic policy than he was in 2016. His rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have either embraced broad ideas like Medicare for all or unveiled their own: Elizabeth Warren's universal child care proposal; Cory Booker's plan to drastically reduce housing costs; Kamala Harris's LIFT Act, which would build on the earned-income tax credit and create a new monthly cash payment for most middle-class households.
But Sanders isn't without an advantage. If in 2016 his foreign-policy thinking was underbaked, then in 2019 he stands as one of the few candidates with a fully formed vision for American foreign policy. It's one that ties his domestic focus on political and economic justice to a larger project of international cooperation and solidarity, anti-authoritarianism and promotion of democratic values. It's a vision that rests on the conviction that progressive politics must continue past the water's edge.
Sanders articulated the substance of his foreign policy views in two speeches: one in 2017 at Missouri's Westminster College -- speaking from the stage where Winston Churchill delivered his "Iron Curtain" speech -- and one last October at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
In his Johns Hopkins address, Sanders offered a big-picture reading of this moment in international relations. For him, the ideological struggle of the 21st century doesn't pit a liberal, democratic America against illiberal, authoritarian opponents, but instead pits liberal, democratic peoples everywhere against illiberalism at home and abroad. It's a "worldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy and kleptocracy" against one toward "strengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial and environmental justice." In this conception of the world, President Trump is just one of many "demagogues who exploit people's fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power."
These movements don't emerge out of nothing. Sanders contends that they are fueled by the enormous disparities of wealth and opportunity that define global capitalism. This is the subject of his Westminster College speech -- an attempt to link domestic economic issues to relations among states. "This planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much, and so many have so little -- and when we advance day after day into an oligarchic form of society where a small number of extraordinarily powerful special interests exert enormous influence over the economic and political life of the world," Sanders said, adding later that "inequality, corruption, oligarchy and authoritarianism are inseparable."
As for culprits, Sanders has a list. His Johns Hopkins address lists Vladimir Putin of Russia, Viktor Orban of Hungary, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as part of this global nexus of corruption and autocracy. He also singles out American billionaires like Robert Mercer and Sheldon Adelson for "promoting a shared agenda of intolerance and bigotry" as part of a "common front" of authoritarianism. And while Sanders was silent on Venezuela in these speeches, he has criticized the government of Nicolás Maduro in other venues, attacking its authoritarianism and suppression of democracy while rejecting intervention by the United States.
If these are the conditions of international relations, then the aim of American foreign policy should be to stand against this rising tide of illiberalism and oligarchy. For Sanders, the United States must create a global order that can constrain authoritarian states and bring democratic accountability to global capitalism. It must also embrace the cooperation necessary for tackling climate change and other transnational challenges, building "partnerships not just between governments, but between peoples" and recognizing that "our safety and welfare is bound up with the safety and welfare of others around the world."
For this project to succeed, however, Americans must also strive for fairness and equality in their own country. "If we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad, and be taken seriously, we need to practice those values here at home," Sanders says.
It's a robust vision -- an expansion of Sanders's cry for "political revolution." He even uses similar terms, closing his Johns Hopkins speech with a call for "an international movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people." There are, however, some missing parts. It's unclear how a President Sanders would approach tense relations with China or deal with democratic decline in Eastern European countries like Poland. And Sanders isn't alone in thinking and talking about these issues -- Elizabeth Warren has also laid out a foreign policy framework, with a similar focus on protecting democracy and curtailing global corruption, and considerable detail on how to get it done.
But Warren has centered her presidential campaign on changing the rules of the American economy. And while Sanders can easily compete here, his bona fides from his 2016 campaign may not be enough to differentiate himself with voters who might not care that he was first on these issues.
What separates him from the pack in this race are his forceful and well-defined foreign policy views -- his synthesis of domestic and international concerns. Rather than fight on old, now-crowded ground, he can move to new territory, opening vital conversations about America's role in the world. He can bring a new set of progressive ideas to the Democratic mainstream and force his opponents to debate them on his terms. In doing so, Sanders could establish himself as the leading candidate for progressive Democrats who want to rebuild the nation's reputation and influence as much as its economy.

Enter Sandmann

Texto completo: Imagine for a moment that a riot occurred in the downtown area of your city. Hundreds, even thousands of people flooded the streets, smashed windows, looted stores, set fires, and beat up innocent bystanders.

But now add a twist. During the riot, each offender left behind a precise digital record of all the damage he or she did. And unlike video records or photographs, these records of the damage done are infallible, in every case leading directly back to all the guilty parties.

This is one metaphorical way of viewing the virtual attack on the lives and reputations of the students of Covington Catholic High School. It began on Jan. 18 with a few negligent and perhaps deliberately deceptive tweets. It went on with shoddy news reports based on false information taken straight from social media. The false, defamatory reports about these students continued for days and days afterwards.

The students’ only apparent offense had been to don politically unpopular hats, souvenirs of their trip to Washington, and to stand in the wrong place at the wrong time, where they had been told to wait for their bus.

Whatever the varied motives, every single person who posted false and defamatory information about these students, whether from malice or even just simple negligence, left an indelible mark that any court of law can trace to its source. Far too many of the negligent accusations, and some of the more malicious ones, can be traced back to people who call themselves journalists. Social media is the modern tool that made this figurative riot possible and encouraged professionals to cast aside standard journalistic precautions against repeating unconfirmed allegations against private persons.

Last week, Covington’s Nick Sandmann sued the Washington Post for $250 million. It is probably the biggest lawsuit he will file, but not the last. Sandmann is unlikely to secure such a sum from the storied newspaper of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. But the Post, like the dozens of other deep-pocketed organizations and persons who appear negligently and with malice to have published highly defamatory information about Sandmann and his classmates, has hardly a leg to stand on in its defense. Libel law frowns upon the powerful when they punch down.

The press gets special treatment in America and is even named in the First Amendment to the Constitution because the republic requires vigilant journalists to hold people in power to account. The Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan provides wide latitude for those writing about powerful public figures, such as President Trump and the many legislators mayors, governors, newspaper owners, and tech titans who feature in the news. As long as they avoid publishing what they know to be false, or publish falsehoods from “reckless disregard of the truth" (a tough but not impossible standard), journalists cannot be found liable even when wrong. This precedent, requiring “actual malice” for liability, prevents the powerful and famous from suing newspapers into silence on trumped-up libel charges.

But journalists' feelings of invincibility can lead to an arrogant sense that there are no boundaries, that they can do no wrong. This is dangerous indeed. For the law treats private individuals, people like Sandmann, his classmates, his parents. and his friends, very differently from public figures. A mere negligent mistake in writing about such people, leading to the publication of defamatory information, can be enough to make the writer liable.

Whether you are a journalist, a celebrity, a think tank, or anyone else with a public platform and a bank account, the civil courts will hold you strictly to account for everything you say about private individuals. You will pay a heavy price for negligence in determining the truth of your allegations. You may be liable for defamation, even if your errors do not evince “malice” or “reckless disregard of the truth.”

There is a good reason for this. With a single story, a careless reporter who fails to check facts can ruin a decent person’s reputation and maybe even his life. That’s why the press is generally much more hesitant to write about private individuals, and why journalists are careful to rely on court records and the like when discussing their misdeeds.

The feeding frenzy that occurred on Jan. 18 was a uniquely modern phenomenon. It combined the nation’s sharp political divisions, deliberate deceptions, heat-of-the-moment partisan carelessness, anti-religious bigotry, and the negligence that social media tends to encourage in professional and amateur alike. This resulted in death threats, "doxing," and false, defamatory information about a group of young men whose conduct in the face of abuse was about as good as anyone could expect from teenagers in the circumstances in which they found themselves.

If ever there was a lesson about the dangers of social media, this is it. This is a case that professors at journalism schools will invoke to scare their students straight about how social media encourages unprofessional behavior. Their message will probably be reinforced by the six-, seven-, and eight-figure payouts that the Post and other publications and individuals will probably be making soon toward Sandmann’s college fund.

Robert Samuelson: Economic policies or pipe dreams?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — As Democrats swing left, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for America. The presidential candidates endorse a variety of far-reaching proposals that, if adopted, would represent the largest expansion of government since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The added spending, taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions.
Are these sound economic policies or partisan pipe dreams?
Let's review the main proposals. For context, remember the following: The U.S. economy (gross domestic product) is about $20 trillion, so a federal program costing $200 billion would be 1 percent of GDP. It would also be about 5 percent of the $4 trillion federal budget.
Here's the rundown:
— Guaranteed job program : Several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn't find one. Economists at Bard College estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at $15 an hour; health insurance and retirement benefits would add another 20 percent. The initial cost would be around $300 billion annually.
— Medicare-for-all : Bernie Sanders proposed this, and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage. Its cost is unclear (in 2017, there were an estimated 27 million uninsured), says a report from PolitiFact of the Poynter Institute. Sanders thinks replacing private insurance with Medicare could cut expenses. Other experts disagree. There would be pressures to sweeten benefits. In a recent New York Times column, economist Paul Krugman wrote that "we'd need a lot more (tax) revenue" to implement Medicare-for-all.
— "The Green New Deal" : Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., propose putting the country on a war footing to purge U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions over a decade. The costs aren't known, because the "new deal" manifesto contains no concrete proposals. However, it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize "clean" energy and suppress fossil fuels.
— Everything else : There are smaller proposals that, in other years, would seem large. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of $70 billion. Sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students. That's perhaps another $50 billion. Then there's "infrastructure" spending — more billions — and a proposal to raise Social Security benefits.
Counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates, the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit ($779 billion in 2018). The actual amount could be more — or less. No one really knows.
How would Democrats pay for this? Some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy. Krugman doubts these would suffice. Adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in "payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class," he writes.
Of course, there is another choice: more deficit spending. Last week, I tried to educate myself on so-called "modern monetary theory." Embraced by some Democrats, its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we've been led to believe. Here's the case for that view, as best I can determine.
"The biggest mistake we make is thinking of the federal government as a household" that has to repay its debt, says Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stony Brook University and an adviser in 2016 to Sanders.
The United States won't default on its governmental debts, because it can always create more dollars — through the Federal Reserve — to honor U.S. Treasury bonds and bills, she says. She rejects the argument that the Fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money. To prevent that, inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates, just as occurs today.
The obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment, she contends. This may or may not be good economics, but it's certainly expedient. No one likes to raise taxes and cut spending, and that may explain why benign neglect of deficits is now going mainstream.
Check out the latest issue of Foreign Affairs. "Washington should end its debt obsession," urge Lawrence Summers and Jason Furman, top economic officials in the Clinton and Obama administrations. Interest rates are low. It's better to borrow and spend on "education, health care and infrastructure."
What's missing from this picture is old-fashioned prudence. True, the government doesn't have to default on its debt in a legal sense. But if financial markets worry about the escalating debt, Treasury bonds will lose value. If the fall in confidence is great enough, it might trigger a panic, made worse by the reality that the dollar is the main international currency.
Our ever-ascending debt increases our vulnerability to a future crisis that we cannot see but almost certainly awaits us.

Texto completo: Academy Award nominated filmmaker Steve James and members of the cast to host Q&A following screening Lisle, IL – Lisle, IL – More than three years ago, filmmaker Steve James spent the 2015-2016 school year documenting the lives of a dozen students from Oak Park and River Forest High School. His goal, he said, was to examine "race and equity and their impact on the quest for racial parity."
On March 4th from 7 to 9 p.m., at Benedictine University (5700 College Road, Lisle, IL), James, five students from the documentary and the Oak Park and River Forest Board President, will screen an episode from the 10-part docuseries, America to Me, at the Daniel L. Goodwin Auditorium.
Best known for his breakthrough 1994 feature, Hoop Dreams, America to Me has been hailed as the best documentary by The Hollywood Reporter and The New York Times called it the one of the Best TV Shows of 2018.
"One of the reasons I wanted to do this series was to dig deeper into how deep-seated institutional racism and societal racism runs in this country," said James.
"One of the things about the series that really surprised me was how amazingly sophisticated and insightful these kids are about their place in the world, and what’s wrong with this world, and what’s right with this world," he added.
The evening film screening is part of the annual campus-wide, day-long Teach-In on Social Justice involving more than 1,000 Benedictine University students, faculty and staff participating in keynote addresses, workshops, and activities to promote social engagement, justice, equity and the Benedictine Hallmarks which include hospitality and a call to serve the common good. The two themes of this year’s Teach-In are Environmental Justice and Sustainability and Inclusion/Inclusivity.
For more information about the America to Me screening, contact Marco Masini at mmasin //ben.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8tOp7J1g3yVI09L.
Benedictine University is located in Lisle, Illinois, just 25 miles west of Chicago, and has a branch campus in Mesa, Arizona. Founded as a Catholic university in 1887, Benedictine enrolls more than 5,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs. The institution is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (hlcommission.org). For more information, contact (630) 829-6300, admissions

Texto completo: Peter Tork, a blues and folk musician who became a teeny-bopper sensation as a member of the Monkees, the wisecracking, made-for-TV pop group that imitated and briefly outsold the Beatles, died Feb. 21. He was 77.
His death was confirmed by his sister Anne Thorkelson, who did not say where or how he died. Tork was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma, a rare cancer affecting his tongue, in 2009.
If the Monkees were a manufactured version of the Beatles, a "prefab four" who auditioned for a rock 'n' roll sitcom and were selected more for their long-haired good looks than their musical abilities, Tork was the group's Ringo, its lovably goofy supporting player.
A versatile multi-instrumentalist, Tork mostly played bass and keyboard for the Monkees.
At 24, he was also the band's oldest member when "The Monkees" premiered on NBC in 1966. Not that it mattered: "The emotional age of all of us," he told The New York Times that year, "is 13."
Created by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, "The Monkees" was designed to replicate the success of "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!" - director Richard Lester's musical comedies about the Beatles.
The band featured Tork alongside Michael Nesmith, a singer-songwriter who played guitar, and former child actors Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones, who played the drums and sang lead, respectively.
"The Monkees" ran for only two seasons but won an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy. In 1967, according to one report in The Washington Post, the Monkees sold 35 million albums - "twice as many as the Beatles and Rolling Stones combined" - on the strength of songs such as "Daydream Believer," "I'm a Believer" and "Last Train to Clarksville," which all rose to No. 1 on the Billboard record chart.
While the band scored a total of six Top 10 songs and five Top 10 albums, it engendered as much critical scorn as commercial success.
Detractors pointed to the fact that the band, at least initially, existed only in name. While the Monkees appeared on the cover of their debut album and were shown performing on TV, their instruments were unplugged. The songs were mostly done by session musicians - much to the shock of Tork.
After the release of the band's second album, "More of the Monkees" (1967), Tork and his bandmates wrested control of the recording process. They also started touring, playing to sold-out stadium crowds and backed by opening acts that briefly included guitarist Jimi Hendrix.
But as Tork's musical ambitions grew, and he began to clash with bandmates who saw the Monkees as more of a novelty act. He left the group soon after the release of "Head," a satirical, nearly plot-free film flop that featured a screenplay co-written by actor Jack Nicholson.
For much of the 1970s, Tork struggled to find his own way. He formed an unsuccessful band called Release, was imprisoned for several months in 1972 after being caught with "$3 worth of hashish in my pocket," and worked as a high school teacher and "singing waiter" as his Monkees wealth dried up. He said he struggled with alcohol addiction before quitting in the early 1980s.
By then, television reruns and album reissues had fueled a resurgence of interest in the Monkees, and Tork had come around to what he described as the essential nature of the music group, which he joined for major reunion tours about once a decade, beginning in the mid-'80s. Tork also performed during that time as a solo artist.
Tork's marriages to Jody Babb, Reine Stewart and Barbara Iannoli ended in divorce. In addition to his sister, survivors include his wife, Pamela Grapes, two daughters, a son and a brother.

Texto completo: SAN CRISTÓBAL, Venezuela -- One moment, the Casique family was piled on a motorcycle, on the way to school: the mother, a son and Nora, the 8-year-old daughter. A fraction of a second later, a truck had barreled into them.
The accident landed the family in the hospital -- and condemned the father, Israel Casique, to scour pharmacies and the black market, or travel to Colombia, in an endless search for the medications and supplies they need to survive in a country where the health care system is in collapse and hospitals lack even basics like soap and alcohol.
The arrival of American donations of food and medical supplies to the Colombian border with Venezuela appeared to be a lifeline for the family and dozens of other patients in critical condition or with serious chronic diseases interviewed by The New York Times last week.
But the delivery of aid has become the epicenter of an escalating political confrontation between President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and the country's opposition, and the impasse has kept the supplies stuck in a converted customs warehouse in the Colombian border town of Cúcuta -- and out of Venezuela -- for nearly two weeks.
Venezuela's chronic patients say the political theater is eclipsing their needs -- with dire consequences.
In the pediatric wing of San Cristóbal's Central Hospital, desperate mothers roam the corridors with lists of out-of-stock medicines needed for their children's surgeries. Others sit in helpless torpor by the intensive care ward, where their babies struggle on life support against preventable bacterial diseases.
Irianny Baute Marín, a diminutive 2-month-old baby with bronchitis, gets respiratory treatment from a device patched together with tape. Her parents had to dispatch someone to Colombia to get the antibiotics she needs, because they are not available in Venezuela.
"I feel so much anguish and desperation," said her mother, Irene Marín, 21. "She is so innocent."
Many other families with no access to hard currency to buy imported supplies see the humanitarian aid as their last chance to save their children.
"Please let it through, because we really need it," Yuritza Montero, grandmother of a month-old boy fighting a life-threatening bacterial infection, while holding back tears. "I know this aid can save lives."
On the wall, a handwritten cardboard sign reads, "Health does not have political affiliation."
[Venezuelans speak of their hopes for their country's future.]
Mr. Maduro has denied there is a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and said Monday the country can export medication. He called American aid a "Trojan horse" aimed at overthrowing his government and blocked a bridge between Venezuela and Cúcuta with barricades and soldiers.
On the other side of the bridge, Venezuelan opposition leaders, along with their Colombian hosts, have described the delivery of the aid as part of a plan to oust Mr. Maduro. They hope to break Mr. Maduro's hold on medication and food -- one of the tools he has used to ensure loyalty. They also hope that the Venezuelan military, a key pillar of support for Mr. Maduro, will turn against him if forced to stand between the population and lifesaving supplies.
In this, they have the firm backing of the United States. President Trump warned the Venezuelan military on Monday that if they continued to block the aid from entering the country in support of Mr. Maduro, they would "lose everything."
Juan Guaidó, a leader of the opposition who has been recognized by the United States and around 50 other countries as Venezuela's interim president, has vowed to get the convoys through and has traveled to the border himself.
Top Latin pop stars, including Maluma and Juanez, will perform at a hastily organized Venezuela Aid Live concert in Cúcuta on Friday. The Venezuelan government will stage its own countershow across the border.
As the political theater on the border escalates, some opposition leaders admit not enough is being done to ensure the supplies get through and reach the right people.
"The challenge is to keep the human needs in sight while this political battle unfolds," said Feliciano Reyes, director of Acción Solidaria, a Venezuelan nonprofit that imports small quantities of donated medicines and distributes them directly to patients and doctors.
On Saturday, a San Cristóbal education official, Aurelio Galán, undertook an exhausting journey over winding mountain roads in triple-digit heat to Cúcuta to join a rally demanding the release of medical supplies. His wife, Luz Marina, stood by his side clutching multiple plastic bags of dialysis solution, which she has had to buy in Colombia since their state-run clinic stopped providing them a month ago.
A week's supply equals her husband's entire monthly salary. He won't be able to buy them for much longer, he said.
"This is some sort of political show from all sides," said Mr. Galán, 53. "If they wanted to, they would have passed that aid already."
Like many other dialysis patients and their families, the Galáns heard on social media and local television that the aid containers in Cúcuta have materials for dialysis, as well as medication for hypertension and diabetes, which many kidney patients also need.
At the Cúcuta rally, opposition speakers amplified the expectations.
"We're going to bring to Venezuela the medication, the medical materials, and to bring liberty," said Gonzalo Ruiz, a Venezuelan doctor and an organizer at Aid and Freedom Venezuela, an activist group.
The Cúcuta aid depot painted a different picture.
Since Feb. 7, the United States Agency for International Development has delivered about 190 tons of aid to Cúcuta. The vast majority of it is food.
The initial amount of delivered medication is too small to make a significant impact, said Manuel Olivares, an opposition leader in charge of organizing medical aid. No dialysis kits are expected to arrive in the near future.
"We can't pretend that this will solve all the problems at once," he said.
International relief organizations like the Red Cross, as well as dozens of small health care groups working in Venezuela, fear the growing political standoff will jeopardize their low-profile work in the country. But on Thursday, Caritas, a Roman Catholic aid group, said it would support the opposition's efforts to bring aid into Venezuela.
On Friday, the police raided and seized medication from Fundación Mavid, a small NGO that has distributed H.I.V. medication in the Venezuelan city of Valencia for years.
Critics of the opposition strategy have asked why they and their Colombian allies have not distributed the stored aid to the thousands of struggling Venezuelans who have sought refuge in Cúcuta, or allowed Venezuelans to cross into Colombia to get the aid themselves.
Some relief workers worry that the opposition's desire to topple Mr. Maduro is overtaking humanitarian needs.
"One side is trying to score political points, and the other is trying not to lose them," said Deixol Saavedra, a Venezuelan migrant who asked for food at the aid warehouse in Cúcuta last month. "What they are interested in is power."
Yet Mr. Saavedra, like a majority of Venezuelans in the region and the chronic patients interviewed by The Times, laid much of the blame for the aid blockade on Mr. Maduro. By denying a crisis, he is condemning thousands to death, many said.
During a dialysis session this month, a 17-year-old kidney patient, Steffany Villamizar, sat up with a tube in her neck, surrounded by dying, bloated patients, and watched as the president toured a pharmaceutical plant on state television, laughing with his ministers.
"Everything was normal to them," she said. "It made me so mad."

More Sun, Less Stuffiness at Two Art Fairs

Texto completo: Galleries participating in art fairs tend to judge their success by the numbers -- not only profits from their sales but also how many new collectors they met who stay in touch. But for visitors, what matters most is less quantifiable: Was the fair experience memorable? And how was the art?
For many viewers reached by a reporter and photographer for The New York Times, the inaugural edition of Frieze Los Angeles and the upstart Felix LA art fair last weekend succeeded on those fronts, dispelling a longstanding notion of the city as a graveyard for art fairs and underscoring its vitality as an art center.
Frieze, set at Paramount Studios, commissioned artworks for the five-acre New York streetscape on the backlot and they helped to give the fair a different vibe, from Hannah Greely's paintings of laundry on a clotheslines to Sarah Cain's wall-to-window takeover of a classic brownstone apartment, including a brilliant stained-glass window.
In the big tent housing 70 gallery booths there were many discoveries to be made. They ranged from a stridently colored, puzzle-like painting of female factory workers by the little-known Sacramento artist Irving Marcus (age 89) at Parker Gallery to a reconstruction of Judy Chicago's important 1965 "Zig Zag" sculpture at Jeffrey Deitch.
Hans Ulrich Obrist, the artistic director of Serpentine Galleries in London, who typically leads two to three trips a year for patrons, called his trip "one of the most exciting we've ever had." He praised the "village-like experience of the Paramount lot," the fair's manageable size (less than half that of Frieze New York) and the various satellite fairs and pop-up events around it.
The popular Felix art fair, which had free entry and was intended to show more affordable art, commandeered several poolside cabana rooms and the entire 11th floor of the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel. Visitors could see unframed paintings by Roger White spread out on a bed and putty sculptures by Matt Hoyt posed on hotel end tables rather than museum pedestals. The lobby had a spread of Kristen Morgin's painted clay replicas of books that she imagined came from Jennifer Aniston's library, with titles heavy on romance and self-help.
Komal Shah, a Bay Area collector and trustee at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, praised the strong showing of women artists across Frieze and singled out as a Felix standout the room of the Chicago gallerist Kavi Gupta, which featured one wall of paintings by AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) -- an artist collective that helped define the vision of the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 70s.
"I did hear a couple of dealers at Frieze lamenting that the L.A. crowd seemed to be more conservative than New York -- more interested in paintings than conceptual work," she said. "But I thought the dealers brought great works. And I loved the energy."
Howard Rachofsky, the Dallas collector, agreed. "I don't ever remember Frieze New York actually being fun -- and this was," he said. "My sense is this will be the first of many Frieze fairs out here." Tickets had quickly sold out, with the final tally of attendance at 30,000. Bettina Korek, the Frieze L.A. director, confirmed the London-based group would return in 2020.
Dean Valentine, the co-founder of Felix, said that given the crowds and positive feedback, he was "excited to start the process" of planning for the future.
Here are some highlights from the fairs' debut editions.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Kamala Harris: Colorful sequined jacket controversy was 'ridiculous'

Texto completo: Presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Wednesday ripped the media coverage of her shopping for a multicolored, sequined jacket while stumping last week in South Carolina.

But while the campaign stop did draw scrutiny, most of the negative press was generated by the apparent coziness between Harris and some of the roving reporters who followed her on her tour of Columbia small businesses.

"So I'm in this store, and I'm hearing her story, and I want to buy something, and so then I look at this multicolored sequin jacket. And I'm thinking this would be really great for Pride Parade, right?" Harris told Comedy Central's "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" of her trip to Styled by Naida, a non-profit organization founded by a formerly homeless woman.

"And I get home, and my husband's like, because he wasn't with me, he's like, 'So there's this jacket that apparently you tried on and it's now got its own life,'" Harris said. "And apparently it became the subject of all this controversy by journalists around should she be doing something like shopping if she's running for president, and then all this other... And just ridiculous, right?"

Commentators like Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said the social media posts correspondents shared of the stop were "just embarrassing."

“So now journalists are going shopping with Harris, helping pick out clothes and then putting out glowing tweets about it,” Hume wrote.

Daily Mail U.S. political editor David Martosko tweeted: "If this is what the 2020 campaign is going to be like, President Trump's complaints about the media could have even more staying power with his base than the last time around."

The New York Times' Jonathan Martin, however, interpreted the encounter differently.

“I took it as a hopeful sign that her handlers aren’t shielding her and are offering the sort of access recent pres campaigns (R and D) have not,” Martin wrote.

Suing to protect the right to just be left alone

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

Texto completo: This year's Academy Awards offers all the traditional reasons to tune in: Glimpses of the world's biggest movie stars preening in couture gowns and borrowed diamonds. Great movies receiving the film industry's highest accolade. Soaring speeches. Stunning upsets.
But for the 2019 edition, there's an equally compelling reason to watch. It's the final chapter to the year's troubled, turbulent awards season. Live.
This Oscar season has been so fraught with missteps, backpedaling, Kevin Hart host-canceling, scandal, furor and controversy right up to this moment, that seeing it all come to a head-spinning conclusion in real time on television with a global audience is going to be a must.
All of that and Lady Gaga crooning "Shallow" with Bradley Cooper and Queen playing. I'm so there. With popcorn.
Kevin Hart out as Oscars host: Backlash from past homophobic tweets
Oscars costume party!: Get up close with iconic outfits from 'Black Panther,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and more
If Oscar producers Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss can pull off this host-less, ever-changing show with moments of poignancy, emotion and intended humor, they're going to deserve an Emmy, a special Oscar and a guest appearance on "MacGyver. "
It's going to be compelling live television, no matter what.
Adweek reports that advertisers have snapped up the full allotment of commercial time, running at $2. 6 million for 30 seconds. Follow the money, because the people spending it know something.
Pulling off a host-less Oscars is the biggest hurdle and potentially most captivating scenario, bang at the show's beginning. It's like a figure skater stepping on the ice and attempting a triple axel jump.
In 2011, there was a host crisis when Eddie Murphy dropped out in November, before Billy Crystal rode in to save the day two days later. Still, many pondered if there would be enough time to pull off the show, which he did.
Hart flamed out of the host job in December following a furor over homophobic tweets revealed from his past. No one else wanted to step into the already thankless job, and the original idea of The Rock as host idea was genius, but he's busy.
The internet is so hungry for someone to fill the void that it's invented this scenario where Whoopi Goldberg, who's gone missing from "The View," is going to step in. Seriously? But wouldn't that be something?
The last time we didn't have a host for the Oscars was 1989 and the opening number featured the jaw-dropping scene of Rob Lowe dancing and singing with Snow White on a helium bender. Lowe is still banging his head against a wall about this.
Just seeing how the show's producers handle the lack of host and opening when confronted with this kind of history is going to be worth ensuring you're tuned in before the last A-lister waltzes off the red carpet into the Dolby Theatre.
Queen and Adam Lambert, whose performance was announced Monday with minimal ceremony and confirmed to USA TODAY as an opening act, could make people forget their host problem in one "We Will Rock You" stomp.
Then there's the other drama that's erupted this year around the major re-tooling of the show – revealing an energized, vocal (oh, and did we mention, very famous) Academy membership ready for some argy-bargy. Remember the "popular film" Oscar? That proposal was shot down faster than Greedo in "Star Wars. "
There have been other stands and hasty retreats by Academy officials. The decision that only two of the nominated songs would be performed – "Shallow" and Kendrick Lamar's "All the Stars" – led to more umbrage. The Academy flipped to allow all nominated songs to be represented, but wasn't able to secure Lamar's participation because he's out of the country and working on an album.
In another effort to cut down on the show's run time, the Academy decreed that four awards would be handed out during commercial breaks, then replayed during the broadcast in abbreviated form. Cinematography, film editing, makeup and hairstyling and live-action short took the hit, and the outcry was sustained – from Brad Pitt and George Clooney to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino.
Just two weeks before the telecast, the show's producers were told by Academy leadership that the show would be drastically changed once again by adding the awards back live.
“It would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown,” Gigliotti told The New York Times. “You find a new way. ”
Watching live awards shows, and live TV productions like "Grease Live," multiplies the thrills because there's no safety net. Right now, there are seasoned pros sweating through an already tricky show, one that's constantly changing in light of every new drama. They are so good that we usually only enjoy the slick product. But as Envelopegate showed us two years ago, when the wrong best-picture winner was announced, things can become regrettably, unforgettably unglued.
And who knows what other dramas will pop in the remaining time before the show finally starts. It's crunch time, and anything goes.
Awards audiences are already tough and have a chip on their shoulder after fights to preserve their show – with the wild card of President Donald Trump watching with his thumbs on Twitter as liberal Hollywood steps out.
Not to mention the surprises which will happen and unknowables which have happened before: a streaker, Neil Patrick Harris onstage in his underwear, Jennifer Lawrence tripping up the stairs to receive her award.
All of this is on top of the vivid plot lines which have emerged this awards season. Popular hits "Black Panther," "Bohemian Rhapsody," "A Star Is Born," and "Green Book" are in the running for best picture. And who the heck really knows who will win? Spike Lee could take home his first directing or best picture Oscar, Glenn Close could break her streak of being the most nominated living actress without a win. It goes on.
History of some sort will be made Sunday. The world waits.

Texto completo: Desus Nice and the Kid Mero make their Showtime debut. And Spike Lee's "School Daze" is on BET.
What's on TV
DESUS & MERO 11 p.m. on Showtime. How do you take a scrappy late-night series hosted by a couple of Bronx pop culture aficionados and size it up for premium cable? The answer, according to Desus Nice and the Kid Mero (the stage names of Daniel Baker and Joel Martinez), is gently. "You don't mess up the recipe if it's working," Desus recently told The New York Times. The pair amassed a following through a free-flowing talk show on Viceland; before it ended last summer, it distinguished itself from other late-night shows through a lack of structure, with episodes that tended to feel like extended hangouts with Desus and Mero; there were no traditional opening monologues. The new show endeavors to take that same structure (or lack thereof) and use premium cable resources to bring in guests like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the pair's first big interview on the new show (and a fellow Bronx native).
SCHOOL DAZE (1988) 5:40 p.m. on BET. A question that will hang heavily over the Academy Awards on Sunday is whether Spike Lee will win a directing Oscar after being nominated, for the first time, for "BlacKkKLansman," his 21st nondocumentary feature. His second, the musical-comedy "School Daze," came out between his classics "She's Gotta Have It" and "Do the Right Thing." It paints a scathing portrait of a fictitious all-black college whose population is divided between members of fraternities and sororities and everybody else. Laurence Fishburne plays a student political organizer; the ensemble also includes Lee and his frequent collaborator Giancarlo Esposito.
What's Streaming
THE UMBRELLA ACADEMY Stream on Netflix. A comic book series created by the former "My Chemical Romance" singer Gerard Way provides the basis for this superhero chronicle, the latest of Netflix's forays into the genre. Ellen Page and the "Game of Thrones" actor Tom Hopper lead the ensemble, playing estranged superhero siblings who are reunited -- and are subsequently attacked by a group of assassins -- after their adoptive father figure dies. Cue the start of a world-saving mission. (Mary J. Blige plays one of the baddies.) In a somewhat unenthusiastic review for The Times, Mike Hale called the series a "polished but increasingly dull version of the same old story: saving the world as a byproduct of overcoming adolescent resentments and family dysfunction."
I, TONYA (2017) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. In the wide and storied world of sports transgressions, few scandals have captured America's attention like the one in 1994 involving Nancy Kerrigan that ended the rising career of Tonya Harding. Craig Gillespie's comedic drama revisits Harding's rise and fall, with Margot Robbie in the lead role and Allison Janney as Harding's mother -- a role for which she won an Oscar.

Soccer Mommy to perform in Kansas City Tuesday

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.

The moniker Soccer Mommy originally started as a joke name that musician Sophie Allison had as her handle on Twitter.
At that time, she wasn’t releasing albums that landed on the Best Albums listings in publications like the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Paste and Billboard .
As Allison returns to Kansas City on Tuesday, Feb. 26, for a headlining show at the Record Bar, she’s embraced the name, while being reserved about the praise she was given for her debut LP, 2018’s “Clean.”
“I think a part of me really doesn’t understand (it). I think like ‘Oh yeah ... all these blogs have written about me, so it makes sense.’ ... To have people saying that it’s one of the best ones is just crazy,” she said in a previous interview with St. Joe Live .
Listeners and music critics latched on to Allison’s storytelling on “Clean,” from the solo opener “Still Clean” to the bass-heavy “Your Dog” and the strummy closer “Wildflowers.”
Her lyrics showcased a mixture of snark, vulnerability and simmering anger, as she works through a breakup and begins to accept herself.
She’s a character you root for when she details a date on the slow-burning rocker “Scorpio Rising.” The listener’s heart goes out to her as she tears herself down, singing about the jealously she has for her current flame’s ex on “Last Girl” (Sample lyric: “Why would you still want to be with me?/She’s got everything you’ll ever need”).
Allison’s knack for distilling those universal emotions has nabbed fans of all ages.
“It’s a range of people from all over — older people and younger people, even little kids sometimes. It’s really cool,” Allison said
The album landed Soccer Mommy on big tours with artists like Kacey Musgraves, Paramore and Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks. In the past week, a clip of Allison dueting with Musgraves on the NSYNC song “Tearin’ Up My Heart” made the rounds on Twitter.
For Allison, it’s a thrill.
“It’s really cool to see people that you listen to when you were younger are into what you’re doing and want to take you on tour. (They) genuinely like your music and aren’t just taking you out on a couple dates. They genuinely want to hear you every night and see what you’re doing. It’s a really good feeling,” she says.

At BuddhaBlends, scratch-made vegan reigns

Texto completo: Meatless Mondays just got a little easier. As did meatless Tuesdays, Wednesdays and, well, any other day one might choose.
At the start of the year, husband and wife team Kyle and Ariana Govan, who own the vegan food truck BuddhaBlends, joined forces with Kava Culture on Fort Myers Beach. The Govans opened BuddhaBlends Vegan Kitchen inside Kava Culture, which took over the former Shark Bar space on San Carlos Boulevard north of Hurricane and Matanzas passes.
"We've been very blessed to have this opportunity," Kyle Govan said.
"We'd been looking for a brick-and-mortar place since we started the food truck, and when this opportunity arose it was just easier to get into an existing kitchen space than to build out something specifically for us."
BuddhaBlends offers an alvegan menu, meaning the kitchen uses no animal products, though it has some remarkable meat and dairy substitutes. Its tacos and nachos feature a blend of ground walnuts, olive oil and taco seasonings that looks and tastes a lot like ground beef. It crafts queso dip using ground cashews. There's even a vegan "pulled pork" quesadilla made from smoked jackfruit that's flavored with barbecue sauce and seasonings from Naples Smoked BBQ.
"We are the first 100 percent vegan kitchen in Fort Myers," Govan said.
"Everything we serve has zero animal ingredients, everything is fresh to-order and has zero processed ingredients."
Other menu favorites include various toasts — avocado toast, banana-nut toast, chickpea toast — waffles, smoothies, blended bowls and nachos. The staff makes a fresh pico de gallo every day, as well as a jalapeño-cilantro aioli made using cashews.
Not surprisingly, the Govans are both vegan, though they came to it for different philosophical reasons.
"Ariana is a huge animal lover," Govan said, "and she sees how uncompassionate we are to animals. Why be cruel to them if we don't have to be?"
For Kyle, the choice to be vegan has roots in the environment.
"We have the largest population this world's ever seen," he said, "and the way the food industry is producing our food, it's just very bad for the environment."
The Govans, both 23, are originally from Clearwater. They attended Florida Gulf Coast University, but the idea for a vegan food truck came to them after a trip to California.
"We saw the different types of food trucks that they had over there, and we were amazed by the variety of food — seafood, barbecue, Chinese, vegan," Govan said.
"Ariana had been vegan for about a year or so, and I was still trying things out, being vegan and vegetarian. The whole time we were out there we ate vegan, and it definitely changed my mind. From that point on, I was a vegan."
After the trip, the pair began thinking about how to bring that "West Coast culture, New Age thing" they fell in love with to Fort Myers.
"We were really interested in how the local breweries brought in food trucks," Govan said, "and we liked the aspect of it being a movable business that can go to events and festivals. Mainly, we wanted to start something that hadn't been done over here."
Plus, they saw a demand for vegan cuisine with the popularity of events like the yearly Veg Fest held in Bonita Springs.
"We saw the market for it, and we just went for it," Govan said.
Though the Govans still take their food truck to weekend farmers markets, special events and catering gigs, the location inside Kava Culture demands a lot of their time and attention.
And it's paying off.
"We've been open for a month, and the feedback has been fantastic," Govan said.

Andrew McCabe claims James Comey's failure to fire him led Trump to paint target on FBI director

Texto completo: Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe made a stunning claim Wednesday which adds a new wrinkle to the timeline of events that led to his dismissal from the bureau.

In an interview with MSNBC, McCabe said a letter Trump initially intended to use to fire FBI Director James Comey criticized Comey for not firing his deputy.

"I have to be careful in the way I talk about this, but I have seen the letter that the president wrote purportedly himself justifying the firing of Jim Comey," McCabe said.

He said in a "rambling four-plus pages," the letter went through a number of reasons why he was firing Comey.

"Now I am not going to go through all of those with you but I will tell you one of them is he claims to want to fire the director of the FBI because of his failure to fire me," McCabe said.

Trump never ended up using the letter. The New York Times reported last year that White House officials urged him not to send it. He instead cited a memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, focusing on the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, as justification to fire Comey in May 2017.

McCabe was fired from the FBI on March 16, 2018, less than two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined that he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In April, it was revealed that the Justice Department IG had referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges while McCabe is mulling whether to sue the government to get his pension back.

McCabe noted in his interview with MSNBC that Trump's firing letter was written "long before."

"So for the president to say today, 'Oh, we caught him and it's the result of the IG investigation,' is just simply contradictory," McCabe said.

Texto completo: A Minnesota man has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with a 1993 cold case after police used a genealogy site to identify him as a suspect and a discarded napkin to obtain DNA evidence.
Jerry Westrom, 52, was charged in the death of Jeanne Ann "Jeanie" Childs, a 35-year-old woman whose naked body was found in her blood-covered apartment. She had been stabbed multiple times all over her body, a warrant says.
Westrom was identified as a suspect by running DNA samples from the case through an online genealogy website, prosecutors said.
The investigation involved tailing Westrom in January to his daughter's hockey game in Wisconsin.
There, Westrom ate a hot dog and threw a used napkin in the trash, the New York Times reports. Authorities retrieved the napkin from the trash and used it to obtain DNA linking Westrom to the cold case, the newspaper reports, citing court records.
Last year, police in Washington State used a similar process to make a cold case arrest in connection with the 1986 murder of a 12-year-old girl. The arrest came after police collected a napkin the suspect used during breakfast at a restaurant, KING-TV, Seattle reported.
Genealogy websites have also recently been used in several high-profile cold case investigations. Among the most notable: Authorities attributed a break in Golden State Killer case to DNA evidence gathered from a genealogy website.
Police can use genealogy websites in this way because there aren’t privacy laws barring them from doing so, said Steve Mercer, chief attorney for the forensic division of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender.
Westrom posted $500,000 bond Friday and was released from jail.

5 things that will be different about this year’s Academy Awards

Texto completo: HOLLYWOOD — It has been a rocky road for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences leading up to this year’s Oscars Sunday.
Last year, producers announced they would include a new awards category to honor popular films during this year’s show. Everyone hated that idea, so they scrapped it.
More recently, they announced that four awards would be presented during commercial breaks in order to keep the show’s runtime down. Everyone hated that idea, so they scrapped it, too.
The show starts Sunday at 6 p.m. Mountain Time. Even though the Academy has walked back those previously proposed changes, there are still a few things that will be different this year, for better or worse.
Here are five notable things about this year’s Academy Awards.
No host
This year will be the first time in 30 years that the Academy Awards ceremony will not have a host.
It’s not for lack of trying. Comedian Kevin Hart was set to emcee the show until some controversial old tweets surfaced and he backed out of the hosting gig.
The last time the show went on without a host was in 1989, according to Vox. It ... wasn’t exactly a success. In place of a host monologue during that broadcast, Rob Lowe did a duet with Snow White, for some reason. Let’s just say that hopefully, this year’s host-less broadcast goes a little better.
A bonus musical performance
Much of how the Academy will fill the time with no host during the show remains to be seen. But there will be an extra music performance to fill some of the void.
Queen and Adam Lambert will perform at the show as a tie-in with the Freddie Mercury biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which is nominated for multiple Oscars this year.
Musical entertainment for the show also will include Jennifer Hudson, Gillian Welch, David Rawlings, Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga and Bette Midler, who will all be performing the songs nominated for the Best Original Song awards category, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Foreign directors nominated
This year’s Best Director field features three foreign directors: Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón (“Roma”), Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Favourite”) and Polish director Paweł Pawlikowski (“Cold War”).
The last time that happened was in 2015 when Alejandro G. Iñárritu, Lenny Abrahamson and George Miller — who are Mexican, Irish and Australian, respectively — were nominated in the category.
First-time acting winner
None of the Best Actress and Actor nominees have won one of the top two Academy Awards for acting. Though some of the candidates have been nominated before, this year will see a first-time winner in each of these categories.
Glenn Close, nominated for Best Actress for her role in “The Wife," is one of the most decorated Academy Awards nominees. She has been nominated three other times for Best Actress, and three times for Best Supporting Actress, but she didn't win in any of those instances.
Close’s fellow nominees this year — Yalitza Aparicio (“Roma”), Olivia Colman (“The Favourite”), Lady Gaga (“A Star Is Born”) and Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me”) — are all first-time Best Actress nominees.
A shorter broadcast
You might get a few more hours of sleep on Oscar night this year. In the name of preserving television ratings, Academy officials have said they want to keep the Oscars show to under three hours.
Ratings for the show have taken a nosedive in recent years, according to the New York Times. Last year, only 26.5 million people tuned in, down from almost double that amount a few years ago.
But with all the awards being presented, and all the nominated songs being performed, it’s not clear how exactly producers will make the show shorter.

Texto completo: Illustration U.S. soccer star Hope Solo celebrates the United States' gold medal victory over Japan in the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Solo is one of the speakers is slated to appear at this year's Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado April 9-13.

The 2019 Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado will feature a writer on "The Simpsons," a World Cup and Olympic soccer champion and an immigration correspondent for the New York Times.
CU in a Wednesday news release announced that more than 100 speakers from 19 countries are expected to attend the weeklong event that has shifted to a Tuesday through Saturday schedule.
The 2019 CWA is exploring the themes of "Design for Life: Breaking the Bubble," "Disruptive Technology" and "Women & Girls Changing the World."
The conference features speeches, panel discussions and performances and is open to the public and free of charge. A full schedule of major addresses and this year's keynote speaker won't be released until the middle of March, according to CWA spokeswoman Erin Rain.
Among the speakers expected to attend is Mike Reiss, an Emmy Award-winning writer and producers and one of the first staff writer's on "The Simpsons," which was recently renewed for a 32nd season.
Hope Solo, a two-time Olympic gold medalist soccer player and winner of the 2011 and 2015 FIFA World Cup Golden Glove awards also is expected to attend.
Miriam Jordan, a national immigration correspondent for the New York Times is scheduled to speak at the event. She has covered the impact of U.S. immigration policy on immigrants, employers and the country as a whole.
The conference will feature speakers in a variety of topics and disciplines including arts, business, the environment, film, health, international affairs, the media and music.
Last year, the conference generated some controversy after organizers decided not to allow the public in to see keynote speaker Ali Raisman's appearance and that the event would not be free. The move was taken by some to be contrary to the freewheeling nature of the conference.
Organizers partially backed off the move and instituted a lottery that allowed 500 members of the public to obtain tickets.
Rain said that all events at CWA this year are free and open to the public.
"If there is a need for a ticket lottery, it will be announced with schedule updates," she said.
The conference runs April 9-13.

Texto completo: I commend Rod Kuhn on his letter of Dec. 16. In addition to the outrageous comments of Mike Quinn and Larry Larsen, there have been many editorial writers suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome. They cannot accept that Donald Trump defeated a truly corrupt candidate, Hillary Clinton, and call him a Nazi among other hateful names.
Trump has been accused of attacking the press, the environment, illegal immigrants and American values. It's interesting how silent the media is now that it is being reported that the Mueller investigation found no wrongdoing by the president or his campaign.
There is no question that there was bias, corruption and criminal activity at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice Department and Obama White House. James Comey has leaked information to the press and there are documented conflicts in testimony before Congress between Rod Rosenstein and others. Trump has clarified many times that he strongly supports the 95 percent of the FBI who protect the citizens of this great country. He needs an attorney general and FBI director that will enforce laws and help drain the swamp.
Trump has repeatedly criticized the press for their "fake news." CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, AP, New York Times and Washington Post have all demonstrated extreme bias against the president as they claim to be disseminating news that is nothing more than hateful liberal opinion. 
Trump continued the border policy of President Barack Obama with some notable exceptions. Those include elimination of "catch and release" and the proposed construction of the wall. Democrats cannot use the word wall, preferring to call it a "barrier." This is grade school behavior at best.
Star Parker (10/29/18) and Kari Bitz (11/7/18) described what it means to support (as Trump has) traditional American values. God bless America.

Should Alabama ISIS bride Hoda Muthana be allowed to return home?

Texto completo: An American woman who traveled to the battlefields of Syria and married and had a child with an Islamic State fighter wants to come home and face the U. S. justice system, her family's Florida-based lawyer told USA TODAY.
Hoda Muthana left Hoover, Alabama to join the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, four years ago at age 19. In Syria, she called for Americans to be attacked, and she spread the group's propaganda online.
She is one of about 1,500 foreign women and children – the spouses and children of Islamic State militants – held in a Kurdish-run detention camp in northern Syria.
Muthana is there with her 18-month-old son. The child's father is not alive. Two of her previous husbands, both Islamic State militants, are also dead. Muthana is not allowed to leave the camp and has armed guards protecting her from Islamic State sympathizers.
"The government needs to engage with her, but not just her; all of these people who joined ISIS" from the West, said Hassan Shibly, a legal representative for the Muthana family. "If she broke the law, then the justice system can deal with her, and if she didn't break the law, she should come back anyway, so it can be determined if she is a threat. "
More: Hoda Muthana, ISIS bride from Alabama, begs to come home
Shibly said Muthana has realized she made a mistake in moving to Syria and wants to return to the USA to face justice and "pay any debts she has to society. " He said she wants to speak out against the Islamic State and help de-radicalize other Americans.
Muthana abandoned her family and fled to Syria in 2014, a year after she graduated from high school. She briefly studied at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.
Shibly shared a letter Muthana wrote this week in which she described herself as "naive, angry and arrogant" when she decided to journey to Syria.
"During my years in Syria, I would see and experience a way of life and the terrible effects of war, which changed me," Muthana wrote. "Seeing bloodshed up close changed me. Motherhood changed me. Seeing friends, children and the men I married dying changed me. Seeing how different a society could be compared to the beloved America I was born and raised into changed me. "
Shibly, executive director of the Florida Council on American Islamic Relations in Tampa, said it was not clear from a legal standpoint whether Muthana's "marrying into ISIS" could warrant a "material support charge" to Islamic State activities, which range from terror attacks in the USA and Europe to beheadings in Iraq and Syria.
Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said that if he were advising Muthana, he would tell her that coming back to the USA would be "risky. " Dershowitz told the New York Post her case would be a "close call" even if all she did was tweet and send emails.
Muthana claimed to have had no contact with U. S. authorities, and Shibly said she can leave the camp only if the U. S. government asks for her release. It's not clear if it has. U. S. immigration authorities were not available to answer questions about her case, including whether a U. S. citizen can be barred from entering his or her own country.
U. S. Customs and Border Protection referred questions about Muthana to the U. S. State Department.
In a briefing, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino would not address Muthana's specific case, but said repatriating foreign terrorist fighters to their countries of origin was the "best solution to preventing them from returning to the battlefield. "
Only six American militants have returned from fighting or training with militant groups in Syria, according to New America, a Washington-based foreign policy research institute. All were taken into custody. Muthana may be the first American spouse or partner of an Islamic State fighter who has sought to return home. The New York Times has reported that another woman, dual U. S. -Canadian national Kimberly Gwen Polman, 46, is also in the al-hawl refugee camp in Syria. She left Canada in 2015.
A similar case in Britain involves Shamima Begum, 19, from London, who gave birth to a baby boy over the weekend in the same camp where Muthana is held.
Begum, who left Britain for Syria at age 15 and married an Islamic State fighter, wants to return to Britain for the sake of her child's welfare, but British authorities, including the nation's interior minister, indicated they might try to block her return. They might find that difficult to do because a British national can't theoretically be prevented from returning home unless that person is also a national of another country. Begum isn't.
The woman's London-based lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said Tuesday that the British government informed him that it is trying to strip Begum of her British citizenship.
As for Muthana, "whether it's a few years in jail, 20 years in jail or no jail, she's open to the legal process, and she's not asking for a free pass, just due process," Shibly said.

Texto completo: China announced
in 2018 that it no longer wanted
to import U.S. recyclables
STAUNTON - A special meeting has been called to discuss Staunton's recycling program.
Council will convene Thursday at 6:30 p.m. in the City Hall Caucus Room. During the meeting, council will get an update on the recycling program, which faced an unexpected cost increase in August.
Sonoco Recycling, the company which offers Staunton recycling services, began billing the city $52,000 annually for the same services it once offered for just $3,100. At the time of the announcement, city officials said residents wouldn't see a change.
The company attributed the increased price tag to global trade policies, leveling growth rates in foreign counties and economics. China announced in 2018 that it no longer wanted to import U.S. recyclables, according to the New York Times.
Mayor Carolyn Dull told The News Leader in an email that she won't have much to say about the program update until she hears from staff.
In July, city spokeswoman Ruth Jones Turner said the city would be able to manage the new cost into the spring of 2019.

IRAN'S 40 YEARS OF DARKNESS TEHRAN MATCHES CONCILIATION WITH CONTEMPT

Texto completo: From its beginning 40 years ago this week, the Islamic Republic of Iran has enjoyed the generous benefit of the doubt from credulous observers in the West. History hasn't been kind to their sympathy.
"The depiction of him as fanatical, reactionary and the bearer of crude prejudices seems certainly and happily false," wrote Princeton's Richard Falk of the Ayatollah Khomeini in an op-ed for The New York Times on Feb. 16, 1979. "Having created a new model of popular revolution based, for the most part, on nonviolent tactics, Iran may yet provide us with a desperately needed model of humane governance for a third-world country."
A decade later, after a reign of unbridled terror that culminated with the infamous fatwa against Salman Rushdie and the 1988 mass murder of thousands of political prisoners, including children, there was another false dawn. Several, in fact.
Ali-Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, who became Iran's president after Khomeini's death, was viewed as a reformer. In truth he was a kleptocrat who orchestrated an international bombing and assassination campaign stretching from Buenos Aires to Berlin. Rafsanjani's successor, Mohammad Khatami, was supposed to be a moderate. That didn't stop the bloody crackdown on student protests in 1999 or Iran's illicit pursuit of a nuclear weapons program during his tenure.
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was one Iranian leader who got little international sympathy. Yet even under him Western reporters penned flattering tributes to Iran's purported openness - right up until the moment the regime stole the 2009 election and brutally suppressed the failed, if inspiring, Green Movement that followed.
Next was Hassan Rouhani, a man the West imagined it could do business with. Business it did, in the form of the Iran nuclear deal and - until the Trump administration put an end to it - the lifting of sanctions.
Yet as goodwill flowed toward Iran, malice flowed out. In 2015 the government executed close to 1,000 people, roughly double the figure of 2010. Last month, it publicly hanged a 31-year-old man on charges of kidnapping and having sex with another man; he's one of an estimated 5,000 gays and lesbians killed by the Islamic Republic.
Abroad, and not just in the Middle East, Iran and its proxies continue to plot violence. An Iranian attempt to bomb the meeting of an opposition group near Paris was foiled last summer. In October, Copenhagen recalled its ambassador to Tehran after another Iranian assassination attempt was prevented in Denmark. In January, Germany banned Iran's Mahan Air because of its role in ferrying arms and fighters to commit atrocities in Syria. German intelligence officials have also accused Iran of trying to acquire nuclear materials in 2016, after the nuclear deal went into effect.
These are countries that want better relations with Iran, and have made efforts to steer a course independent from the Trump administration. Tehran's behavior gives the lie to the idea that it matches conciliation with conciliation. It matches conciliation with contempt.
Donald Trump's foreign policy has mostly been shambolic, but credit where it is due: Other than the stunning folly of the announced withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, where they could help check Tehran's regional ambitions, he has gotten Iran mostly right.
America's withdrawal from the nuclear deal has not led Iran to resume its nuclear program (despite some gesturing to that effect). A tougher U.S. tone is likely behind the sharp drop in Iranian harassment of U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf. The resumption of sanctions has put Iran under acute economic stress.
Most important, ordinary Iranians know where to pin the blame. Last summer, social media captured Iranian protesters chanting "Death to Palestine," "No to Gaza, no to Lebanon" and "Leave Syria and think of us." These are people sick of going hungry and unpaid while singing the "Death to America" theme song.
The overarching goal of Western policy cannot be to appease Iran into making partial and temporary concessions on its nuclear program, purchased at the cost of financing its other malignant aims. The goal must be to put an end, finally, to 40 years of Persian night.
This should not be a military campaign. But it can be a campaign of economic pressure, to put Iran's leaders to a fundamental choice between their ideological ambitions and the needs of their people. It can be a campaign of diplomatic pressure, to underscore that a regime that routinely flouts the rules of civilized countries can't be treated as one itself. It can be an intelligence campaign, to continue to expose and subvert Iran's efforts to acquire and field strategic arms.
Above all, it has to be a human-rights campaign. Liberals and progressives should not find it difficult to join conservatives in championing the rights of women in Iran, particularly women removing their headscarves in public and courageously facing the consequences. Nor should it be difficult for liberals and conservatives alike to call attention to the plight of Iran's political prisoners, much as both sides were once moved to action by the plight of political prisoners in the Soviet Union or China or South Africa.
Back when there was an idea of something called the free world, led by the United States, Americans cared about such things, and were willing to act. It is not too late for Americans to do so again, when so many are still in the dark.

Texto completo: Karl Lagerfeld, the eccentric German designer who blended fashion and art, who favored white hair, black sunglasses and 19th-century-style shirt collars, and simultaneously was creative director of French (Chanel), Italian (Fendi) and eponymous international fashion labels, has died. He was around 85.
One of the most celebrated, if controversial, fashion icons of the 20th and 21st centuries, Lagerfeld died early Tuesday, according to The Associated Press.
Such was the enigma surrounding the designer that even his age was a point of mystery for decades, with reports he had two birth certificates, one dated 1933 and the other 1938.
"Thanks to his creative genius, generosity and exceptional intuition, Karl Lagerfeld was ahead of his time, which widely contributed to the House of Chanel's success throughout the world," CEO Alan Wertheimer said in a release posted to the brand's website. "Today, not only have I lost a friend, but we have all lost an extraordinary creative mind to whom I gave carte blanche in the early 1980s to reinvent the brand."
Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel's president for fashion, added, "The greatest tribute we can pay today is to continue to follow the path he traced by – to quote Karl – 'continuing to embrace the present and invent the future.' "
The Chanel release confirmed Lagerfeld would be succeeded as creative director by Virginie Viard, his longtime studio director and collaborator.
Fendi's chairman and CEO Serge Brunschwig lauded Lagerfeld's "immense culture, his ability to rejuvenate at all times, to taste all the arts, to not overlook any style" in a press release issued to USA TODAY Tuesday.
"He leaves us an enormous heritage, an inexhaustible source of inspiration to continue. Karl will be immensely missed by myself and all the Fendi people," Brunschwig said.
On Jan. 22 Lagerfeld worried fans when he who had looked increasingly frail in recent seasons, did not come out to take a bow at Chanel's couture show in Paris, which the company attributed to fatigue. It was is the first time in recent memory that Lagerfeld, who has designed for the house since 1983, did has not come out to receive applause at the end of one of his shows.
Viard, appeared in his place, emerging from the door of a lavish Italian "villa" set painstakingly created by the house to showcase its spring-summer designs.
Never shy about his own genius, Lagerfeld considered himself world renowned for his "cutting-edge, aspirational and relevant approach to style," with a fashion sensibility "rooted in a DNA that's accessible-luxe and cool," and a "signature aesthetic combining timeless classics with a modern, rock-chic edge," according to his website.
At one point in 2013, he said he wanted to marry his closest companion – his cat, a white Siamese named Choupette, who has nearly 50,000 Twitter followers and an Instagram account.
But that was only one of the headlines chronicling outre conduct over the years: He once used strippers and a porn star as models, thus annoying Anna Wintour who walked out of one of his shows in 1993.
An unapologetic supporter of fur in fashion (even though he didn't wear it himself), he invited the wrath of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, which tried to throw a pie at him at a New York event in 2001. They missed and hit Calvin Klein.
"A fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style," sneered PETA of Lagerfeld.
Then there were the uproars after he called supermodel Heidi Klum "insignificant" in the fashion world because she was "too glamorous" in 2009; criticized singer Adele as "a little too fat" in 2012; and later that year dissed Pippa Middleton's face, suggesting she only show her backside.
From the 1950s, Lagerfeld exchanged frequent public barbs with rival French designer Yves Saint Laurent until the latter died in 2008. He even got into a fracas with Oscar queen Meryl Streep when he claimed in 2017 that she dropped out of wearing a Chanel dress to that year's Oscars in favor of a brand that would pay her.
"He lied," Streep snapped.
In 2013, Lagerfeld told French magazine Paris Match he was born in 1935, but as of 2019, even his own assistant still didn't know the truth. They told the Associated Press he liked "to scramble the tracks on his year of birth – that's part of the character."
Born in Hamburg to a father whose company made evaporated milk and the daughter of a local politician, Lagerfeld migrated to Paris, where he finished his education at Lycee Montaigne.
He started his career in 1954 when he won first prize in a contest to design a wool coat, a design subsequently produced by Pierre Balmain who offered Lagerfeld, then 17, a job as his assistant. By 1957, he was an art director for designer Jean Patou.
Lagerfeld also started his own label, Karl Lagerfeld, which though less commercially successful than his other ventures, was widely seen as a sort of a sketchpad where the designer worked through his audacious ideas.
In 1982, he took over at over Chanel, which had been dormant since the death of its founder, Coco Chanel, more than a decade earlier.
Lagerfeld was open about his homosexuality – he once said he announced it to his parents at age 13 – but kept his private life under wraps. Following his widely known relationship with a French aristocrat who died of AIDS in 1989, Lagerfeld insisted he prized his solitude above all.
"I hate when people say I'm 'solitaire ' (or solitary.) Yes, I'm solitaire in the sense of a stone from Cartier, a big solitaire," Lagerfeld told The New York Times in an interview. "I'm happy to be with people, but I'm sorry to say I like to be alone, because there's so much to do, to read, to think."
As much as he loved the spotlight, Lagerfeld was careful to obscure his real self.
"It's not that I lie, it's that I don't owe the truth to anyone," he told French Vogue in an interview.

He Cheered On the Amazon Deal. Now That's His Political Wedge.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
The responses came out sheepishly, as though the debate question had delved into some illicit college-age misconduct.
"Yes, unfortunately," Nomiki Konst, a candidate for public advocate, admitted. "Not anymore."
Other Democratic candidates, like Ydanis Rodriguez, a city councilman from Upper Manhattan, Ronald Kim, an assemblyman from Queens, and Danny O'Donnell, an assemblyman from Manhattan, also gave grudging nods, but blamed their partners or spouses.
Their transgression? Acknowledging that they have used Amazon.
Of the candidates on the debate stage that day, only one -- Eric A. Ulrich, a Republican city councilman from Queens -- was an unabashed fan of Amazon, and the only one who fully supported the company's deal to accept as much as $3 billion in tax incentives to build a corporate campus in Long Island City, Queens.
And now that Amazon has pulled out of a deal, Mr. Ulrich may be uniquely positioned to benefit.
Nearly all of the 17 candidates in the Feb. 26 special election have opposed the deal that would have given Amazon the tax breaks, citing the company's anti-union background, and the demands that 25,000 workers would have placed on the city's struggling housing and transit infrastructure.
Mr. Kim even named his party line "No Amazon."
So for voters cheering Amazon's departure, there is no shortage of like-minded public advocate candidates to choose from. But for those unhappy with the company's exit -- and the loss of the 25,000 jobs the company had promised to create -- Mr. Ulrich may be a logical choice.
"I was right and they were wrong," Mr. Ulrich said in an interview. "The other candidates in this race were trying to outperform one another on who can be more anti-business and anti-Amazon. They chased Amazon out of town."
A Republican running for citywide office in New York would not normally stand much of a chance, if for no other reason than simple political math. For every one registered Republican voter, there are six registered Democrats. Multiply that by a factor of Trump -- the president's election in 2016 has only strengthened the Democrats' hold on New York -- and the current odds rise even further.
But as one of two Republicans (Manny Alicandro, a lawyer, is the other) running, Mr. Ulrich may benefit from the race's nonpartisan status: With 15 Democrats in the race, the traditional Democratic vote may be spread so diffusely that it could boost a Republican's chances.
"I think there's a chance that regular people who would not normally be inclined to vote in a special election are a little bit angry about what happened and are therefore more likely to vote," Chris Coffey, a Democratic political consultant, said of the failed Amazon deal. "And if they are, there's only one person who was not against Amazon and that's Eric Ulrich."
Amazon's new campus drew strong disapproval from the public advocate field early on.
Mr. Kim, for example, wrote an opposing op-ed with Zephyr Teachout, a law professor who has run unsuccessfully for attorney general and governor on progressive platforms, and introduced legislation that would direct corporate subsidies to instead help cancel student debt.
Melissa Mark-Viverito, a former City Council speaker, denounced the plan, suggesting that New York should focus on improving its subway system. Jumaane Williams, a councilman from Brooklyn, was irate. "You give away $3 billion? $3 billion? To the richest man in America?" Mr. Williams told The New York Times in November.
And during the recent debate, several other public advocate hopefuls doubled down on their position against Amazon. Ms. Konst said she was "actively fighting" the Amazon deal. Mr. O'Donnell said the deal was done "backwards." Dawn Smalls called for the plan to be blocked until there was further public review. Michael A. Blake, an assemblyman who represents the Bronx, called for "dramatic changes" to the proposal.
"They were reading from the same script," Mr. Ulrich said when asked about the question in an interview. "It's like they were passing a piece of paper and putting their own spin on it."
Mr. Ulrich has already distinguished himself from the Democrats in the race by taking a tougher stance on the policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio. He opposes the plan to close the Rikers Island jail complex and congestion pricing.
Mr. Coffey said Mr. Ulrich's path to becoming public advocate must travel through Republican voters and people "who don't like" Mr. de Blasio. "If you have a small number of people who all go to Eric Ulrich in a race like this, that could be a game-changer," he said.
Amazon's decision to abandon its planned campus has spawned a political nonprofit called Accountable New York that will urge voters out to vote on Feb. 26 by attacking Mr. de Blasio in planned television and digital advertisements. The group, created by a Republican political operative, E. O'Brien Murray, is not allowed to explicitly support any candidate.
Although Mr. de Blasio joined with Mr. Cuomo to support the Amazon plan, the pair split on who to blame after the deal collapsed. Mr. Cuomo blamed Senate Democrats and other members of his own party who identify as progressive for opposing the plan. Mr. de Blasio mostly pointed the finger at Amazon, saying Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the collapse of the deal is an example of an "abuse of corporate power."
"The mayor gets flak and he runs from the Amazon deal and he refuses to fight for it," said Mr. Murray, who recently ran Keith Wofford's unsuccessful Republican campaign for attorney general. "New York is being taken over by left-wing liberal socialists."
But candidates such as Mr. Kim and Ms. Konst believe they may benefit from the Amazon decision because they were against the deal in any form, while several other candidates wanted to simply modify it.
"There's a litmus test at this point," Mr. Kim said. "It's basically corporate politicians versus true progressives."
Ms. Konst said the stances adopted by public advocate candidates on the Amazon plan show the importance of the job as an investigator and foil to the mayor. "At the end of the day, Amazon is a bad company and we should not be welcoming bad companies with bad histories," she said.
Other public advocate candidates have been accused of shifting their position to become more critical of Amazon, perhaps sensing the shifting political winds among Democrats.
Ms. Mark-Viverito, Mr. Williams, Mr. Blake and Mr. Rodriguez all signed a letter in October 2017 urging Amazon to locate their campus here. They have all since said that does not mean they support the deal that the city and state agreed to, but others have seized on the seeming incongruity.
"By signing the letter, you are clearly supportive of the deal," said Councilman Rafael Espinal of Brooklyn, who is running for public advocate and did not add his signature to the letter. "I don't believe we should have even started the conversation" because of Amazon's labor practices and how it hurts small businesses.
Mr. Blake opposed the Amazon deal when it was announced, calling it "very troubling" in a statement. He also called for more transparency regarding the details of the plan, such as how it would benefit the community.
After the deal's collapse, Mr. Blake said he was disappointed. In an interview, Mr. Blake said his reaction should not be interpreted as him changing his stance on Amazon. "I said the deal needs to be changed," he said. "That does not mean scrap the deal."
Mr. Blake suggested that his position on Amazon -- sandwiched between Mr. Kim's fervent opposition and Mr. Ulrich's "blind acquiescence"-- was the smartest and most consistent one, characterizing Amazon as a "defining issue" in the election.
Mr. Ulrich agreed.
"The voters will remember that either you were for Amazon and for jobs," Mr. Ulrich said, "or you were against Amazon and against jobs."

Texto completo: CAIRO -- Egyptian officials detained a New York Times correspondent after he arrived in Cairo on Monday, holding him incommunicado for hours before forcing him onto a flight back to London without explanation.
The move against the correspondent, David D. Kirkpatrick, is an escalation of a severe crackdown against the news media under Egypt's strongman leader, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
Egyptian journalists have borne the brunt of Mr. el-Sisi's repression, with dozens imprisoned or forced into exile. But of late, a lack of pushback from the United States has emboldened Egypt's security forces to take stronger action against representatives of Western news outlets, including expulsion.
Mr. Kirkpatrick, 48, was Cairo bureau chief for The New York Times from 2011 to 2015 and is the author of a recent book on Egypt, "Into the Hands of the Soldiers." He was detained on arrival at Cairo airport on Monday night by security officials.
Hours later, after being officially denied entry to the country, Mr. Kirkpatrick's phone was confiscated and he was held without food or water for seven hours.
On Tuesday morning, Egyptian officials escorted him onto an EgyptAir flight back to London. An air marshal held his passport until the plane touched down at Heathrow Airport.
The Egyptian authorities gave no explanation for their actions. Sam Werberg, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Cairo, said: "We're concerned about reports of the unexplained refusal of entry to Egypt of a U.S. citizen New York Times journalist. We have raised our concerns with Egyptian officials."
Michael Slackman, international editor of The New York Times, said: "We are deeply disturbed that the government of Egypt detained our correspondent, kept him incommunicado, denied him food or water and refused to allow him into the country."
"Egypt has long been a center of the international press in the Middle East, a role that is now severely threatened," Mr. Slackman added. "A free and open press is more essential than ever."
Egypt has imprisoned dozens of journalists in recent years, often for nothing more than asking the wrong questions. In January, a television anchor was sentenced to a year in prison for interviewing a gay man on his show.
A photojournalist, Mahmoud Abou Zeid, known as Shawkan, is the most prominent imprisoned journalist. He was due to be released in September after five years in prison but remains in detention for reasons that are unclear. His lawyer says he may be freed this week.
In March 2018, Egyptian officials drove a reporter with The Times of London, Bel Trew, to Cairo airport and forced her to board a flight to London. Weeks later, Mr. el-Sisi won a flawed presidential poll with 97 percent of valid votes.
Ahmed Gamal Ziada, an Egyptian journalist arrested at Cairo airport on Jan. 30, faces charges of spreading false news on social media.
Mr. Kirkpatrick's writings have clearly irked the authorities. His recent book covered the Arab Spring uprising of 2011 and the violent turmoil surrounding the 2013 military takeover that brought Mr. el-Sisi to power. In an article last year, he described efforts by Egyptian intelligence officers to direct Egyptian news media coverage on sensitive subjects like relations with Israel.
The Egyptian authorities routinely denounce human rights groups, independent journalists and other critics as agents of foreign powers or purveyors of fake news. Their language often echoes that coming from Washington.
Defenders of press freedom worry that President Trump's outbursts -- such as a Twitter post last weekend that read "THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!" -- embolden autocrats around the globe to take aggressive action against the press.
Despite growing human rights abuses in Egypt, Mr. Trump counts Mr. el-Sisi among his closest allies in the Middle East and has described him as a "great guy." During a speech in Cairo in January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered further praise for Mr. el-Sisi.
Egypt, China and Turkey are the world's worst jailers of journalists, responsible for about half of the global total of at least 251 who were imprisoned for their work in 2018, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.

Nearly 9,000 fail to meet Medicaid work requirement in Arkansas. A total of 8,895 Arkansans failed in January to meet the Medicaid work requirement — meaning they either didn’t work, volunteer, or take classes for 80 hours during the month or failed to log their hours. No one will be kicked off Medicaid yet, but if they don’t meet the requirement for two more months during the course of the year then they will lose Medicaid coverage unless they get an exemption. Every January, the work requirement is “reset” to zero months of noncompliance for all people enrolled in Medicaid. This means people who were kicked off last year are allowed to re-enroll the following year and do not have past months of not complying with the requirement counted against them.

The turncoat lobbyist pushing Medicare for All. Wendell Potter knows all the arguments against a government-financed healthcare system in the U.S., because he used to make them himself when he led communications for the health insurance giant Cigna. A decade later, he is fighting against those same arguments, seeking to expose what he now views as a deeply flawed and inefficient healthcare system. Potter, president of the newly formed Business Initiative for Health Policy, is working to convince employers to support the Medicare for All Act backed by liberals in Congress, a move that he says would extend coverage to 30 million uninsured and improve coverage for those already insured. He wrote in his 2010 book Deadly Spin that he had "sold his soul" in his previous career with Cigna. Since then, he has been blowing the whistle on insurers offloading the sickest and most expensive patients in order to boost profits. “I obviously am very familiar with all the arguments against it because I was in the business of scaring people away from this,” said Potter of government-financed healthcare, speaking to the Washington Examiner during an interview in downtown Washington, D.C.


Potter opposes a general shift toward ‘Medicare for all.’ Most rank-and-file House Democrats during the last Congress were co-sponsors of the Medicare for All Act, as are most of the senators who are running for the Democratic nomination for president. House leaders, however, are on a different page. They instead favor fixes to Obamacare and letting people have the option of buying into Medicare at age 50 or 55. Potter disapproves of such incremental approaches. In his view, insurers want to fend off government-financed healthcare and instead steer Congress toward tweaks to Obamacare for their own self-interest. He argues that merely funneling more money into Obamacare wouldn't help people deal with high out-of-pocket costs. “I think it's time for an overhaul,” Potter said. “I think that a gradual shift is not in the best interest of the public or businesses, unless you are in the business of offering insurance. There's going to be fierce resistance certainly from the entrenched moneyed interest in healthcare, not just the insurance companies.”


Iowa won’t appeal ‘heartbeat’ abortion law. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds said on Monday that the state will not appeal a ruling by a federal judge determining the state’s limits on abortion to be unconstitutional. Reynolds signed the bill into law last year, which would have prohibited abortion after a heartbeat could be detected, at roughly six weeks of gestation. Reynolds said in a statement that she didn’t see a way that appealing the ruling would be effective. "This was an extremely difficult decision, however it is the right one for the pro-life movement and the state of Iowa," Reynolds said in a statement.


Seniors believe controlling drug costs is key to Medicare’s survival: Survey. An eHealth survey of more than 2,000 Medicare beneficiaries found that 73 percent of those surveyed believe that putting a cap on prescription drug costs is key to the future stability of Medicare. In contrast, roughly a quarter believed hospitals and doctors should be paid less, or that people who are not yet eligible for the program should be taxed more. The survey also shed some light on the thinking of seniors regarding healthcare coverage reform. It showed the Medicare program remains popular: Only 6 percent of those surveyed said they had some level of dissatisfaction with coverage, and 41 percent said that they thought more people should have access to something similar to Medicare. That latter figure is up from just last August, when 34 percent of respondents said they thought more people should have access.


Ruth Bader Ginsburg returns to the bench after undergoing cancer surgery. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be back on the bench for oral arguments today, marking the first time she will hear cases since undergoing lung cancer surgery in December. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg is expected to be in attendance to hear arguments in one case before the justices. The Supreme Court returned for its February sitting on Tuesday after a four-week recess. At 85, Ginsburg is the oldest justice and senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. She underwent surgery on Dec. 21 to remove two cancerous growths from her left lung, a procedure that took her away from the court and caused Ginsburg to miss her first oral argument in her 25-year career on the Supreme Court.


Mexican man in Border Patrol custody dies after 15-day hospital stay. A Mexican man who had illegally entered the country on more than one occasion died Monday morning in a Texas hospital after being apprehended by local police earlier this month. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement late Monday the unnamed 45-year-old man was taken into custody by the Roma Police Department about 50 miles northwest of McAllen, Texas, on Feb. 2. The man told police he needed medical help and was driven by Starr County Emergency Medical Services to Mission Regional Medical Center. The staff deemed him OK to be taken to the Rio Grande City Border Patrol Station, where he would be processed by Border Patrol and held for up to 72 hours before being turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as is standard practice. The man told Border Patrol agents during a welfare check on Feb. 3 that he needed to see a doctor and was taken back the McAllen Medical Center that day. While there, he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure. He stayed at the hospital for 15 days before dying there around 9 a.m. local time Monday.


Melania Trump debuts healing garden at Miami children's hospital. Melania Trump debuted a healing garden and intensive care unit for heart patients at the Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami on Monday. The first lady, who was staying at the Trump Mar-a-Lago resort in nearby West Palm Beach, Fla., over the holiday weekend, unveiled the Morton and Linda Bouchard Healing Garden, as well as the Esrick Dream Foundation Cardiac Intensive Care Floor. “It is because of the generous donations of people like Morton and Linda Bouchard, or Steve and Kiki Esrick of the Dream Foundation, that hospitals can offer more care and comfort to children who are already battling to get well,” Trump said.

Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld was right about fashion and wrong about women

Texto completo: Karl Lagerfeld, one the 20th century’s greatest fashion designers, died Tuesday in Paris. Credited with saving Chanel when he became its creative director, Lagerfeld was known, not only for his stylistic brilliance, but also his outspoken and controversial comments.

His perspective on fashion was invaluable, but his critiques of women represent the darker side of the industry.

The haute couture king told the New York Times that fashion designers are artisans, not artists. As catwalk looks have become increasingly unattainable, with models debuting styles you wouldn’t see anywhere but the runway, Lagerfeld emphasized fashion’s utility.

Designers “take themselves very seriously because they want to be taken as artists,” he said. “I think we are artisans. It’s an applied art. There’s nothing bad about that. If you want to do art, then show it in a gallery.”

Despite his lifetime contracts with high-fashion labels Chanel and Fendi, Lagerfeld embodied a down-to-earth perspective on clothes. “People buy dresses to be happy,” he said.

But the designer’s legacy is tainted by the way he conformed to industry stereotypes. Fashion may have been more than a piece of art to him, but women were not.

Lagerfeld had a habit of complaining about women’s bodies, whether he was saying they looked ugly or need to lose weight. He called Adele “a little too fat,” as an aside while discussing her lovely voice, and later insulted plus-sized women again: “No one wants to see curvy women on the catwalk.”

He also grumbled about other people's faces. In 2012, he insulted Pippa Middleton saying the Duchess of Cambridge is beautiful, but “her sister struggles. I don’t like the sister’s face. She should only show her back.”

Worst of all, Lagerfeld dismissed objections to sexual harassment in the industry. He told Numero magazine last spring that he was "fed up" with the #MeToo movement. "If you don’t want your pants pulled about," he said, "don’t become a model! Join a nunnery, there’ll always be a place for you in the convent."

Lillian Fallon, a New York City-based fashion writer, said Lagerfeld’s conflicting legacy represents a broader trend. “His comments on plus-size women and models in general kind of summarize the elitist attitude of the fashion industry and the treatment of women as objects meant for consumption,” Fallon said. “He seemed to embody a lot of the negative stereotypes of the fashion industry.”

Lagerfeld “really was not on board with the push to have a more accurate representation of women and wasn’t really interested in diverse beauty.”

While obituaries focus on his more humorous quotes — Lagerfeld once said that “sweatpants are a sign of defeat” — we should remember that he was only halfway revolutionary. The designer’s legacy was one of breaking fashion trends but conforming to its old tropes.

Beyond worrisome: Trump-Europe rift ‘now open and angry’

Texto completo: Suppose you have a group of friends that has been together a long time — a really solid group that has demonstrated over years and even decades that the members will stick together and work together to help one another and solve mutual problems. That’s a pretty big deal. You are lucky to have such a group of friends. And maybe, over time, you come to recognize the value of being a member of such a group so much that it helps you get through those times when you occasionally wonder whether you are doing more than your share of the helping.
The NATO alliance, and various other big alliances to which the United States has been a member — and in many cases, the leading member — have been like that.
Then Donald J. Trump became president. He announced, as a candidate and since, that these deals are for suckers. The United States does too much for its allies and they don’t do as much for us.
Maybe it’s true. Maybe it’s not. Maybe it’s more complicated and the overall benefits of belonging to such a group of friends are more important than a day-by-day tote-up of who is doing more or less than their share.
In any case, I was quite impressed with a talk I covered last fall by Minnesota native and former high-ranking Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, in which he argued that the big, enduring benefits of being a member of such a group significantly outweigh the possibility that you are doing more than your share. (My full piece on the Sullivan talk is here.)
The United States’ major rivals/competitors/foes, Russia and China, are big, powerful nations. Not compared to us, but compared to most others. But they are very poor in allies. The U.S.-led structure of those alliances dwarfs anything that could be called alliance structures led by our major geo-political rivals. The advantages of that should be obvious. But it seems they are not so obvious to the current occupant of the Oval Office who, by dint of that position, sits atop that dominant alliance structure, and who has spent more of his presidency complaining about his allies than about his adversaries. In fact, he seems to seldom, if ever, complain about anything Russia does.
All of which I review only to set up this troubling story in the New York Times: “Rift Between Trump and Europe Is Now Open and Angry.” If the story is right, this is beyond worrisome and it is beyond a dream-come-true for Vladimir Putin.
Read the whole thing.
Here’s the top:
European leaders have long been alarmed that President Trump’s words and Twitter messages could undo a trans-Atlantic alliance that had grown stronger over seven decades. They had clung to the hope that those ties would bear up under the strain.
But in the last few days of a prestigious annual security conference in Munich, the rift between Europe and the Trump administration became open, angry and concrete, diplomats and analysts say.
A senior German official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on such matters, shrugged his shoulders and said: ‘No one any longer believes that Trump cares about the views or interests of the allies. It’s broken.’
The most immediate danger, diplomats and intelligence officials warned, is that the trans-Atlantic fissures now risk being exploited by Russia and China.
Even the normally gloomy Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, happily noted the strains, remarking that the Euro-Atlantic relationship had become increasingly ‘tense. We see new cracks forming, and old cracks deepening,’ Mr. Lavrov said.

Should we sell Montana, though? A petition online calls for paying off the national debt by selling Montana to Canada for $1 trillion. Some Montanans have questions about the petition, including, "How dare you?"
Catholic priests got women pregnant. Now there are rules.
Catholic priests break celibacy vows so often that the church drafted secret rules for those who father a child. The Vatican has required celibacy from priests for centuries, but frequent violation of that rule prompted the church to establish a secret set of guidelines for priests who father children. The latest revelation, first reported by The New York Times, comes amid a new wave of developments tied to the burgeoning sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the church for close to two decades, including what the Pope called the "sexual slavery" of nuns.
Protecting America from space attacks. It's a thing now.
It's not a "Star Trek" spinoff or new Michael Bay flick, it’s a new branch of the military closer to liftoff after President Donald Trump signed a directive Tuesday to create the program. Space Force's mission? To patrol Earth’s orbit and protect America from attack. Critics called the idea far-fetched and wasteful not long ago, but Trump remains enthusiastic about the idea, tweeting in August: "Space Force all the way!" It's been a harder sell in Congress (and the interwebs), where cost and redundancy concerns have stymied efforts to make the new military branch, set to start within the U. S. Air Force. Funding for the program will be in the administration's proposed 2020 budget, the White House said.
He lost his gun license but kept the gun
The gunman who killed five and wounded six last week in a shooting rampage in Aurora, Illinois, had his gun license revoked but kept the gun. Illinois State Police sent the convicted felon a letter in 2014 giving him 48 hours to get rid of his Smith & Wesson. If he saw the letter, he ignored it. That’s the unfortunate norm in Illinois: Fewer than half of Illinois gun owners with revoked licenses abide the requirement to show they no longer own firearms, according to State Police data. State Police sent more than 10,800 revocation letters to residents last year, but “in most instances" gun owners failed to vouch that they no longer possess a firearm – a failure of life-and-death importance in Aurora.

Stonehenge's greatest mystery solved?
Scientists have discovered the exact location of the quarries from where dozens of Stonehenge's massive stones came: western Wales, about 180 miles away. Now we’re a step closer to Stonehenge's greatest mystery – why its stones came from so far away. The answer? They were relatively "easy" to remove, archaeologists theorize, as they were already natural vertical pillars: Using wood mallets, workers only had to bash wedges into the ready-made joints between pillars to break them apart, per a study. The two-ton stones were then dragged or carried to their location in present-day England.
Karl Lagerfeld: Chanel 'was a sleeping beauty – not even a beautiful one'
The fashion world is mourning the death of Karl Lagerfeld, an industry icon for over 40 years. The eccentric German designer blended fashion and art, favoring white hair, black sunglasses, and 19th-century-style shirt collars, and simultaneously was creative director of French (Chanel), Italian (Fendi) and eponymous international fashion labels. One of the most celebrated, if controversial, fashion icons of the 20th and 21st centuries, Lagerfeld died early Tuesday. He was around 85.

Texto completo: The widespread use of BlackBerrys by the Sinaloa Cartel came to light at the trial of El Chapo. The HSI team in Nogales collected more than 1 million BlackBerry messages sent among El Chapo's organization, according to an account of the trial by a New York Times reporter.
The trial of the notorious drug kingpin known as "El Chapo" wrapped up last week in New York City, but the federal investigation of his brother and the Sinaloa Cartel rolls on in southern Arizona.
While Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman Loera awaits sentencing after being convicted of numerous charges related to running the cartel, federal agents believe his brother Aureliano Guzman Loera, known as "El Guano," is running an extensive drug-trafficking operation in northern Mexico, Arizona and Texas, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Tucson.
Federal judges here approved dozens of applications to gather data on calls and messages to BlackBerry devices, WhatsApp accounts and cell phones tied to the "Aureliano Guzman-Loera, aka Guano drug-trafficking organization," according to records found by the Arizona Daily Star at the federal courthouse in Tucson.
The applications, which were filed by federal prosecutors on behalf of Homeland Security Investigations and unsealed months later, describe smuggling drugs from Mexico into Arizona and Texas, as well as moving drugs farther into the United States.
Homeland Security Investigations special agents said Aureliano Guzman Loera, who is not in custody, was using a BlackBerry to discuss "high level Sinaloa Cartel operational business" and a judge allowed the agents to gather data on the incoming and outgoing calls and messages tied to the BlackBerry.
Another member of the Guano trafficking organization had "high frequency" communications with a major U.S. bank, records show. Another member used a BlackBerry to "discuss meetings with Mexican military and drug trafficking activities," while another coordinated large shipments of cocaine from Colombia.
Another application said a Guano member used a BlackBerry to "provide information on rival drug cartels and cartel enforcement." Still other applications said BlackBerrys and WhatsApp accounts were used in various aspects of cultivating drugs and moving them around Mexico.
The widespread use of BlackBerrys by the Sinaloa Cartel came to light at the trial of El Chapo.
The HSI team in Nogales collected more than 1 million BlackBerry messages sent among El Chapo's organization, according to an account of the trial by a New York Times reporter.
After El Chapo's conviction, the HSI office in Nogales was credited by the Drug Enforcement Administration and others for its role in bringing the drug kingpin to justice.
A spokeswoman for HSI in Arizona declined to comment on the Nogales office's role in the investigation of El Chapo or the applications filed in Tucson's federal court.
Since El Chapo's arrest in January 2016, the question of who is in charge of the sprawling Sinaloa Cartel has lacked a definitive answer.
The main player for the Sinaloa Cartel is Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, who has helped run the cartel since its founding more than 30 years ago, the Associated Press reported last week. In August, a columnist with the Mexican newspaper El Universal wrote that "Mayo is not important: El Guano is the boss." Other news outlets have pointed to El Chapo's sons as the cartel's leaders.
While the Daily Star's search of court records focused on the Guano organization, records also showed numerous other drug-trafficking organizations on Arizona's border with Mexico, including one that runs large-scale drug-smuggling attempts using tractor-trailer rigs at ports of entry for the Sinaloa Cartel.
Another organization coordinates cocaine shipments from various points in Arizona to cities on the East Coast, as well as picking up cash proceeds from drug sales in those cities and transporting them to Sonora.
The widespread use of BlackBerrys by the Sinaloa Cartel came to light at the trial of El Chapo. The HSI team in Nogales collected more than 1 million BlackBerry messages sent among El Chapo's organization, according to an account of the trial by a New York Times reporter.

[...]the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, "Why would a president of the United States do that?" McCabe said. McCabe also revealed that when Trump told Rosenstein to put in writing his concerns with Comey - a document the White House initially held up as justification for his firing - the president explicitly asked the Justice Department official to reference Russia in the memo.

Texto completo: BY ERIC TUCKER
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in an interview that aired Sunday that a "crime may have been committed" when President Donald Trump fired the head of the FBI and tried to publicly undermine an investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia.
McCabe also said in the interview with "60 Minutes" that the FBI had good reason to open a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was in league with Russia, and therefore a possible national security threat, following the May 2017 firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.
"And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia's malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, "Why would a president of the United States do that?" McCabe said.
He added: "So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?"
Asked whether Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was onboard with the obstruction and counterintelligence investigations, McCabe replied, "Absolutely."
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment Sunday night.
McCabe also revealed that when Trump told Rosenstein to put in writing his concerns with Comey - a document the White House initially held up as justification for his firing - the president explicitly asked the Justice Department official to reference Russia in the memo. Rosenstein did not want to, McCabe said, and the memo that was made public upon Comey's dismissal did not mention Russia and focused instead on Comey's handling of
The Hillary Clinton email server investigation.
"He explained to the president that he did not need Russia in his memo," McCabe said. "And the president responded, "I understand that, I am asking you to put Russia in the memo anyway."
Trump said in a TV interview days after Comey's firing that he was thinking of "this Russia thing" when he fired Comey.
Those actions, including a separate request by Trump that the FBI end an investigation into his first national adviser, Michael Flynn, made the FBI concerned that the president was illegally trying to obstruct the Russia probe.
"Put together, these circumstances were articulable facts that indicated that a crime may have been committed," McCabe said. "The president may have been engaged in obstruction of justice in the firing of Jim Comey."
McCabe was fired from the Justice Department last year after being accused of misleading investigators during an internal probe into a news media disclosure. The allegation was referred to the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington for possible prosecution, but no charges have been brought. McCabe has denied having intentionally lied and said Sunday that he believes his firing was politically motivated.
"I believe I was fired because I opened a case against the president of the United States," he said.
In the interview Sunday, McCabe also said Rosenstein in the days after Comey's firing had proposed wearing a wire to secretly record the president. McCabe said he took the remark seriously, though the Justice Department last Septemeber - responding last September to a New York Times report that first revealed the conversation - issued a statement from an unnamed official who was in the room and interpreted the remark as sarcastic.
McCabe said the remark was made during a conversation about why Trump had fired Comey.
"And in the context of that conversation, the deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. He said, "'I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn't know it was there,'" McCabe said.
In excerpts released last week by CBS News, McCabe also described a conversation in which Rosenstein had broached the idea of invoking the Constitution's 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The Justice Department said in a statement that Rosenstein, based on his dealings with Trump, does not see cause to seek the removal of the president.

Texto completo: CHARLOTTE, N.C. >> Rick Welts, the Warriors' president/chief operating officer and the NBA's most prominent openly gay executive, attended NBA All-Star weekend after having initial reservations because of North Carolina's anti-LGBTQ law.
USA Today first reported the news.
Welts did not attend Sunday's All-Star game, but he was here for All-Star weekend on Friday and Saturday.
Welts' participation in All-Star weekend here is notable for two reasons.
As a former high-ranking NBA executive, Welts created the concept of NBA All-Star weekend in 1984. That morphed into a star-studded event that grew to include the Slam Dunk Contest and the 3-point shootout.
Second, the NBA had relocated its All-Star game in 2017 from Charlotte to New Orleans because of a bill that required transgender people to use restrooms, locker rooms or showers in government buildings and schools that matched their biological sex, and not their gender identity. Welts publicly announced in a New York Times article in 2011 that he is gay.
The view of the league office and many others, (is the bill) "discriminated against the LGBTQ community," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a press conference Saturday. "We then made a decision that it was inconsistent with the values of this league to play the All-Star Game here under those circumstances."
North Carolina has since replaced that law with HB142, which allows transgender people to use a bathroom or other facility that identifies with their gender. But local governments still cannot offer protections for any transgender people.
"For many people, it didn't go far enough, and I'm sympathetic to those who feel that there are still not appropriate protections for the LGBTQ community," he said. "But I also felt from a league standpoint it was important, and as part of our core values, to work with people and ultimately to move forward with the community."
 Honorary All-Stars Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade checked into the game with 58 seconds left in the first quarter.
Nowitzki splashed a 3-pointer from the right wing on his first offensive possession, and drained another from the left wing on the subsequent possession, giving Team Giannis a 53-37 advantage entering the second quarter. He added a third at the 9-minute mark in the second quarter and scored nine points on 3-of-3 shooting in 3:58 in the opening half.
 The 2019 slam dunk contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend involved several props, but it was Hamidou Diallo's decision to abandon one that created the dunk that everyone will remember from Saturday night's competition.
Diallo, a rookie shooting guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder, initially rolled a ball rack onto the court for his second attempt of the first round. He decided that wasn't right, so he asked "the biggest person in the building" to step into the lane instead. What ensued was a remarkable display of athleticism and creativity. After running up and going into a deep crouch, Diallo exploded into the air, leaping over Shaquille O'Neal, the 7-foot-1 Hall of Fame center, clearing the big man's head, and finishing the dunk with his hand plunged deep inside the basket.
The dunk, which received a perfect score of 50 from the judges, managed to be an homage to two of the best dunks of Vince Carter's career. Carter notoriously jumped over the head of Frederic Weis in the middle of a game at the 2000 Olympics and he hung from his elbow after finishing one of his dunks on his way to a win in the 2000 dunk contest.
Diallo went on to beat Dennis Smith Jr. of the New York Knicks in the finals to be crowned the 2019 slam dunk contest champion.
 When NBA Commissioner Adam Silver thinks about parity in professional sports, he sees the NFL as the gold standard. But he can't help but chuckle that the New England Patriots are such a constant presence in the Super Bowl.
For the last four seasons the Warriors and Cavaliers have met in the Finals. That will change this year the Cavaliers without LeBron James are one of the NBA's worst teams. But the Warriors seem poised to head back to the Finals for a fifth straight year.

Texto completo: [Video: United Skates (2019) | Official Trailer | HBO Watch on YouTube.]
A documentary on underground skating culture rolls onto HBO. And the first season of "Manifest" ends on NBC.
What's on TV
UNITED SKATES (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. This illuminating documentary was born out of a visit to Central Park. The filmmakers Tina Brown and Dyana Winkler went to shoot a piece about the death of roller-skating culture and instead were introduced to a whole new side to the sport: a thriving community of black skaters who flock to rinks across the country in the dead of night. With the help of enthusiasts from different cities, the movie traces how the sport became a mainstay of black culture and sheds light on how, post-segregation, racism lives on within the rinks. "This is a passion project in the best sense of the word," Teo Bugbee wrote in The New York Times, "a movie in which the ingenuity and dedication of the filmmakers illuminate the same qualities in their subjects."
AMERICA'S GOT TALENT: THE CHAMPIONS 8 p.m. on NBC. Twelve final acts -- including a magician, knife throwers and a sand artist -- compete to be world champion in this season finale. Guest performer include members of Cirque du Soleil and the former contestants Jackie Evancho and the Voices of Hope Children's Choir.
MANIFEST 10 p.m. on NBC. A colossal threat to the passengers' safety hangs over this season finale, while tensions run high between Jared (J. R. Ramirez) and Zeke (Matt Long). This mystery drama, about a missing plane whose passengers discover supernatural powers when they return to Earth, has been likened to "Lost" and "The 4400," but it has failed to leave a lasting impression.
What's Streaming
WHAT THEY HAD (2018) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. When Ruth (Blythe Danner) goes out in the snow and boards a train in nothing but a coat and a nightgown, her daughter, Bridget (Hilary Swank), returns to Chicago from Los Angeles to confront Ruth's dementia with her family. Her homecoming opens a weighty can of worms: Bridget's brother, Nick (Michael Shannon), wants their father (Robert Forster) to put Ruth in a facility; Bridget begins to re-evaluate her marriage; and Nick opens up about his father's flippant view of his business. The drama, Elizabeth Chomko's debut feature, sounds familiar (see "Away From Her" or "Still Alice"), but critics have argued that the cast sets the movie apart.
THE OLDENHEIM TWELVE on Acorn TV. The entire first season of this Dutch thriller is available to stream. When 12 residents of a tight-knit village go missing one after another, the murky details surrounding their disappearances leads to delirium. Villagers wonder whether a serial killer is on the loose or if a supernatural force is behind the madness, and paranoia drives some to flee. Staying behind are a journalist (Noortje Herlaar) and a detective (Nasrdin Dchar) who try to uncover the truth.

Texto completo: How do you know if a stock is a good deal? Or the stock market?
The industry bombards us with complicated analysis and unreadable, unnecessarily intimidating jargon. How can you simplify it to what matters?
The easiest way to fathom a stock's (or the market's) value is to think like you're buying the whole business. What's the price, and what will you get back in the long run?
The price part is easy. Stock prices and broad indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 are quoted widely.
For the "get back" part, many use a figure called the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E. It's a stock or index price divided by its earnings per share. Some use the past 12 months' earnings. Others use estimates for the next year (which I prefer, called forward P/Es). If a P/E is 12, you're paying $12 for every dollar of earnings. Most pundits presume stocks are expensive when P/Es are high and cheap when they're low. They think high P/E implies low return potential (and vice versa). But there is a better two-step way.
First, flip it by dividing earnings by price. Or, just look up the stock's P/E ratio at Google Finance and invert it (divide 1 by the P/E). Currently, the S&P 500's forward P/E is 16. So divide 1 by 16, and you get 0.0625 or 6.25 percent. This is the S&P 500's "earnings yield." It's what you would get each year after tax, forever, if the S&P 500 were a company, you owned it all – 100 percent – and earnings never grew.
Second, to sense value, compare them to long-term bond interest rates. Ten-year U.S. Treasurys currently pay 2.73 percent. Stocks' earnings yield is much higher, so a better long-term deal. BBB-rated corporate bonds – investment grade for the average public company, not too risky – yield 4.45 percent. That's pretax, so in an average family with a 26 percent tax rate (state and federal) that's 3.3 percent after you take out taxes.
Stocks' 6.25 percent is almost twice as high. So owning the S&P 500 earns a better return than lending to these same companies.
As mentioned earlier, the earnings yield is your forever, after-tax return from all stocks if earnings never grow. But they do grow! Businesses adapt in the long term, capturing technological change and innovation. New inventions bring new sources of corporate earnings. Think about how many products use a simple microchip. Firm's routinely dream up new ways to collide evolving technology with basic products and services. Medical progress is unending. It's all future potential profit.
When you own stocks, you own that future. When you lend by owning bonds, you don't. You get fixed interest payments. If you need long-term growth to fund your long-term retirement, stocks are the surest way to get it. Earnings yields tell you this future is a bargain today.
Of course, that says nothing about stock prices a month, six months or a year from now. Could be higher or lower. Those wiggles are the short-term and all about society's varying sentiment toward owing volatile assets. This framework is just how to measure value in the long term and a great way to think about value. For more – and to learn more about different market segments – try some classic investment books. Andrew Tobias' "The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need" is quite handy. So is "The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money & Investing."

Vatican defrocks ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick after finding him guilty of sexual crimes

Texto completo: Former U. S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has been defrocked by Pope Francis after Vatican officials found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults, the Vatican said Saturday.
McCarrick was a powerful fundraiser in the church. He is the highest-ranking clergy to be laicized by the clerical state. The action strips McCarrick, 88, of priestly rights and bars him from celebrating Mass.
Hundreds of priests have been defrocked for sexual abuse, but laicizing someone of McCarrick's rank is an “almost revolutionary,” move for the church, Kurt Martens, a Catholic University of America canon law professor, told The New York Times.
In July 2018, Pope Francis accepted McCarrick's resignation amid the sex abuse scandal. McCarrick was a retired cardinal at the time and faced allegations of sexually abusing a minor nearly five decades ago when he was a priest in New York. He was also accused of engaging in sexual misconduct with adults while he served in New Jersey.
On Jan. 11, McCarrick — who had once served as the archbishop of Washington — was found guilty of “solicitation in the Sacrament of Confession, and sins against the Sixth Commandment with minors and adults, with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power,” the Vatican said.
The Sixth Commandment addresses sexual behavior.
McCarrick had been embroiled in a scandal that included an apparent open secret that he slept with adult seminarians. He was also found guilty by the Vatican of soliciting for sex while hearing confession.
The sexual abuse of minors by priests and its systematic coverup has been a decades-long crisis for the church. McCarrick's defrocking comes days before Francis is set to lead an international gathering of bishops on the issue of sexual abuse among clergy.
An appeal by McCarrick was rejected and the Vatican said that the decision announced Saturday is final and no longer subject to future appeals.

Resumen: Butler spoke out after Queens resident Thomas Davis told the Daily News in an exclusive interview that Garcia sexually assaulted him multiple times when he was a minor working in the rectory at St. Michael's Catholic Church in Flushing between 1973 and 1975. Garcia heard how O'Rourke groomed Burns over a period of months and eventually drove him to visit the Naval Academy in Annapolis that summer in 1974, taking a strange detour on the drive home that required them to spend an unplanned night together in a Chevy Chase hotel - in a room that he said had only one bed. Garcia - who would not talk about his role in handling sex abuse allegations within the diocese during a recent phone interview - previously confirmed that O'Rourke admitted to abusing Burns.

Texto completo: She calls him her "nemesis" and the "fixer" of the Diocese of Brooklyn - and she's not surprised by a new allegation he too was a predatory priest.
Sister Sally Butler, a longtime Brooklyn nun, says Queens-based Msgr. Otto Garcia personally covered up multiple sex abuse complaints involving other priests while serving in high-ranking positions under Bishop Thomas Daily.
She brought forward three cases to the diocese, she said, so hearing this week he's now facing the first public allegation he personally molested an adolescent boy in the early 1970s was hardly a shock.
"He was the Michael Cohen of the diocese. He was the 'fixer.' He seemed to be a totally amoral person," she said of Garcia, comparing him to the disgraced lawyer who pleaded guilty last year to illegally funneling money to cover up alleged affairs involving President Trump.
Butler spoke out after Queens resident Thomas Davis told the Daily News in an exclusive interview that Garcia sexually assaulted him multiple times when he was a minor working in the rectory at St. Michael's Catholic Church in Flushing between 1973 and 1975.
Garcia denied the allegations to The News, claiming he barely knew Davis. "I had so little contact with him that I didn't know him at all," he said.
The Brooklyn Diocese released the names Friday of 108 priests credibly accused of sexual misconduct. Garcia was one of two priests listed separately who had an allegation against him that was deemed "unsubstantiated."
Former Queens resident Bob Burns said hearing the new allegation against Garcia made him "feel violated again."
"I'm just pissed off. I'm angry," he told The News. "I wish I was shocked. I always had issues with (Garcia). He was the clean-up man."
Burns, 59, said he was sent to Garcia in 1993 after reporting to the church he'd been sexually assaulted by the Rev. Thomas O'Rourke when he was 14 years old in the summer of 1974.
He said Garcia collected all his information then helped cover up the entire case, clearing the way for O'Rourke, after some alleged counseling, to return to ministry as pastor at St. Mary Star of the Sea in Brooklyn.
"They believed him, not me. Garcia basically said, 'We trust him. He's a priest,'" he recalled.
"I'm having a visceral reaction," Burns said while discussing Davis' allegation. "The person I went to for help was as bad as the person I wanted to get away from. The systemic cover-up just seems to go deeper and deeper. I still have faith, but I don't have it in the Catholic church anymore."
Both Burns and Butler, 83, said they don't know Davis personally but believe his allegation against Garcia.
"I would have no reason to think Mr. Davis is not telling the truth. Why on earth put yourself through that?" Burns said in a phone interview.
Burns - a married dad now living in Maryland - said Garcia personally told him back in 1993 that O'Rourke admitted groping him when confronted with the allegation. Still, Garcia let it slide.
"O'Rourke claimed it was more of a fondling incident and that I was the only one - that it had never happened any other time," Burns recalled. "Garcia said they told O'Rourke not to make any contact with me and that they were going to send him to St. Luke's in Maryland for treatment."
Burns said he was adamant that O'Rourke was lying.
"(O'Rourke) said it was just fondling, but it was aggressive, almost to the point of a violent sexual assault. This wasn't a situation where he put his hand in the wrong place. It was premeditated," he said.
Burns said he told Garcia the explicit details of his case. Garcia heard how O'Rourke groomed Burns over a period of months and eventually drove him to visit the Naval Academy in Annapolis that summer in 1974, taking a strange detour on the drive home that required them to spend an unplanned night together in a Chevy Chase hotel - in a room that he said had only one bed.
"My spidey-senses started to go off, but I wasn't smart enough to know what was going on," he recalled.
Burns said when he emerged from the bathroom at one point, O'Rourke had stripped to his boxers. The priest then began offering him surprise gifts he bought at the Naval Academy, he said.
"Then the assault occurred," Burns said. "By a medical definition, there was no penetration, but it was an aggressive, overpowering, violent assault. He finishes up, pats me on the back and goes to sleep."
Burns said he crawled out of the bed and spent the rest of the night locked in the bathroom.
"I was physically ill. I could barely talk," he said. It took him many years before he could tell anyone what happened, much less take his story to the church.
O'Rourke, who died in 1998, was later accused in a lawsuit of repeatedly sexually abusing an altar boy at Corpus Christi Church in Woodside, where he worked in the 1960s.
Garcia - who would not talk about his role in handling sex abuse allegations within the diocese during a recent phone interview - previously confirmed that O'Rourke admitted to abusing Burns.
"It was very troubling for him. He recognized the effect it had on someone who trusted him," Garcia told Catholic Standard in 2002.
Burns joined a 2003 lawsuit filed by dozens of victims, but the statute of limitations for his claim had run out. He eventually accepted a settlement. He can't sue again, but he is free to talk about his experience.
Butler, meanwhile, told The News she was one of three nuns who reached out to diocese brass in 1996 and reported that three priests sexually molested adolescent boys in a Brooklyn parish in the mid 1970's.
One of the boys was Carlos Cruz, an orphan partially raised by Butler who confided in her that the Rev. Anthony Failla molested him 20 years prior at St. Michael-St. Edward's in Fort Greene.
Butler said Garcia was in charge of the internal investigation involving the three priests. She said Garcia never notified police and allowed Failla to quietly move to Florida. Failla died last year.
Garcia defended the diocese's handling of Failla and other abusive priests in a 2002 New York Times interview.
"When we discovered that there were some allegations with credibility, to the best of our ability, we investigated them and we took action," Garcia said in the Times.
Butler said another of the three priests involved in the complaints was the Rev. Brian Callahan, who died in 2003.
She described going with the two other nuns to meet with Garcia and his lawyers at the Chancery to discuss the complaints - but she said they only received lip service.
"He dismissed us as unimportant. He told us it would be taken care of. He said that to everybody," she said.
She said Cruz, who eventually moved to Schenectady and lived with his wife and children there before his death in 2015, "hated" Garcia for his handling of the situation.
The nun, who still lives in Fort Greene, said she hopes Davis gets a more thorough hearing of his grievances and a shot at some form of justice.
"I hope he can see it through. I want him to do it for Carlos, too," she said.
"Carlos died of a massive heart attack after years of flashbacks and panic attacks and God knows what else," she said.
"I know he would have had a different life (without the abuse)," she said. "He was a very bright kid. I'm grateful for having known him."

The Truths of an Interview

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
A New York Times reporter was recently confronted with a nightmare scenario: How does one interview a master interviewer?
David Marchese has been interviewing celebrities for a living for a while, and over time he has became something of a celebrity himself, at least in journalism circles. Mr. Marchese has a reputation not only for drawing out startling quotes from his subjects -- Quincy Jones, Sarah Silverman and Alex Trebek among them -- but for creating holistic, often intimate portraits of the inner lives of boldface names.
Mr. Marchese recently joined The New York Times Magazine, where his work will appear in the newly refurbished Talk column. His debut interview, with the actress Meg Ryan, appears in this week's magazine. The Times reporter eventually mastered his fears and spoke with Mr. Marchese about his work and how he does it.
I'll start with the big question: Why interviews, as opposed to other story forms?
I had struggled in the past to find ways to creatively frame people in the traditional profile format. Meaning: You start with a scene, explain why the person is relevant in the culture and then offer supporting quotes from people that know them. I just feel like there are a lot of other writers who are much more capable than I am of figuring out how to do that in fresh ways.
Then there are people who are geniuses at trying to pin down a subject on a specific line of thinking or get their specific position on an issue. It's a kind of interviewing that I admire very much and don't think I'm particularly good at. I enjoy using the interview to give you a sense of who the subject is and what they think about.
What was the first interview you did where you felt you succeeded in that?
One stands out for me, for a different reason: When I worked at Spin magazine, I did an interview with Lou Reed, who was sort of famous for being very difficult and aggressive with journalists. My experience with him bore out that his reputation was deserved. It was a difficult, combative interview, one that made me feel like I had failed in some fashion, because he seemed so negative in his responses to my questions -- to my whole being.
But when I went back to the transcription and was putting the interview together, I realized that just because he didn't like me or my questions, it didn't mean that something had gone wrong. I had to internalize that lesson: The truth of the interaction is the thing that you're trying to get across.
Establishing rapport is a big part of what you do. How do you that?
It's just like anytime you meet someone for the first time. Sometimes you just realize very quickly that this person seems to be comfortable.
I interviewed Sarah Silverman, who is a very warm, friendly person to begin with. At one point during the conversation, she made a pretty foul-mouthed joke, as she is wont to do. I segued in a foul-mouthed way, and she doubled over laughing and slapped a couch. I thought, O.K., she's engaged in the conversation.
How do you choose your subjects?
I have a long and detailed spreadsheet of potential subjects that has somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 names at this point. They're all people who I have an inkling might be interesting to talk to, regardless of whether they have a particular project in the works or something they want to promote.
That inkling comes from a few things: whether they've had an interesting career or life journey; if they have a reputation for being a good interviewee, or have shown a willingness to speak in a personally insightful way; and my own personal interest in them and their work. Certain people just have a quality that piques my curiosity, and I can't really explain why!
In the case of Meg Ryan, I was interested in learning more about her choice to pull back from Hollywood. She was one of the most successful actresses in the world for a long time and then really went low profile. Exploring the whys of that felt like potentially fertile conversational ground.
Did anything happen while you were in the room with Ms. Ryan that captures what it was like to speak with her?
We conducted the main portion of the interview at a Chinese restaurant near where she lives in Manhattan. After the interview was over and she left, I saw that she'd left her phone on her seat. About five minutes later she came back into the restaurant, a bit flustered, to look for her phone. It was exactly the type of flibbertigibbet thing one of her rom-com characters would have done.
What is the longest someone has been on your spreadsheet?
Thomas Pynchon has been near the top of my dream list for a long, long time.

Texto completo: As President Trump declared a national emergency on Friday to bypass Congress and build his long-promised wall, he again painted a portrait of a lawless, chaotic border and cited arguments about the effectiveness of the kind of barrier he has in mind that were not rooted in facts.
Illegal border crossings have been declining for decades. While families are overwhelming an immigration system devised to handle single men, a border wall would not prevent them from seeking asylum, which is legal. Research does not show that immigrants commit more crimes than native-born Americans. And a wall would do little to prevent drugs and human trafficking at the border, as official ports of entry are the main route into the United States for both.
Cumulatively, Mr. Trump's unsupported or misleading statements undercut his rationale for declaring an emergency, a step that is widely viewed as testing both constitutional and political norms and is sure to draw legal challenges.
What Was Said
"In El Paso they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall. And they had 23 murders. It's a lot of murders. But it's not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall in Mexico."
This is misleading.
Mr. Trump is correct that there were 23 murders in El Paso last year, compared with more than 1,200 murders in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. But the disparity predates the existence of border barriers separating the two towns.
In 2007, the year before border fencing construction began, El Paso reported 17 murders while Juárez recorded about 320 homicides, before the drug war between cartels escalated.
In 2010, after the barriers were largely completed, El Paso recorded five murders before the number increased to 16 a year later. That same year, murders in Juárez topped 3,600 before declining to over 2,000 in 2011.
What Was Said
"When you look and when you listen to politicians -- in particular, certain Democrats -- they say it all comes through the port of entry. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's just a lie. It's all a lie."
False.
Mr. Trump was referring to the flow of drugs across the border and disputing arguments that most smuggling takes place not in remote areas where a wall might be built but through authorized border crossing points, or ports of entry. The relevant statistics come from Mr. Trump's own agencies, not Democrats. Data from Customs and Border Protection shows that 80 percent to 90 percent of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl is seized at ports of entry (marijuana is the exception). The Drug Enforcement Administration noted that a "small percentage of all heroin" is seized at areas between ports of entry.
What Was Said
"You can't take human traffic -- women and girls -- you can't take them through ports of entry."
False.
You can. For example, the Justice Department recently detailed how an international sex trafficking ring committed visa fraud to transport women from Thailand into the United States and coerce them into the sex trade.
About 80 percent of human trafficking victims passed through official ports of entry, according to a decade's worth of data collected by the Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative. The Polaris Project, a group that works to prevent human trafficking in the United States, said in a statement that out of nearly 50,000 cases it has handled, "the vast majority of victims" arrive through ports of entry.
What Was Said
"Take a look at Israel. They're building another wall. Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me -- 99.9 percent."
True.
Israel built a wall along its border with Egypt in 2013, and it has proved to be effective. Israeli officials have said that illegal crossings decreased to 12 in 2014 from more than 16,000 in 2011 -- a 99 percent reduction.
Whether that example could be applied to the United States is another matter, as PolitiFact has reported. The border between Israel and Egypt is much shorter than the United States-Mexico border, along flat land as opposed to mountainous terrain. Israel also invested in technology and manpower to guard its border.
What Was Said
"And the people that say we create precedent, well, what do you have 56 or a lot of times that is creating precedent."
This is misleading.
Mr. Trump is right that previous presidents have issued 58 national emergency declarations since 1978, 30 of which are still in effect. But those declarations have largely dealt with crises and conflicts abroad.
Examples include blocking transactions with the Taliban, prohibiting the importation of diamonds from Sierra Leone, placing restrictions on North Korea and allowing faster treatment during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.
Mr. Trump's declaration, however, is extraordinary in that it addresses a domestic policy issue and involves redirecting money without the approval of Congress.
What Was Said
"I went through Congress. I made a deal. I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn't supposed to get $1, not $1, he's not going to get $1. Well, I got $1.4 billion, but I'm not happy with it."
This is misleading.
The funding deal passed by Congress on Thursday authorized $1.375 billion for border fencing, which is less than the $1.6 billion that senators proposed last June and that Mr. Trump rejected. Asked about his reaction to the reduced funding, Mr. Trump misleadingly cited comments made by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
At a news conference in January, while the government was still partially shut down, Ms. Pelosi jokingly said that she would agree to give Mr. Trump $1 for his border wall. But Ms. Pelosi and Democrats have consistently drawn a distinction between the wall and border security, referring to employing technology enhancements and additional personnel as well as barriers. At that same January news conference, Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats promoted a bill that included $1.3 billion for border fencing and would have temporarily reopened the government.
Other claims:
Mr. Trump also repeated four other claims about immigration and his border wall that The New York Times has previously fact-checked:
■ He misleadingly claimed that he had already "done a lot of wall." (The first extension of barriers built before Mr. Trump took office, 14 miles, is scheduled to begin this month -- a tiny portion of the 1,000-mile wall he promised.)
■ He falsely claimed that the money for the wall was coming from the revised North American Free Trade Agreement. (Any additional federal revenue from the trade deal, which is not guaranteed, would still be coming from American consumers, not Mexico.)
■ He claimed, with no evidence, that the man charged in a Manhattan truck attack sponsored "22 or 23 or 35 of his family members" to immigrate to the United States. (This is not possible, as the man was a green-card holder who would not have been able to sponsor extended family.)
■ He claimed, with no evidence, that other countries are "putting some very bad people" in the diversity visa lottery. (Individuals enter the lottery on their own, and must pass a screening process that bars criminals and the indigent.)

To reduce money in politics, slash the size of government

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Like a terrifying demon that returns during the final scene of a horror movie, campaign-finance reform is the “thing” that never goes away. The United States Supreme Court sometimes saves the day, as it did with the First Amendment-related Citizens United case in 2010. Yet reformers always have a new scheme to take “the money out of politics,” even though their last schemes always resulted in more cash influencing political campaigns.
The campaign-finance scaremongers are back with a symbolic bill that is a political poke-in-the-eye to the sleazy-seeming Trump administration. It could never pass the Senate or gain a presidential signature, but it makes a point. Now that they have a majority in the House, Democrats are pushing HR1, which Vox describes as a “sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at stamping out the influence of money in politics and expanding voting rights.”
The voting-rights goal is doable because Congress has the power to loosen federal standards for voting. But only a delusional person would believe that lawmakers have the power to “stamp out” money in politics any more than they have the power to “stamp out” sexually transmitted diseases. Desire often outstrips good sense, which is why STDs and political spending are at record highs. People will work around any new hurdles placed in their way.
The problem — at least with political spending — is government, not rich people. Both political sides rail about the role of billionaires in our political system. The left fulminates about the Koch Brothers and right-wing “dark money” groups, whereas the right pounds the table about George Soros and left-leaning tech firms. However, a close look at lobbying spending in California offers some much-needed lessons on this hot-button topic.
The Sacramento Bee recently published an analysis of spending on government lobbying and found that it rose again last year. The total was $361 million, up 5 percent since 2017. It is far above the approximately $200 million spent on lobbying in 2002. One can easily conclude from these numbers — and from watching lobbyists swarm the Capitol — that something untoward is going on.
Nevertheless, those numbers need a little more perspective. The total 2017-2018 California state budget was $183.3 billion. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal would spend $209.1 billion. In 2002-2003, the total state budget was $97.9 billion. Lobbying spending has gone up, but only in tandem with growth in state government spending. Lobbying dollars are small potatoes when you consider the total, well, potato pie.
Sure, stories are legion about legislators who won’t consider any proposal until they run it by the requisite lobbyist. Union leaders strut around the Capitol as if they own the place, because they pretty much do own the place. Lobbyists and trade groups of all type — unions, industry and activist groups — routinely write the language that becomes state law. Welcome to the real world. No finance reform can ever take the politics out of the political system.
Again, the problem is the size of government. Writing in National Review, Bradley Smith notes that Democratic lawmakers have proposed a Green New Deal “that would essentially abolish the aviation, auto, energy and mining industries, among others. Why is it illegitimate for shareholders and employees in those industries to voice their opinions on regulatory schemes that would leave them bankrupt and unemployed?” Good question.
Take a closer look at that California lobbying report. The top spender was Pacific Gas & Electric, which is a regulated monopoly utility whose continued existence could be dependent on how the Legislature decides to handle wildfire-related liabilities. The Western States Petroleum Association, a trade group that represents the highly regulated oil and gas businesses, is next on the list. Then there’s another regulated utility, Edison International, and the California State Council of Service Employees, which is a powerful labor union.
Reality check: Those groups whose existence is most dependent on the government are going to spend oodles on lobbying that government. Look at the lobbying categories, per the Bee. The biggest spender is government — mainly local governments influencing state government. Next is healthcare, which is a government-dependent industry. Then come utilities, which are government-granted monopolies. Also high on the list are insurance companies, where government has power to set rates, as well as manufacturers, education and labor unions.
Finance reformers are frustrated by the courts, but there’s that thing called the First Amendment. Spending is not speech per se. However, columnist George Will asked if The New York Times would be OK if it were free to write what it wanted, but if the government controlled “the amount it can spend on journalists, paper, ink, printing presses, delivery trucks, advertisements and so on.” You get the point.
Maybe we can all embrace a reform idea that would actually work: reducing the size and power of government. Sadly, that is the one idea that will frighten the kind of politicians and activists who support campaign-finance reform.

Texto completo: With a successful Jazz in the Schools weekend in our rearview mirror, I thought now would be a good time to let you know what the rest of 2019 will bring. Let me start with our two summer programs.
The Reno Jazz Orchestra will heat up the summer with "The Queen of Soul — A Loving Tribute to Aretha Franklin." Aretha was a vocal master you know so well by her hits, but did you know her recording career started as a jazz singer and that she stepped in for Luciano Pavarotti at the Grammys? Indeed she did, and it was at the last moment. When Sting let the audience know that Pavarotti's doctors would not let him sing due to a sore throat, Aretha was backstage and asked if she could listen to Pavarrotti's rehearsal tape. After hearing it she said, "I can do this." She had learned "Nessun Dorma," the aria Pavarotti was set to perform, for a private party for Pavarotti a year prior. With 30 minutes notice and no rehearsal, Franklin went on stage and mesmerized the audience with her stunning rendition.
Join us either July 15 at the Hawkins Amphitheater or July 21 at the Trepp Amphitheater in Sand Harbor. The RJO will be recruiting four Aretha "divas" to alternately take the lead and sing backup.
Franklin's backup singers were known as the Sweet Inspirations and were successful recording artists in their own right. Backing Franklin on some of her most famous recordings, they also backed up Van Morrison, Elvis and Wilson Pickett, and can even be heard on Jimi Hendrix's 1968 album Electric Ladyland. Members over the years included Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney Houston; Dee Dee and Dionne Warwick; and Estelle Brown. I guarantee a full dose of Franklin's memorable hits, gospel, some of her jazz material — and hey, maybe a little opera. Why not?
To close the summer season we are thrilled to announce Kurt Elling will be our guest artist for the Labor Day weekend. The New York Times declared Elling "the standout male vocalist of our time." His accolades include a 14-year run atop the DownBeat Critics Poll, a dozen Grammy nominations, a Grammy award for "Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman," and eight Jazz Journalists Association awards for Male Singer of the Year.
All the awards may get your attention, but it is his instantly recognizable voice, embracing listeners with his warm, rich baritone and navigating the full span of his four-octave range as a virtuoso instrumentalist and a compelling storyteller that will captivate you. I have been a fan for many years, and this past fall my wife Candy and I were fortunate to see him perform at the legendary jazz club Ronnie Scott's in London. Though a jazzman for sure, he opened his set with Bob Dylan's "A Hard Rain is Going to Fall" and magically turned it into his song.
His music and wit appeal to the full range of music lovers, from the novice jazz fan to the most jaded jazz hipster. A native Chicagoan, he began singing at night while studying at the University of Chicago Divinity School by day, eventually holding court at the city's revered Green Mill Lounge. His debut album, "Close Your Eyes," secured his first Grammy nomination.
He is currently touring with his quintet promoting his latest CD, "The Questions," but as varied an artist as he is, he's also a featured artist in "Jazz Beyond Borders: From the Golden Gate to The Great Wall in San Francisco" and "Kurt Elling Presents 'The Big Blind' — A Jazz Radio Drama at Jazz At Lincoln Center in New York City." Elling does not regularly perform with big bands, so it is a real treat for the RJO to present him in that setting.
Of course, there is a lot more to come this year beyond Aretha and Kurt Elling. Our education program continues with the mentor program, where RJO musicians mentor WCSD jazz bands; and our Saturday student jazz workshop, which begins March 23 and concludes with a capstone performance May 31 as the opening act for the RJO. The workshops are all about learning to improvise jazz by learning tunes and improvising a solo over them all by ear.
We will perform a noontime concert in UNR's Nightingale Hall on April 27 as a part of the Reno Jazz Festival. For 20 years we have performed a free one-hour concert for the participating students where we announce our UNR jazz studies scholarship winner. This one is free and open to the public.
We have scheduled four concerts at our home in Midtown that we share with the Good Luck Macbeth theater group. Put May 31, June 1, Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 on your calendar now; seating is limited and the setting for a big band is intimate. A guest conductor will pick the program and rehearse the band, so stay tuned to hear who will conduct.
In mid-August the RJO has closed Carson City's Jazz and Beyond festival each of its 10 years and would be honored to do the same this year. We end the year with our annual Jazz for the Holidays Dec. 13 and 14 at the Cargo Concert Hall in the Whitney Peak Hotel. We haven't decided on that program yet, so feel free to share some ideas. Just so you don't have to write down all the dates, here is a schedule of events you can cut out and put on the fridge:

Texto completo: Second of two parts:
Lilly Smartelli went as far as to call a Scottsdale hotel about having a wedding for her and her dog there. Not a real wedding but a fundraiser for rescue dogs. It was too expensive. Lilly struggles to pay her medical bills.
She decided to write a book, about her life and imagining weddings with Bernie as the groom. "Let's just focus on something fun," she thought.
Lilly self-published "The $5 Dog Wedding" a year later, releasing it on Oct. 3. On the same date in 2007, Lilly had donated a kidney to a childhood friend. "That's my only legacy," she said.
That's why a percentage of her book sales go to Donate Life America, a nonprofit organ donation advocacy group.
Lilly hired publicist Laurie Monteforte to write a press release about the book. Montefort sent it to The New York Times, which wrote it up for its Jan. 31 Vows column.
Since then, people have offered to help pay for a wedding, but Lilly asks instead that they buy her book or donate to Donate Life America or local dog rescues.
Lilly doesn't have much time left. She runs out of breath as she talks. She hopes she can do some good in that time by raising awareness of organ donation and rescue dogs. That would be better than any big Italian wedding.
Bernie was not the handsome dog he is now when she saw him in that cage.
"The beauty is on the inside for a lot of people and for a lot of dogs," she said. "You just have to imagine what they could be like."
On Valentine's Day, she planned to buy herself flowers and mark the card from Bernie and Spinner. "I don't feel alone because I have them," she said.
She doesn't think anyone should feel alone because they aren't in a relationship. Adopt a dog or if you can't adopt, volunteer at an animal shelter.
"You will find love there," Lilly said.
You can find her book at thefivedollardogwedding.com.

Newark back in Amazon game?

Texto completo: "Amazon now has the opportunity to join in Newark's story of a city on the rise."
Gov. Phil Murphy
Amazon on Thursday said it was canceling its plans to build a corporate campus in New York City.
Although Amazon said it would not reopen its search for a second home, the company did say it plans to expand its tech hubs and corporate locations across the United States — meaning that some cities could still benefit from the tech giant's backing out of New York City. Those plans, however, may exclude Newark, which does not have an Amazon tech hub, even though Audible, an Amazon company, has its headquarters there.
"After much thought and deliberation, we've decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for Amazon in Long Island City, Queens," the company said in a statement. "For Amazon, the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive, collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term."
The company said it would not reopen the HQ2 search at this time but will proceed with its plans in Northern Virginia and Nashville. The company announced in November that it would split its proposed HQ2 between New York City and Northern Virginia. The company had previously announced it would open a new Operations Center of Excellence in downtown Nashville.
Amazon said it would also continue to hire and grow across its 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the United States and Canada.
The company's tech hubs in North America outside Seattle employ more than 17,500 corporate employees, as opposed to warehouse and fulfillment staff. As of August, that number was anticipated to rise to 26,200 by 2023. With the change of plans for its HQ2, the growth of these tech hubs could mean more jobs in cities where Amazon already is.
In Newark, the company has a significant presence with its Audible headquarters. However, it is not one of the 17 cities with an Amazon tech hub.
Regardless of Amazon's decision not to reopen its HQ2 search, state and city officials said they are staying in contact with the tech giant, to be prepared should company officials change their minds. Gov. Phil Murphy said Thursday that he contacted Amazon and Newark officials directly after he learned that the company had pulled out of New York City.
"After learning of the decision to pull out of their chosen HQ2 location, I contacted Amazon and city of Newark stakeholders directly, continuing a constant dialogue that predates my time as governor," Murphy said in a statement. "New Jersey is open for business, and now more than ever, Newark is the clear choice as the next presence for Amazon corporate offices. Amazon now has the opportunity to join in Newark's story of a city on the rise."
Mayor Ras Baraka on Thursday also said he welcomed the opportunity to resume conversations with Amazon should it want to relocate a portion of its proposed HQ2 campus to Newark.
"Given the city and state's assets — a strong talent pipeline, a diverse tech base, unmatched infrastructure and a highly accessible location — we are well poised to accommodate Amazon should they want to relocate New York City's portion of HQ2, in whole or part," Baraka said. "Legislation regarding the tax incentives has already been passed, our real estate options are still viable, and the community has been — and will continue to be — engaged."
After a flurry of contradicting reports published late last week, officials from near and far have come forward to remind the tech giant that if New York City doesn't want Amazon, there are plenty of places that do. It seems their outreach did not fall on deaf ears.
In New Jersey, where Newark was named a finalist in the year-long bidding process for Amazon's second headquarters, elected officials and city leaders reportedly have kept in touch with the company in hopes of keeping the campus near, if not in, New Jersey.
Earlier this week, Murphy made the most public case for New Jersey at a press conference for an unrelated event in Avenel in Middlesex County, where Amazon has fulfillment centers.
"Nothing's changed on the Newark story. I think it's one of the most inspiring, compelling urban stories in America, and it continues to be, and with each day the story gets stronger and better," Murphy said Monday. "So we remind everybody — Amazon, right through the entire alphabet — Newark and New Jersey are open for business. Period. Full stop."
State officials continue to work closely with Amazon because of the thousands of people the company already employs in New Jersey, Murphy added.
City leaders in Newark, too, have reportedly kept in close contact with Amazon. Aisha Glover, president and chief executive of the Newark Alliance, which led negotiations with Amazon during the city's bidding process, told Fortune that she renewed talks with the tech giant six weeks ago.
"Our goal is to make sure we keep it in the region," Glover told the magazine. "We have reached out to express that our incentives on the state and city side have been passed, so there's more opportunity for them to be welcomed with ease."
Last year, former Gov. Chris Christie endorsed Newark's initial application and pledged as much as $7 billion in tax incentives, including $5 billion in state tax relief over a decade and $1 billion each in breaks on property taxes and income taxes from Newark. It would have been the largest tax incentive ever offered by New Jersey.
Glover did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
In November, Amazon announced that it would split its proposed HQ2, or its second headquarters in the United States, between New York City and Northern Virginia. The campus was expected to bring as many as 25,000 jobs to each campus.
Although Newark ultimately did not win the bid, it was chosen as one of 20 finalist cities out of hundreds. That was considered a win for New Jersey's most populous city.
Since Amazon announced that it would be heading to Long Island City in Queens, there has been push-back from politicians, residents and businesses.
On Friday, those tensions rose to an all-time high after The Washington Post published an article citing two people familiar with the company's thinking who said the company was having second thoughts about New York City.
Until Thursday, Amazon had not commented about those claims beyond a statement it gave to The Washington Post last week. In an email on Tuesday, a company spokesperson forwarded what appeared to be the same statement given to the Post, and declined to give further comment.
"We're focused on engaging with our new neighbors — small-business owners, educators, and community leaders," the spokesperson wrote. "Whether it's building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be."
Since the Post's story on Friday, conflicting reports have surfaced that implied Amazon would still move forward with its plans in New York City.
The same day of the bombshell report, The New York Times, also citing two people familiar with the company's thinking, reported that Amazon had no plans to back out. Sources told the Times that the story by the Post had gone too far.
The news that Amazon would be backing out of New York City came as a shock. As recently as Tuesday, officials were convinced that Amazon was still set on its HQ2 proposal in Queens.
On Tuesday, Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, told Bloomberg that Amazon's plans in New York City were still a go.
"Everybody that is involved on the ground here is all steam ahead," Lusskin told Bloomberg. "I have no direct indication that there's any change in that decision."
Although it remains unclear what exactly the tech giant will do in coming weeks, now that plans for New York City have fallen through, there are plenty of states ready to be Amazon's rebound.
Over the past several days, New Jersey and leaders in at least four other states have reportedly expressed their renewed interest in Amazon's HQ2, including Texas, Illinois, Connecticut and Florida. Even leaders in upstate New York have pitched themselves as an alternative to their own New York City.
"Amazon now has the opportunity to join in Newark's story of a city on the rise."

F.B.I. Inquiry of Pop Star Over Texts to Young Fan

Texto completo: The F.B.I. is looking into whether the singer-songwriter Ryan Adams, 44, committed a crime by engaging in sexually explicit communications with an underage fan, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the matter.
As reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, Adams and a young woman, who said her online communications with the singer began when she was 14 and continued until she was 16, exchanged text messages and conducted video calls that sometimes included nudity. The two never met in person.
Adams, through his lawyer, Andrew B. Brettler, has denied that he "ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage." On Thursday, Brettler said that he had not been contacted by law enforcement. He declined to comment further.
In response to The Times's article, F.B.I. agents in the bureau's New York office on Thursday took the first steps to open a criminal investigation, according to the official, who declined to be identified because the person was not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The agents, from the Crimes Against Children Squad, will seek to interview the woman, the official said, and try to obtain the text messages and any other evidence she may have in her possession. If they find her account credible, they will take other investigative steps, which could include subpoenaing both her cellphone records and those of Adams from their service providers, the official said.
Federal law bars the sexual exploitation of children under 18, defining a violator as anyone who "persuades, induces, entices or coerces any minor to engage in" a visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct. Several legal experts said that decisions on whether to prosecute such cases could hinge on whether the adult reasonably believed the minor was of legal age, taking into account context from their conversations.
While the inquiry was in its earliest stages, the official said that generally in such cases, agents seek to interview a victim's friends and family members to determine whether they made contemporaneous statements about the contact.
[Read our report: Ryan Adams dangled success. Women say they paid a price.]
A lawyer for the woman, now 20, declined to comment as her family deliberated how to proceed. The Times identified the woman by her middle name, Ava, because she was a minor during these interactions. An F.B.I. spokeswoman, Amy J. Thoreson, declined to comment Thursday when asked about the matter.
The Times reviewed extensive communication between Adams and Ava, including direct messages on Twitter that began when she was 14, and more than 3,000 text messages spanning a nine-month period when Ava was 15 and 16. The text messages from late 2014, when Ava was 16, included explicit photographs of her. She said the pair also conducted video calls on Skype, where Adams exposed himself during phone sex. The Times has reviewed screenshots of these interactions.
Throughout their communication, Adams asked Ava, a successful bass player since she was 12, repeatedly about her age. "Do me a paranoid favor," he wrote in November 2014, when he was 40 and she was 16. "Show me you are 18." He invoked others accused of targeting girls, including R. Kelly.
Sometimes, in response to Adams's prodding, Ava said she was older than she was. More than once Adams asked to see her identification, although she never provided any in the messages reviewed by The Times, and their sexual conversations continued.
Brettler said that Adams did not recall these conversations and added that while the singer has corresponded with fans and aspiring musicians online, Adams "does not recall having online communications with anyone related to anything outside of music." Brettler also provided photos of Ava, in which he said her appearance suggested "that she was in her 20s."
After the publication of the article, Adams posted on Twitter on Wednesday to apologize to "anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally," though he continued to dispute the accuracy of The Times's reporting. "I would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage," he wrote. "Period."
Ava and other women interviewed by The Times said that Adams often dangled potential career opportunities as he pursued female artists in sexual scenarios. "Music was a point of control for him," said Adams's ex-wife, the singer and actress Mandy Moore.
Adams, a Grammy-nominated rock singer famous for his contributions to the genre known as alternative country, has released 16 studio albums and announced plans to release three more this year via Blue Note and his own Pax-Am Records. Capitol Music Group, which oversees those labels, declined to comment.
The allegations that Adams manipulated and harassed women in the music industry sent ripples through the business. "We're all fed up," the singer Vanessa Carlton wrote on Twitter. Bethany Cosentino, the singer of Best Coast, said that the same story "could literally be written about so many dudes in music." And Tamara Lindeman of the Canadian band the Weather Station added: "Having to perpetually question if a potential collaborator is interested in you musically or personally is an enormous and unspoken barrier for women in music."
Jason Isbell, a country singer who is scheduled to appear on one of Adams's upcoming albums, wrote on Twitter that he had been unaware of Adams's alleged behavior. Asked if he believed the women's accounts, Isbell responded: "Yep."

Texto completo: In its first major funding announcement for FY 2019, the National Endowment for the Arts has approved more than $1 million in Art Works grants, Challenge America grants and Literature fellowships to 42 Minnesota arts organizations and individuals.
The average grant amount is $25,000. The biggest grants will go to Children’s Theatre Company ($75,000), to support the development and production of new work; Graywolf Press ($70,000), Milkweed Editions ($60,000) and Coffee House Press ($55,000) to support the publication and promotion of new books; Artspace ($50,000), to support a training program for arts and culture organization leaders to advance their facility and space-related goals; and Minnesota Opera, to support the world premiere and additional performances of “The Fix,” a new opera about baseball, which opens in March. The Minnesota Orchestra will receive $40,000, and so will Northrop (for its dance season), Penumbra Theatre and the SPCO.
Poets Amy Munson of Columbia Heights, Michael Torres of Mankato and Roy G. Guzmán of Minneapolis will each receive a $25,000 Literature Fellowship.
These FY 2019 grants will reach all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Minnesota was one of seven states (plus DC) to be awarded more than $1 million in NEA grants; New York took the lead with nearly $7 million. Here’s a list of all the grantees, sorted by state.
David Mura wins 2019 Kay Sexton Award
Author, critic, teacher, mentor and performance artist David Mura has won the 2019 Kay Sexton Award, the Friends of the Saint Paul Public Library announced today. The award is given annually to an individual or organization in recognition of longstanding dedication and outstanding work in fostering books, reading, and literary activity in Minnesota. Sexton, who died in 2014, was a nationally influential bookseller and mentor to many booksellers and writers.
Mura has taught at Hamline, Macalester, and the Loft, among other places. At the Loft, he inaugurated a class for writers of color. He co-founded the arts organization Asian American Renaissance and served as its artistic director. His latest book, “A Stranger’s Journey: Race, Identity and Narrative Craft in Writing” is a finalist for a 2019 Minnesota Book Award. Mura is also the author of two memoirs, a novel, and four books of poetry. His Kay Sexton Award honors his efforts to increase literary accessibility and audiences and foster writers of color.
In a statement, author Alexs Pate said, “For the past 30 years plus, David has been on a journey, a largely successful one I might add, to create a more humane life in this state for writers of color.”
Mura will be honored at the 2019 Minnesota Book Awards ceremony on Saturday, April 6.
Jorie Graham to read in UMN English Writers Series
American poet Jorie Graham will be trailing a long list of prizes and awards when she gives this year’s Esther Freier Lecture in Literature – an evening of her poetry. So far, she’s won a Pulitzer (for “The Dream of the United Field: Selected Poems”), a MacArthur Fellowship, the Wallace Stevens Award and, most recently, the Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry from the Library of Congress. Graham won the Bobbit for her 2017 collection “Fast,” which she wrote while her parents were dying and Graham was in treatment for cancer. The New York Times called it an “autopsy of self and nation in the face of overwhelming loss.” Graham is a professor at Harvard. She’ll read at Coffman Memorial Union Theater on Thursday, April 4.
Graham’s reading is part of the Spring 2019 UMN English Writers Series, which also includes a First Books Reading; the launch of the 2019 Tower magazine, with creatuve work by U of M undergrads; and the 11th Annual Hunger Relief Benefit. All events in the series are free and open to the public.
The picks
Tonight (Thursday, Feb. 14) through Sunday at the Minnesota Museum of American Art: “100 Years and Counting.” The first show in the M’s sweet new space in the Pioneer Endicott Building is an introduction to the depth and breadth of its collection. From old favorites we haven’t seen for many years to recent acquisitions, it’s part revelation, part affirmation, part taste of things to come. FMI. Free. Open tonight (and every Thursday) until 8 p.m., 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Friday through Sunday. The show closes Sunday.
Friday and Saturday at the Walker: Celebrating Henry: A Henry Threadgill Festival . One of the towering figures in music today, Threadgill is an alto saxophonist, flutist, composer, improviser, visionary, and major influencer. In 2016, he became one of only three jazz musicians to win the Pulitzer Prize for music. (Wynton Marsalis won in 1997, Ornette Coleman in 2007.) On Friday, 24 Minnesota musicians, curated by Michelle Kinney, will perform works by Threadgill from the past 40-plus years. On Saturday, after an opening set by New York power-jazz trio Harriet Tubman, Threadgill will perform with his quintet Zooid. If you plan to go, be sure to read Britt Robson’s radiant, intelligent interview of Threadgill for the Star Tribune. 8 p.m. both nights. FMI and tickets ($25/20, $35/28).
Friday through Sunday: The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Tapestry19: “Songs My Mother Taught Me.” The SPCO has long taken its music into the community, performing in neighborhood venues throughout the Twin Cities. With Tapestry, a new biennial festival, it begins drawing music from the community, asking community members to lend their voices and viewpoints to a shared exploration of issues we face today. Tapestry19 asks the question, “How do I recognize my home?” Concerts this weekend will feature the world premiere of Twin Cities soul singer and composer PaviElle French’s “A Requiem for Zula,” a tribute to her mother and growing up in St. Paul’s Rondo neighborhood, and the world premiere of composer and clarinetist Kinan Azmeh’s “Don’t RipEat After Me,” about growing up in Syria in the 1980s. More world premieres will follow next week. The goal, in the words of SPCO artistic director and principal violinist Kyu-Young Kim: “To magnify the ability of music to engage our whole selves and our whole community.” Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.in the Ordway Concert Hall, Sunday at 2 p.m. in Benson Great Hall. FMI and tickets ($12-50, kids and students free).
Monday at the Dakota: A Celebration of Black History Month with Bruce A. Henry. Sarah Greer will join Henry in songs by Paul Robeson, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye and other great African American artists. This will be stirring, powerful and gorgeous – those voices!

Plan ahead
For Friday, March 16, at the Fitzgerald Theater: Live from Here with special guest host Jon Batiste. Bandleader for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” scion of a long line of Louisiana musicians, Batiste has a new album out, “Hollywood Africans,” and an excess of charisma. He’ll stand in for host Chris Thile. Doors at 4 p.m., live broadcast at 4:45. FMI and tickets ($45-55).
For Thursday, March 28, at the Cathedral of St. Paul: Choir of King’s College, Cambridge. Last chance to see and hear one of the world’s most esteemed and popular choral groups – through numerous recordings, annual radio and TV broadcasts (“A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols,” “Carols from King’s”), and live performances – with longtime music director Stephen Cleobury, who will retire in September. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($45-59; sold through the Fitzgerald Theater, but the concert will take place at the Cathedral).
For Friday, April 12, at Mixed Blood Theatre: Double Sided: A Literary Reading. Dessa (rapper, singer, essayist, author most recently of “My Own Devices”), Donte Collins (award-winning poet, author of “Autopsy”), Maggie Ryan Sanford (award-winning science writer and fiction writer), and Shane Hawley (writer, performer, author of “ABC Death”) will read and perform from their own work, KARE 11’s Jana Shortal will host, plus there will be a surprise musical guest. 7:30 p.m. FMI and tickets ($25).

Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking (non-fiction)
New York Times Bestseller. The world-famous cosmologist and author of "A Brief History of Time" leaves us with his final thoughts on the biggest questions facing humankind. Stephen Hawking was the most renowned scientist since Einstein, known both for his groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology and for his mischievous sense of humor. He educated millions of readers about the origins of the universe and the nature of black holes, and inspired millions more by defying a terrifying early prognosis of ALS, which originally gave him only two years to live. In later life he could communicate only by using a few facial muscles, but he continued to advance his field and serve as a revered voice on social and humanitarian issues. Now, as we face immense challenges on our planet – including climate change, the threat of nuclear war, and the development of artificial intelligence – he turns his attention to the most urgent issues facing us. Will humanity survive? Should we colonize space? Does God exist?
The Reluctant Healer by Andrew Himmel (fiction)
Named to Kirkus Reviews' Best Books of 2018. "The Reluctant Healer" tells the story of a young attorney who is torn between mounting evidence that he has the spiritual ability to heal others. Will Alexander is cautious and conventional. But when he meets Erica, a beautiful, intense energy healer, he becomes troubled not only by her unorthodox endeavors but also by the limitations of his own existence. Will is startled to discover that he may possess metaphysical gifts of healing that confront the narrow doctrines of his regulated life.
Vindication by H. Terrell Griffin (fiction)
In this John Grisham style mystery, Matt Royal, the retired lawyer-turned-beach-bum is called back into the courtroom to defend his girlfriend J.D. Duncan's Aunt Esther, who lives in the sprawling North Central Florida retirement community of The Villages. A best-selling author has been murdered after a book signing, and Aunt Esther has been arrested. Matt has a history with the local sheriff – one which may not bode well for his client. Matt reluctantly suits up for the courtroom, and J.D. takes a leave from the police department to go undercover. A bizarre specter from the past haunts their investigation every step of the way. As they delve further into the case, the pieces of the puzzle refuse to fall into any kind of coherent pattern. Not until the case goes to trial and the evidence is revealed does the truth emerge – and a strange kind of justice prevails.
Samantha Bonnette is marketing & development manager at Shreve Memorial Library.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is speaking publicly about the investigations into President Donald Trump's Russian ties and his possible obstruction of justice, telling CBS in an interview that Justice Department officials weighed asking the Cabinet to consider invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office.
McCabe made the revelation during an interview with "60 Minutes" that is scheduled to air on Sunday.
In September, the New York Times reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had discussed using the 25th Amendment on Trump and that he had considered wearing a wire to record his conversations with the president. Rosenstein has strongly denied the report.
"60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley said Thursday on CBS "This Morning" that McCabe told him "there were meetings at the Justice Department in which it was discussed whether the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could be brought together to remove the president of the United States under the 25th Amendment. "
Pelley said those conversations took place in the time between Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, and May 17, 2017, when Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate a potential conspiracy between Russian intelligence operatives and the Trump campaign.
On Thursday, the DOJ again denied that officials considered using the 25th Amendment.
"As to the specific portions of this interview provided to the Department of Justice by 60 Minutes in advance, the Deputy Attorney General again rejects Mr. McCabe’s recitation of events as inaccurate and factually incorrect," a spokesperson said in a statement. "The Deputy Attorney General never authorized any recording that Mr. McCabe references. "
What to know about the 25th Amendment: It's never been used, but ex-FBI head says officials thought about it
McCabe told Pelley in an excerpt of the interview released Thursday that he met with agents looking into Russian election meddling the day after Trump fired Comey to make sure the investigation was on "solid ground" in case he was removed from his position or fired.
He said he wanted to make sure "that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace. I wanted to make sure that our case was on solid ground and if somebody came in behind me and closed it and tried to walk away from it, they would not be able to do that without creating a record of why they made that decision. "
More: Fired FBI official Andrew McCabe kept personal memos regarding Trump
The 25th Amendment, ratified after the assassination of President John Kennedy, outlines the procedures for the vice president to assume office. Section Four of the amendment says that the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet can rule "that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. "
McCabe was fired last March by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for "an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions. " Trump called McCabe's firing "a great day for Democracy," but the White House denied any role in his ouster.
McCabe denied the allegations, which have been referred for investigation to the U. S. Attorney’s office in Washington, and blasted his firing as part of the Trump administration’s "war on the FBI. "
Trump responded Thursday to the news of McCabe's interview by calling him a "disgrace to the FBI and to our Country" who was trying to pretend to be a "poor little Angel" in a tweet Thursday. He also repeated many of his past criticisms of McCabe, who he says helped start the "Russia hoax" and was biased in favor of Hillary Clinton.
Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that "the writings of a disgraced FBI agent" won't detract from Trump's accomplishments and he said he was unaware of any talk about invoking the 25th Amendment.
"I’ve never heard any discussion of the 25th amendment by members of the government and I would never expect to," Pence told NBC News during an interview from Poland where he is attending a conference on security in the Middle East on security in the Middle East.
McCabe's "60 Minutes" interview precedes the release next week of his book, “The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. "
Contributing: The Associated Press
Russia probe: Mueller hasn't said a word about the Trump investigation. It's possible he never will.
More: Yes, the Mueller investigation is costly. But the millions seized from Manafort have it on track to break even

Texto completo: Doug Adler's long nightmare is finally over.
After two years of living hell, the tennis broadcaster who was falsely accused of racism finally cleared his name last week. This despite what has become all too common on Twitter: a rush-to-judgment mob mentality.
While an ESPN tennis analyst at the Australian Open in January 2017, as all-time great Venus Williams charged the net, Adler observed that she was using what is known in tennis as "the guerrilla effect," as in guerrilla warfare, where sudden ambushes occur.
Viewers unfamiliar with the term "guerrilla" went crazy, hopping on Twitter to express their outrage - how dare he call Williams a gorilla! Tweets included, "My jaw dropped when I heard this! Disgusting!"
As the unfortunate tweets about the word "guerrilla" piled up, ESPN panicked. And when it was learned that one of the clueless tweets was a New York Times freelancer, Adler was toast (not breakfast toast, but ... never mind).
ESPN threatened to fire Adler unless he apologized for something he didn't do, and when he did apologize, the network fired him anyway. Didn't he make a racist comment?
Uhm, no. He was using a homonym (and no, I am not attacking gay people). Homonyms are words that sound alike but have different meanings. A spouse on the phone describing the dinner his or her partner cooked as "It was fowl" might want to phrase it another way to avoid having a dish thrown at him or her.
What is foul is that Adler's life for two years has been a nightmare.
Adler sued ESPN for wrongful termination on Feb. 14, 2017. Last week, ESPN finally settled the lawsuit and rehired Adler. But in the interim, the stress and abuse he experienced took their toll. According to tennis.life, he suffered emotional and physical issues, including a heart attack.
In his book "The Death of Expertise," national security expert Tom Nichols says we have become "proud of not knowing things. Americans have reached a point where ignorance ... is [considered] an actual virtue." It wasn't for Adler.
Meanwhile, ESPN executives tried to keep the settlement with Adler low key. Maybe ESPN was embarrassed.
Or maybe executives at ESPN know that the truth doesn't matter anymore?

Texto completo: PARIS -- Swastikas drawn on portraits of a women's rights champion and Holocaust survivor in Paris; the word "Juden" (Jews, in German) spray-painted on a bagel bakery; a tree planted in memory of a young Jewish man who was tortured to death, chopped down in a Paris suburb.
A spate of reports in recent days illustrates what the government officially confirmed on Tuesday: Anti-Semitic incidents have risen sharply in France. Such episodes jumped by 74 percent in 2018, to 541, up from 311 in 2017, the interior ministry reported.
"Anti-Semitism is spreading like a poison, like a bile," the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said on Monday as he visited the site of the felled tree.
The tree was a memorial to Ilan Halimi, a Jewish man who was kidnapped and tortured to death after being held captive for three weeks by members of a French criminal gang in 2006. The authorities and Jewish institutions were preparing to commemorate the 13th anniversary of Mr. Halimi's death, which falls on Wednesday, when the tree was found destroyed.
In Paris, a street artist who painted portraits of Simone Veil on mailboxes in the 13th arrondissement found swastikas scrawled across her face on Monday.
Ms. Veil, a Holocaust survivor sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp at age 16, became France's health minister in the 1970s and championed a law legalizing abortion. A feminist icon and symbol of resilience in the face of the Holocaust, she died in June 2017.
She was interred in the Panthéon, where France's greatest figures are buried. Soon after, colorful portraits similar to the ones vandalized on Monday flourished across Paris with the words "Merci Simone."
"Shame on the despicable person who disfigured with a swastika my tribute to Simone Veil," Christian Guémy, the street artist, wrote on Twitter. He cleaned the paintings on Tuesday and said he would repaint them tirelessly if they were to be vandalized again.
Frédéric Potier, the head of a government body created to fight racism and anti-Semitism, said the increase in the number of anti-Semitic acts could be explained by a resurgence of such messages within far-right circles, especially online.
"Online platforms are a fertile ground for hatred, and it increasingly spills out in the public sphere," he said.
The number of anti-Semitic incidents fluctuates annually -- it rose in 2015 and fell in 2016 and 2017 -- but the sharp change last year was a rare spike.
Prime Minister Édouard Philippe unveiled a broad plan against anti-Semitism and racism last year that included a coordinated fight against online hatred at the European level.
But critics, including some Jewish groups, called such plans inadequate.
"Anti-Semitism is a signal of the democratic weakening of our country," Francis Kalifat, the president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, said in a news release. He denounced a "wall of indifference surrounding anti-Semitism" and called for a "national wake-up."
French Jews, who make up less than 1 percent of the country's population, have for years sounded alarms about anti-Semitic acts that have pushed thousands to move or even leave the country. A rabbi in the 17th Arrondissement of Paris told The New York Times last year that Jews had relocated to the area "because they felt threatened" in their former neighborhoods, especially in the suburbs surrounding the city.
The issue drew a surge of attention last year after the killing of Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor. The killing, in her Paris apartment, shocked the Jewish community and the country as a whole.
Jean Veil, one of Ms. Veil's two sons, told RTL radio that he wasn't surprised by the latest anti-Semitic acts, and noted that similar marks had been found on portraits of his mother displayed on the Panthéon's gates last summer.
"Mother wouldn't be surprised about what is happening, because she had few illusions on anti-Semitism," he said.

Texto completo: “Should I go into more debt to start my business?”
The woman was soft-spoken, polite, patient. She had waited until the end of an Inc. conference session I was moderating, about how small-business owners could get loans and other financing, to approach me with her story. She was trying to pay off a sizable amount of credit card debt, and she wanted my advice: Could she make money more quickly by starting her own business? Would that be worth going deeper into the hole?
Launching a startup might seem like a good way to get rich quick – or at least get out of personal debt – at a time when companies like Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb have raised billions of dollars apiece. But such high-profile success stories are the exceptions to the brutal rule for entrepreneurs: About half of all startups fail within five years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and two-thirds fail within 10 years.
“That means you have a high probability of losing any and all money you put into your business,” I write in my new book, Startup Money Made Easy: The Inc. Guide to Every Financial Question About Starting, Running, and Growing Your Business (HarperCollins Leadership, 240 pp. , released Feb. 12). “It’s like any other risky investment: There are potentially huge upsides, but the downsides are far more statistically likely. ”
It’s an important warning, but not a blanket one. Starting a business can be exhilarating, life-changing and financially rewarding – as Daymond John, Sallie Krawcheck, Jack Ma, Bobbi Brown, and many other successful startup founders describe in the book. You just have to know what you’re getting into, and how to take the right risks. For example:
Can you afford to live without a salary for a year or more? The most successful startup CEOs often wait at least several months before they start paying themselves, Inc. data shows. Only 28 percent of respondents to the 2018 Inc. 5000 CEO survey, which polls the heads of the fastest-growing private companies in America, started taking a salary immediately after starting their business. When they did start paying themselves, 45 percent of these CEOs paid themselves less than $50,000 annually. That’s not exactly Jeff Bezos money.
Have you written out a business plan, complete with a financial section? Yes, most business plans rarely anticipate all the realities of running a business. But spending some time predicting your expenses, cash flow and break-even point will force you to think through the financial risks you’re about to take. It will also get you ready to raise money and apply for loans, since outside investors and banks will expect to see a business plan.
Do you know how much money you need to start your business? Finally, some good news: It’s easier and cheaper than ever to start a company these days. Think less than $5,000; that’s what 42 percent of 2018 Inc. 5000 CEO survey respondents said they used to start their first business. You might need more than that, or less; it depends on factors including where you live, the type of company you want to start, and how many employees you need. But if you’ve saved up a few thousand dollars to invest in your dream company, and you can afford to risk it all, you may be in good shape to take the startup risk.
Which is why I begged that woman at the conference to avoid that risk right now. I recommended that she get in touch with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit adviser for people struggling with debt, and focus on trying to get her financial health back, first. I hope that she’ll soon be in a place where she can start her business – and where she, and everyone else who wants to start a business, can afford to take the right entrepreneurial risks.
Maria Aspan is an award-winning business journalist and an editor-at-large at Inc. magazine, where she oversees money coverage and writes about startups, technology, finance and gender. She has also covered business and finance for the New York Times, Thomson Reuters and American Banker.

Texto completo: Corey Maggette has been identified as the unnamed Duke men’s basketball player who allegedly sexually assaulted Meredith Watson, USA TODAY Sports confirmed through a friend of the accuser Monday night.
Watson is the second woman to come forward to accuse Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault.
Maggette’s one year at Duke before an NBA career that stretched 14 seasons coincides with the alleged rape (1999), first reported by USA TODAY Sports on Friday. The New York Times was the first to report that Watson identified the alleged perpetrator as Maggette to a friend.
The friend, Washington D. C. -based attorney R. Stanton Jones, confirmed in an email to USA TODAY Sports that Watson told him she was raped by Fairfax and Maggette.
“When Meredith told me she’d been raped twice at Duke, it made me realize that nothing really awful had ever happened to me in my then very young life,” Jones told USA TODAY Sports. “That realization, and the horror of what Meredith told me about what she’d been through in college, had a big impact on me then and has stuck with me ever since. ”
Maggette denied the accusation when reached by The New York Times.
"I have never sexually assaulted anyone in my life and I completely and categorically deny any such charge," Maggette said in the statement issued through a spokesperson.
A spokesperson for Watson’s attorney has not returned multiple messages left by USA TODAY Sports since Saturday night. That spokesperson, Karen Kessler, provided The New York Times with a Facebook message exchange between Watson and another friend in March 2017, in which Watson named Fairfax and Maggette. The Times was unable to independently verify the message’s veracity.
"Ms. Watson came forward to address the Justin Fairfax denials," Kessler told USA TODAY Sports in a text message on Saturday when asked for specifics about the 1999 incident with the Duke player. "This is our focus and should be yours. "
Maggette has worked as a broadcaster since retiring from the NBA in 2013 and is an analyst at Fox Sports West.
"Fox Sports takes allegations of misconduct seriously, and we are looking into the matter," Fox Sports West said in a statement. "We have no further comment at this time. "
Watson’s attorney, Nancy Erika Smith, said in a statement released Friday that Watson "went to the dean, who provided no help and discouraged her from pursuing the claim further. "

Duke athletics director Kevin White said in a statement on Saturday that Duke had no knowledge of the alleged 1999 rape until Friday night when USA TODAY Sports and other outlets began to address it.
"The university is looking into the matter and will have no further comment at this time," White said.
Duke University also is investigating the allegation against Maggette.
"We are in the process of gathering information to determine what policies and procedures were in place during the time period in which these events are alleged to have occurred, and whether they were activated and followed," Duke said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. "We are not able to provide further information or comment on any individual at this time. "
Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said after Saturday’s game against Virginia that he had "no knowledge" of the incident until Friday.
"I think there was an allegation made, right?" Krzyzewski said. "So, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but there is an allegation. "

Great nations don't quit wars before they prevail

Texto completo: "Great nations do not fight endless wars," President Trump declared in his State of the Union address. It was a line that could have been delivered by President Barack Obama, who in 2015 memorably said, "I do not support the idea of endless war."
Just a few days before Trump's address, his own party delivered the president a stinging rebuke when Senate Republicans passed a resolution opposing his Syrian and Afghan withdrawals by an overwhelming bipartisan 68-to-23 vote. Trump's defenders say: That's just the foreign policy establishment advocating "forever war." When, they ask, will these wars end? When will we be able to declare victory and go home?
These are fair questions, and they deserve serious answers.
In traditional wars, defining victory is easy. Victory comes when the enemy surrenders and lays down its arms. But this is not traditional war. We are not fighting nation-states with defined borders and armies, navies and air forces. We are fighting radical Islamist terrorists who are engaged in what Osama bin Laden called "a war of destiny between infidelity and Islam." There will be no signing ceremony on the deck of the U.S.S. Missouri. They will never lay down their arms. In this war, victory for the United States is every day that passes without a terrorist attack on American soil. And that daily victory is made possible because the men and women of the U.S. military are hunting the enemy in faraway lands.
America's enemies have a very clear definition of victory. For them, victory comes when we give up the fight before they do. We know this because they have told us so. The 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told his CIA interrogator "Americans don't realize we do not need to defeat you militarily; we only need to fight long enough for you to defeat yourself by quitting." That is how the terrorists see Obama's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 and Trump's planned withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan: America defeating itself by quitting.
It is understandable that, after 18 years, Americans want the war to end. But what we want is irrelevant. We don't get to decide unilaterally that the war is over. The enemy gets a vote. Just because we have tired of fighting doesn't mean that they have.
Here is the hard truth: We don't get to choose when the war ends, but we do get to choose where it is fought. It can either be fought over there, in the deserts of Syria and the mountains of Afghanistan, or it can be fought over here -- on American streets and in American cities, as it was on Sept. 11, 2001. It's up to us.
Trump deserves enormous credit for taking the gloves off in the fight against the terrorists. He was absolutely correct when he declared in the State of the Union address, "When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters." But the Islamic State is not defeated. It still has tens of thousands of fighters under arms and, according to one estimate by the Institute for the Study of War, as much as $400 million it smuggled out of Iraq, money that can be used to sustain its movement and plan attacks across the world.
In Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence estimates there are about 20 terrorist groups - including al-Qaeda and the Islamic State affiliate known as Islamic State Khorasan, or IS-K - who would immediately gain an uncontested sanctuary from which to plan new attacks if America withdraws. On Jan. 28, the New York Times reported that a 2017 intelligence assessment, renewed last year, "says a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan would lead to an attack on the United States within two years."
Right now, the U.S. military has its boot on the terrorists' necks. They are focused on survival, not on launching faraway attacks. Take that boot away, though, and the terrorists will get up, dust themselves off, regroup, rebuild and go back to trying to kill Americans in the United States.
In his address, Trump praised the heroism of the men who stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. "They did not know if they would survive the hour," he said. "They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail."
The same is true today. Great nations do not quit before they prevail.

Fundraiser for Closs, family sets new goal of $150K

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint. Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward," De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."
Jayme Closs smiles with the family pets at her aunt's home, two days after escaping from a cabin in Gordon in Douglas County. Closs was missing for 88 days after her parents were murdered in her Barron home.

Texto completo: Valeria Luiselli's newest novel, "Lost Children Archive," is a penetrating work that tells one family's complicated story as they drive cross-country from New York to Arizona, even as she deftly draws contemporary political and personal struggles together in the mix.
Born in Mexico, Luiselli grew up in South Korea, South Africa and India, and has enjoyed an award-winning career as a writer of both fiction and nonfiction works.
She has authored the novels "Faces in the Crowd," "The Story of My Teeth" and "Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions," and the essay collection "Sidewalks." She has captured two Los Angeles Time Book Prizes, and an American Book Award; and is a two-time nominee for the National Book Critics Circle Award.
Luiselli's work has appeared in the New York Times, Granta, McSweeneys and other publications. She now lives in New York City.
Your new novel, "Lost Children Archive," chronicles a family's road trip from New York City to Arizona that served two purposes. The first was to provide research opportunities for both parents' projects as audio documentarians, with his focusing on the last leaders of the American Apache Indians, and hers on the child refugee crises from the court of immigration in New York. The journey was also a chance to share with their children some lessons of American history about the government's treatment of native Americans, as well as opportunities to personally experience what migrant children at the U.S. southern border were encountering. How did you develop the idea of this detailed and intense storyline?
When I begin a book, I have no idea of what I am going to do. I never think in terms of plot, or even overarching topics. All I have is a question, or perhaps a set of questions, and some intuitions about how to possibly explore them. One of the fundamental questions that drove me to write this novel had to do with the way that we tell stories to children, and in particular, the way we talk about history in relation to the present. And, in turn, the way that their internalization of those stories and versions of history may or may not make the world a less confusing and less terrifying place.
This novel, if anything, is about the process of composing stories, of threading voices and ideas together in an attempt to better understand the world around us. I don't see this as a novel about the refugee crisis, or about Apaches — but a novel about childhood, and the place of storytelling in the often daunting and sometimes solitary experience of being a child.
An important subplot in this narrative is the crisis within the family itself: the husband and wife, who are the parents of two children — all of whose names are never given — are in an unhappy marriage whose future is tenuous, at best. How does this affect the family dynamic during and after this trip, especially for the children?
I guess the crisis within the family, as they travel across the country inside their car, and the socio-political crisis unfolding around them, are in constant echo of each other. The novel is very much about the blurring of boundaries between our private sphere and the political/public realm.
We live in times where we can no longer draw a sharp division between the public and the private, between political life and family life. The two intersect and collide constantly, and we all have to figure out how to keep our feet on the ground and our heads clear.
Tell me about the decision of the main narrator (the mom) to change her documentary project from telling the story of "the crisis at the border" to that of the "lost," or "refugee" children.
More than a change it's a development prompted by her observations. She begins to pull on that thread when she starts spending time in the New York immigration court.
Then, as the family plans to drive southwest, and she begins to learn about the many layers of the crisis, she shifts her attention to the detention centers along the border. Finally, as she gets closer to the border, she starts thinking about all the children who cannot actually tell their story, who cannot actually be seen and cannot actually be heard — because they are either locked away indefinitely, or have gotten lost, or have lost their lives.
What the novel documents in this regard are simply the many layers of a crisis, and we travel through them, as readers, while the narrator herself is learning how to move across them.
During the course of the story, the couple's two young children become lost on a side trip that they set out on alone. They wind up experiencing circumstances similar to those of refugee children at the southern border of the United States. How did this experience ultimately influence the future of this family?
When I was writing "Lost Children Archive," I often found myself thinking about reenactment, both as a weird cultural practice — people reenacting historical moments — and as a more psychological, personal, internalized event, through which empathy for long-gone peoples and communities can perhaps be achieved.
In the novel, the children constantly reenact historical events, but they mix them all up with the present.
And in their confusion of past and present — especially the instances of brutal violence against Native Americans and the current treatment of undocumented people — they are able to understand political violence more clearly, and feel it in their own skin, so to speak.
Do you have other writing projects in the works at this time?
I'm doing research on mass incarceration and immigration detention. But I'm still in very early stages of the process, just taking notes, reading a lot, thinking. I have no idea what will come of it. And am not in a hurry.

Texto completo: Bill T. Jones/
Arnie Zane Company: Analogy Trilogy
“Analogy/Dora: Tramontane" Feb. 14, “Analogy/Lance: Pretty aka The Escape Artist" Feb. 15, “Analogy/Ambros: The Emigrant" Feb. 16-17.
At Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. Tickets $30-$40, 617-478-3103, www.icaboston.org
Bill T. Jones has never wanted for ambition. Formed in 1982, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company addressed racism, gender politics, and dance as a performance art that's not necessarily silent. Zane died in 1988, but Jones has since become a MacArthur Fellow, a Kennedy Center honoree, a two-time Tony Award winner, and the artistic director of New York Live Arts. And the company has continued on in works like “Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land" (1990), “Still/Here" (1994), and “Story/Time" (2012). On Feb. 14-17, the Institute of Contemporary Art will present Jones's “Analogy" trilogy (2015–2017), a meditation on meaning and memory that incorporates text, music, movement, and video.
“Analogy/Dora: Tramontane" (Feb. 14) focuses on Jones's mother-in-law, Dora Amelan, who was a nurse and social worker in Vichy France during World War II. “Analogy/Lance: Pretty aka The Escape Artist" (Feb. 15) looks at the life of Jones's nephew, Lance T. Briggs, a model, performer, and drug addict. (Jones brought a related work, “Letter to My Nephew," to the ICA when he was last here, in November 2016.) And “Analogy/Ambros: The Emigrant" (Feb. 16-17) was inspired by the novels of 20th-century German writer W.G. Sebald, specifically the segment of “The Emigrants" in which the narrator's great-uncle, Ambros Adelwarth, becomes the traveling companion of American aviator Cosmo Solomon before giving way to depression and dying in a mental institution. Jones spoke to the Globe about the origins of his trilogy and what “Analogy" means to him.
Q. Did “Analogy" start out to be a trilogy?
A. Well, I had been reading a lot of wonderful literature about 13 or 14 years ago, and I was directed toward W.G. Sebald's series of books. “The Emigrants" was maybe one of the first I read, and I was much struck with it, particularly the story of Ambros Adelwarth, because I'm a fan of this sort of historical fiction rooted in strong characters. It felt very real for me as a person in middle age trying to be truthful and wondering about the nature of truth. Sebald used his history in such a way that at times you wonder what is fiction and what is fact. So it started with Ambros Adelwarth.
Q. But “Analogy" begins with Dora.
A. Yes, around the same time, I was reviewing an oral history with Dora Amelan I had done as a gift to my husband [Bjorn Amelan, the company's creative director]. She was 19 years old when the Nazis marched into Antwerp. She and her sisters escaped, and she became involved with a Jewish organization, one part of which was underground. She began to work at one of these holding camps the Vichy government set up with the Germans, and she has a very powerful story to tell about what it means to be a young Jewish woman trying to understand who she was and what was a meaningful life when the whole world was crazy.
And I was trying to do both Dora and Sebald — he has a natural affinity for the time period, the European point of view. But they are so rich that I realized I should deal with one at a time. Dora Amelan was visiting us twice a year, the stories were continuing to pour out of her, and I felt quite privileged to be sitting across from a piece of history that was someone I loved. So we began with Dora first, putting Ambros on the back burner.
Q. And after that?
A. The next one seemed to be staring me in the face, my young nephew, Lance T. Briggs. I keep calling him my “young" nephew — he's a man who's almost 50 years old now, but in my mind he's still the vivacious and troubled 18-year-old that I had known years ago, and he was washed up on a far shore of life, having had this exciting life as a model, a dancer, and then addiction to crack cocaine, and a sex worker. And we were talking once a week, and he told me that he wanted to tell the absolute truth about his life, that he had lived this shadow life since he was quite a young boy. And therefore he was the second one in the trilogy.
Q. Does “Analogy" represent a new direction in dance, or is it just a different performance genre?
A. Well, my work has always been multidisciplinary, if that's what you mean. On one level it's trying to deepen something that I've been interested in a long time in how text, movement, song, décor are all greater than the sum of their parts, and this work is a meditation on all of those things. I think I've never made anything quite like it, and quite frankly I haven't seen anything quite like it.
Q. What kind of challenge was this for the dancers?
A. I told Nick Hallett [the trilogy's composer] that I really wanted my company to sing. And he was a bit skeptical; he's a professional singer, and he didn't think that these dancers had the ear. And it's true, it's been a struggle getting people who are not thinking about pitch to actually understand pitch, and to understand text. These people had already been indoctrinated into a system that would have them pick up the microphone and then speak the language of an 85-year-old French-Jewish woman. So they had to learn about her phrasing, her imagery. They had to channel Lance T. Briggs, a young inner-city man who was their age somewhere in the late '80s, the '90s.
And then they had to learn about Ambros Adelwarth and my love for literature. They had to learn what it was about this novel that inspired me to try to make a performance out of it. The first cast — it's now 50 percent changed, but the first cast was required to read the novel. I find it a very interesting and tasty reading, but for many of them it was just flowery language. They're not very much interested in literary metaphors or poetic allusions, not to mention the historical references that Sebald is such a master of. But they had to do it for the sake of the choreography.
Q. And finally, what is the “Analogy" of the title?
A. It's analogy about a comparison. But I don't tell the audience what is being compared. If they see all three pieces, I think it becomes ever more clear what is actually the subject of the piece. I sometimes say “Analogy" is about the nature of a life, or what is a life well lived, or what is a meaningful life. I don't tell you what I think, but I give you an opportunity to look at how I've drawn the portraits, and that tells you something about what I think about these three lives, and therefore justifies their being compared. I would encourage people to try to see all three sections of the piece if they could. I think it will be quite rewarding.

People, and the Dogs Who Own Them

Texto completo: We love our dogs, that's not news. And we love pictures of our dogs, also not news. But every year, at the same time, we really start to think about our dogs -- how they look, their personalities, their gaits. That's because we're subconsciously comparing our personal pooches to the professional canines in the Westminster Dog Show. As they strut and pose, on television, we can't help but think, "I've seen cuter," often in our own neighborhoods, or at the end of our own leashes.
And The New York Times photo archives proves that point. When we began the process of digitizing the six million photos in the Times files, images of dogs became an unexpected through line of how we photographed New York. One of the main things that stood out: while the people, the fashion and the cars changed, the dogs of New York stayed very much the same.
For instance, decades before Instagram or #packwalk, there was Jim Buck trouping through the streets of New York with multiple leashes and multiple dogs in tow. In 1964, Gay Talese profiled Buck in these pages. "145-Pounder Walks 500 Pounds of Dogs," read the headline on the article. Which doesn't sound exceptional now, but Buck is thought to be the first professional dog walker. In the story we learned that Buck was 32, married, with two kids, and two big dogs of his own. He was making a decent income -- six figures, in today's dollars -- and he was in a growing field, electronic sales. But as Talese explained, Buck was bored. He loved animals and the outdoors so with "a little advertising and a little salesmanship," he began a dogwalking business and not only earned enough to support his family, he became a pillar of dog culture on the Upper East Side.
As Talese reported it, Buck was such an unusual sight that he always drew a crowd. "Hook up a sled!" cried one doorman. "Opening race at Aqueduct" was one policeman's quip. When Buck died in 2013, his Times obituary noted that he "is widely described as the first person to professionalize dog walking in New York City and, by extension, in the United States .... He walked in sun; he walked in rain. In wintertime, his charges might be clad in small sweaters bearing the logos of the European resorts where their masters skied."
In the years before social media, dogs in the paper served a similar function. Like press-hungry starlets, these pups pictured here made it into every section of the paper, from weather reports to the style pages to metro and sports. In much the same way that dogs of Instagram say a hundred delightful things to viewers without actually saying a word, these images speak to, as one essay by N. R. Kleinfield put it, "urban love stories: how and why people fetch, sit and roll over for their pets."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump’s State of Kumbaya address

Texto completo: At times during the State of the Union speech, Donald Trump sounded like he wanted everyone to love each other. If you just caught selected snippets, you might have believed that he had turned a new leaf, pushed the restart button and resolved to let bygones be bygones.
"We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution," Trump said early in the speech. But earlier in the day, he bashed his political opponents, proving that fear and revenge are still the meat and potatoes of his life.
As he was speaking in the House chamber, you could see the two little figures dancing on his shoulders. The angel kept urging him to talk nice, but the devil assured him that the same old Trump was fine. Since old habits die hard, the devil won.
When Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress, Trump's threats meant something. But he no longer has the run of the place, with Democrats controlling the House, and he should have listened to the angel.
Lyndon Johnson, majority leader of the Senate and president of the United States, recognized the nature of political power, and he had an earthy way to describe it. Essentially, Johnson said that if you grabbed hold of politicians hard and did not let go, "Their hearts and minds will follow."
And, since Democrats now have a solid grip on Trump, he needs a reality check. Compromise and conciliation are called for, and even though no one gets all he wants, everyone gets something. This is the art of politics.
As for Trump's tough-guy image, there has never been a tougher man in the White House than Johnson, and even he was not all bully. Johnson convinced and cajoled and charmed liberals and conservatives alike, even aligning himself with Republican President Eisenhower to build the interstate highway system.
As political journalists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak described Johnson's approach, "Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions."
Earlier in the week, New York Times writers Michael Tackett and Maggie Haberman described Trump as a president who has only one tactic -- fear -- and it is wearing thin.
"Other presidents have held out the fear of recrimination from the Oval Office to get their way, but they did not use Mr. Trump's blunt instruments alone," they said.
And, as David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama said, "Every foreign leader and every practicing politician has taken a measure of him and understands the basics, that he responds to strength and there's not a lot behind the facade."
But there he was Tuesday night, ignoring reality and the shift in political power in the co-equal branch of American government. It was his chance to change his approach and start to govern. Instead, fearful of ongoing investigations, he bashed and threatened the Democrats.
"If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation," he warned. It was a foolish play from a guy who no longer holds all the cards.

Texto completo: In one of probably many 5-4 decisions to come, the conservative justices signaled their support for Trump's discriminatory agenda. Shame on them for supporting this base-baiting nonsense from a president who avoided the service due to inflamed corns or whatever while claiming to suffer a "personal Vietnam" dodging STDs as an entitled magnate about town in the 1970s. Cruising the clubs in daddy's limo is almost the same as dodging feces-tipped spears in a rice paddy but not quite.
Fun fact: No one on the current Supreme Court has served in the military, although you could argue Kavanaugh was practically a full bird colonel when it came to procuring beer for his fraternity pals.
Now of course I'm not saying Supreme Court justices should have personal experience with every issue that comes before them. That would be, to use legal vernacular, nutso facto.
But I am saying that it seems to me if you're going to sit on the highest court in the land for life, you should want to smite bigotry and prejudice a lot more than the average Joe, Jolene or Jolene becoming Joe.
The Trump administration considers this a victory. A transgender military ban was one of the first things the president wanted to accomplish, most likely not for any deeply held, wrongheaded belief but more to stick it to Obama who announced trans soldiers would be able to serve openly toward the end of his presidency. You remember, right before the sky turned coal black and the rivers turned to blood. Kidding! It was more of a brooding gray.
The issue of keeping transgender people from serving in the military is just the latest chapter in an ugly history of prejudice in the U.S. military. Truman integrated the military because it was the right thing to do. In 2011, Obama finally tossed the offensive and ridiculous "don't ask, don't tell" of the Clinton years, allowing gay and lesbian soldiers to no longer be discriminated against. It's hard to understand why the high court would penalize soldiers simply because they've been brave enough to take the steps to make them whole, finally.
Numerous studies have found that trans soldiers have no negative impact whatsoever on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness. Blubbering about hormone and other medical costs is ridiculous, too. Five times as much is spent on Viagra for non-trans personnel.
There are nearly 11,000 transgender troops serving in the military today, protecting all of us who didn't have the guts or the stamina or, honestly, the pure patriotism to enlist. Instead of vilifying these valorous soldiers as "less than" while they protect us thousands of miles away from their homes, we should offer grateful support. Anything less is simply un-American.

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson then put the young girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home in Douglas County and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint. Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward,"De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

Trump Defies Deadline For Report On Khashoggi

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump refused to provide Congress a report on Friday determining who killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, defying a demand by lawmakers intent on establishing whether the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was behind the grisly assassination.
Mr. Trump effectively bypassed a deadline set by law as his administration argued that Congress could not impose its will on the president. Critics charged that he was seeking to cover up Saudi complicity in the death of Mr. Khashoggi, an American resident and a columnist for The Washington Post.
"Consistent with the previous administration's position and the constitutional separation of powers, the president maintains his discretion to decline to act on congressional committee requests when appropriate," the Trump administration said in a statement. The statement said the administration had taken action against the killers and would consult with Congress.
But Democrats said Mr. Trump was violating a law known as the Magnitsky Act. It required him to respond 120 days after a request submitted in the fall by committee leaders -- including Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and then the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- a period that expired Friday.
"The law is clear," said Juan Pachón, a spokesman for Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the committee. "It requires a determination and report in response to the letter we sent with Corker. The president has no discretion here. He's either complying with the law or breaking it."
The Trump administration imposed sanctions in November against 17 Saudis accused of being involved in the killing, but has refused to blame Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a key ally and the country's de facto ruler, despite a C.I.A. conclusion that the crown prince ordered it.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent letters to the committee leaders describing actions taken against individuals without offering the determination of who was responsible as demanded by the lawmakers.
"I anticipate a more detailed briefing from the administration on this issue and look forward to working with them and the members of my committee in our ongoing effort to address the killing of Jamal Khashoggi," said Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, who succeeded Mr. Corker as chairman.
The Saudi government on Friday rebutted a report that Prince Mohammed told a top aide in 2017 that he would use "a bullet" on Mr. Khashoggi if he did not return to the kingdom and cease his criticism of the Saudi government.
"We know that the crown prince did not order this," Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, told reporters at the Saudi Embassy in Washington. "We know that this was a rogue operation."
"It's like saying when Oliver North was engaged in Iran-contra, did Ronald Reagan know?" he said.
On Thursday, The New York Times reported that the conversation between the crown prince and a top aide, intercepted by American intelligence agencies, revealed the most detailed evidence to date that Prince Mohammed considered killing Mr. Khashoggi long before a team of Saudi operatives strangled him inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and dismembered his body using a bone saw.
The Saudi government has repeatedly denied that the crown prince played any role. Mr. al-Jubeir said Saudi authorities continue their investigation while a trial of suspects is underway. "Those responsible will be held accountable," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration was set to ignore a Friday deadline for giving the Senate a full accounting of the role of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in the brutal slaying of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi four months ago.
The administration, which has consistently sought to shield Saudi rulers from blame, had until midnight Friday to answer senators' questions about whether Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, as U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, and what additional sanctions should be placed on the government in Riyadh.
The deadline was set by Democratic and Republican senators, who wrote the president on Oct. 10 - slightly more than a week after Khashoggi's disappearance - calling for an investigation.
Senators said Trump was obliged by law to answer within 120 days. Administration officials contended, however, that the law was not binding and that the president could ignore the senators' demands.
A top Saudi official, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir, on Friday insisted the crown prince had no role in Khashoggi's slaying, saying the trial of the suspects and the ongoing investigation would show it was a "rogue operation" with no official backing.
The New York Times reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a 2017 conversation in which Mohamed told a top aide that he would use "a bullet" on Khashoggi, a regime critic, if he did not return home to Saudi Arabia.
Fire at Brazilian soccer academy kills 10, injures 3
RIO DE JANEIRO - Fire tore through the sleeping quarters of an academy for one of Brazil's most popular professional soccer clubs Friday, killing 10 people and injuring three, most likely teenage players, authorities said.
Firefighters were called just after 5 a.m. local time to the sprawling Ninho de Urubu training grounds of the Flamengo soccer club in Rio de Janeiro.
The cause of the fire was not known.
Those killed were not immediately identified by the club but they were athletes, a health official said.
Two of the injured youths were hospitalized in stable condition and one was in critical condition. The ages of the injured were 14, 15 and 16, according to a fire official.
Several people who appeared to be relatives entered the complex without speaking to reporters.
Stone says he should be free
to speak in Russia probe case
WASHINGTON - A federal judge shouldn't bar longtime Donald Trump confidant Roger Stone from making public statements about his criminal case in the Russia investigation, his attorneys said Friday.
Defense lawyers say in a court filing that any limits on Stone's public comments would infringe on his right to free speech.
They made the argument as U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is considering a gag order preventing both sides in the case from making public statements that could prejudice potential jurors.
Jackson raised the issue last week as she told Stone not to treat his criminal case like a "book tour," referring to post-indictment talk show appearances Stone made in which he attacked the investigation as politically motivated.
Iran's top leader defends chants of 'Death to America' by crowds
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is defending "Death to America" chants that are standard fare at anti-U.S. rallies across Iran but says the chanting is aimed at America's leaders and not its people.
Khamenei's website on Friday quoted him as saying the chant means "death to U.S. leaders, death to (President Donald) Trump and John Bolton and (Mike) Pompeo."
He says the Iranian people "will not stop saying 'Death to America' as long as the U.S. acts malicious" toward Iran.
Khamenei was referring to Trump's State of the Union address this week in which the American president, among other things, said: "We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants 'Death to America.' "
France presses Italy in historic EU dispute
PARIS - France's pro-EU government and Italy's populist leaders sparred anew Friday amid the neighbors' biggest diplomatic spat since World War II.
French officials said Friday that this week's recall of French Ambassador Christian Masset was prompted by months of "unfounded attacks" from Italian government members Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini, who have criticized French President Emmanuel Macron's economic and migration policies.
But the main trigger for the crisis appeared to be Di Maio's meeting in a Paris suburb this week with members of the yellow vests - a French anti-government movement seeking seats in the European Parliament - without informing French leaders, who considered it an unwarranted intrusion into the nation's internal affairs.
Steep fall in enforcement by EPA seen since 2016
WASHINGTON - Civil and criminal crackdowns on polluters dropped sharply in the second year of the Trump administration, according to 2018 enforcement figures released Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Trump administration EPA says the agency is taking a new tack with polluters, giving states more of a role in regulation and enforcement and stressing education and voluntary compliance with offenders as well as fines and criminal prosecution.
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies overall in carrying out the deregulatory goals of President Donald Trump.
Declines include civil investigations carried out by the agency, which fell to 22 last year, down from 40 in 2017 and 125 in 2016, the last year of the Obama administration.
Health exam: President Donald Trump is "in very good health" and expected to remain healthy for "the duration of his Presidency, and beyond," the president's doctor said Friday after a physical exam by 11 specialists. The White House did not release more details and did not say whether any would be released.
In Washington: Amid a measles outbreak that has sickened more than 50 people in the Pacific Northwest, Washington lawmakers heard testimony Friday on a bill that would remove parents' ability to claim a personal or philosophical exemption to opt school-age kids out of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

Texto completo: When it comes to racist behavior and sexual assault, there's a difference in how Democrats and Republicans handle scandal: Republicans tolerate it.

That's according to 2020 candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was asked during a stop in Ankeny, Iowa, on Friday about the turmoil engulfing top Democrats in Virginia.

“I don’t mean to congratulate ourselves because we’ve got our issues to work through too, but I would point to the contrast between how the Democratic Party handled allegations of sexual mistreatment among people in our ranks … and what’s going on on the other side of the aisle,” the 37-year-old Indiana mayor said.

“Or when it comes to these disturbing racial relations. The difference between the conversation the Democratic Party is having about the governor of Virginia and the conversation, if any, that the Republican Party is having about people like Steve King. How much will we tolerate?”

Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, came under fire last month for racism over statements he made to the New York Times.

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, and Attorney General Mark Herring — all Democrats — are facing intense pressure to resign over scandals that emerged in the last week.

Northam and Herring separately admitted to wearing blackface decades ago. After it appeared Northam would give in to calls to resign, Fairfax appeared set to take the reins — until two women accused him of sexual misconduct.

All three Democrats have since been asked to step down, facing the most pressure from those within their own party.

Buttigieg said Democrats, such as former Sen. Al Franken who was accused of groping and kissing women without their permission, have caved to pressure, while Republicans have not forced members to resign.

He pointed to King still being in Congress. Though King faced calls to resign over his remarks on white supremacy, Republicans did vote to remove him from his committee assignments, citing a pattern of inflammatory comments.

“People of conscience need to look at the right thing to do, that will resolve some of these issues, too,” Buttigieg said.

Texto completo: A second woman has come forward to accuse Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of a "premeditated and aggressive" sexual assault, the latest accusation leveled against him amid calls to resign.
Meredith Watson said in a statement through her lawyers that Fairfax raped her while they were students at Duke University in 2000. The accusation follows a previous claim by a former colleague who says Fairfax sexually assaulted her in 2004.
Fairfax has denied both allegations.
The claims cap off a week of tumult in Virginia politics as the state's top three Democrats have been embroiled in controversy. The state's governor and attorney general have both admitted to wearing blackface in the 1980s but have rejected calls for them to resign.
In a statement Friday, Watson's lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, said Fairfax and her client were friends in college but didn't date. Watson told her friends at the time that Fairfax raped her and has provided her lawyers with emails and Facebook messages detailing her account of the rape, Smith said.
Watson also called on Fairfax to resign, Smith said.
"At this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character," Smith's statement said. "She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages. "
Fairfax, 39, said Friday he would not resign and demanded an investigation into the claims.
"I will clear my good name and I have nothing to hide. I have passed two full field background checks by the FBI and run for office in two highly contested elections with nothing like this being raised before," he said in a statement. "It is obvious that a vicious and coordinated smear campaign is being orchestrated against me. "
In a second statement Friday, Watson's attorney Smith pushed back against Fairfax's denial.
In college, Watson went to Fairfax after she had been previously raped by someone else, Smith said. Later, after Fairfax allegedly raped Watson, they had an interaction outside a campus party, Smith said.
"She turned and asked: 'Why did you do it?' Mr. Fairfax answered: 'I knew that because of what happened to you last year, you’d be too afraid to say anything. ' Mr. Fairfax actually used the prior rape of his 'friend' against her when he chose to rape her in a premeditated way," Smith said in the second statement.
Duke campus police have no criminal reports naming Fairfax, university spokesman Michael Schoenfeld said. Durham police spokesman Wil Glenn also said he couldn't find a report in the department's system on the 2000 allegation.
Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe on Friday said the accusations were "serious and credible" and he called on Fairfax to resign.
In a joint statement, five Democratic U. S. representatives from Virginia also asked Fairfax to step down, as did the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.
"The past seven days have been some of the most painful we can remember. It has been very difficult to marshal the thoughts, let alone the words, to react," the statement read from Reps. Don Beyer, Abigail Spanberger, Elaine Luria, Jennifer Wexton and Gerry Connolly.
The black caucus said it believes "it is best for Lt. Governor Fairfax to step down from his position . . . While we believe that anyone accused of such a grievous and harmful act must receive the due process prescribed by the Constitution, we can't see it in the best interest of the Commonwealth of Virginia for (Fairfax) to remain in his role. "
Patrick Hope, a Democrat and Virginia state delegate, said in a tweet he'd introduce articles of impeachment for Fairfax on Monday if the lieutenant governor doesn't resign.
If Fairfax, as well as Gov. Ralph Northam and the state's attorney general, Mark Herring, were to step down, Republican Kirk Cox, the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, would take over leading the state — complicating matters even more for Democrats.
Liberals have taken a zero-tolerance approach to racial transgressions and sexual assault, which was highlighted by the #MeToo movement. But ousting the top three Democrats in the state and leaving Republicans in charge seems to have left liberals in a no-win situation.
But the accusations continue to mount against the state's top three officials.
Earlier this week, Vanessa Tyson, who worked with Fairfax at the 2004 Democratic national convention in Boston, lodged claims that Fairfax forced her to perform oral sex in a hotel room at the time.
Fairfax on Wednesday called the encounter consensual.
"I wish her no harm or humiliation, nor do I seek to denigrate her or diminish her voice," the lieutenant governor said. "But I cannot agree with a description of events that I know is not true. "
According to The New York Times, five people say Tyson, a professor at Scripps College in Claremont, California, told them about the assault over the past two years and that her account of the event has been consistent since going public.
Fairfax, according to the Times, said of the 2004 encounter: “We hit it off, she was very interested in me, and so eventually, at one point, we ended up going to my hotel room. ”
Tyson said she decided to go public with her charges because of the prospects that Fairfax seemed likely to become the state's chief executive.
"I felt a jarring sense of both outrage and despair," Tyson said in a statement Wednesday.
Kaneedreck Adams, 40, told The Washington Post that Watson told her at Duke in spring 2000 that Fairfax raped her at a fraternity house.
"She said she couldn’t speak, but she was trying to get up and he kept pushing her down," Adams, who reportedly lived across from Watson, told the newspaper. "She said he knew that she didn’t like what was happening, but he kept pushing her down. "
Adams described Fairfax, who was a year ahead of them in school, as a "nice sweet charming guy. "
"We all knew he wanted to be in politics," she told the Post. "He had a reputation for being very friendly. Some of my friends, we called him sunshine. "
The Post also reported that Watson emailed Milagros Joye Brown, a college friend, in 2016 as Brown invited former classmates to a fundraiser for Fairfax's lieutenant governor bid.
"Molly, Justin raped me in college and I don’t want to hear anything about him. Please, please, please remove me form any future emails about him please," Watson reportedly wrote in the Oct. 26, 2016 email.
The accusations against Fairfax came amid talks that he might be next in line to take over for Northam after a yearbook photo surfaced showing a man in blackface and another person wearing a Ku Klux Klan robe.
At first, Northam acknowledged he was in the photo and apologized. The following day, he denied either person was him, but admitted that he did dress in blackface at a 1984 dance contest in San Antonio for a Michael Jackson costume.
Herring, who is third in line to lead the state, also admitted this week that he, too, donned blackface in the 1980s.
The blackface controversies have forced Virginia, the capital of the Confederacy, to relive its racist roots, something that's happened far too frequently in the state.
Virginia was also the epicenter of protests over the removal of Confederate monuments and hosted a right-wing rally in 2017 in Charlottesville that turned deadly after a neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.

'These kids need a chance'

Texto completo: Leon County Commissioner Bill Proctor is calling for a community summit to address challenges facing the 32304 zip code — the poorest in the state.
The status raised eyebrows after Florida Chamber of Commerce President Mark Wilson revealed more residents in this zip code are living in poverty than all others in the state during the annual breakfast in October, hosted by the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce.
Two months later, the Florida Chamber released its latest poverty report where Leon County ranked 14th in the state for the number of children (18 and under) living in poverty.
Nearly half of the children in the 32304 zip code live below the poverty level. The area stretches from the Ochlockonee River to CollegeTown and the fringes of Florida State's campus. The Florida Chamber reports 1,837 poor children call this area home.
Troubled by the latest economic outlook, Proctor is urging swift action. He said it's clear economic segregation persists in the capital city and has been documented by the Florida Chamber and several studies in recent years.
The latest picture points to Tallahassee's "moral bankruptcy," Proctor said, adding it's a "collective indictment" of elected, university, business and school leaders. The community summit is scheduled for March 7 at a location to be announced later.
"It needs to happen," he said, "but it needs to happen with a concerted and collective action."
Behind the numbers Florida Chamber's chief economist Jerry Parrish is in high demand with local leaders.
They want to hear his take on Leon County, especially compared to the state. He's been contacted numerous times to present information to groups, including the Leon County Commission in May, and has appointments lined up with individual elected officials.
Parrish said the 32304's poverty picture is based on Census information. It doesn't include college students who live on campus, such as dorms. But it includes any resident who lives at or below the poverty level.
"If you're in a dorm, you're not in the poverty. If you're a college student who is less than the federal level, you're counted as poverty," Parrish said.
Still, this zip code's rate among children is startling. For two years, Parrish said he's been part of the state's drumbeat to expose what's happening in communities and how it impacts Florida's workforce in the future.
"We aren't nearly the highest poverty rate in Leon County, but these kids need a chance. We need to help them get a chance to get them out of poverty," Parrish said.
Many elected and business leaders agree an action plan is warranted. And, at least one resident, an environmental engineer with no 32304 ties, wants to help.
Last month, Bart Bibler shared his commitment during a County Commission meeting. He talked about his concept iHOPEinc, which stands for Hub of Public Engagement.
It's a web-based business under development acting as a clearinghouse for demographics, information and events tied toward improving race relations and crime prevention.
"It's one place people can go to get engaged," Bibler said. "It's just an important issue to me. If we can get this right, we can get the other things right."
Bibler isn't new to taking on big issues. When he was a state land management plan coordinator for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, he lost his job after refusing to remove "climate change" from a report in 2015.
He hopes his concept could complement Proctor's summit and ongoing community efforts. He said the idea is to get something started and allow experts to weigh in.
Proctor welcomes the offer. He said the 32304 zip code is like the Titanic.
"Mr. Bibler is riding by with a boat. I'm going to get on it, and I encouraged everyone on the Titanic to get on it," Proctor said.
The District 1 commissioner wonders what kind of additional evidence the community needs to act. In 2015, the New York Times said Leon County ranked among the worst counties in the United States in helping poor children move up on the income ladder. "It ranks 329th out of 2,478 counties, better than only 13percent of counties," the article stated.
Since then other reports paint a picture of struggling families in Leon County.
The United Way of the Big Bend released its 2017 report on the "working poor" population, also known as Asset Limited, Income Constrained Employed or ALICE. The report said 1 in 2 residents in the Big Bend area struggles to meet basic needs.
The ALICE population grew from 41 percent in 2017 to 43 percent in 2018, according to the latest report released Wednesday.
The situation is getting worse.
Leaders debate how to best help Some local leaders say they're willing to talk more about the challenges, but they want to do it in the most effective way possible.
Other say more details are needed to understand what steps to take next.
The summit's success lies in the "tone and the tenor," said Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare President and CEO Mark O'Bryant, who chairs the Tallahassee Chamber's Board of Directors.
O'Bryant said change will happen if decision makers and the community band together.
"Are people going into it with the mindset that this is going to be a constructive dialogue or are people wanting to go into it just to whine and complain," he said. "If it's a constructive dialogue, I think it could be very effective, because it puts it out there and lays out the problems."
While he didn't know the specifics of the Proctor-driven summit, Tallahassee Mayor John Dailey said he supports the general idea of a community response to addressing serious issues.
"We all need to come together and truly address these challenges," Dailey said. "If we're really going to make a difference and move the needle, it's going to take all of our commitment."
He said that commitment comes with financial resources and a deeper dive at what this zip code is facing, along with what services are and aren't being provided.
Dailey said he'd be interested to know whether there's a need for a strategic community plan to address childhood poverty and childhood hunger.
County Commission Nick Maddox said he could support more collective conversations.
"I'm not at all in favor of having a summit just to have a summit. But if we are really going to have a summit going, it has to create outcomes and synergy," Maddox said. "There's a sense of urgency to have outcomes. I don't care how we get to it. But we need outcomes."
County Commissioner Rick Minor, executive director of the Second Harvest of the Big Bend, has a front row seat to the community's hunger needs. Many of his clients live in the 32304 zip code.
He urges residents in the zip code to be a part of the summit discussion.
"The folks who live in 32304 and other parts of Leon County, they are going to know the needs of their area more than anyone else," Minor said. "I want to have a robust dialogue with the community leaders and residents who are in a position to help. It impresses upon me the urgency that we need to get something done."
City Commissioner Curtis Richardson, who attended the Chamber's annual breakfast event in October, said he didn't know what to make of the zip code's status.
It was the first time he'd heard it was the poorest in the state. He questions whether college students, who aren't generating an income, are skewing the outlook of what's taking place in the 32304 zip code.
"If they are including the students in those income figures, there might be a misrepresentation there," he said. "We need to figure out what is causing that. I think more information needs to be gathered. It's certainly an issue that needs to be looked in to."

Kamala Harris tests CNN's campaign

CNN’s recent “Town Hall,” featuring fast-rising Sen. Kamala Harris, was moderately helpful in assessing the California freshman’s presidential candidacy, but far more useful in evaluating what television must do in the critically important 2020 race.
Host Jake Tapper promised that this would be the first of many such made-for-CNN events. Indeed, with a crowded field of Democratic contenders, many of whom are new to the national scene, an hour of prime-time can go a long way toward educating voters.
Or not. CNN chose the campus of Drake University in Des Moines as the setting for its program because, as Tapper explained, “The all-important Iowa caucuses are just over one year away.” That’s a distinction that might work for Iowans but which, at this stage, is lost on voters in 49 other states.
The audience was described by Tapper as “people who tell us they plan to caucus with the Democrats next year and members of the Drake University community.” Translation: A friendly crowd capable of fairly soft, straight-from-the-playbook questions, such as: “What would you plan to do to make America safer (for minorities)?” And, “What is the first thing you would do as president of the United States?”
Even the toughest question, about Harris’s record as a prosecutor, was presented without teeth. Moreover, although Tapper made a token effort to follow up, he did not challenge Harris as many critics have in recent weeks.
Writing in The New York Times, law professor Lara Bazelon noted that, “Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state’s attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent.”
For her part, Harris was engaging, even charismatic, but her answers often went too long, and Tapper never once interrupted. Without any meaningful pushback, Harris was left to glide along with boilerplate answers.
Perhaps CNN would argue that such introductory gatherings are intended to give candidates a forum to lay out their positions without the rigors of an actual debate — or even the stress of a Sunday talk show.
Frankly, the entire Town Hall format is too gimmicky. Since audience questions are carefully screened by producers ahead of time, and their order predetermined, what’s the point? The forum would be far more useful if multiple hosts questioned the guest — with perhaps a fairly brief audience segment at the end.
It’s a long, some would say excruciating trek to Election Day 2020. Many people believe it’s far too early to pay close attention to an over-crowded field slugging it out in an overly long campaign.
Then again, the stakes couldn’t be higher. CNN is in a unique position — without the clear conservative bias of FOX, or the overt liberal leaning of MSNBC — to inform viewers about the candidates and issues.
Viewers seem to agree, with nearly 2 million watching the CNN program, the most ever for a single-candidate event of this kind.
Kamala Harris will undoubtedly grow as the campaign moves forward. CNN must as well.

Texto completo: Headnote Experts Address Gun Violence in U.S. and Need for Policy Changes
In an era where drive-by attacks, police-involved shootings and random mass murders, due to their unprecedented frequency, have led a growing number of citizens to a state of apathy, a series of panel discussions held on the campus of Howard University in Northwest invoked emotional reactions, personal testimonies and a host of recommendations related to changing the current landscape.
With the theme "Triggered: The Power of Guns, Law and Politics," the third annual C. Clyde Ferguson Jr. Symposium, hosted by the Howard University School of Law and the Howard Human and Civil Rights Review, fostered conversation on the development and implementation of strategies and legislation that could provide a pathway to greater safety in Americas cities and communities.
Keynote speaker Rep. Robin Kelly (D-IL 2nd district) joined legal experts, politicians, student activists and a vocal audience as they explored the meaning behind the second amendment, addressed the realities of gun-related violence today and provided reasons for more stringent gun laws and policies in the U.S.
Panelists included: Aalayah Eastmond, student activist and senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglass High School; Lord Ja-mar, recording artist, producer and activist; Zion Kelly, student activist; and Harold McDougall, professor of law.
The morning panel, moderated by rap artist Rah Digga, focused on the concept of "human hierarchy" and the proliferation of and possible explanations for unprovoked mass shootings that continue to occur in common spaces, including public schools, in America. One teenaged participant, Aalayah, a survivor of the Parkland shooting that resulted in the death of 17 students, pointed out that the gunman had been a victim of repeated bullying and wondered if its emotional impact may have been the impetus for his deadly rampage.
McDougall explained the concept of "human hierarchy" as described in the New York Times best-selling book "Queen Bees and Wannabees," written by parenting educator Rosalind Wiseman that served as the basis for the popular teen movie "Mean Girls." McDougall said bullying plays a dominant role during adolescence, existing within a hierarchy that includes "winners and losers."
In comedic fashion, Rah Digga referred to her formative years when both bullies and the in crowd co-existed. Best known for her membership in the Busta Rhymes-created group, FlipMode Squad, she's now a blog commentator with Lord Jamar who's part of the popular rap group Brand Nubian. Lord Jamar chimed in asserting that today's youth, including millennials, have become too "soft" and that being bullied makes one stronger. Before the session's conclusion, Aalayah had been brought to tears.
Briana Thompson, a third-year law student and member of the group that organized the event described its purpose.
"One of the goals of the program was to have a panel comprised of people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives to facilitate a much-needed, realistic discussion on gun violence in today's society," she said. "There are generational gaps that cannot be ignored. Back in the day, bullying ended at the school; now bullying continues online."
Aalayah pointed out that while Parkland employs nine security guards, the school only has three counselors, illustrating a use of financial resources that she believes should be reconsidered.
Other sessions included a panel that discussed the recently-formed gun violence prevention movement and the impact of that violence on public health. One conservative politician, Liz Matory approached the conversation from the perspective of a gun rights advocate. One litigator from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Jonathan Lowy called for greater gun control while a community advocate, Wilson Santos, spoke about the necessity for more intentional for violence prevention strategies within black and brown communities.
Second-year law student James Walker said bringing different voices to the table needs to be facilitated more often so that information can be shared.
Thompson agreed.
"We hope the program provided a platform for the community to see the different perspectives in our society in a way that can help initiate a conversation on how we can come together to eradicate gun violence," she said.

Texto completo: Of all the millions of people who have spit into a plastic vial and sent their DNA off to have it analyzed, writer Dani Shapiro might be the most prepared for what happened next.
The core of Shapiro’s work — this bestselling author has written 10 books — has always concerned family issues, those tangled emotional webs we weave around each other and the secrets we keep.
“It has been a huge part of what formed me as a writer — I had an obsession with searching and digging, trying to understand,” Shapiro says, noting that half of her books are memoirs about deep, personal exploration. “I idly wondered why (I kept writing memoirs) but those were the books that continued to present themselves to me as necessary. And that comes very much out of not knowing something and writing in order to try to know.”
Part of what she didn’t know was why, with her fair hair and blue eyes, she barely resembled her parents, both Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe — an otherness remarked upon by people throughout her life.
All is revealed when the results of an Ancestry.com test that she took “on a whim” come back: She is not her beloved father’s biological daughter after all, but the product of artificial insemination her parents turned to when they could not conceive. Why that happened and what meaning Shapiro makes of it is the subject of her riveting new memoir, “Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity, and Love.”
“This discovery poured gasoline over everything I thought I knew and threw a match on it,” she says. “Now I see the whole picture.”
Since its release in January, the book has quickly risen to the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction and has already been optioned by Hollywood, a clear indication that both her writing and the topic of family secrets is speaking to the hearts of millions.
“I certainly wanted it to resonate with people who had been through similar experiences or discovered there were family secrets —everybody seems to have them,” said Shapiro in a phone interview while she was on the road for her national book tour that lands in Southern California for several appearances this week.
“Adoptees, people who discover they were donor conceived, or have half siblings — there are so many of those kinds of secrets tumbling out of the closet right now,” she observes.
More like an avalanche.
She notes that in 2018 alone 7 million Ancestry.com kits were purchased — and that doesn’t take into account what might be sold for other commercial DNA services like 23andMe. (DNA kits were the No. 1 holiday gift last year, too.) Shapiro discovered while researching “Inheritance” that out of the 7 million kits, 14 percent revealed what’s known in that industry as ”NPE,” Not Parent Expected: “That’s a huge number of people. Many of them, like me, were just recreational DNA testing.”
The ease and accessibility of these DNA tests herald a historical shift, she believes. “I think this is a moment in our culture when secrets and the impossibility of secrets is reaching a deafening roar,” Shapiro observes. “Paternity, ethnicity — these were secrets people could keep since the beginning of time, and did. And now that is over. I think in a few decades the idea that there ever were these secrets is going to seem like the most ridiculous thing you’d ever heard.”
Yet the exploration she undertakes in this book is even more universal: At the center is the question: How do heredity and history combine to make us who we are?
Says Shapiro: “I was also very aware that I did not only want people that could directly relate to the material to be readers of this book, because I felt I had learned so much in this really sort of harsh and complicated, and ultimately liberating, journey. I learned so much about identity, and family, and what makes a father a father, and about nature and nurture.”
Anyone who knows Shapiro’s work understands that she was close to her father, who died in an accident when she was 23, and distant from her abusive mother. These are themes that have run throughout her work. Reconciling her experience with her biological makeup was the “emotionally challenging” part of her journey to write this book.
“One of the things I had to contend with was the deep suspicion that I was part of my father’s sadness. The man that I tried so hard to make happy. But I don’t think that diminished in any way the love he had for me,” she says. “The irony is my biological parent is the one I felt a deep disconnection from, while my father, who was not my biological parent, was the one to whom I was connected. I think that my mother looked at me for all of our shared life together and found it very challenging because I was her secret. I was a reminder of their infertility; I was not my father’s child and on some very deep animal level, she knew it.”
There’s a moment in “Inheritance” where a friend tells her, “Everyone feels other,” and that she had been the explorer to come back to teach us all something about what that means. “I very much took that to heart,” she says.

The American Dream Remains Deferred for Black Millennials

Texto completo: The American Dream is described as a national ethos: a set of ideals in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, and upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers.
That's the Wikipedia definition.
For African American millennials, the dream remains deferred - and in some cases, is a nightmare.
"The American Dream, the idea that anyone can succeed through hard work, is one of the most enduring myths in this country. And one of its most prominent falsehoods," Reniqua Allen, the author of "It Was All a Dream" wrote in a recent New York Times Op-Ed.
"As I entered my 30s, still navigating what achieving the dream would mean, I wondered what other black millennials were feeling. I wanted to figure out what my generation of Black Americans thought about the promise of the American dream and how we can attain it," Allen said.
Keli Hammond, the owner and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based B Classic Marketing & Communications and author of "Craved: the Secret Sauce to Building a Highly-Successful, Standout Brand," said Black millennials have an uphill climb to achieve the American Dream.
"Unfortunately, this is a very true reality. Race is a touchy subject in this country - always has been, always will be," Hammond said. "It's funny because, even thought it's part of our social construct, it's still incredibly uncomfortable when it's talked about."
Hammond, who holds a bachelor's degree in Advertising from Temple University and a certification in Change Leadership from Cornell University, noted that race has a way of humbling dreams quite fast.
"Although I believe that millennials in general are struggling to identify with the American Dream, for Black millennials it can often feel like a dream you can't achieve," she said.
"We weren't afforded the same job opportunities or raises, we don't have the same networks, we're not given the same leeway if we make a mistake, and we don't have the same access to capital or generational wealth - it's hard every day," Hammond said.
In a survey customized exclusively for NNPA Newswire, Branded Research asked 452 African Americans which aspect of the American Dream is most important.
A total of 30 percent said having a comfortable retirement; 21 percent said homeownership; 21 percent said setting up their children for success; 15 percent said owing a business; 7 percent said a college education; and 6 percent said having a nuclear family.
When broken down by gender, 22 percent of men and 34 percent of women said having a comfortable retirement was most important.
Twenty-two percent of men identified homeownership as most important as compared with 21 percent of women.
When broken down by age, 24 percent of those between 18 and 24 identified setting up their children for success was most important and 21 percent of the same age group said having a comfortable retirement and owning a business is paramount.
Twenty-eight percent of African Americans between 25 and 34 identified home ownership as most important followed by setting up their children for success (27 percent); and having a comfortable retirement (19 percent).
Overall, African American consumers are most likely to say that the most important aspects of the American Dream are having a comfortable retirement, homeownership and setting children up for success.
African American women are more likely than African American men to say that having a comfortable retirement is the most important aspect of the American Dream.
Younger African Americans value homeownership, setting up children for success and owning a business while older African Americans value a comfortable retirement most.
"The American Dream isn't what I strive for [because] my goal is to be successful in my chosen creative path of singing and to travel the world doing that - not to be tethered to a job I don't like, to pay a mortgage I don't want in order to live permanently anywhere," said New York musician Risa Branch.
"I finally paid off my student loans. I want the freedom to be wherever I want to be," Branch said.
"If I did get the surplus funds to buy a house, I'd rent it out and use the investment to fund a more mobile lifestyle."
Hammond argued that Black millennials want equality, opportunity and freedom. "We want the same business and home loans, we want the same job offers, we want the same - everything," she said.
"I'm college-educated, well-read, and well-traveled. I'm a business owner and a homeowner, and even with all of that, I'm keenly aware that I am still very much an underdog," Hammond continued.
"Freedom means you don't struggle financially or live paycheck-to-paycheck. Freedom means you're able to relax sometimes and not worry about all the ways that you have to work to dispel racial myths and stereotypes."

Jill Abramson: 'I certainly didn’t plagiarize in my book'

Texto completo: Former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson was defiant in the face of plagiarism allegations Wednesday.

Abramson, who was abruptly fired from the legacy newspaper in 2014, has been promoting her new book Merchants of Truth . But her book, providing insight into the business of news, was ripped on Wednesday by multiple accusations she had either made serious errors or had included similar phrases to other works.

“All I can tell you is I certainly didn’t plagiarize in my book, and there’s 70 pages of footnotes showing where I got the information," Abramson said during an interview with Fox News.

She said she stood by what she had written and dismissed the idea that perhaps there had been an issue with her referencing. Instead, Abramson suggested the "many people from Vice have been taking issue with the book" because "they don’t like the portrayal of Vice" in it.

Michael Moynihan, Vice News Tonight on HBO correspondent, was one of Abramson's first critics.

“I think it’s a very balanced portrait, and I have a lot of praise for some of their journalists and some of their stories. I like their fresh approach to news," she said.

After her appearance on Fox News, Abramson tweeted a more conciliatory message.

"I take seriously the issues raised and will review the passages in question," she wrote.

Another critic, Ian Frisch, claimed Abramson had copied his own book Magic is Dead "at least seven times," sharing excerpts comparing the infringing passages.

"I'm just...I don't know. Devastated? This is just crazy. I'm just showing these screenshots so people know. I have articles to write and a book coming out in three weeks, so I have bigger shit to worry about. But shame on you, Jill. Shame on you," he wrote.

Abramson's publisher, Simon & Schuster, called the book "exhaustively researched and meticulously sourced" in a statement issued Wednesday night. The company stopped short of pushing back on the plagiarism allegations, however, saying, "If upon further examination changes or attributions are deemed necessary we stand ready to work with the author in making those revisions."

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — It's been widely reported that the Utah Jazz have been working on a deal with the Memphis Grizzlies to acquire point guard Mike Conley, but those negotiations may have hit a snag.
According to ESPN's Brian Windhorst and The New York Times' Marc Stein, Conley has indicated he does not want to get traded to the Jazz.




Ricky Rubio and Derrick Favors would be at least part of the package Utah would send to Memphis to acquire the 31-year-old Conley.


As Stein indicated, Conley would have to join the Jazz if the Grizzlies chose to make that deal. Utah and the Detroit Pistons have been reported as the two teams most in the running to acquire Conley ahead of Thursday afternoon's trade deadline.

Texto completo: "I believe it is important for us as an organization to provide opportunities for students to hear dialogue from and interact directly with people like Howard Schultz, so we jumped on the opportunity. As someone who is passionate about entrepreneurship and business, Howard Schultz is someone who I've admired in regards to those two categories. I'm interested to hear his thoughts on politics and his potential role in them in the future."
Aaron Banks,
Purdue's student body president,
adding Schultz's team reached out this week
to Purdue Student Government, which will sponsor the visit Thursday
WEST LAFAYETTE – Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks, will be at Purdue University Thursday to make what The Washington Post reported would be "a major policy address" leading up to the possibility that he might make an independent run for president.
Purdue President Mitch Daniels on Tuesday morning confirmed that Schultz would be on campus Thursday. Daniels told the J&C that Schultz reached out to Purdue about the event.
The talk will be at 1 p.m. Thursday in Fowler Hall, a 388-seat venue in Purdue's Stewart Center. Seating will be limited "to invited and ticketed members of the university's governance councils," according to Tim Doty, a Purdue spokesman.
A livestream of the talk will be shown in Loeb Playhouse, which is down the hall in Purdue's Stewart Center and has 1,038 seats.
The format for the event — lecture, Q&A with Daniels or straight-up rally — wasn't immediately specified by Purdue or Schultz's team.
Schultz has been a center of attention after saying he was considering an independent bid in 2020. Some Democrats have blasted his strategy of going for moderate voters, saying that a third-party candidacy would siphon votes from a Democratic nominee and help President Donald Trump win re-election.
In the past week, Schultz has criticized both Trump and candidates lining up on the left, insisting that he could win the White House by going for American voters disaffected by the partisan fighting from both sides.
"I am certainly prepared for the cynics and the naysayers to come out and say this cannot be done," Schultz told The New York Times. "I don't agree with them. I think it's un-American to say it can't be done. I'm not doing this to be a spoiler."
Trump went after Schultz after "60 Minutes" aired a profile of billionaire on Jan. 27.
"Howard Schultz doesn't have the 'guts' to run for President!" Trump tweeted. "Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the 'smartest person.' Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!"
Over the weekend, on CNN, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat said to be considering a run in 2020, called an independent run by Schultz "an enormous mistake."
"He has had a successful legacy as a businessperson," Inslee said on CNN, "and it would be tarnished beyond imagination if he does the only thing that his candidacy would do would be to help the re-election of Donald Trump."
Bill Burton, a spokesman for Schultz, told The Washington Post leading up to the Purdue visit: "Howard burst onto the scene in a way that no one anticipated, and now that a majority of Americans know who is he is, he is laying out some of his ideas and prescriptions for the greatest problems facing our country."
Aaron Banks, Purdue's student body president, said Schultz's team reached out this week to Purdue Student Government, which will sponsor the visit Thursday.
"I believe it is important for us as an organization to provide opportunities for students to hear dialogue from and interact directly with people like Howard Schultz, so we jumped on the opportunity," Banks said. "As someone who is passionate about entrepreneurship and business, Howard Schultz is someone who I've admired in regards to those two categories. I'm interested to hear his thoughts on politics and his potential role in them in the future."
There's another connection to Purdue, or at least to Daniels.
When asked at week ago by a reporter from Axios to name a Republican he admired, Schultz mentioned Daniels, who was a two-time Republican governor in Indiana before he came to Purdue in January 2013.
In September 2016, Daniels hosted a Q&A at Purdue with Gary Johnson, former New Mexico governor who was making a presidential run as a Libertarian. During the 2016 campaign, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders also held a campaign event at Purdue ahead of Indiana's May primary.

Texto completo: Hours before the State of the Union address in which he urged Congress to "reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution" and embrace cooperation and compromise, President Donald Trump rekindled his long-running feud with Sen. John McCain, more than five months after the veteran Arizona Republican died.
Trump's attack on the late 2008 Republican presidential nominee, who died Aug. 25 at age 81, came during a Tuesday lunch hosted for television news anchors, where Trump mostly targeted Democratic leaders.
But, according to a published report, Trump also revisited McCain's famous thumbs-down vote that derailed a Trump-backed Republican health-care effort and saved the Affordable Care Act in 2017. It was a major point of contention between Trump and McCain.
"By the way, he wrote a book and the book bombed," the New York Times reported Trump as saying of McCain.
McCain's daughter, Meghan McCain of ABC's "The View," took to Twitter to rebuke the president for his latest shot at her dad.
"The president's obsession with my father 6 months after his death is pathetic and telling," she said in a Twitter message.

Texto completo: The State of the Union address is an elaborate form of political gamesmanship. Members of Congress trot out guests who will help them make a point, good or bad, about the president's agenda, and vice versa.
When we asked readers whom they would invite to the address on Tuesday, we heard from many liberals who described their fantasies of inviting guests to rebuke President Trump.
Some people came up repeatedly: Christine Blasey Ford, Colin Kaepernick and immigrants whose families were separated at the border. Readers also chose personal heroes and people whom they had encountered while engaging in political activity.
Here are some of their answers, which have been condensed and edited for clarity.
Colin Kaepernick
Colin Kaepernick, because we need to shine a spotlight on racial inequality in America. It can't be brushed under the shiny hood of so-called respect for the flag. Real respect means striving for the ideal of true equality.
-- Sophia Naz, Glen Ellen, Calif.
Colin Kaepernick is an unwavering voice for racial justice. He has been a phenomenal example of putting principles before personal gain. And I think it would make a lot of the G.O.P. very uncomfortable.
-- Jennifer Armstrong, Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
A representative for Jamal Khashoggi
I would invite the fiancée of Jamal Khashoggi to point directly to the Trump administration's refusal to hold Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, responsible for Khashoggi's murder.
-- William Johnston, Higganum, Conn.
I would hold up a massive picture of Jamal Khashoggi, front and center, to show the president how he has failed and continues to fail America and American citizens.
-- Peggy White, Ypsilanti, Mich.
Immigrants
An undocumented immigrant to the United States from El Salvador or Guatemala who has been the victim of gang violence, to demonstrate the humanity of these people and how the United States should be a land of refuge.
-- Joe Waks, Bayonne, N.J.
A baby separated from her or his parents at the border, to remind everyone of that cruelty, and that reunification is not happening quickly.
-- Sharon M. Anderson, Great Falls, Mont.
Jussie Smollett
Jussie Smollett because he was singled out as a victim in a hate crime combining hatred of his skin color with hatred of his sexual orientation. I'd like to draw attention to the unacceptable hatred that is seething in this country.
-- Jim Arnold, Los Angeles
I would invite Jussie Smollett as a concrete, human reminder that racism and homophobia are alive and well in our country and have violent consequences for L.G.T.B.Q. people of color. Feeling safe on the streets should not be a privilege. It should be a right, one that is defended vehemently by the president at all times for all people.
-- Trish Vawter, Portland, Ore.
An expert on environmental health
Ruth Etzel, the former director of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Children's Health Protection and a world-renowned expert on environmental health, whom the Trump administration placed on administrative leave with pay.
Dr. Etzel's team was getting ready to release new, stricter lead guidelines to protect children. Children will continue to suffer.
-- Kathy King, Stillwater, Minn.
A former prisoner
I would invite one of the people who have been unjustly placed in prison for decades and have had their verdicts overturned because of the work of the Equal Justice Initiative, so they could see, face-to-face, the people who appoint federal judges and who have sworn to work for justice in our country.
-- Barbara Ann Brothers, Staunton, Va.
Christine Blasey Ford
I would invite Christine Blasey Ford because she had great courage, and I know she was telling the truth. She stood up to power and still does. She is a true hero.
-- Christine Williams, San Jose, Calif.
I cannot fathom the strength it takes to tell the entire world about something as deeply personal as sexual assault. She gave a voice to people everywhere who have faced abuse at the hands of those in power, and because of that she is an American hero.
-- Emerson Ellis, Austin, Tex.
A survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting
David Hogg or Emma González (both survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February 2018).
It would be a positive message by young people who are risking their lives and reputations by going public, and doing something about pervasive gun violence in America.
-- Don Reeck, Whitmore Lake, Mich.
The kids from the Parkland high school shooting. They moved the country to think about weapons sales.
-- Ana Tomassini, Chile
The publisher of The New York Times
A. G. Sulzberger! Support the free press and the next generation.
-- Elizabeth Greer, Seattle
Cardi B
Cardi B was a superstar during the government shutdown with her viral tweets and videos. She's passionate about American politics, specifically presidential history. Plus she is a badass who would bring some spunk to the usually boring political affair!
-- Vince Cefali, Chicago

Texto completo: White House Roundup
NEW YORK - Federal prosecutors in New York issued a subpoena Monday seeking documents from Donald Trump's inaugural committee, furthering a federal inquiry into a fund that has faced mounting scrutiny into how it raised and spent its money.
The Wall Street Journal, citing a copy of the subpoena, reported that prosecutors asked for "all documents" related to the committee's donors and vendors, as well as records relating to "benefits" donors received after making contributions.
The newspaper reported late last year that federal prosecutors are investigating whether committee donors made contributions in exchange for political favors - a potential violation of federal corruption laws. It said the inquiry also was focused on whether the inauguration misspent the $107 million it raised to stage events celebrating Trump's inauguration.
The subpoena also requested documents relating to donations "made by or on behalf of foreign nationals, including but not limited to any communications regarding or relating to the possibility of donations by foreign nationals," the Journal reported.
The New York Times reported late last year that federal prosecutors are examining whether anyone from Qatar, Saudi Arabia or other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee.

Relaxed abortion rules portend the dehumanization of us all

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.
Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s.
This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus," or, even, a "product of termination" — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Texto completo: Against the backdrop of the recent government shutdown and the push for a border wall by President Donald Trump, the State of the Union guest list of Connecticut's congressional delegation will highlight several major areas of discord between Democrats and Republicans.
Among those invited to Washington, D.C., for Trump's prime-time speech Tuesday is the head of a nonprofit behavioral health services agency that provides shelter and other services to children separated from their families at the border.
Regina Moller, executive director of Noank Community Support Services, will be the guest of U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose office is seeking to draw attention to the impact of the partial government shutdown on agencies like NCSS.
Federal funding to a youth homeless shelter run by the organization was cut off during the 35-day shutdown, according to Murphy's office.
"I'm so glad she is joining me at the State of the Union to shed light on how President Trump's border policies are traumatizing a generation of children and how the recent government shutdown affected Connecticut," Murphy said. "Regina's organization takes care of child refugees, kids who are feeling the violence and trauma of places like Ecuador and Guatemala and see the United States as a country that can save their lives. These kids aren't threats to our security, they are our future leaders, and I hope my colleagues will realize this as Regina tells these children's stories when she comes to Washington,"
Connecticut's other senator, Richard Blumenthal, is bringing Vietnam veteran Gerry Wright of Andover, who was exposed to Agent Orange during the war and has become a leading advocate for legislation to help veterans sickened by the toxic substances.
The choice of Wright by Blumenthal, a member of the Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services committees, follows a string of Twitter insults by Trump against the senator over his military service flap.
In 2010, the New York Times reported how Blumenthal had said on multiple occasions during his 20-year tenure as state attorney general that he served in Vietnam.
Blumenthal was a member of the Marine Corps Reserve during the war but remained stateside. He apologized for the mischaracterization, which did little to derail his election to the Senate.
Wright won't be the only State of the Union guest to wear a military uniform.
Rep. Joe Courtney, who represents eastern Connecticut, is bringing Lieutenant Commander Kimberly Young-McLear, of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
A report released in December by the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General determined that Young-McLear was the target of workplace bullying at the Coast Guard Academy because she is black and a lesbian, according to Courtney's office.
"It is unacceptable that talented and compassionate individuals like Kimberly are subjected to toxic and hostile work environments while serving their country," Courtney said. "Moreover, our military service members and civilian employees must have the confidence that when they report workplace bullying and other forms of harassment or discrimination, they will not be subjected to retaliation. I thank Kimberly for her moral courage, integrity, and devotion to duty as a Coast Guardsman."
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who is in her 15th term, will bring Deirdre Daly, the U.S. attorney for Connecticut from 2013 through 2017 and first woman to the hold the post.
Lane Murdock, a 16-year-old Ridgefield High School student who organized a national walkout last year to protest the inaction of Congress on gun control reform, will be the guest of Rep. Jim Himes.
Rep. John Larson, who is in his 10th term and represents the Hartford region, gave his extra ticket away to a GOP colleague, a spokeswoman said.
This will be the first State of the Union for Jahana Hayes, the former National Teacher of the Year and House freshman who represents the north and western parts of the state.
A spokesman for Hayes did not respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Lawmakers heard hours of passionate testimony Monday about obscenity, literature and censorship as they considered a proposal to require teachers to notify parents or students before utilizing sexually explicit materials in classrooms.
Bill sponsor Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata, R-New Gloucester, and her supporters said parents as well as students should have the opportunity to opt out of reading or viewing "obscene materials." Yet opponents pointed out that parents can already formally challenge a book's usage with the local school board and compared Arata's bill to previous attempts to ban works now considered classics of literature.
"Who is going to decide what is obscene? Who is going to police this law in all of our schools across this state?" asked Cathy Potter, a librarian in Falmouth's public schools. "And are you prepared to prosecute librarians and teachers for putting books in the hands of our students ... because this would make it a crime."
As an example of "the pornographic nature of materials being assigned to students in Maine," Arata distributed excerpts from "Kafka on the Shore," which was assigned to her son in the 12th grade. The 2002 book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami has won critical acclaim - including landing on The New York Times' Top 10 list for 2005 - but contains some explicit descriptions of sexual activity as well as rape.
As originally written, Arata's bill proposed that public schools be removed from the list of institutions - such as libraries or museums - that are exempt from the law prohibiting the dissemination of obscene materials to minors. That proposal garnered vociferous pushback from educators and others who recalled the moral policing that once led schools or entire states to ban literary classics such as "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Of Mice and Men" and "Catcher in the Rye."
In response, Arata amended her bill to instead require teachers to provide written notice that the book or other materials contained obscene content or depictions of sexual assault. Both the students and their parents/legal guardians would need to provide written consent prior to receiving the materials.
"This common-sense bipartisan bill will give minors and parents the respect and dignity of choosing what is appropriate for them and their family so that they do not have to feel embarrassed, harassed or traumatized," Arata said. She said the bill "will help make sure that all Maine schools are safe and nurturing environments for our children."
Supporters the Christian Civic League of Maine, pastors and parents, as well as several survivors of sexual assault warned that graphic depictions or descriptions could further traumatize children who are victims themselves. Others objected to teachers' selection of certain movies with objectionable material in their classroom curriculum.
Jennifer White of Gray said her then 11-year-old daughter was confused after watching a film in class that included both sexual content and depictions of a man committing suicide with a gun.
"Showing a movie with that type of graphic content and sexually explicit material can cause harm to a child that is not mature enough to handle it, and fifth grade is not mature enough to handle that," White said. "This is one example of how L.D. 94 can better provide transparency to both children and families."
But teachers, librarians and associations representing Maine's school boards and superintendents urged lawmakers to reject a bill that would make it a criminal offense for teachers to teach literary texts that some perceive as obscene.
"The problem is that what is obscene to one person or group may be judged to have artistic or social merit to another," said Claudette Brassil, a retired English teacher representing the Maine Council for English Language Arts. "Criminalization of literary choices is a detriment to academic freedom. As in the past, contemporary community standards continue to evolve and are influenced by many forces."
Brassil, a Brunswick resident who taught at Mt. Ararat High School in Topsham, testified that literary works can sometimes provide a platform for students to talk about violence or sexual situations with adults. She also said that she believes children are becoming more willing to speak up to trusted individuals - including teachers - when they are victims of abuse.
Opponents also said the bill was unnecessary because school boards in Maine already have a process through which members of the public can challenge the suitability of educational materials and request a formal review. In fact, Arata used that process to successfully challenge the use of "Kafka on the Shore" in her children's schools.
"This is a decision that I believe is best handled locally with your school board - people who you elect and most likely represent, as a group, the norms in your community," said Victoria Wallack, representing both the Maine School Boards Association and the Maine Schools Superintendents Association. "That is where I would go first. I wouldn't be here at the Legislature trying to change educational policy that is rightfully adopted ... by the school board."
The Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee is expected to hold a work session on L.D. 94 next Monday.

Texto completo: At least 18 have been dismissed in N.Y. and N.J. in past two months
President Trump's company has fired at least 18 undocumented workers from five golf courses in New York and New Jersey in the past two months, part of a purge set in motion after a series of reports about the clubs' employment of workers without legal status.
Eric Trump, the president's son, confirmed the firings to The Washington Post on Monday. Those dismissed included three undocumented workers at the Trump National Golf Club Colts Neck near Montrose, N.J., and three more at the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia in Pine Hill, N.J.
Another was dismissed from Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley in Hopewell Junction, N.Y., Eric Trump said. Eric and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., have day-to-day control of the Trump Organization.
The Washington Post could not independently verify Eric Trump's figures. There have also been firings at the Trump course in Bedminster, N.J., which his son did not address.
The Post previously reported a purge of about a dozen undocumented workers at Trump's club in Westchester, N.Y., representing half the club's winter staff. Eric Trump on Monday put the number fired at 11.
It was unclear how seasonal employees expected to return to the clubs for the spring or summer would be affected.
The wave of dismissals raises questions about how widely the president's company has relied on undocumented workers, even as he has denounced illegal immigration in fiery terms and demanded the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The president has suggested that if Congress does not give him money for a border wall, he may declare a national emergency. Trump said Friday, "I think there's a good chance we'll have to do that."
The firings were a result of an internal audit by the Trump Organization after a New York Times article in December identified undocumented housekeepers at the Trump golf course in Bedminster.
The Trump Organization said these workers presented false documents when they were hired.
"We are making a broad effort to identify any employee who has given false and fraudulent documents to unlawfully gain employment," Eric Trump said in a statement last month. "Where identified, any individual will be terminated immediately."
Juan Quintero, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who has worked at the club now known as Trump Hudson Valley for about 18 years, said he was among those fired.
Quintero, 42, said he was a teenager when he left his hometown of Valle de Chalco, outside Mexico City, and slipped across the border to seek his fortune in the United States.
He eventually found steady work mowing fairways and tending greens at the course, he said, and raised four children in the United States.
Last month, a Trump Organization executive told him he could no longer work there, Quintero said.
"Half of my life," he said. "And now nothing."
Former employees say the number of undocumented workers employed at these courses is probably larger than the firings reflect because labor is seasonal at many golf courses. Maintenance and other employees often leave their jobs in late fall and return when the courses reopen in the spring, leaving only a fraction of employees to work through the winter.
Some seasonal employees contacted by The Post who weren't technically fired said they expected they would not be rehired in the spring.
The fired employees interviewed by The Post were from Latin America.
They worked in food service, maintenance, housekeeping and other jobs at the golf courses. Many said they had held these jobs for years and that the Trump Organization previously had paid little attention to their immigration status.
The workers interviewed said they got their jobs by presenting false Social Security and green cards. Many said their supervisors were aware the documents were fraudulent.
Quintero said he was warned by a supervisor that news of undocumented workers at Trump properties might mean trouble for him.
"He said, 'Right now, there's a big problem,' " Quintero recalled. "He told me to look for another job."
Weeks later, Quintero said, he met with the Trump Organization official who told him he was fired.
On Jan. 18, a Trump Organization human resources executive visited the Trump golf club in Westchester County, N.Y., and summoned about a dozen workers, one by one, into meetings, in a wave of firings first reported by The Post.
The executive told them an audit had revealed that their documents were not genuine and that they should leave the premises.

The Trump Organization said last week it would start using the E-Verify electronic system to check the immigration status of all of its employees. The system allows employers to check the documents that employees provide against U.S. government records.
Four of the workers from the Bedminster and Westchester courses visited Capitol Hill last week to meet with lawmakers.
Among those they visited was Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), who called on federal authorities Monday to open an investigation into the Trump Organization's golf clubs.
In a letter to FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Menendez said officials should "conduct an appropriate investigation" into the concerns raised by the four ex-employees. He requested that the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, undertake the probe.
"The workers I met with describe a hostile environment where they were verbally abused and threatened," he wrote. "Given the serious nature of these allegations, I request that the FBI/HSI immediately open an investigation regarding the Trump National Golf Clubs."
Menendez also asked that members of the group who remain undocumented be protected from deportation during a possible investigation.
Victorina Morales and Sandra Diaz, two of the workers who met with lawmakers, will attend the president's State of the Union address Tuesday.

Father says death will not define his son

Texto completo: The real, deep grief over his oldest son's passing will set in any day now, but sifting through his dorm room on the University of Iowa campus Friday, Michael Belz said that emotion was pushed aside by the tasks at hand.
Michael and his son's girlfriend waded through Gerald Belz's belongings, searching for items to put in his casket.
The possessions are all that remain of the young man many are quick to describe as compassionate, fiercely driven and tough. The two found the blue cap Gerald wore constantly, but searched for the rosary he kept tucked safely away.
Before Gerald's death, Michael had planned to give the battery in his son's truck a jump on Friday. Instead, he and Gerald's girlfriend searched the vehicle for the missing rosary that afternoon.
Gerald Belz, who would have been 19 next week, was found unresponsive by a police officer outside a campus hall just before 3 a.m. Wednesday, around the time wind chill in Iowa City reached 51 degrees below zero. Belz was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
That morning, Michael Belz received a call notifying him of his oldest son's death.
"Disbelief," Michael said. "I was yelling in the hallway. I think that's what woke my son up, my younger son."
In the wake Gerald's death, Michael was also looking for answers as to why his son was outside at that hour instead of in his dorm room.
"We're kind of looking around to see if we can find any clues that the investigators have overlooked," he said. "Things that might seem out of place or out of the ordinary. It's been a while since I've been down here, so I really didn't know what his room looked like."
Police are attributing his death to exposure to the weather and have said they do not suspect foul play. UI police, as well as Michael Belz, have declined to say anything about the investigation's findings.
Belz is one of at least eight people in the Midwest believed to have died from exposure to cold as the Arctic's polar vortex expanded deep into the United States. But his father wanted Gerald to be remembered for his kind heart, not for the last moments of his life.
In grief and shock, Michael called a local television station just hours after police notified him of his son's death. He wanted to put an end to comments made on the station's Facebook page, where people posted that Gerald was probably intoxicated. In the following two days, he's been filmed three times and fielded questions from The New York Times.
"I'm not that great at public speaking," he told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. "I never wanted to be famous. And this is not the way I would have wanted to be famous if I did."
Michael told reporters that an emergency-room physician said several times there was no sign of alcohol in Gerald's system. But more than that, Michael just wants people to remember his son as he was: bold, caring and full of conviction.
"In many things, he was very mature for his age," he said. "He had a lot of compassion for others. He would put out a quiet, tough image, even for such a small guy that he was."
Gerald is survived by his parents and his younger brother, Andrew. Michael describes his family as "up-and-down" in the aftermath of Gerald's passing. Andrew was initially gung-ho about pulling together photos for Gerald's funeral, but has since become reserved while scanning old pictures.
Several people — more than Michael says he could have expected — have called him or posted online to share memories of Gerald and how the young man affected their lives.
"There's been a lot of memories that have been filed away and not thought of in many years," he said. "Then somebody says something, and it's, 'Oh yeah, I remember that; I remember this.'"
He received one such call as he combed through Gerald's dorm room. Brian White, his son's former football coach and teacher at Kennedy High School in Cedar Rapids, called to reiterate how great Gerald was.
Off the field, classmates describe him as genuine; the type of person who seemed to cast aside assumptions and try to get to know people. Gerald excelled in the classroom, earning enough college credits in high school to be classified as a sophomore during his first year at UI.
But in large part because of his small size, he wasn't a star player on the football field for the Cougars.
His former coaches and teammates said Gerald was one of the hardest working players on the team. In interviews, they said he took his support role seriously, never complaining. He seemed to always smile, even after being knocked down on the scout team in practice.
Gerald typically played in games once the Cougars had a comfortable lead. One such instance lingered in Michael's mind Friday. He kept coming back to the pride he felt when his son nearly blocked a punt.
"If he'd just taken a slightly different angle, he would have gotten it," he said. "That probably would have been his defining moment in his high school football career. I didn't know he had it in him. I knew he was not a great football player, but he put in the effort ... he did the work, and he was getting the results."
Gerald seemed to find a niche after football season wrapped up his senior year at Kennedy. He joined a new rugby team after Michael said coaches recommended him because he was small and quick. When he enrolled at UI, Gerald joined the Cedar Rapids Headhunters, an adult rugby team.
Michael also recalls the pride he and his wife, Sherine, felt when they dropped Gerald off at college. He said it felt like their oldest was headed off to follow his dreams at the school he'd been eyeing for years.
"I think Iowa was the only college on his radar," he said. "I suggested (he) take a look at Iowa State. Take a look at UNI. He wanted to be a doctor, and he wanted to go to the University of Iowa."
Specifically, Gerald wanted to be either a cardiologist or neurosurgeon. Michael thinks he was driven by seeing doctors struggle to diagnose family members with medical issues.
"He wanted to make a difference," Michael said. "He wanted to be the one ... to be able to help other individuals in similar circumstances."
Gerald seemed full of potential. With his passing, though, Michael says he's learning his son has already had a much larger positive impact on those around him than he could have imagined.
"I wish that people know him as a compassionate person," he said. "No matter what comes out in the investigation ... we don't want this to be a defining moment in his life. He was a friend to many more than I was ever aware of."
Michael Belz speaks during an interview on Friday in Iowa City.

Texto completo: This week brings a useful reminder that Facebook is not in the helping-you-keep-in-touch-with-friends business. It's in the ad-selling business - a business that requires data. Lots of data.
Long story short: On Wednesday, Apple shut down a research app Facebook had distributed to some iPhone and iPad users, paying them up to $10 in exchange for downloading the app, and $20 a month to keep it installed. The app allowed Facebook to collect an enormous amount of user data. News coverage has emphasized the privacy aspects of the story, painting the issue principally in terms of good and evil. Apple is again portrayed as the champion of user protection; Facebook, as usual, is the bogeyman, indifferent to the privacy of its users.
Facebook seems clearly to have earned its latest privacy black eye, but it's important not to overstate what's going on here. This is essentially a contract dispute.
Some background. In addition to services that allow companies to distribute software to consumers in the form of apps, Apple also offers something called the Developer Enterprise Program, which provides a certificate that allows distribution of apps to multiple iOS users within a firm, bypassing the App Store. For example, the firm can develop a communications app for internal use and, using the certificate, download it to all employee iPhones and iPads. It can use the same process to share beta versions of potential apps among its in-house researchers.
As first reported by TechCrunch, however, since 2016 Facebook has been using its certificate to offer users the opportunity to participate in a "paid social media research study. The offer, made through ads on Snapchat and Instagram, targeted users between 13 and 35, but was mainly aimed at teens aged 13 to 17. (Parental permission was required before teens could participate.) Those who signed up would receive money in exchange for Facebook's ability to collect browsing history, location data, content of messages and more - including "which apps are on your phone and "how and when you use them.
To install the app, users were not directed to the App Store or Apple's beta-testing system, either of which would have allowed Apple to review the app before it could be installed on consumer devices. Instead, those who signed up for the research program were sent to a Facebook site from which they could download its certificate. That's where the problem arose. The certificate does not permit distribution of apps to users outside the company.
Apple's response, as quoted by TechCrunch, was immediate and harsh: "Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple. Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.
The revocation is no trivial matter. Again, the certificate grants permission for the company to distribute apps internally. With its certificate disabled, Facebook will have to find a workaround.
Still, let's be clear about what constitutes Facebook's "clear breach. The problem isn't the vacuuming up of consumer data. It's that Facebook has done so in a way that violates the terms of the enterprise certificate. Apple's concern about its "users and their data might well be sincere, but this particular dispute isn't about the fact that Facebook collected user data; it's about the way that Facebook collected user data.
That's it. That's the whole case.
I'm not suggesting that what Facebook has done isn't serious. But neither is it the end of user privacy as we know it. Yes, had Facebook sent the app through normal channels, Apple might well never have approved it. And, yes, users who downloaded the app allowed Facebook extraordinary access to their online activity. But users seemed to know what they were getting into - and were also paid for the privilege.
Twenty dollars per month might not sound like a lot to, say, the typical Bloomberg reader. So imagine Facebook instead had promised one free local Uber ride per month. Or a free digital subscription to The New York Times. It turns out that $20 per month can buy a lot.
That's not a defense of Facebook's apparent breach of its agreement with Apple. I'm just suggesting that users who allowed Facebook to install the app on their iPhones were not necessarily being exploited. Freedom to contract doesn't seem terribly high on our list of fundamental values these days, but some of us still insist upon its importance.
As to the misuse of the certificate, I assume the two companies will swiftly work things out. (Google has voluntarily ended a similar program.) The revocation of the certificate is a pain, but in the end it's likely to prove mostly symbolic, a useful weapon in the never-ending public relations war between Apple and Facebook over which cares more about data privacy. The skirmish will be brief, because the two companies need each other. In fact, I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Facebook's enterprise developer certificate has been restored by the time you read these words.
But the contretemps still matters because public image matters. Apple will once more steal a march on Facebook in their continuing privacy wars. Maybe six months from now nobody will remember the details, but people will remember that Facebook goofed on privacy again. The goofs are starting to add up. The company has to reverse this trend. Even when you're the only game in town, sooner or later reputation affects your bottom line.

Texto completo: Book Notes
As part of African American Heritage Month, preacher and author Austin Channing Brown will speak about her book "I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made For Whiteness" at Whitworth University at 7 p.m. Tuesday.
In "I'm Still Here," which was released in May, Brown writes about her journey to "learn what it means to love blackness," while discussing why attempts at racial justice often fail.
Discussing "I'm Still Here" with the Chicago Tribune in May, Brown said she felt like there were a lot of books about the black male experience and wanted black women to feel seen and heard while also uplifting the story of black women who have always been around white spaces.
"I really wanted to uplift that story because we so often feel alone and isolated because there is only a handful of us where we work or worship or volunteer," she said. "So I just wanted to write a book that said: I see you. And I affirm what you're experiencing. You are not alone."
Brown also noted that she wrote "I'm Still Here" for people who are already committed to racial justice as a way to let them know of improvements that still need to be made.
It's not enough to have a black woman on staff or to have 20 percent people of color in your company, she said.
"Good, I'm glad you started, I'm glad you're committed, but we've got to keep going," she said. "So I was trying to paint a picture of what it might look like to keep going without being prescriptive."
The event is free. It'll be in the Robinson Teaching Theatre, Weyerhaeuser Hall at Whitworth, 300 W. Hawthorne Road.
Reading postponed

Texto completo: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock apologized Saturday for not doing more to prevent future workplace sexual harassment by a former aide who later worked in the New York City mayor's office.
In a Medium post, Bullock wrote: "Four years ago I fell short in my role preventing sexual harassment. I'm sorry, and I'm committed to doing better."
Kevin O'Brien, the ex-longtime aide to the governor who worked at the Democratic Governors Association in Washington when Bullock served as chairman of the organization in 2015, was let go by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2018 amid sexual harassment allegations, according to Politico.
More allegations from O'Brien's time at the DGA in 2015 came to light earlier this week in a New York Times report. O'Brien was fired by the DGA in 2015, an action Bullock thought was sufficient to end future harassment at the time, the Associated Press reported.
"I was shocked: This was inconsistent with the person I'd known for seven years and had come to call a friend. I'd never seen him act inappropriately," Bullock wrote in the Medium post. "I'd never heard stories or complaints," adding that the DGA took "quick action" in firing O'Brien.
A spokesperson for de Blasio told AP the mayor did not know about the previous accusations when O'Brien was hired in New York, as nothing was found during a routine background check.
"Last week I learned (O'Brien) had again sexually harassed two women while working in the New York City Mayor's Office," Bullock wrote. "I felt sick and heartbroken. I felt the realization I hadn't done enough."
Bullock added that he should have contacted de Blasio's office about the 2015 allegations, and that he was "wrong and naïve" to not take more action.
"We're on the right path, but we can do more," Bullock wrote about preventing workplace harassment. "I can do more. Creating safe and fair workplaces means we all have the responsibility to speak up and do what's right. That includes me."
The full post can be read here.
"There's no excuse for what I've done. I'm embarrassed and ashamed," O'Brien said in a statement to AP earlier this week. "No one deserves to be treated that way. I've apologized to the people I've hurt and will continue to do so because I am truly sorry."
Bullock is in his final term as Montana governor and has been thought by some to be a potential presidential candidate in 2020.

Was Gold Star Chicago's greatest nightclub?

Texto completo: I don't need F. Scott Fitzgerald to tell me, as he wrote at the end of "The Great Gatsby," "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past," because Monica Eng pleasantly dragged me back into the past when she asked, "What can you tell me about the Gold Star Sardine Bar?"
Eng, who was once a reporter here at the Tribune, came to our offices recently to research a story about the Gold Star for "Curious City," that entertaining and enlightening offering of WBEZ-91.5FM, where she now works. Begun in 2012, Curious City has answered a variety of questions asked by listeners: "How many rats are in Chicago, and why are they here?" "What happened to all of the people who lived in Cabrini-Green?" "Where does our unmistakable and lovable Chicago accent come from?" "Just how many bats live in the Loop? What are their favorite hangouts?"
Since I had often visited the Gold Star during its 1982-1997 lifetime, I was a logical person to consult for this particular question, which was asked by a man named Dion McGill: "The Gold Star Sardine Bar at 680 N. Lake Shore Drive was recently sold to Northwestern Hospital. What is the history of this venue?"
After a very pleasant time answering Eng's many questions, I was sufficiently memory-logged to ask myself, "Was the Gold Star Sardine Bar the greatest nightclub Chicago has ever known?"
An answer of sorts came for my colleague Howard Reich, who told Eng, "I think in over 40 years of listening to music in Chicago I've never encountered another club remotely like it. One reason was the size, thus the name. We, the audience, were the sardines. But it didn't matter how crowded or packed it felt, you were in this little cocoon of elegance that had no peer anywhere in the city or country for sure."
Others interviewed on the Curious City program include Lloyd Sachs, a critic who worked for the Sun-Times; Debbie Silverman Krolik, the publicist for the club and one of its performers, Tony Bennett (yes, that Tony Bennett); and Patricia Barber, who was the house pianist at the Gold Star before becoming a jazz giant.
So, I asked around, "Was the Gold Star Sardine Bar the greatest nightclub Chicago has ever known?" And from a few of a certain gray-haired age came, "No," and the name Chez Paree. Opened in 1932 in the Streeterville neighborhood, it was among the country's premiere nightclubs, hosting virtually every star in the entertainment galaxy until the 1960s.
Mister Kelly's also was mentioned frequently. Operating by the brothers George and Oscar Marienthal at the corner of Rush Street and Bellevue (where Gibsons now sits) from 1955-1975, it gave its stage to such stars as Ella Fitzgerald, Woody Allen, Mort Sahl, Barbra Streisand, Muddy Waters, Richard Pryor, and Bette Midler. The Marienthals also ran the successful London House and the Happy Medium.
A few talked of the Club DeLisa, that 1,000-seat South Side home to jazz, blues, rhythm and blues and soul greats until the late 1950s. No one was old enough to recall the Sunset Cafe (aka the Grand Terrace Cafe), where Louis Armstrong played in the 1920s.
There were mentions of other bygone spots as Byfield's, located during the 1980s in the Ambassador East Hotel; the Earl of Old Town, that folk mecca; the Quiet Knight, Theresa's, Pepper's Lounge and the Checkerboard Lounge. One person suggested the Gate of Horn. Another the Burning Spear.
More than a few people I talked to did remember the Gold Star and raved about it.
There is no denying that it was unique, opening in 1982 shortly after Bill Allen and Christ Kamberos, partners in the Treasure Island grocery store chain, were walking around their newest location in what was then the 666 N. Lake Shore Drive building and, Allen said, "came upon this dirt little space." He turned to Kamberos and said, "I'm going to turn this into a bar ... I'll call it the Gold Star. The Gold Star Sardine Bar because it's going to be cramped."
And so it was, with seating for about 60 people (with maybe 100 or so able to stand elbow-to-elbow). Allen (his Gold Star partners were Sharon Hardy and Susan Anderson), wanted to recapture the sort of intimacy he remembered from New York City in the 1940s when he was a student at Columbia University, started booking big names right away. So there was the 20-piece Count Basie Orchestra and Bobby Short. In Dec. 1986, Bennett came.
There was never a cover charge. No minimum. No reservations. There were glasses filled with free cigarettes. More than 1,000 people were turned away for Bennett's show and an astonishing 7,000 could not get in to see Short.
The place was open for lunch and rarely jammed, with hamburgers, chicken salad, chili, meat loaf, quiche and gazpacho highlighting the menu. It was a popular cocktail hour hangout for those who worked across the street at the television studios of WBBM-Channel 2.
The nights and the big names -- Buddy Rich, Stan Getz, Julie Wilson, Woody Herman -- are what made the Gold Star famous. The New York Times called it "the best saloon in America" and for a time in the late 1980s there was serious talk about expanding the concept to other locations in this city and to other cities.
"That would have been great," Silverman Krolik told me. "Bill was such and amazingly creative guy, a combination of Zorba the Greek, P.T. Barnum and Florenz Ziegfeld." That never happened and, as Eng neatly tells the story, a pile of legal troubles began to bedevil Allen and he closed the Gold Star in 1997. He died four years later.
"I wish I could have known him, been there," many people told me, even as they ticked off some of the nightclubs that they enjoy these days and nights, lively spots such as the Green Mill, Davenport's, Andy's, Jazz Showcase, Berlin ... the list is encouragingly, even surprisingly, long.
On Eng's "Curious City" I said of the Gold Star that "there was something undeniably magic about it." In drifting back into the past I realize that when it comes to nightclubs, we've had it pretty good here and still do. The economics of the business preclude the sort of extravagant star booking once practiced by Allen at the Gold Star; Lady Gaga is not going to be performing at the Smartbar. The point, I suppose, is to appreciate what you've got, because soon enough magic is only memory.

Texto completo: Science and religion seem to be getting ever more tribal in their mutual recriminations, at least among hard-line advocates. While fundamentalist faiths cast science as a misguided or even malicious source of information, polemicizing scientists argue that religion isn't just wrong or meaningless but also dangerous.
I am no apologist for religion. As a psychologist, I believe that the scientific method provides the best tools with which to unlock the secrets of human nature. But after decades spent trying to understand how our minds work, I've begun to worry that the divide between religious and scientific communities might not only be stoking needless hostility; it might also be slowing the process of scientific discovery itself.
Religious traditions offer a rich store of ideas about what human beings are like and how they can satisfy their deepest moral and social needs. For thousands of years, people have turned to spiritual leaders and religious communities for guidance about how to conduct themselves, how to coexist with other people, how to live meaningful and fulfilled lives -- and how to accomplish this in the face of the many obstacles to doing so. The biologist Richard Dawkins, a vocal critic of religion, has said that in listening to and debating theologians, he has "never heard them say anything of the smallest use." Yet it is hubristic to assume that religious thinkers who have grappled for centuries with the workings of the human mind have never discovered anything of interest to scientists studying human behavior.
Just as ancient doesn't always mean wise, it doesn't always mean foolish. The only way to determine which is the case is to put an idea -- a hypothesis -- to an empirical test. In my own work, I have repeatedly done so. I have found that religious ideas about human behavior and how to influence it, though never worthy of blind embrace, are sometimes vindicated by scientific examination.
Consider the challenge of getting people to act in virtuous ways. Every religion has its tools for doing this. Meditation, for example, is a Buddhist technique created to reduce suffering and enhance ethical behavior. Research from my own and others' labs confirms that it does just that, even when meditation is taught and performed in a completely secular context, leading research participants to exhibit greater compassion in the face of suffering and to forgo vengeance in the face of insult.
Another religious tool is ritual, often characterized by the rigid following of repetitive actions or by engagement with others in synchronous movement or song. Here, too, an emerging body of research shows that ritualistic actions, even when stripped from a religious context, produce effects on the mind ranging from increased self-control to greater feelings of affiliation and empathy.
Ritual can also play a part in strengthening beliefs. Research on cognitive dissonance has shown that publicly stating beliefs that we don't initially endorse leads to a psychological tension that is often remedied by altering our beliefs and behaviors to match our public pronouncements. Thus the religious practice of repeatedly stating beliefs as part of prayers -- as in the Catholic Mass -- may enhance devotion to a creed.
What findings like these suggest is that religions offer techniques -- or "spiritual technologies," in the words of Krista Tippett, the host of the radio show "On Being" -- that help people endure difficulties, change their views or move them toward action. These techniques seem to work by nudging our behavior subconsciously. Ms. Tippett stresses that the specific religious traditions from which such techniques are borrowed should be understood and honored on their own terms. But when I spoke with her recently, she also agreed that the techniques might work even when separated from their religious trappings, as meditation and elements of ritual have been shown to do.
If this view is right, religion can offer tools to bolster secular interventions of many types, such as combating addiction, increasing exercise, saving money and encouraging people to help those in need. This possibility dovetails with a parallel body of research showing that by cultivating traditional religious virtues such as gratitude and kindness, people can also improve their ability to reach personal goals like financial and educational success.
When I broached this body of research with the cognitive scientist and religious skeptic Steven Pinker, he emphasized that it was by no means a vindication of religion as a whole. He made a point to differentiate between what he called religious practices and cultural practices, with religious ones being those more likely to have doubtful supernatural rationales (like using prayer to contact a deity for favors) and cultural ones having more practical justifications (like using ritual to foster connection and self-control).
While I can see Professor Pinker's point -- and I agree with him that religion as a whole must be judged by its full set of positive and negative effects -- the dividing line between cultural and religious can be blurry. The Jewish practice of Shabbat, for instance, stems from a divine command for a day of rest and includes ritualistic actions and prayers. But it's also a cultural practice in which people take time out from the daily grind to focus on family, friends and other things that matter more than work.
My purpose here isn't to argue that religion is inherently good or bad. As with most social institutions, its value depends on the intentions of those using it. But even in cases where religion has been used to foment intergroup conflict, to justify invidious social hierarchies or to encourage the maintenance of false beliefs, studying how it manages to leverage the mechanisms of the mind to accomplish those nefarious goals can offer insights about ourselves -- insights that could be used to understand and then combat such abuses in the future, whether perpetrated by religious or secular powers.
Science and religion do not need each other to function, but that doesn't imply that they can't benefit from each other. Rabbi Geoffrey Mitelman, the founding director of Sinai and Synapses, an organization that seeks to bridge the scientific and religious worlds, told me recently that science can help clergy better aid those they counsel by showing which types of social and behavioral practices are empirically most likely to foster their emotional, moral and spiritual goals.
A yearning for a science-religion synergy is growing in some circles. Ms. Tippett cites as an example the Formation Project, an initiative designed by a group of millennials who are looking to cultivate their inner lives and form a community by combining ideas from psychology and neuroscience with practices from ancient spiritual traditions. In doing this, she points out, these young people are not blindly accepting any doctrine. They are asking questions and choosing what works based on evidence. In short, they are doing exactly what I think the communities of scientists and clergy need to do in a more rigorous way and on a much larger scale.
Will it work? That's an empirical question. But if we choose not to investigate it, we'll never know. And I suspect we'll be the poorer for it.

Texto completo: Eyeless garter snakes. Pink lightning. A giant countdown clock in the sky.
Some things can’t be explained.
In “The Great Unknowable End” (Simon & Schuster, $19.99), Austinite Kathryn Ormsbee shows how that’s true of the mysterious happenings in a small Kansas town in the ’70s, and of life in general. She’ll showcase her young-adult tale of two teenagers trying to figure out their place in the world at BookPeople on Feb. 27.
When Stella and Galliard first meet, they each have significant challenges to overcome. Stella had hoped to go to the University of Kansas to study engineering and eventually work on a team that launches rockets. But after her mother dies and her brother decamps to the nearby Red Sun community, she has to come home to care for her sister: “I … bought her a new pair of Keds because she is growing too fast and Dad doesn’t notice these things.”
Galliard has lived in Red Sun’s commune his entire life, thinking of the world beyond as the Outside. But after he’s passed over for the plum post of resident artist — a post he believes is rightfully his — he starts wondering more about
what the Outside has to offer. It’s the Crossing season, a sort of Rumspringa free pass for teen commune residents to visit the nearby town. Galliard meets Stella at the movie theater where she works and he’s sneaking in with a fellow commune member.
“Unknowable” is atmospheric, character-driven and full of imagination. It’s rooted firmly in the late ’70s, with music and film references as the backdrop for these two teens’ attempts to forge their paths into adulthood. Ormsbee resists easy answers, which makes this novel all the more beguiling. (Ages 13 and older)
Christopher Paolini’s backstory is almost as fascinating as his best-selling fantasy tales. A home-schooled voracious reader, at age 15 he began writing about a boy who finds a stone that turns into a dragon. His parents self-published the book, which caught the eye of best-selling novelist Carl Hiaasen after he noticed his stepson reading it.
“Eragon” was eventually republished by Knopf and grew into a quartet of titles known as the “Inheritance” series — all of which topped the New York Times best-sellers list. Though the books were sometimes dinged by critics for harkening to familiar inspirations like “Star Wars” and Middle Earth, at one point they were outselling Harry Potter titles.
Paolini, now 35, has returned to Eragon’s world of Alagaësia with “The Fork, the Witch and the Worm” (Knopf, $16.99), a new series of interlinked but stand-alone tales. One is authored by Paolini’s sister Angela, who is the inspiration for the herbalist of the same name in the story itself. He will be in Austin at 7 p.m. Feb. 28 at the Austin Public Library’s Central Branch. The reading is free; tickets for the signing line are available with purchase of the book from BookPeople. (Ages 12-15)
Unfamiliar situations can spark anxiety in the hardiest of young souls. “This Book Is Spineless” (Page Street Kids, $17.99) aims to validate and demystify scary situations with an inventive format. Austinite Lindsay Leslie breaks the fourth wall by having the book itself act as narrator, asking right from the cover, “Yes. Yes I am. Can you help me be brave and face my fears?” As the picture book progresses, the book overcomes nerves about the dark, the vastness of space, ghosts and more.
All five senses and multiple genres are explored, with the book (and, one suspects, its readers) growing less afraid at each page turn and new challenge. This interactive title, illustrated by Alice Brereton, begs to be read aloud and could be a springboard to discussions of deep-seated fears and how to ask for help.
Leslie will be at BookPeople at 2 p.m. Feb. 23. (Ages 4-8)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Who Wins in India's Budget? Critical Blocs of Voters

Texto completo: NEW DELHI -- A new pension plan for rickshaw pullers. More money for fisheries. Tax breaks for the middle class and cash handouts to struggling farmers.
On Friday, the Indian government announced its budget, and with a major election looming in the next few months, the spending plan was stuffed with financial inducements intended to woo voters, though they will increase India's debt beyond targets the government itself has set.
At the same time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers have been trying to deflect criticism that they tried to bury an official jobs report that showed unemployment at a 45-year high. Mr. Modi came to power five years ago promising to create millions of jobs for India's 1.3 billion people.
The latest numbers, leaked to the Indian news media this week, show that even while India's total economy has been growing, at an impressive 7 percent rate or even higher, unemployment also has been rising, hitting 6.1 percent.
Two top statistics commissioners resigned in protest over what appeared to be a concerted government effort to suppress the jobs report. P. C. Mohanan, a career statistician, was one of them.
On Friday, in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Mohanan said it was "the responsibility of every government to bring out official statistics as public information."
"We approved the report to be released, and it did not get released to the public after that," he said. "I have no idea who decided that report will not be released."
Government economists have tried to defend the decision to withhold the report, saying that it was still a draft and that the jobs data needed to be verified. Newspapers across India carried front-page articles on the controversy.
But on Friday, Mr. Mohanan could not have been clearer. "We approved the report," he repeated.
He said that the National Statistical Commission, for which he was the acting chairman, had decided months ago that the report should have been published in December.
India is preparing for a hotly contested election that pits Mr. Modi and his Hindu nationalist political party against an increasingly assertive opposition led by Rahul Gandhi, the scion to a storied political dynasty. His father, Rajiv, was prime minister and so was his grandmother Indira, considered the Iron Lady of Indian politics, who loomed over this country for years. Both were assassinated.
Mr. Modi still leads in opinion polls against Rahul Gandhi, whose Indian National Congress party was deeply damaged by corruption scandals when it was in power. The party's identity as a family dynasty -- Mr. Gandhi recently tapped his younger sister, Priyanka, as a party leader in a strategic state -- has alienated some voters, though others seem energized by Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics.
She is considered a strong public speaker and a forceful personality. The Congress party is counting on her to appeal to women across caste and religious lines.
As the days draw closer to the election, expected to be held in early May, the Congress party is gaining momentum. A race that once seemed a walk for Mr. Modi now seems too close to call. Indian voters are known for suddenly turning against incumbent leaders.
India's political landscape is highly fragmented, like Indian society itself. In the last election, in 2014, more than a dozen political parties, rooted in caste, region or religious beliefs, won seats in Parliament.
Most analysts believe neither Mr. Modi's party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, nor the Congress party will win an outright majority. Regional and caste-based parties will probably become the kingmakers, trading their support for central positions in the next government.
This is where the farmers come in. Farmers are a huge source of votes in India. More than half of India's population still depends on agriculture to survive. Recent studies show growing distress in farming communities because of population growth, shrinking plots of land, climate change and high fertilizer prices. Each year, thousands of farmers, despondent over dwindling yields and seemingly endless bills, commit suicide.
So few were surprised that one of the signature handouts in Mr. Modi's budget unveiled on Friday was cash payments to farmers with less than two hectares -- about five acres -- of land. Under the new program, small-scale farmers will get 6,000 rupees, around $85, in cash. For many farmers, 6,000 rupees is about a month's earnings.
Workers in the informal sector, which includes rickshaw pullers, brick layers, tea sellers, maids, drivers, watchmen and millions of others, also are to be given financial bonuses under the new budget, but it seemed Mr. Modi was especially interested in pleasing farmers.
"Our hard-working farmers were not getting the full value of their produce," Piyush Goyal, Mr. Modi's acting finance minister, said in his budget speech.
"There is a need for providing structured income support to the poor landholder farmer families," he added. "Such support will help them in avoiding indebtedness as well and falling into clutches of money lenders."
Even so, many farmers were critical, calling the payments insufficient.
"They have done a crude joke to farmers," said Vijay Jawandhia, a farmer leader in Maharashtra, India's third-largest state. "How will 500 rupees per month remove the distress of farmers?"

Texto completo: A tiered metal cart — filled with plates of appetizer-size morsels — is pushed from table to table, allowing diners to pick what they want to eat.
That’s how service is handled in traditional dim sum parlors, and it is how guests select small plates at the new SLC Eatery. It recently opened in a remodeled building — once a rock shop — at 1017 S. Main, Salt Lake City.
“We’re hoping people get excited about the cart,” said executive chef Logen Crew. “It’s something completely different for Salt Lake City."
Crew and restaurant owner Paul Chamberlain have worked together for nearly 15 years in the Salt Lake City kitchens of Fresco Italian restaurant, Trio, Stanza and, most recently, Current Fish and Oyster.
Before breaking out on their own, the two visited restaurants around the country that have integrated the trolley cart into their service. They made a point of visiting the award-winning State Bird Provisions, a San Francisco restaurant that was one of the first to give “fine dining the dim sum treatment,” according to The New York Times. In 2013, State Bird was named the country’s best new restaurant by the James Beard Foundation — the Oscars of the culinary world.
Items on the cart will change regularly, said Chamberlain. “That will be our creative outlet.”
On a recent night, plates of shrimp ceviche with hominy, avocado and grapefruit were on the cart along with ponzu-infused broccoli with almonds and napa cabbage. These two- to three-bite items cost $3 to $10 each.
Crew said he’s starting out with a handful of small plates but will increase the offerings over the next few weeks.
Selecting items from the cart is just one way to enjoy the food at SLC Eatery. The restaurant also has a regular menu with entrées, including fresh noodles with lamb shoulder, mini cotija cheese tamales — called tamalitos — and a hamburger with hasselback potato fries. Entrées cost $14 to $32.
Crew said the regular menu and the cart offerings will include globally inspired flavors of Latin America, the Mediterranean and, of course, Asia.
Right now, the restaurant is serving only dinner, but quick-serve lunch is expected soon.
SLC Eatery • 1017 S. Main, Salt Lake City; (801) 355-7952 or slceatery.com. Open Tuesday through Sunday from 5 to 10 p.m. Lunch service expected soon.

Facebook Wrings Record Profit Out of Rough Year

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook's worst year ever was its best year ever when it came to its business.
After a string of scandals in 2018 damaged its reputation and raised questions about its handling of people's data, the social network said Wednesday that it had gained new users around the world in the fourth quarter and reported a record profit. Facebook also posted its full results for 2018, which showed its total revenue and profit reaching record levels.
The results suggested that advertisers had continued to spend money on the site and that users were not deterred by Facebook's issues, which include the spreading of disinformation and election meddling. The company had said last year that it expected its growth to slow as it spent to improve the privacy and security of its users.

"One of the biggest questions people have about Facebook is whether we can make the massive investments we're making to monitor and protect the platform while we keep growing our business," Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said in an interview on Wednesday. "This quarter shows we can do both."
Yet even as its growth continued, Facebook began de-emphasizing its core social network and started highlighting its family of apps, which include Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Facebook said it would eventually stop sharing user numbers for each individual service and instead provide one combined figure for all of its apps.
The change is part of a strategy by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to knit together its businesses into one overarching network. Last week, The New York Times reported that he planned to integrate the technical infrastructure of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger so that people could talk across the services for the first time. The move, which the company hopes to complete by the end of the year or by early 2020, could provide Facebook opportunities for additional revenue from messaging activity and would increase the utility of all of the apps.
In a call with investors on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg confirmed the report, calling the move an eventual boon for users. People want messaging that is "fast, private and reliable," he said.
The moves followed a difficult year for Facebook, as questions about the unintended consequences of social media have sharpened. The company has faced scrutiny over improper handling of its users' data, its largest-ever security breach last year, and the distribution of false content and foreign influence campaigns across its network.
This week, Facebook has been grappling with a report by TechCrunch that it paid people to install an app that would suck in all of their phone and web activity. That has renewed questions about Facebook's approach to user privacy and prompted criticism from Apple, which oversees iPhone apps.
For its fourth quarter, Facebook's revenue rose 30 percent from a year earlier to $16.9 billion, while profits jumped 61 percent to $6.9 billion. Seven million advertisers spend money on the platform, the company said, and in a shift, more than two million now buy ads in Facebook's Stories, one of its newer products.
Facebook also said its daily active users had risen 9 percent from a year earlier to 1.52 billion, the same rate as in the previous quarter. Notably, the number of new users increased in every geography; in previous quarters, growth stagnated in the United States and in Europe. In total, Facebook said, 2.7 billion people now use its core social network and its other apps.
The company added that its estimate of fake accounts on its site had jumped 27 percent from the third quarter to 116 million, while duplicate accounts rose 12.5 percent to 255 million.
The overall results surpassed Wall Street estimates and sent shares of Facebook soaring more than 11 percent in after-hours trading. The company's share price had plunged about 34 percent over the past year, down from a high of $218 in July.
Facebook also said it expected that other investments in new products in areas such as e-commerce and payments systems would yield new revenue streams.
Still, executives cautioned on Wednesday that profit margins would begin to thin in the coming year. Facebook increased its number of employees to more than 35,000 in 2018, up 42 percent, as it added more people to fight disinformation and moderate content on the site. Operating expenses will keep rising, the company said, as Facebook hires in key areas to deal with the issues.
"A lot of our business challenges have been self-imposed," Mr. Zuckerberg said on the call.

Texto completo: An ESPN series covers the two-sport phenom Deion Sanders. And it's the last day for Netflix subscribers to catch the Coen brothers' classic "The Big Lebowski" on that platform.
What's on TV
30 FOR 30: DEION'S DOUBLE PLAY 9 p.m. on ESPN. During the past 10 years, ESPN's "30 for 30" series has covered stories about the world's most intriguing athletes and sports figures, like O. J. Simpson, Andrés Escobar and Bo Jackson. Jackson appears in this latest installment, which focuses on another two-sport athlete, Deion Sanders, and the 24 hours in 1992 when he attempted to play professional baseball, for the Braves, and football, for the Falcons. The documentary, narrated by the rapper Ludacris, features interviews with former Braves and Falcons players, coaches and sportscasters.
TRUCK NIGHT IN AMERICA 10 p.m. on History. At a time when you can find a TV show that focuses on just about any niche topic -- pimple-popping, extreme couponing, making cakes poorly -- it's not surprising that there would be one completely devoted to large, customized trucks. The new season of this competition series pits five drivers against one another in monster-truck-rally-style challenges, like climbing mounds of crushed cars or trudging through swamps. The two best drivers will compete to win $10,000, taking their rigs through an obstacle course called the Green Hell.
What's Streaming
THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) on Netflix, Crackle, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, iTunes and Vudu. Last week, Jeff Bridges (who played the Dude in this movie) teased a reprisal of his cardigan-wearing character in a short clip on Twitter. And by Monday, fans of "The Big Lebowski" got the rest of the footage in the form of a short Super Bowl ad for Stella Artois, featuring the Dude alongside Carrie Bradshaw turning down their usual drinks of choice for the Stellas. Once you've had your fill of watching Bridges say "ar-toes," drink down this original Coen brothers' classic, if only to remind yourself of just how good it is. It leaves Netflix on Friday.
TAG (2018) on HBO's streaming platforms. Six years ago, The Wall Street Journal profiled a group of adult men in their 40s who, in the past two decades, had kept up a long-running game of tag since high school, flying around the country, hiding in bushes and popping out of car trunks to avoid being "it" for an entire year. By 2018, the incredible true antics had inspired a feature film, starring Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Hannibal Buress, Jeremy Renner and Jake Johnson. And while the game and its players might seem juvenile, the film also touches on the anxiety that can accompany aging. In his review, The New York Times critic A. O. Scott wrote, "The story does wander into a few dark corners of middle age: romantic disappointment; addiction and recovery; the possibility of illness and the inevitability of death."

A former baseball writer and columnist for The New York Times, Smith grew up in Pennsylvania in an African-American family that was intent on rooting for Jackie Robinson when he broke the color barrier in 1947. And in this section, she writes of how the example set by Robinson was what set her on her path to be a journalist, one that in 2017 took her to Cooperstown, where she was inducted into the writers' wing of the Hall of Fame. Her recollections appear on Page 9.

Is meal kit packaging becoming sustainable?

Texto completo: While for some the industry solves one problem — of going to the grocery store — it's grasping to fix another, one that's a symptom of itself, something that's been a thorn in its side and a gripe of its customers: The amount of plastic, cardboard and paper that comes with each package.
In response, they've tried to make their packaging smaller, more efficient and easily recyclable, experts say. Yet, hurdles to a perfectly efficient system remain.
Just five years ago, few of us knew the names Blue Apron and HelloFresh let alone ordered ready-to-cook packages of meat, vegetables and fresh spices to our doorsteps.
Since then — with their near-constant freebie offerings — the multi-billion dollar industry is no longer niche but mainstream, with stars like Chrissy Teigen, Tom Brady and Martha Stewart slapping their names on their own meals for home delivery.
While for some the industry solves one problem — of going to the grocery store — it's grasping to fix another, one that's a symptom of itself, something that's been a thorn in its side and a gripe of its customers: The amount of plastic, cardboard and paper that comes with each package.
In response, they've tried to make their packaging smaller, more efficient and easily recyclable, experts say. Yet, hurdles to a perfectly efficient system remain.
Most meal-kit companies today still ship packages of plastic-wrapped vegetables and meat that come in a cardboard box. But simply ditching packaging isn't a reality. Successful meal-kits hinge on their ability to keep food cool, fresh and free from commingling.
Companies rearranged their boxes to reduce the number of ice packs, devleoped recyclable insulation and vowed to use more hearty vegetables t3hat don't require packaging.
To Jonathan Quinn, the secret is getting to the perfect amount of plastic without sacrificing food safety. The industry, in its short history, has learned its lesson somewhat.
"Let's be honest, there was an excessive amount of packaging probably being used early on in the days of meal kits," Quinn said. "But it's gone through an evolution."
Many of the meal kits today boast that oftentimes the majority of its packaging is recyclable. The catch is, not all of it can be placed in curbside recycling bin for pick-up. Rather, it must be
"They contain a lot of packaging basically out of necessity because when you ship products direct to consumer you have food safety issues," said Cara Brosius, an industry analyst at Fredonia Group. "They have a variety of ingredients that have to be packaged separately because you want the separate ingredients to stay fresh and you also want customers to easily be able to assemble the meals."
In the meantime, the industry is putting out millions a meal per month. HelloFresh, the biggest meal-kit provider, dished out 46.5 million meals from July through October last year.
This means durable, insulated packaging is a requirement, preserving freshness while also keeping products from commingling. This requires tiny jars for sauces, plastic film-wrapped vegetables and spices, plastic-cased meat, all cooled by a disposable freezer pack and placed in a cardboard box.
Need to state what's keeping them from becoming all-recyclable
roviding fresh ingredients to your door required packaging - a lot of it - and the pang of guilt customers felt was a blemish for the industry that touted bringing cooking healthy meals back to the kitchen and fewer food waste.
The fledgling industry seems to have made some improvements, although it's not perfect.
Nearly all still come in a box with plastic cooling packs and wrappers - and they'll still be as long as meat needs to be cold and cross-contamination remains a reality.
The two biggest meal-kit companies — HelloFresh and Blue Apron — chose not to quantify how much of their boxes are recyclable, or how much, if at all, they've decreased as it relates to the amount of packaging in their boxes. Although, both said they've made improvements and industry analysts agree the industry on a whole has improved.
Jonathan Quinn, manager of market development at NOVA Chemicals, which makes polyethylene used in packaging of some meal kits. He admits
Some have done their own research to determine the most plastic and cardboard-ridden meal kits.
what the industry presents as almost unavoidable, the need for plastic and cardboard plastic to get the meals to your door.
"The contain a lot of packaging basically out of necessity," said Cara Brosius, an industry analyst at Fredonia Group, which studies the food industry. "When you ship products direct to consumer, you have food safety issues. You need to make sure that food that needs to be cold arrives cold and fresh."
That poses a big problem for the companies that appeal more to younger, more e
promised you meals you could cook at home - and they were enviable and Instagram-worthy. They also made you a warrior in the fight against food waste because perfect ingredient portions meant no tossing out turned parsley.
But the pile of spent plastic and cardboard seemed to off-set any good intentions. A common complaint of the meal-kit industry has been the amount of packaging it requires, a difficult problem to solve because the industry relies on the ability to ship fresh ingredients to a person's door.
It seemed inevitable that meal-kits meant trading one environmental good deed while perpetuating another environmental problem.
So have meal kit companies made any progress in making their packaging more environmentally friendly?
In a world where we're banning plastic bags and ditching straws, where do meal kits stand on the ledger of sustainability.
In 2016, Purple Carrot founder and CEO Andy Levitt described packaging improvement as almost an inevitability.
"We are still in early days here, but when there is that much attention and money being spent for this, there will eventually be compostable insulation or dissolvable insulation you can put into water and turn into dog food or something," he told the New York Times. "Someone will make a dent so people can have access to meal kits without the guilt."
In a world where cities ban plastic bags and fast food restaurants ditch plastic straws.

Texto completo: Tom Brokaw, the former anchor of "NBC Nightly News," apologized Sunday evening for comments about Hispanics and assimilation he made earlier in the day on the network's "Meet the Press."
"I feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics offended some members of that proud culture," Mr. Brokaw tweeted. "I never intended to disparage any segment of our rich, diverse society which defines who we are."
Mr. Brokaw, who retired as anchor in 2004 and currently serves as a special correspondent for NBC, had nonchalantly said that Hispanics should make a greater effort to blend into American culture. His comments, made during a discussion about President Trump's desired border wall, led to an immediate backlash.
"Hispanics should work harder at assimilation," Mr. Brokaw said. "That's one of the things I've been saying for a long time. They ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities, and that's going to take outreach on both sides, frankly."
Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent for "PBS NewsHour" and a former New York Times reporter, was also on the panel and responded to Mr. Brokaw's comments.
"You're talking about assimilation. I grew up in Miami, where people speak Spanish, but their kids speak English. And the idea that we think Americans can only speak English, as if Spanish and other languages wasn't always part of America, is, in some ways, troubling," Ms. Alcindor said.
Among those who criticized Mr. Brokaw was Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas. He explained in a Twitter thread that even though there are generations of Hispanics in the United States, they are, in his opinion, never truly considered American.
"For a celebrated journalist who spent years chronicling American society you seem stunningly ignorant of the Hispanic community in this country," Mr. Castro tweeted. "Unfortunate to see xenophobia pass for elevated political commentary."
The National Association of Hispanic Journalists denounced Mr. Brokaw in a statement released on Sunday.
"Brokaw's comments also ignore the fact that most U.S. Hispanics are born in the United States; English is their native language," the statement read.
The organization also criticized him for what it viewed as an insufficient apology.
"The 'sorry some Hispanics were offended' apology tweeted by Tom Brokaw earlier this evening is not an apology at all," the group said. "It only further demonstrates Brokaw's lack of understanding of what forced assimilation does to communities."
In a 2016 national survey of Latinos, Pew found that 41 percent of Hispanic adults between the ages of 18 and 35 use English as their dominant language. The study found that 40 percent of Hispanics in the same age group are also bilingual.
Another Pew study found that Americans with Hispanic ancestry are less likely to identify as Hispanic as generations go on. By the third generation, the share that self-identifies as Hispanic falls to 77 percent.
"Assimilation is denying one culture for the other," said Hugo Balta, the president of NAHJ and a senior producer at MSNBC. "Hispanics are no less American for embracing their country of origin or that of their ancestors. Being bicultural and bilingual is a strength in an increasingly multiethnic, multilingual society."
Mr. Brokaw opened his commentary by claiming that people on the "Republican side" do not want their children to marry Hispanics.
"A lot of this, we don't want to talk about. But the fact is, on the Republican side, a lot of people see the rise of an extraordinary, important new constituent in American politics, Hispanics, who will come here and all be Democrats," he said. "I hear when I push people a little harder, 'I don't know whether I want brown grandbabies.' I mean, that's also a part of it."
One of former President George H.W. Bush's grandchildren took offense to the "brown babies" comment.
"With all due respect @Tombrokaw I am one of those 'little brown ones' and can assure you that my grandparents conveyed to me that they loved and were proud of me before they passed," tweeted George P. Bush, the Texas land commissioner and a son of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.
Mr. Bush and his two siblings, who are Mexican-American, were once famously referred to as "the little brown ones" by their late grandfather, who claimed to use the term affectionately.
As the anchor of "Nightly News," Mr. Brokaw, 78, was the face of NBC for more than 20 years. Since he stepped down in 2004, he has appeared on the network's news shows, most often to discuss politics, elections and historical events. Mr. Brokaw has also produced and directed documentaries and special segments.Mr. Brokaw sent out a bizarre string of tweets along with his apology, at one point writing, "My tweet portal is whack."
"Finally, I am sorry I failed to convey my strong belief that diversity, dynamic and inclusive, is what makes America," he said.
In a statement released Monday night, a spokesperson for NBC News said, "Tom's comments were inaccurate and inappropriate and we're glad he apologized."

Texto completo: U.S. withdrawal would depend on al-Qaeda, ISIS being denied foothold
KABUL - U.S. and Taliban officials have moved closer to an agreement that could meet a Taliban demand for withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan, officials here indicated Monday, a potential step toward ending more than 17 years of American involvement in the country's long conflict.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, speaking from his palace in Kabul, addressed what appeared to be a significant breakthrough in talks between American officials and Taliban representatives in Doha, Qatar, calling on insurgents to begin "serious talks" with his government and embrace a "speedy peace."
The tentative agreement for a framework to pull out U.S. troops, in exchange for Taliban promises to deny al-Qaeda and the Islamic State a foothold on Afghan soil, comes as Washington races to clinch a deal just weeks after President Trump ordered the withdrawal of up to half of the 14,000 American troops in the country but stopped short of announcing the plan.
But both U.S. and Afghan officials said several major issues remain to be resolved before a peace agreement can be reached, including U.S. demands for an extended cease-fire and the Afghan government's insistence on being included in talks about the Taliban's future role in government and society.
Strong support across the U.S. government for a political solution reflects a recognition of the elusiveness of a military victory against a militant group that has defied almost two decades of warfare with U.S. and NATO forces.
It also reflects the toll that a war that began in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has taken on Afghanistan's people, government and economy.
During six days of talks in Qatar last week, Taliban and U.S. representatives outlined but did not formally agree on a broad plan in which U.S. troops would leave the country in exchange for the insurgents pledging to ensure that Afghan territory would not be used by them or other Islamist militant groups to harm American interests.
Significant obstacles remain to reaching a peace deal, though - or even beginning substantive talks.
"This is a major breakthrough. It's the closest we've ever been to ending this 18-year war. But a framework shouldn't be mistaken for a deal. There is still a lot to flesh out," said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia program at the Wilson Center. "Above all, the Afghan government needs to be brought into these discussions. And even with all this momentum, a fundamental challenge will remain in place: how to ensure that the Taliban holds up its end of the bargain and doesn't take up arms again, in the event of a deal."
Though U.S. officials expressed cautious optimism Monday, the Pentagon hasn't adjusted its plans to continue aiding Afghan national forces fighting the Taliban.
In Washington, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan called the developments "encouraging" but said he had not been asked to prepare for a full troop withdrawal.
News of a potential breakthrough generated anxiety within the Afghan government, which has been excluded from the talks because the insurgents view it as an American puppet. Speaking in a televised address, Ghani warned that a deal without Afghan government involvement could lead to the kind of "catastrophic" civil strife that followed the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.
Speaking after being briefed by Zalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration's special envoy for Afghan peace, Ghani assured Afghans that he would not accept a deal that undermines their rights and the nation's unity.
Khalilzad told the New York Times on Monday that U.S. and Taliban officials had agreed in principle on the two key elements of an eventual deal. But he said a U.S. troop pullout still hinges on the Taliban's acceptance of a cease-fire and direct talks with the Afghan government on domestic issues as part of a full-fledged peace accord.
"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and 'everything' must include an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive ceasefire," he said Saturday on Twitter after leaving Doha. Talks between the two sides are expected to resume next month.
Ghani, who met with Khalilzad late Sunday in Kabul, said in his speech that no agreements would be concluded without the government's full participation.
Taliban officials, for their part, issued a statement late Saturday saying that progress had been made but that further talks were needed to deal with "unsolved matters." The statement added pointedly that Taliban policy was made "very clear" during the talks: "Until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon, progress in other issues is impossible."
Among crucial issues to be addressed in future talks are the Taliban's role in a post-peace governing system and the extent to which its strict Islamic codes could be reimposed on a society that has known democratic freedoms for the past 17 years. A statement from Ghani's office on Monday said Khalilzad told him the Doha talks did not include such issues.
The issue of Afghan inclusion in the peace process is especially sensitive for Ghani, who is seeking reelection in a vote slated for July. He has opposed suggestions that an interim government be formed to implement a peace plan, and he has expressed concern that a hasty U.S.-Taliban deal could come at the expense of Afghan democracy and freedoms.
Several Afghan critics derided Ghani's assertion that his government would be consulted on U.S. troop pullout plans. They noted that Trump has already said he wants to withdraw thousands of troops and that Khalilzad has been under White House pressure to arrange a deal with the Taliban as fast as possible.
"America does not need our advice or consultation for leaving. It came here for its own interests, and it will leave for its own interests," said Hafiz Mansour, an opposition legislator.
Trump's troop reduction plans have dismayed military officials who have said Afghan forces require ongoing help to execute offensives and defend urban centers.
Ghani has worked closely with U.S. military officials since taking office, strongly endorsing a buildup in U.S. training and advising of Afghan forces over the past two years. At an international economic conference last week in Davos, Switzerland, Ghani said that 45,000 members of the Afghan security forces had died since he took office in 2014, a much higher toll than previously reported.
Washington's push for a deal comes 18 months after the president - initially setting aside his impulse to order an immediate withdrawal - approved a strategy for Afghanistan that included thousands more U.S. troops and more-aggressive rules of engagement.
Since then, the president has grown impatient with the lack of progress, as a stalemate between U.S.-backed Afghan forces and the Taliban persisted and violence continued to spike.
Even if a peace deal emerges with the Taliban, both Washington and Kabul still have to contend with a common enemy in the Islamic State, an offshoot of which has been carrying out attacks in Afghanistan.
The Pentagon might theoretically seek to withdraw the bulk of troops under a peace deal but leave a counterterrorism mission in the country to combat the Islamic State and al-Qaeda - or conduct periodic strikes from outside Afghanistan.
Hanging over the flurry of diplomatic efforts are questions about how much time Trump will allow to attempt a negotiated solution.
"The American departure could be 280 characters away," said Christopher Kolenda, a retired Army colonel who commanded troops in Afghanistan and took part in talks with the Taliban during the Obama administration. "The question is: Does the United States depart as part of a durable peace agreement that supports our interests, or does it depart in a way that allows Afghanistan to descend to a new level of civil war?"

Texto completo: Encouraging comments from the U. S. envoy to Afghanistan on "significant progress" in talks with the Taliban heightened hopes for peace, but the envoy and experts on the region warned that major obstacles remain.
Even if a deal is reached, the battle-weary nation of 35 million people could be enveloped in a bloody civil war long after the Americans are gone.
Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad expressed optimism after talks in Qatar wrapped up over the weekend but said, "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. " Monday, he told The New York Times that negotiators agreed on a "framework" for a plan aimed at ending the conflict that has crippled Afghanistan since the U. S. invasion more than 17 years ago.
Khalilzad said the Taliban committed to preventing Afghanistan from becoming a platform for international terrorists. The United States would begin withdrawing troops in return for a cease-fire – and the Taliban conducting talks directly with the Kabul government, something the militant group has refused to do.
The 14,000 U. S. troops remaining in the South Asian country advise the Afghan military and conduct counterterrorism operations. President Donald Trump has frequently questioned the value of U. S. troop involvement.
Benjamin Hopkins, director of Asian Studies at George Washington University, said that the Taliban leadership is fully aware that Trump wants out – and that it cannot take control of the country so long as foreign troops remain.
"Recognizing this, the U. S. has been resistant to any deal withdrawing U. S. troops while the Taliban is still a militarily capable force," Hopkins said. "The thing that seems to have changed is President Trump’s desire to withdraw. . . . Khalilzad is negotiating with that political reality in mind. "
More: Death of American, Taliban attack may muddle plans for withdrawal
More: Afghanistan may be a mess if US troops leave; they should leave anyway
Vanda Felbab-Brown, author of "Aspiration and Ambivalence: Strategies and Realities of Counterinsurgency and State-Building in Afghanistan," said the most likely outcome of a U. S. exit would be civil war.
If the Taliban agrees to negotiate with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, the militants will demand to keep their military force or integrate it into the Afghan military, Felbab-Brown said. That would put the United States in the position of subsidizing Taliban fighters.
The Taliban won't settle for "meager representation" in Parliament but will want control of ministries and power at the national level, she said.
"They will not disarm and go home," Felbab-Brown said. "The question is: Is there any deal that the Taliban is willing to stick by?"
Felbab-Brown and Hopkins said Ghani will not be pleased to see U. S. troops leave. Ghani spoke to his nation Monday, inviting direct talks with the Taliban and assuring Afghans that no deal would be made without his participation.
Ghani has said that although no country wants foreign troops indefinitely, U. S. troops remain a crucial component for his country's stability. Hopkins suggested that U. S. officials might be planning a residual "security footprint" while withdrawing the public face of the deployment.
The latest talks "could be the beginning of something, but only if there is a major change in the interests and aims of the parties," Hopkins said. "And I don’t see the Taliban as the one moving here. "
About 2,400 U. S. military personnel have died in Afghanistan – including one last week – since American forces launched the offensive against the Taliban weeks after the terrorism attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. A Taliban car bomb attack last week killed at least 45 people, including dozens of Afghan intelligence officials.
Violence has been on the rise.
Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a former Taliban official who is a member of the country's High Peace Council, expressed optimism about the talks but stressed that more discussions are needed in the coming weeks or months.
"Afghanistan's problem is not so simple that it can be solved in a day, week or month; it needs more time and more discussions," Mujahid told The Associated Press.
Felbab-Brown said she hopes that if the Taliban wins enough concessions, civil war could be averted.
"Civil liberties may fade, but maybe you will save thousands of lives," she said. "That is better than bloody civil war. But it is not a happy outcome. "

Texto completo: People often review their retirement investment strategy in January. But more will probably do it this year after 2018's rocky close. Here are 18 "do's and don'ts" to keep in mind.
DO save more: Contribution limits for 401(k)s rise to $19,000 this year ($25,000 for the 50-and-older set). The more you put away now, the longer your investments have time to grow, paying off big-time down the road.
DON'T peek: It's unwise to look at your investments more than once a month. Once is often enough to verify that your portfolio is working as it should and that market movements haven't created big stock or sector concentrations. Looking more often, however, leads to tinkering with your investments – usually a recipe for buying stocks high and selling them low – plus extra costly commissions.
DO think long term: If you're still working and investing for retirement, your time horizon may be 30, 40 years or more. Short-term wiggles even out over long stretches. If you got out of the market before December's plunge and got back in at year-end and avoided that nasty period, it makes very little difference over the long term.
DON'T think short term: Avoid a sudden re-evaluation of your portfolio because of news stories. Stocks look forward, not backward. They've priced in whatever you just read.
DO get perspective: Get a good hobby to clear your head when stocks get violently volatile. Hiking, bird-watching, parasailing – whatever happily gets your mind off the wild wiggles of markets.
DON'T get hooked on a feeling: Resist changing your portfolio because you suddenly feel good or bad. Fear and greed drive most investment errors. They're usually backward-looking. Reacting to the recent past is never wise.
DO diversify: Make sure you diversify enough. No one security should exceed about 5 percent of your total portfolio. Too risky.
DON'T make decisions after drinking: Too many folks work all day, tipple a few while relaxing, then look at their portfolio, get emotional and make bad investment moves. Decisions require muted emotion.
DO invest globally: Owning familiar U.S. names may feel best. But it's a big world. America is just more than half the global stock market. Quality opportunities abound in the other half.
DON'T think you're a passive investor: Calling yourself "passive" when you're buying and selling index funds or ETFs is self-deception. Those tools are passive, but trading them is active.
DO tune out 2020 chatter: Ignore speculation about the 2020 election and its stock market impact. It's too far out. Early polls usually aren't predictive. No one can pick the winner this far in advance – or gauge the election's impact on the market.
DON'T overemphasize small differences in returns: If Fund 101 returned 9 percent annualized in the past 20 years but Fund 337 did 7 percent, it says nothing about how they'll do in the years ahead.
DO know you'll often be wrong: So, own some things that will do fine when what you think will do well doesn't, just in case.
DON'T obsess: Don't get hung up on best and worst performing stocks in a month, quarter or year. They usually cancel each other out. The totality – the broad middle – is what matters.
DO embrace mistakes: They're learning opportunities. Ignoring them sets you up for future failure.
DON'T get cocky: We're human. If you make a great trade, it may be skill. Or more likely luck. The road to ruin is paved with overconfidence.
DO remember capital preservation and growth can't coexist: True capital preservation means no risk – and no return. It's just cash, or something like it. Returns require risk.
DON'T get jealous: If your neighbors boast about big returns, good for them! But they aren't you. Maybe they're taking risks that aren't right for you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot trying to keep up.
DO keep learning: Build your investing and retiring know-how via daily reading.

Texto completo: The publisher Spiegel & Grau, a Penguin Random House imprint known for its best-selling and groundbreaking nonfiction, has been shut down as part of a continuing effort to streamline Penguin Random House's sprawling operation following the merger between Penguin and Random House in 2013.
On Friday, the company announced that the imprint will be shuttered and that its founders, Cindy Spiegel and Julie Grau, will leave. The news came as a shock to some at the company and in the publishing world, as the imprint had just completed one of its most successful years. In 2018, it published multiple New York Times best sellers and other high-profile titles, including a book about the Beastie Boys by the band members Michael Diamond and Adam Horovitz, and one about pressing societal concerns by the Israeli historian and philosopher Yuval Harari.
The imprint, which was started at Doubleday in 2007 and moved to Random House in 2008, has over the years amassed a stable of prominent authors and award-winning books.
Spiegel & Grau published "Between the World and Me," by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a best seller that won a 2015 National Book Award and helped drive conversation about police violence and systemic racism. They also published best sellers like Bryan Stevenson's "Just Mercy," the memoir "Born a Crime," by the "Daily Show" host Trevor Noah, Jay-Z's "DECODED," Piper Kerman's prison memoir "Orange Is the New Black" and books by popular self-help authors like Suze Orman and Brené Brown.
Some authors who started their careers at Spiegel & Grau mourned the end of the imprint. Ms. Kerman, whose memoir was adapted into a successful Netflix series, credited Ms. Grau with taking a chance on her when she was an aspiring writer who had never published anything and was still on federal probation.
"She understood the book I aspired to write and helped me do it with kindness and ferocious intelligence," Ms. Piper said in an email. "She has a brilliant sense of story and knows where an author fits into a cultural moment."
Ms. Spiegel and Ms. Grau developed a track record for publishing prescient works that tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. At a moment when editors and publishers were looking for books by authors from diverse backgrounds, the imprint became something of a magnet for books by African-American writers and cultural figures.
One of Spiegel & Grau's top editors, Chris Jackson, left in 2016 to revive another Random House imprint, One World.
Despite its successes, Spiegel & Grau became yet another casualty of corporate restructuring. Its closing follows the merger last fall of two of the company's most successful publishing lines, Crown and Random House. The new joint division is being led by Gina Centrello, formerly the president and publisher of Random House. In a memo to employees at that time, Madeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., said that Crown and Random House "will retain their distinct editorial identities."
Ms. Spiegel and Ms. Grau are the latest prominent editors and publishers to depart as a result of the shake-up. In the aftermath of the reorganization, Maya Mavjee, Crown's president and publisher, left the company and will be moving to Macmillan; Crown's senior vice president and publisher, Molly Stern, who edited Michelle Obama's book, left the company. Emi Ikkanda, an editor at Spiegel & Grau, will also leave with the shuttering of the imprint.
The consolidation comes at a moment when big publishing houses are trying to adapt to the shift toward online retail. Some of the biggest publishing houses have been adding imprints and acquiring smaller publishing companies to stay competitive, hoping that getting bigger would give them an advantage when negotiating terms with retailers and distributors. In 2016, Hachette Book Group struck a deal to acquire Perseus, an independent publishing house, and in 2014 News Corporation bought the romance publisher Harlequin for $415 million.
When Penguin and Random House merged in 2013, they became by far the largest of the "big five" publishing houses, which also include Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan.
Lately, however, there have been signs that the biggest publishing houses feel the need to contract and consolidate by eliminating and combining imprints. Last year, Hachette shifted its free-standing Hachette Books nonfiction line to the Perseus Books division. In 2017, Penguin shut down Blue Rider Press.
Penguin Random House, which houses around 275 imprints worldwide and generates some $4 billion annually, has begun to look for ways to streamline its publishing lines, a move that could help to curb duplication across imprints.
In a company memo, the Random House publisher Susan Kamil said Spiegel & Grau's authors would move to other imprints.
"While the S & G list will no longer exist as a stand-alone imprint, its amazing authors will be fully and proudly supported by Random House, The Dial Press and One World," Ms. Kamil wrote.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
A little more than a year ago, Noel Millea, the deputy editor of the New York Times Real Estate section, asked if I could recommend a journalist to take over a column called "What You Get." The assignment was to write every week about three houses on the market that were roughly the same price, but located in different parts of the United States.
Like many New Yorkers, I was already spending a lot of time online looking at real estate for free. I usually did this at night when I couldn't sleep and the idea of uprooting my family and moving to, say, Abiquiu, N.M. -- where we could buy a house with 50 acres of vineyards for the price of a two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan -- didn't seem preposterous.
So I did a Dick Cheney and recommended myself.
Now every week, in broad daylight, I think up a number from $ 250,000 to $ 3 million and investigate what it would buy in San Diego or Philadelphia or maybe Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Using websites like Zillow, I pick three homes that are in good condition and nicely furnished and photographed. If a house has been staged with clichés like horse-head portraits or caged hanging light fixtures, I pass it by. I am also averse to obviously faked photos, with fires pasted into fireplaces and lawns the color of Sprite bottles.
Once Noel approves my choices (she almost always does; we are sisters in our armchair real-estate-buying enthusiasms), I call the listing agent of each property and ask a lot of questions. Who built the home? What is the neighborhood like? When was the kitchen upgraded? Is that fireplace mantel original?
I lean toward homes with strong character, like a Queen Anne Victorian in Fall River, Mass., that belonged to Lizzie Borden ( $ 799,000), or a circular stone house with a mushroom-shaped carport in Pleasantville, N.Y., designed by Frank Lloyd Wright ( $ 1.5 million). I've also found an astronomer's lair, complete with observatory and seismograph, built under the clear skies of Tucson, Ariz. ( $ 650,000), an imitation lighthouse standing at the edge of the Ohio River in Prospect, Ky. ( $ 849,000), and a mansion in Boise, Idaho, modeled on a medieval castle ( $ 2.675 million).
By making price the only constant, "What You Get" conveys the jagged economics of geography. In the first week of September 2018, $ 1.9 million bought you a three-story brick rowhouse near Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia ( $ 427 a square foot), an International Style steel-and-glass pavilion in Westchester County in New York ( $ 578 a square foot) or a midcentury cottage in Palm Beach, Fla. ( $ 1,028 a square foot).
The disparity can feel vertiginous. In hot real estate markets like Washington, D.C., and Boston, what you get seems to shrink and grow flimsier by the month. Entire cities have become like fashionable restaurants, overpriced and short on places, though there have been recent signs of a cooldown.
And yet, as I peek into the interiors of America, I am surprised by the things they have in common. Like leather sofas, for which, apparently, there is no climate too sticky. Or kitchens that flow uninterruptedly into family rooms. (That rumor about the death of the formal dining room is not greatly exaggerated.)
Contrary to the assumptions of many readers, and a few friends in various cities who send me hurt notes asking why I've snubbed them, I do not personally visit any of the 156 properties I write about each year. (Though I did once dispatch my brother Drew to check out a house in Portland, Ore., where he lives.) Instead, I have built warm telephone relationships with real estate professionals. They often invite me to drop by the towns I've only just learned about, like Middleway, W.Va., which lays claim to a two-centuries-old ghost story, known as the "Wizard Clip," involving noisy invisible scissors. Or Danby, Vt., which may have the largest underground marble quarry in the world.
I find I even have fans. Nothing I've written in a long journalistic career has won me more eyeballs than this column. Even blood relatives exclaim, "That's you?" when I mention it.
Why is vicarious real estate shopping a national pastime? Not long ago, to check out someone else's home, we had to inveigle an invitation to tea, buy a shelter magazine like House Beautiful or go to an open house and pretend we wanted to buy it. Now we have HGTV, Instagram and Pinterest. In the age of obliterated benefits and the gig economy, we've lost faith in the perfectibility of our work lives, but not of our home lives. We believe happiness is an en suite bathroom, a raised vegetable bed or a wood-burning fireplace, with or without an inglenook.
Sometimes the spell cast by the listings I read is so overwhelming I call my husband over to look at the screen. He usually admires whatever renovated New England barn or Craftsman cottage on the Michigan-Indiana border is shown there, before asking, "What's wrong with it?" because the price, by New York City standards, is absurdly low.
At which point there is only one thing to do: Type "San Francisco" into the search engine.
Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Until recently, when I asked my dad for my weekly allowance, he'd shuffle his hands through his pockets and hand me cash. One morning a few months ago, though, I approached him with a new idea. I asked him to Venmo me. He glanced over his New York Times. "What's Venmo?" he said.
I explained to my dad that it's an app that lets you send and receive money on your smartphone -- all my friends know about it, and most use mobile payments of some kind. When I ran an Instagram poll last month, 60 percent of the 300 people who responded (mostly ages 12 to 25) said they used apps like Cash App, PayPal and Google Pay for mobile payments. Many of them commented that their employers (mostly parents they babysat for) had paid them via phone.
Apart from interactions with adults, friends and I use Venmo mainly to borrow and pay money back and forth to one another. We are one another's wallets. Phoebe Hill, 15, responded to my poll by saying she used these apps because "I can pay back/request money from my friends, so I won't forget." Evelyn Lazen, 18, said she used Venmo because "I never have cash, and I always manage to lose my debit card." (One drawback to Venmo for me versus cash is that it can be harder to track how much money I have, as it's not all in my wallet.)
Cashless systems are spreading in the United States and beyond. In China, an estimated 525 million people, 40 percent of the population, have used mobile payments. But the apps aren't just for money. What I like about Venmo is that it's made for social networking too. Your friends can see who you are paying and what you say you're paying for (unless you make your account private). It keeps me in the loop with what is going on. In a weird way, it's like any other public platform, or even sharing your location. It's nice to know what is happening around you. And I can always check to be sure my dad has Venmoed me my allowance. ◊ DRAWING (DRAWING BY KYLE HILTON)

What did Trump know, and when?

Texto completo: For two years now we've heard, "No collusion! and "Witch hunt! Such disparagement of special counsel Robert Mueller's work was never viable (e.g. we knew about the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 for well over a year); now it's simply wrong. Perhaps the new phrase, albeit not original, should be: What did President Donald Trump know, and when did he know it?
The indictment and arrest of Roger Stone were not unexpected, but the allegations should shake Republicans out of their slumber. We learn from the indictment:
"After the July 22, 2016, release of stolen [Democratic National Committee] emails by Organization 1 [WikiLeaks], a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.
A senior official was allegedly directed to inquire about stolen emails. Who directed him, and if not Trump himself, did Trump know what was being done on his behalf?
Likewise, Mueller alleges:
"During the summer of 2016, STONE spoke to senior Trump Campaign officials about Organization 1 and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. STONE was contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by Organization 1.
And then there is this:
"On or about October 7, 2016, Organization 1 released the first set of emails stolen from the Clinton Campaign chairman. Shortly after Organization 1's release, an associate of the high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read well done.' In subsequent conversations with senior Trump Campaign officials, STONE claimed credit for having correctly predicted the October 7, 2016 release.
In short, Mueller has evidence suggesting that the highest levels of the Trump campaign were using Stone to intercede with WikiLeaks, with its known collaborations with Russia, to assist in release of dirt on the campaign's opponents.
If Trump was directing campaign aides to intercede with Stone, and by extension, WikiLeaks, that "would plainly constitute another piece - a big one - in the mosaic of evidence showing that Trump was committing campaign-related crimes in coordination with Russia to rig the presidential election in his favor by knowingly weaponizing stolen information against his opponent, says constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe. "That mosaic could certainly establish a high crime warranting Impeachment. But I still believe that an intense and public fact-finding process by the House, starting now, needs to precede any formal decision on impeachment, without which the essential public consensus favoring Trump's removal won't emerge.
Mueller indicted Stone on multiple counts of lying to the House Intelligence Committee and also a count of witness-tampering. "It is a damning indictment that shows Stone tried to obstruct the investigation every step of the way to keep the truth from coming out, remarks former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller. "The question now is are there even bigger secrets he is protecting, and if so, how far is he willing to go to protect them?
Max Bergmann of the Moscow Project points out, "According to Trump himself, campaign staff, and embedded political reporters, the campaign was the Trump show. He was his own strategist and made every decision. He concludes, "It is simply impossible to believe that when it came to the most important campaign decision of all - whether or not to collude with Russia - Trump wasn't involved.
In addition to the extent of Trump's personal involvement and the identity of the Trump Organization's contacts with Stone (a New York Times report earlier in the year suggested former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was one contact), further questions abound. Former FBI special agent Clint Watts asks: "Why did Stone, after seeing the Mueller investigation start, make false statements to HSPI when it was highly likely his communications with Organization 1 would be discovered? (Watts also wonders: "Will they charge WikiLeaks or not? That is one link for collusion if they are to pursue that.)
There are plenty of juicy and ludicrous tidbits in the indictment, such as Stone's alleged mob-like threats to others including a reference to "The Godfather: Part II. You cannot make something like this up:
"You are a rat. A stoolie. You backstab your friends-run your mouth my lawyers are dying Rip you to shreds, Stone told the person in an April 9 email. He also threatened to "take that dog away from you, and said, "I am so ready. Let's get it on. Prepare to die (expletive).
Regardless of the luridness, no one - including Trump's dead-enders in the right-wing media - should fail to recognize how serious this is. We have collusion between Stone and WikiLeaks about a crime, stealing emails, and between Stone and a Trump campaign senior official about that activity. We will see which characters, if any, committed which crimes. But the president is a hair's breadth from being implicated in collusion (or knowledge of collusion). His efforts and all these associates' lies now make more sense.

Texto completo: He hated black men. He wanted to kill one, and he did.
In a videotaped confession, James Harris Jackson, a white Army veteran from Baltimore, told investigators that he spent several days two years ago stalking black men in Manhattan before he spotted a 66-year-old man sifting through trash for recyclables.
And in an undeniable testament of his hate, Mr. Jackson said he pulled a short sword from his coat and repeatedly stabbed the man, Timothy Caughman.
The killing, Mr. Jackson said, was "practice" for a larger attack he had planned for Times Square where he intended to murder young black men who were with white women because he loathed interracial dating.
Mr. Jackson, 30, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to rare state charges of murder as terrorism and murder as a hate crime, accepting what is certain to be a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. His dramatic plea to all counts against him came four months after the video of his interview with police was presented at a pretrial hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Jackson, who walked into the courtroom on crutches, wearing black slack pants and a white button-up shirt, made no speech and expressed no remorse. He answered a series of questions from Justice Laura A. Ward in a matter-of-fact tone. The judge asked him if he had stabbed Mr. Caughman because he was black and hoped the attack would incite "a racial war."
"Yes," he said.
The murder of Mr. Caughman came at a time when hate crimes were rising throughout the country and in New York City. While New York has continued to be one of the safest big cities in the country, the number of reported hate crimes increased by 5 percent last year.
Prosecutors in Manhattan say the number of cases in the borough has increased steadily since the 2016 election of President Trump, whose rhetoric is often divisive.
The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said Mr. Jackson's conviction was the first of a white supremacist on terrorism charges in New York, and one of a few in the country. Mr. Vance had intended to try the case himself.
"This is an incredibly disturbed young man and he brought tragedy to Manhattan and he certainly showed Mr. Caughman no mercy and I don't think this office should show him any," Mr. Vance said during an interview at his office. "It was a cruel and completely planned attack with a broader political goal."
A family friend and a cousin of Mr. Caughman looked on as Mr. Jackson entered his guilty plea.
"The pain is still there," said Mr. Caughman's longtime friend, Portia Clark, 66. "I'm grateful he pleaded guilty to all of the charges and they can take him back and throw the key away."
Ms. Clark, standing outside of the courtroom, addressed Mr. Jackson: "And no -- I don't forgive you for what you did."

On St. Patrick's Day in 2017, Mr. Jackson boarded a bus in Washington, D.C., and rode it to New York City. He said he thought about going to another city, but settled on New York because he believed his attack would receive the most media attention there: "I wanted to basically influence the national conversation," he said.
"I was planning on doing basically as many as I could in Times Square," he told detectives during a two-hour interview following his arrest. He said he had planned to send an email to The New York Times or CNN to explain the motive behind his "terrorist attack" or what he described as "an amateurish, slipshod version" of one.
After arriving to the city, Mr. Jackson checked into a hotel on West 46th Street. He spent three days hunting victims with a short sword and two smaller knives tucked into his coat.
Security cameras filmed him as he followed a black man whom he later told investigators he decided against attacking because there were too many people around. He said he followed 10 to 15 black people or groups with the intent of killing them, but hesitated each time.
Then, at about 11:15 p.m. on March 20, Mr. Jackson spotted Mr. Caughman rummaging through trash on West 36th Street near Ninth Avenue. Mr. Caughman was a recycler who lived nearby in a room at the Barbour Hotel, which now houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. (In earlier reports about the murder, Mr. Caughman was inaccurately described as homeless.)
Mr. Jackson told investigators he stabbed Mr. Caughman in the back. Mr. Vance said the sword struck several of Mr. Caughman's organs, causing him to bleed out. Mr. Caughman screamed and asked Mr. Jackson, "What are you doing?"
Mr. Jackson responded by stabbing Mr. Caughman several more times in the chest before fleeing. He broke the tip of his sword during the attack and tossed it in a garbage can in Washington Square Park.
Bleeding, Mr. Caughman walked a block to a police station on West 35th Street, where officers called an ambulance, the police said. He died at Bellevue Hospital.
Soon Mr. Jackson's image from security cameras appeared in news reports. A day after the attack, Mr. Jackson turned himself in at a police substation in Times Square.
At the time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio strongly condemned the killing. Mr. de Blasio, who spoke at Mr. Caughman's funeral, called the attack a racist act of domestic terrorism. Mr. Vance agreed and charged Mr. Jackson with "murder in the first degree as an act of terrorism."
"I looked at this as no different than an Islamist Jihadist coming into the city and attacking a synagogue or attacking a non-Muslim for ideological or political purposes," Mr. Vance said. "That's exactly what James Jackson did, except it was based on a bias of white supremacy."
Mr. Jackson joined the Army in 2009 and served at various locations in the United States, working in military intelligence. He was deployed to Afghanistan between December 2010 and November 2011. Afterward, he was stationed in Baumholder, Germany, before being discharged in August 2012.
Mr. Vance said that after Mr. Jackson left the military he became "self-radicalized" and, in a "twisted way, he saw himself as a key element in starting a worldwide racial war."
During his interview with detectives, Mr. Jackson said he intended the murder of Mr. Caughman to be a "declaration of global war on the Negro race," and that he wanted to "inspire white men to kill black men, to scare black men and to provoke a race war."
He told a detective that he felt no remorse. He said his goal was "a global policy aimed at the complete extermination of the Negro race."
"I was going for something a bit bigger," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The Black Hebrew Israelites said the confrontation Friday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial involving Covington Catholic High School students and a Native American man was “great” for their cause.

“It’ll get to them,” Ash Yasharahla, who belongs to a congregation of Hebrew Israelites known as I Am Israel (No Division), told the New York Times. “It’ll permeate their minds. As long as the full message is up there, it’s a great thing.”

A group of five Black Hebrew Israelites yelled racist, homophobic, and other derogatory comments to a group of Covington Catholic High School students before a viral encounter between the teenagers and Native American protester Nathan Phillips.

The Black Hebrew Israelites, who believe God’s chosen people are blacks, Hispanics, and Native American people, is widely viewed as a hate group, and its members often act in provocative ways in an effort to get a reaction.

One member of the group present at the Lincoln Memorial Friday said that it happened to “expose” what America has become.

“Our God did that to expose what this country is coming to, to expose what we’ve been teaching,” Shar Yaqataz Banyamyan said.

Among the obscenities the Black Hebrew Israelites called the Covington Catholic students in “Make America Great Again” hats and attire were “incest kids,” “faggots,” and “white crackers,” while also claiming that the teenagers were racist.

Transgender ban still on hold despite Supreme Court decision

Texto completo: LEGAL LIMBO: Despite yesterday’s 5-4 Supreme Court decision clearing the way for the Pentagon to bar military service by most transgender individuals, the Pentagon said late yesterday that for now, at least, there will be no change in the current policy. That approach was formulated by a 2016 order from then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter , allowing transgender troops to serve openly.


“There is currently one court case with a national injunction still in place,” said Lt. Col. Carla Gleason , a Pentagon spokesperson. “We are currently accessing transgendered individuals per the Carter policy,” she said in an email. The Supreme Court’s unsigned order lifted injunctions on implementing the policy imposed by federal judges in California and Washington state.  There is still a stay on the rules pending a decision from a circuit court in Maryland, the Pentagon said.


“The Department is pleased with the orders issued by the Supreme Court today. We will continue to work with the Department of Justice regarding next steps in the pending lawsuits,” said a statement issued earlier in the day. “As always, we treat all transgender persons with respect and dignity. DoD's proposed policy is NOT a ban on service by transgender persons.”


THE MATTIS POLICY: At issue is the version of the transgender ban fashioned by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis seven months after President Trump , in a series of tweets, surprised the Pentagon by announcing a total ban on transgender individuals to “serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.”


Mattis refined the policy to allow currently serving transgender troops to remain, and to allow for new the accession of new recruits so long as they served in their biological birth gender, and did not have a diagnosis of “gender dysphoria.”


The Pentagon said yesterday that policy was solely intended to maximize combat effectiveness. “It is critical that DoD be permitted to implement personnel policies that it determines are necessary to ensure the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world,” said a statement issued after the high court ruling. “DoD's proposed policy is based on professional military judgment and will ensure that the U.S. Armed Forces remain the most lethal and combat effective fighting force in the world."


PREDICTABLE REACTION : Groups advocating on behalf of transgender individuals were quick to condemn the Supreme Court ruling and vowed to fight on in the lower courts.


“For more than 30 months, transgender troops have been serving our country openly with valor and distinction, but now the rug has been ripped out from under them, once again,” said Peter Renn , an attorney with the group Lambda Legal. “We will redouble our efforts to send this discriminatory ban to the trash heap of history where it belongs.”


“Multiple federal courts have recognized that excluding qualified individuals simply because they are transgender is contrary to basic constitutional principles of equality and fairness,” said Shannon Minter , legal director of National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups representing transgender plaintiffs.


“It’s critical to understand that the military is not required, and has no need, to reinstate the transgender ban, which would cause destabilizing whipsaws in personnel policy,” said Aaron Belkin , director of the Palm Center. “The Defense Department should not reinstate the transgender ban because it would undermine readiness, cause significant disruptions and uncertainty, deprive the military of much-needed talent, and wreak havoc with the lives and careers of the 14,700 transgender troops bravely protecting our nation’s security.”


“The Trump administration’s cruel obsession with ridding our military of dedicated and capable service members because they happen to be transgender defies reason and cannot survive legal review,” said Jennifer Levi director of GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders or “GLAD.”


THE NEW CHAIRMAN WEIGHS IN: The decision drew an immediate rebuke from the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, now controlled by Democrats.


“I am extremely disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision to allow the Trump administration to enforce its discriminatory ban on transgender military service without proper due process in the courts,” said Rep. Adam Smith , D-Wash.


“Anyone who is qualified and willing should be allowed to serve their country openly, without their career being affected by an arbitrary, discriminatory directive from the President. We have fought against this bigoted policy at every step, and we will continue to do so."

HAPPENING TODAY — TWO VOTES TO REOPEN GOV’T: It’s Day 33 of the partial government shutdown, two competing bills to end the impasse face likely defeat in the Senate when they come up for a vote tomorrow. At least in absence of a broader deal.


A Republican measure would give President Trump the $5.7 billion he wants to extend and barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border and end the shutdown. The Democratic proposal would reopen the government for about two weeks, just long enough for government workers to get their back pay, and one more paycheck, before the whole things starts again, if no agreement is reached by Feb. 8.


Congress watchers say neither bill is likely to get the 60 votes needed for Senate passage, due to the chamber’s filibuster rules.


‘UNACCEPTABLE’ TWEETS COAST GUARD COMMANDANT: “Your Coast Guard leadership team & the American people stand in awe of your continued dedication to duty, resilience, & that of your families. I find it unacceptable that @USCG members must rely on food pantries & donations to get through day-to-day life. #uscg,” tweeted Adm. Karl Schultz , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard as his forces missed their second paycheck of the year.


“You, as members of the armed forces, should not be expected to shoulder this burden,” said Schultz in an accompanying video message.


POMPEO ‘OPTIMISTIC’: With giving any reason for his optimism, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland yesterday that he’s hopeful the shutdown will soon be over.


“ We all hope that it'll end fairly quickly. Political fights in the United States are a time-honored tradition, as those of you who've studied our history know. I hope that we get this one resolved in relatively short order,” Pompeo said in a video q-and-a from the U.S. “I'm always optimistic. I'm counting on the fact that we'll get it resolved pretty quickly.”


PROGRESS ON KOREA: In that remote video appearance piped in from Washington, Pompeo insisted that despite media reports suggesting North Korea has been slow to fulfill promises to “denuclearize,” talks are progressing nicely.


“When Kim Yong-chol visited Washington last week, we made further progress not only in the discussions that he had with the president but Special Representative [ Stephen] Biegun had the opportunity to meet with his newly designated counterpart as well, where they were able to discuss some of the complicated issues towards achieving what the two leaders laid out back last June in Singapore.”


Pompeo added, “There remains an awful lot of work to do, but good things have happened already. The North Koreans aren't conducting missile tests. The North Koreans aren't conducting nuclear tests. There are many steps yet along the way towards achieving the denuclearization. We're determined to work towards achieving that. I believe at the end of February we'll have another good marker along the way.”


President Trump is planning to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un late next month, reportedly in Vietnam.


ON RUSSIA: “It’s not the case that we are doomed to a Cold War rivalry,” said Pompeo on U.S. relations with Russia. “These two nations are the two largest possessors of nuclear capability in the world. Russia is a formidable power in that respect, and we understand that, and so we need to ensure that there are conversations taking place so that we can prevent both proliferation and the risk that comes with the possession of those nuclear weapons.”


“I must say, it’s been a struggle,” Pompeo said. “We’re looking for Russia to begin to change its behavior, whether that’s its behavior in Ukraine or the work that it did to influence elections here in the United States and that it’s done to influence elections all across the world … We are not destined to be antagonists. We can do better than that, but it will take a Russian change in their outlook and behavior in the world in order to achieve that.”


NATO MEMBERSHIP AFFIRMED: All the reports about Trump’s frustration with NATO, and his questioning of the value of remaining in the alliance, prompted the Democratically-controlled House to vote overwhelmingly last night to block the president from spending any federal money to withdraw from NATO, and to set a formal policy that the U.S. will "remain a member in good standing."


“This branch of government fully supports the alliance, the collective defense of our allies, and peace across the North Atlantic region,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel , D-N.Y., said during a floor debate.


ISIS TO GITMO? A group of GOP senators — Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Marco Rubio of Florida, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas — want President Trump to transfer more than 700 “battle-hardened terrorists” detained by the Syrian Democratic Forces to the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.


The lawmakers assert in a letter to the president yesterday that given the “rapidly shifting dynamics in Syria, it is possible that these terrorists may escape or be released from SDF custody in the coming weeks and months” and could attempt to commit terrorist attacks in the U.S. and Europe.


The U.S. hasn’t transferred any new detainees to the detention facility — which currently houses 40 detainees — in more than 10 years. Doing so would require the U.S. to prove that the detainee in question is affiliated with a force that the U.S. is in armed conflict with.


WHO NEEDS BRIEFINGS? The time-honored tradition of having an official spokesperson take questions from reporters in a formal briefing is slowly going the way of the flip-phone, a quaint anachronism of a bygone era.


At the Pentagon, there hasn’t been a “routine” on-camera briefing from an official spokesperson since May of last year. The State Department’s daily press briefings are more like monthly or bi-monthly events. And the White House appears to have given up entirely on the process, which has become increasingly unsatisfying for both sides.


“The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the ‘podium’ much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press,” President Trump tweeted yesterday. “I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, Fake News!’”


SHANAHAN’S DEBUT? The Pentagon was planning to have Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan make an appearance in the briefing room last week to have his first interaction with the Pentagon press corps, but a weekend snowfall closed the federal government and scuttled the plan.


Now there’s talk that Shanahan may meet the press sometime this week, possibly as soon as today. As of this morning, the Pentagon lists no public events on his schedule. Stay tuned.

Texto completo: BIDDEFORD, Maine -- Political and social justice activist Angela Davis told a young Muslim woman on Wednesday that she also felt fear when she worked for civil rights in the 1960s and 1970s, but that she could not let that fear stop her work.
"People often asked, 'Weren't you afraid when you were facing the death penalty?'" Davis responded to the question from 21-year-old activist Hamdia Ahmed of Portland. "Yes, I was afraid. Of course I was afraid but one doesn't have to be immobilized by one's fear. You can be afraid and you can continue to do the work."
Davis, 74, an acclaimed author, academic and former member of the Black Panthers and the Communist Party USA, spoke at the University of New England's Harold Alfond Arena, nearly 55 years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the university's precursor, St. Francis College.
An overwhelming crowd that organizers estimated topped 1,500 people delayed Davis' talk, "Freedom is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement," part of the college's commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

Davis spoke for almost an hour, opening by sharing her favorite quote of King's from "The Triumph of Conscience."
"We may now be in only the initial period of an era of change as far-reaching in its consequences as the American Revolution. The developed industrial nations of the world cannot remain secure islands of prosperity in a seething sea of poverty. The storm is rising against the privileged minority of the earth, from which there is no shelter in isolation and armament. The storm will not abate until a just distribution of the fruits of the earth enables man everywhere to live in dignity and human decency. The American Negro in 1967, like Crispus Attucks, may be the vanguard in a prolonged struggle that may change the shape of the world, as billions of deprived shake and transform the earth in their quest for life, freedom and justice."
"This is a very exciting moment because so many people have spoken out" against injustice, Davis said.
Davis spoke of racial violence and gender violence, asking, "Why don't we see the relevance of that work in the struggles against gender violence?"
Davis, a longtime advocate for prison reform, asked, "How ridiculous is it to assume that the violent institution of a prison can solve problems of violence people sent to prison usually end up becoming more violent Prisons are places that actually allow us to forget about solving the problem of violence."
She spoke of the ongoing federal government shutdown, adding, "I try not to mention the name of the occupant [of the White House]," and continued, "All this talk about build a wall many of the people who are trying to come to this country are fleeing violence -- often violence that is the work of U.S. capitalists."
In 1969, Davis was fired as a professor at UCLA for her membership in the Communist party, and for her efforts defending three black prisoners at Soledad prison who were accused of killing a prison guard after several African-American inmates had been killed by another guard.
During the trial of one of the three, four people including a judge were killed, and Davis was charged with murder for allegedly purchasing firearms. She fled and was listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List for months until her capture. She was ultimately acquitted of charges including conspiracy to commit murder.
Earlier this month, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, which had chosen Davis for a human rights award, rescinded the award following protests over her support for a boycott of Israel until it ends the occupation of the West Bank, the New York Times reported.
On Wednesday, she mentioned the controversy, and briefly discussed Palestine.
"This is an exciting moment because we're finally beginning to recognize, as Dr. King said, 'Justice is indivisible,'" she said. "He said, 'I am not going to be concerned about justice for Negroes in the United States because I know that justice is indivisible, and injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'"
Among other questions fielded by Davis was one posed by a Warren man who asked her response to former Gov. Paul LePage's remarks that "black and hispanic men are the enemy."
Davis wasn't familiar with LePage's comment, but advocated for "a very strong movement against racism" and "revitaliz[ing] existing anti-racism movements" in Maine.
"The existing political leadership of the country has created an environment that has brought out all of the worst forms of racism," she said. "We're seeing forms of racism that are very much linked to the period after slavery, and people are erupting again."

Kamala Harris opens presidential bid

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Kamala Harris, a first-term senator and former California attorney general known for her rigorous questioning of President Donald Trump's nominees, entered the Democratic presidential race on Monday. Harris would be the first woman to hold the presidency and the second African-American.
Harris, 54, who grew up in Oakland, California, is one of the earliest high-profile Democrats to join what is expected to be a crowded field. She made her long anticipated announcement on ABC's "Good Morning America.
"I am running for president of the United States, she said. "And I'm very excited about it.
She portrayed herself as a fighter for justice, decency and equality in a video distributed by her campaign as she announced her bid. "They're the values we as Americans cherish, and they're all on the line now, Harris says in the video. "The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values.
On ABC, she cited her years as a prosecutor in asserting: "My entire career has been focused on keeping people safe. It is probably one of the things that motivates me more than anything else.
Harris launched her presidential bid as the nation observes what would have been the 90th birthday of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The timing was a clear signal that the California senator- who has joked that she had a "stroller's-eye view of the civil rights movement because her parents wheeled her and her sister Maya to protests - sees herself as another leader in that fight.
The opening hours of Harris' campaign included a number of cultural touchstones aside from her decision to announce her bid on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Staffers said her timing, and the design and color of her campaign logo, were a nod to Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination 47 years ago this week. Upon returning to Washington, Harris spoke to reporters at Howard University, the historically black college that she attended as an undergraduate and on Monday described as "one of the most important aspects of my life.
Harris, the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, faced at least one question about her heritage on Monday. When a reporter, who noted she is both African-American and Indian-American, asked how she would describe herself, Harris replied: "How do I describe myself? I describe myself as a proud American. That's how I describe myself.
She skipped the formality of forming an exploratory committee, instead going all in on a presidential bid.
She plans a formal campaign launch in Oakland on Jan. 27. The campaign will be based in Baltimore, with a second office in Oakland.
Harris joins what is expected to be a wide-open race for the Democratic presidential nomination. There's no apparent front-runner at this early stage, and Harris will face off against several Senate colleagues.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have both formed exploratory committees. Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are also looking at the race.
If Booker enters the race, he and Harris could face fierce competition for support from black voters.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the 2016 Democratic nomination, is also considering a campaign. Several other Democrats have already declared their intentions, including former Maryland Rep. John Delaney and former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro.
Harris launches her campaign fresh off of a tour to promote her latest memoir, "The Truths We Hold, which was widely seen as a stage-setter for a presidential bid.
She is already planning her first trip to an early primary state as a declared candidate. On Friday, Harris will travel to South Carolina to attend the Pink Ice Gala in Columbia, which is hosted by a South Carolina chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which Harris pledged as an undergraduate student at Howard University. The sorority, founded more than 100 years ago, is a stronghold in the African-American community.
South Carolina, where black voters make up a large share of the Democratic electorate, is likely to figure heavily into Harris' prospects. And early voting in Harris' home state of California will now overlap with the traditional early nominating contests, which could give Harris a boost.
She also has planned a trip to Iowa, where she campaigned on behalf of Democrats during the 2018 midterm elections.
Asked Monday about her path to the nomination, Harris said it would go "through all of the states that are the 50 states of the United States.
"It is going to be about speaking truth, especially when there has been so much that is contrary to truth, she said.
Harris' campaign team is already taking shape and includes several veterans of Democratic politics.
Juan Rodriguez, who ran her 2016 Senate campaign, will manage her presidential bid. Her sister, Maya Harris, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton, will be the campaign chair. The veteran campaign finance lawyer Marc Elias will serve as the campaign's general counsel, and Angelique Cannon, who worked for Clinton's 2016 campaign, will serve as national finance director. David Huynh, who was Clinton's director of delegate operations in 2016, will serve as a senior adviser. Lily Adams, a Clinton campaign alum who has worked as Harris' spokeswoman, will be communications director.
Her staff says she plans to reject the assistance of a super PAC, as well as corporate PAC money. She's invested heavily in cultivating a digital, small-dollar donor network.
Before her 2016 victory in the Senate race, Harris made her career in law enforcement. She served as the district attorney in San Francisco before she was elected attorney general.
Harris is likely to face questions about her law enforcement record, particularly after the Black Lives Matter movement and activists across the country pushed for a criminal justice overhaul. Her prosecutorial record has recently come under new scrutiny after a blistering opinion piece in The New York Times criticized her repeated claim that she was a "progressive prosecutor, focused on changing a broken criminal justice system from within.
Harris addressed her law enforcement background in her book. She argued it was a "false choice to decide between supporting the police and advocating for greater scrutiny of law enforcement.

Texto completo: Westbrook's world famous ice disk is ready for its close-up -- at least it better be.
There's now a webcam that broadcasts the daytime movements of the disk, which has been spinning in the Presumpscot River for more than a week and continues its counterclockwise rotation, despite a new covering of several inches of fresh snow over the weekend.
Such disks are known to occur under just the right conditions, but the Westbrook version has the advantage of being unusually large -- about 100 yards across -- and in a downtown location where it's easy to see. And where, perhaps, it's too accessible -- someone planted a small American flag in the disk's center and a rainbow flag on a pole near the edge of the disk.
Although city officials are discouraging anyone from trying to walk onto or otherwise disturb the disk, the flag on the outer edge does allow those monitoring the disk from the comfort of home to spot the steady counterclockwise rotation of the phenomenon.
The image can be found at mooseheadwebcams.com, which primarily has webcam images of various spots around Moosehead Lake in northern Maine.
Tina Radel, the city of Westbrook's marketing and communications manager, said Brown University asked to put up the webcam to monitor the growth and eventual demise of the ice disk. Rob Mitchell, the owner of a building on Ash Street, gave his approval, and Ethos Marketing, which is the building's tenant, allowed the college to access its internet network to stream the pictures.
The webcam captures an image once every minute, and the site includes a clip of the previous day's images strung together for a time-lapse of the disk that effectively shows it in motion.
Radel said the disk seemed to get a little smaller Sunday as a storm moved into the state but then appeared to rebound after the precipitation stopped and cold air swept in.
"It actually looks like it grew larger last night," she said.
The disk has attracted worldwide media attention with reports by the BBC, U.S. television networks, The Boston Globe and The New York Times, among others.
The interest seems to have ebbed somewhat, Radel said, although she got emails Monday seeking approval to use time-lapse images -- which Radel put on the city's Facebook page -- from a site in France and from The Washington Post. News about the storm on the East Coast seemed to overwhelm interest in the disk on Saturday and Sunday.
"It slowed down, which was nice for the weekend," she said.
The disk actually stopped spinning last Wednesday when it got stuck to ice on the riverbank. A Freeport man came to the rescue Thursday with a paddleboard and an ice pick and broke it free.
Besides the media attention, the ice disk has drawn crowds to Westbrook as people feel compelled to see the phenomenon in person. That has pleased the operators of downtown business, including one bar that has been serving "Ice Disk Cosmos."

WhatsApp limits number of people you can forward messages to in effort to reduce rumors, fake news

Texto completo: The popular text messaging service WhatsApp Messenger is limiting how widely users can share messages in an effort to reduce the spread of false information.
Previously, users could forward messages to up to 20 recipients, but now the limit will be five.
At a press event in Indonesia, WhatsApp said it decided to move forward after a six-month test of the five-recipient limit in India. The country experienced violence last summer after viral hoax messages resulted in more than a dozen lynchings, CNN reported.
Like Facebook, which has been battling misuse on its platform, WhatsApp – the world's most popular messaging app, with 1. 5 billion users – is also fighting to wipe out fake information on the social network. Similar to Facebook, WhatsApp allows users to send encrypted texts, photos and video on a one-to-one basis.
In an opinion article for The New York Times in October, three researchers said that 44 percent of Brazilian voters were getting their information from WhatsApp, and that much of it wasn't credible: "The app was used to spread alarming amounts of misinformation, rumors and false news. " The researchers called on WhatsApp in October to restrict forwards.
Despite five sounding like a small number, The Verge points out that messages could still get forwarded to groups, which can have as many as 256 people. "That means a forwarded message could be put in front of nearly 1,300 people, despite the five time limit. "
The WhatsApp update will launch first to users on the Android platform, which is more heavily used overseas, and then to Apple's iOS.
“WhatsApp carefully evaluated this test and listened to user feedback over a six-month period," the company said in a statement. "The forward limit significantly reduced forwarded messages around the world. Starting today, all users on the latest versions of WhatsApp can now forward to only five chats at once, which will help keep WhatsApp focused on private messaging with close contacts. We'll continue to listen to user feedback about their experience, and over time, look for new ways of addressing viral content. ”

RACISTS TO THE RIGHT, ANTI-SEMITES TO THE LEFT IN A POPULIST AGE, CAN PARTY ESTABLISHMENTS SIDELINE BIGOTS?

Texto completo: The past five years in Western politics has seen a repeated failure of "cordons sanitaires" - the barriers that political establishments have tried to throw up against both radical ideas and xenophobic sentiments. The rise of populism and the return of socialism have breached these cordons, and racism and Judeophobia have come through the breach with them - to the point where it's entirely plausible that Britain will soon find itself with a prime minister, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has an anti-Semitism problem, even as the United States has already elected a birther to the presidency.
This week we're watching two interesting attempts to re-establish or shore up those old barriers. On the right, there's the congressional Republican effort to isolate Steve King, the Iowa congressman whose racist comments and flirtations with white nationalism have become, at long last, a matter of severe embarrassment to his colleagues. On the left, there's the mass exodus of corporate and political sponsors from this weekend's Women's March, which has fallen into controversy because of some of its leaders' ties to Louis Farrakhan, and reports that anti-Semitic canards were aired at its organizing meetings.
The two efforts are similar but not parallel. The push against King is an attempt to redraw a line effaced by Donald Trump's race-baiting, and since as you may have noticed Mr. Trump is still the president, it matters only as a possible marker for a post-Trump Republican future, not a defining statement for the GOP today. The exodus from the Women's March, on the other hand, is an attempt to get out ahead of a problem before it becomes worse - before anti-Semitism migrates from the left-wing fringe to the center, before the party starts getting its own versions of Jeremy Corbyn in positions of real influence.
This is not to say that anti-Semitism or other paranoid worldviews are a new problem on the left, or that the Democratic Party has always handled them effectively. The permanent prominence of Al Sharpton and the eternal return of Michael Moore testify to certain unsuccessful reckonings, and the grass-roots left can be as amenable to conspiracy theories as the grass-roots right. But the fact that Mr. Trump is in the White House while the Democratic National Committee bails on the Women's March illustrates a fundamental difference; if the Democrats struggle with the tiger, the Republicans have let it leap the cage.
But it's possible that this is changing, with the Women's March's eccentric leadership as a leading indicator, and that a more left-wing, populist, anti-establishment Democratic Party - a party reshaped by Ocasio-Cortezan energy, shall we say - will become increasingly influenced by paranoias and bigotries that bubble up on the far left. (The Democrats are already vulnerable to paranoias of the center, like the obsessive fixation on Vladimir Putin's puppeteering whenever populism wins another victory - but that's a subject for another time.)
For liberals pondering how to sustain a quarantine in a more populist future, the right's experience with (and leading up to) Mr. Trump offers several lessons. The first is the obvious one: For a quarantine to work, you have to be willing to commit to it even when it has electoral costs. That's emphatically not what Republicans working to sideline Steve King are doing; they've turned on him only after a hard-fought midterm election in which they didn't want to lose his seat. In this sense the partial G.O.P. abandonment of Roy Moore, which helped cost the party a Senate seat, was a more limited but also more important case study in how to establish a cordon sanitaire.
The ascent of Trump was the opposite case. The party establishment could have worked to marginalize or exclude him from the primary process; the birtherism alone offered grounds enough. But the GOP feared the possibility of a Trump third-party run too much to take a stand or draw a line - and because it didn't, imagining that he could never win, many more lines have subsequently ended up erased.
The second lesson is less high-minded and more complicated. You can't make your quarantine too broad, or you'll end up repressing ideas that need to be debated, and empowering demagogues when they're the only ones who will talk about them. The centrist political parties of Europe have fallen victim to this trap; their respectable consensus excluded far too much (skepticism of the euro, of austerity, of mass immigration) and reaped the whirlwind when centrist governance stopped working. And the pre-Trump Republicans had a similar problem: By trying to simply bury the "America First!" ideas that Pat Buchanan ran on in the 1990s, they created a return-of-the-repressed scenario, where a big swath of their own voters felt chronically unrepresented and ignored and turned eagerly to Mr. Trump.
For Democrats, this dilemma is likely to play out over foreign policy, and especially policy toward Israel. Anti-Zionism isn't necessarily anti-Semitism, but the difference can get blurry quick, and the Israel debate is the place where rhetorical poison seems most likely to infect left-wing politics. Which means that most establishment Democrats would prefer not to have debates about Israel at all, just as most establishment Republicans circa 2013 hoped to stop debating immigration.
But for a party whose base is clearly less sympathetic toward Israel than Democratic elders in D.C., repressing the debate would be a mistake - because then anti-Zionism is more likely to percolate below the party's surface and then bubble up as bigotry. The challenge is to figure out how to quarantine those kinds of hatreds and also represent your voters - because if you fail at the second task, even with the highest of principles the quarantine won't hold.
And it also won't hold, to reach our final lesson, if you fail egregiously at governing. Where did Donald Trump come from, ultimately? From the presidency of George W. Bush, in which establishment-Republican blunders gave us the Iraq debacle and the financial crisis. Where did European populism come from, ultimately? From the misgovernment of the eurozone by respectable centrists. Why have the Democrats managed to keep the cranks at bay more successfully than the GOP? Because the party's elite has mostly kept the trust of the party's base.
I say "mostly" because the shocking defeat of Hillary Clinton did create a power vacuum in which more crankish figures - from various Resistance grifters to the Women's March's Farrakhan-friendly organizers - have gained prominence. But still, nothing like the prominence now enjoyed by grifters on the right.
For the Democratic Party's cordon sanitaire to really fail, you would need something that Mr. Bush delivered, that Barack Obama avoided, and that Democrats should (obviously) hope their next president avoids as well - a failed presidency, in which the bonds of trust between voters and party leaders are decisively severed.
Without wishing liberalism well, I also hope it doesn't come to that.

Texto completo: Mariano Rivera will not be the only player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame this week on his first try. Public ballots have shown overwhelming support for Roy Halladay, the former ace of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies. If Halladay were here, he would surely acknowledge that Rivera, the sublime Yankees closer, helped nudge him over the Cooperstown border.
Halladay died on Nov. 7, 2017, at age 40 when the small plane he was piloting crashed into shallow water near Holiday, Fla. In one of his final interviews, he enthusiastically recalled a tutorial with Rivera at the 2008 All-Star Game, and a tip that gave him his final burst of brilliance.
"I'd been watching Mariano a lot, and my cutter was pretty good, but it wasn't always consistent," Halladay said in March 2017 at a picnic table beneath palm trees at the Phillies' training complex in Clearwater, Fla. "There were times where it would be really good and other times when it just wasn't as effective. Mariano really helped me."
I had chased Halladay for more than two years to set up this conversation. I needed his perspective for a book I was writing on pitching -- "K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches," to be published this spring by Doubleday -- and knew he would be a critical voice.
As The New York Times's Yankees beat writer for most of his Blue Jays tenure, I had marveled at Halladay -- the way he stoically baited elite hitters into tentative swings and never seemed satisfied unless he had worked nine innings. He had just returned to the Phillies in 2017 as an instructor, advising minor leaguers on the mental side of the sport. Halladay had rebuilt his confidence and delivery early in his career, and he never stopped reinventing himself on the mound.
With his cutter, Halladay suspected that the problem was his thumb position. Rivera was a legend by then, on his way to a record 652 career saves, and his name became synonymous with the cutter, a pitch he had found by accident but had mastered like no other. He confirmed Halladay's guess.
"Sure enough," Halladay said, "he told me that one of the keys for him was making sure he wrapped his thumb under and got it on the opposite side of the ball."
When Halladay threw his sinker, with his index and middle fingers along the narrow seams, he placed his thumb directly under his index finger on the bottom of the ball. When he threw his cutter, which he held with his index and middle fingers across the wide part of the seams, he always put his thumb in the same spot.
Rivera showed Halladay his technique, bending his thumb at the knuckle and tucking it under the ball, so the nail was even with the middle finger, not the index finger. This kept the thumb pad from blocking the ball's spin as it left his hand, allowing the index and middle fingers to pull through unimpeded and send it on its path, veering inside to a lefty hitter and away from a righty.
I handed Halladay a ball, and he wrapped it in Rivera's grip, holding his arm out straight.
"So now if you look at it from behind, you have all the ball sticking out on this side," he said, and from the pitcher's perspective, you could see at least half the ball peeking out from the left side of the hand. The rest of the ball was covered by Halladay's fingers.
"So now it's overloaded. It almost has to go that way," he said. "When I got my thumb underneath the index finger, it was still centered. But as soon as I get it moved over, then all of a sudden, it overloads the ball on that side."
Did it feel natural right away?
"It took a little while," Halladay said, "and it was so awkward at times that when it was really good, I traced my fingers on the ball with a pen. I just took a black ballpoint pen and traced it, right where my finger placement was, and I put it in my locker and just stored it and kept it with me. Well the next spring, I was throwing it and it wasn't working, I wasn't getting results out of it. So I went back and picked up that ball and just grabbed it without looking at the marks. And sure enough, my thumb was back to here, where it felt comfortable.
"So I put it back on that mark where it was a little uncomfortable at first, but sure enough, it came right back. Then you get used to it, and you're like, 'O.K.' But it was a pitch that you really had to monitor where you were, how you grip it, because you could get in bad habits just from long tossing. It's just an odd place to throw a ball."
Halladay beat the Yankees three times in the second half of the 2008 season; when Rivera's teammates learned of his generosity to a rival, they fined him in kangaroo court. For Halladay, it was a springboard.
In the three years that followed -- one with Toronto, two with Philadelphia -- Halladay was the best pitcher in baseball. He threw the most innings, averaged 19 victories a season, and his 2.53 earned run average was the lowest among pitchers with at least 75 starts. He won his second Cy Young Award, threw a perfect game and then threw just the second postseason no-hitter in major league history.
Those three years gave Halladay a full decade at the top of his game -- fewer dominant seasons than some Hall of Famers, but enough to sway the voters. Had he instead declined sharply after 2008, he would have been the same kind of candidate as Johan Santana.
Santana collected just 2.4 percent of the vote in last year's election, not enough to stay on the ballot. But for seven seasons for the Minnesota Twins and the Mets -- 2004 through 2010 -- Santana was every bit as dominant as Halladay was in his first seven seasons of success (2002 through 2008).
In Santana's seven-year run, he had 110 wins and a 2.87 E.R.A., with a WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) of 1.063. In his first seven years of stardom, Halladay had 113 wins and a 3.19 E.R.A., with a 1.132 WHIP. Santana had more strikeouts, Halladay fewer walks. But their results were essentially the same.
For Santana, though, that was just about all he had. Besides a three-month renaissance in 2012 (including the Mets' long-awaited first no-hitter), Santana was finished. At his peak, he pitched like a Hall of Famer. But his prime was just too short.
Halladay's prime lasted just long enough. It was not all thanks to Rivera's cut fastball, of course. But in those first three seasons after Rivera's help, Halladay threw the cutter for 40 percent of his pitches -- more often than any other starter in baseball. His other favorite pitch, the sinker, moved in the opposite direction. At times, it seemed unfair.
"Toughest on me? Halladay, that sinker and cutter," Derek Jeter told me last spring. "I tried to just guess which way it's going to go -- and I always guessed wrong."
Jeter hit .234 in his career against Halladay, whose control was so impeccable that his walk rate in those three years (1.24 per nine innings) was the best in the game. And if he ever lost the feel for the cutter, he knew where to find it: on the ball with Rivera's grip traced onto it.
"I'd keep it in my locker, and when we'd go on the road, I put it in my travel bag," Halladay said. "Stuck it in a shoe, wherever I went, and if I was struggling, I'd just pick it up. I carried it the rest of my career."
Perhaps that ball remains among Halladay's career possessions. What a poignant artifact it would be for the display case honoring the new inductees in Cooperstown.

How a gay White House adviser helped purge homosexuals from government

Texto completo: In 1957, the New York Times published a profile of President Dwight Eisenhower's first assistant for national security affairs, a position that would eventually become known as national security adviser. "No man in the Government, with the possible exception of the President, knows so many of the nation's strategic secrets," the Times declared of Robert "Bobby" Cutler. The paper then employed a mess of contradictions to describe this Massachusetts Republican, which was not so much the oxymoron then that it is today. "A proper Bostonian" who is also a "Rabelasian with a salty vocabulary," "an earnest Episcopalian" and "a man who can move so quickly from ribaldry to piety and back to ribaldry again," "a 'slave driver' who can force his staff to work as hard as he works himself" but also "a charming and generous friend," Cutler was "a bachelor's bachelor . . . who has had a lifelong love affair" not with any person but with his home town, Boston.
To add another paradox, barely hinted at by the Times: Cutler was a gay man who sat atop the national security bureaucracy at a time when people like him were being purged from government service.
This we know thanks to a new biography, "Ike's Mystery Man: The Secret Lives of Robert Cutler." Written by Cutler's great-nephew, Peter Shinkle, it is based largely upon a set of secret diaries that Cutler wrote during his time in the Eisenhower administration and that he never intended anyone, except the (human) object of his affection, to see. While the interests of America's historical record - long bereft of gay history, which is often elusive by nature - may be served by revealing the intimate details of Cutler's interior life, whether he merits a full-length biography is another matter.
Born into a Boston Brahmin family, Cutler was a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. After working as a lawyer, banker and political fixer, he got to know Eisenhower personally as an aide on his 1952 national whistle-stop campaign train tour. As much as Cutler's bloodline made him a natural fit for the WASP aristocracy leading the new Eisenhower administration, his sexual orientation threatened his privileged position.
Shortly after swearing the oath of office, Eisenhower began weeding "subversives" out of the federal government. Elected amid the Red Scare, Ike had won the presidency partly because of a sense that the long-reigning Democrats were soft on communism, which in the public mind had become linked with homosexuality. A whisper campaign, abetted by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, tarred the recently divorced Democratic nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as a homosexual; Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen (Ill.) associated Stevenson with "the lavender lads of the State Department." Ike's campaign slogan, "Let's Clean House," alluded not only to corruption but sedition and sexual impropriety.
On Inauguration Day, Attorney General Herbert Brownell submitted a draft executive order to the new president mandating security background checks for all new federal employees. The following day, Cutler suggested a more sweeping policy, one that had been proposed by a government commission during the previous Truman administration but never implemented. Under the regulations advised by the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security, "sexual perversion" should be a factor in determining whether an employee posed a security risk, alongside the more conventional menace of communist sympathies. While "sexual perversion" was undefined, its intended target was obvious: homosexuals.
As a result of Executive Order 10450, signed by the president on April 27, 1953, thousands of patriotic gay men and women lost their jobs in what later became known as the "Lavender Scare," far more than would ever fall victim to the much more infamous Red Scare. Shinkle's contribution to history is his revelation that a gay man played an important bureaucratic role in this tragedy by advocating a policy that lowered the threshold for dismissal from disloyalty to homosexuality.
There are not many more such previously undisclosed moments in this book, however, much of which treads familiar Cold War history. In chapters rehashing the controversy over Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance, U.S.-sponsored coups in Iran and Guatemala, and the evolving U.S. nuclear weapons posture, Cutler emerges as a bystander to far more significant figures like Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, CIA Director Allen Dulles and Hoover. Shinkle does recount an exchange involving the latter figure, which, in light of what he has revealed about Cutler's sexual orientation, can be read in a somewhat humorous light. Following a leave of absence Cutler took during the "politically sensitive" period around the 1956 reelection campaign, which may have been prompted by rumormongering about his sexuality, Hoover wrote the returning administration official a letter. "Dear Bobbie," the FBI director - himself a bachelor long dogged by gay rumors - began, conspicuously using the feminine form. Cutler, no less catty in his reply, used letterhead from the bank at which he was working, embellished with the image of a Puritan and the motto, "Worthy of Your Trust."
"Ike's Mystery Man" becomes a genuinely engrossing read in its final third, when Cutler develops a romantic interest in a National Security Council staffer half his age. Thus begins, by his own description, "the greatest adventure of my life," an adventure that is by turns pathetic and illuminating. Pathetic, as the romance is unrequited yet strung along by the younger man, who at most admits to platonic love for Cutler. Illuminating, because it resembles the experiences of countless men and women who, forced for so long to mask their true selves, appeared to the world as mysteries.
Peter Shinkle will discuss "Ike's Mystery Man" with Michael Isikoff, chief investigative correspondent of Yahoo News, at Politics and Prose on Jan. 20. at 1 p.m. James Kirchick , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author of "The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues and the Coming Dark Age." He is writing a history of gay Washington.

Texto completo: TLAHUELILPAN, Mexico -- Mexico's president vowed on Saturday to redouble his fight against an epidemic of fuel theft after thieves punctured a pipeline north of Mexico City, causing an explosion that killed at least 73 people and injured 74 others.
The blast underscored the deadly perils of the fuel-theft racket, which has cost the government billions of dollars a year and has been the target of a weekslong crackdown by the administration of Mexico's new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
The government's strategy has included diverting fuel from the pipelines most heavily targeted by criminal gangs, and transporting it by truck. But the logistical changes have slowed deliveries across the country, causing shortages and long lines at service stations.
Mr. López Obrador, who visited the area early Saturday, insisted that the disaster showed why his strategy was more necessary than ever: Fuel theft not only inflicts financial damage on the nation, but it also exacts a deadly toll.
"We have to continue with the plan to end fuel theft," Mr. López Obrador said during a news conference later at the presidential palace in Mexico City. "We will not stop. We will eradicate this."
The fuel theft crisis is an early test of Mr. López Obrador's efforts to combat the country's worsening security landscape. He has said he intends to both strengthen the nation's security apparatus and address underlying social issues, such as inequality and poverty.
Last Wednesday, the lower house of Mexico's Congress approved the creation of a 60,000-member national guard composed of police officers and military personnel to handle the nation's public security tasks, including its fight against organized crime. The proposal has been widely criticized by opposition parties and human rights activists who say it represents a further militarization of policing.
Friday's explosion, which occurred in a rural, impoverished part of the state of Hidalgo, was particularly deadly because the breach in the pipeline created by criminals had also lured hundreds of villagers from the municipality of Tlahuelilpan, drawn by the promise of free gasoline.
That section of pipeline had been among the parts of the fuel transportation network that had been temporarily shut as part of the government's strategy to curb theft. But the flow through the tube resumed on Friday, just hours before thieves punctured it, officials said.
Gov. Omar Fayad of Hidalgo told reporters that his state, like others, had suffered fuel shortages as a result of the government's strategy.
Residents who gathered at the explosion site on Saturday said that while opportunism had prompted some residents to flock to the illegal pipeline tap on Friday, many others were compelled by the shortages created by the government crackdown.
Villagers, they said, were desperate to find gas for their personal use.
"If there hadn't been such a bad shortage, this tragedy would not have happened and innocent people would not have died," said Raúl Linares, 30, a farmer. "People didn't have a way to move around, get to their jobs, go anywhere."
He added: "We agree with fighting fuel theft, but not this way because it is us who ultimately paid the price." Mr. Linares said one of his nephews was badly burned in the explosion and another was missing.
Videos taken before the blast showed a raucous atmosphere at the site, with villagers from Tlahuelilpan, including families, laughing as they filled plastic jugs, pails and canisters with the gasoline, which gushed from the break like a geyser.
In the footage, military personnel who had rushed to the scene can be seen standing by and observing the throng that had converged on the pipeline, which connects to the nearby Tula refinery operated by the government-run oil firm Petróleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex.
Mexico's defense secretary, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, said that about 25 troops were on the scene, but the contingent was not large enough to turn back the 600 to 800 villagers who had swarmed the site. He said that his troops tried to persuade residents to retreat but their entreaties were ignored, and some of the people turned "aggressive" toward the soldiers.
About two hours after the authorities learned of the break, the fuel ignited, causing a huge explosion and sending flames and clouds of smoke into the sky. Videos and photographs circulating on social media and broadcast on Mexican news channels showed people engulfed in fire running away from the blaze and victims screaming in pain and wailing for help.
The fire took more than four hours to extinguish and left a blackened scar in the landscape.
It was the deadliest pipeline explosion in Mexico in recent memory. In 2010, at least 27 people were killed, scores injured and numerous homes destroyed in a blast in San Martín Texmelucan de Labastida, a city in the state of Puebla. That, too, was caused by an illegal siphoning effort, officials said.
On Saturday afternoon, forensic investigators and military police officers were examining the scene as scores of residents watched. Some villagers said they hoped to glean information about missing relatives.
"We are all mourning today," said Angela Perez, 54, two of whose neighbors were among the dead. Ms. Perez theorized that many villagers who had flocked to the pipeline rupture wanted to get gasoline to resell.
"But it was a foolish mistake," she said. "Look what happened."
Fuel theft has been a longstanding problem in Mexico that, until recent years, was mostly written off by the government as a business cost, analysts said. But the problem began to worsen about a decade ago as organized crime groups started to diversify their portfolios.
Rising international fuel prices made the crime increasingly attractive. The crime groups co-opted officials at all levels of government using bribery and violence, and won support among impoverished local populations with a steady supply of low-cost, black-market fuel and offers of relatively lucrative employment as lookouts and fuel couriers.
Much of the theft occurs through taps drilled under the cover of darkness into pipelines that carry fuel from the nation's ports and refineries to distribution centers across the country. Though much of the pipeline system runs underground, thieves operating in remote regions and doing quick work with shovels have been easily able to unearth the pipes. They have generally used high-powered drills to perforate the pipes, installing taps to siphon the fuel.
The problem has worsened in recent years. During the first 10 months of last year, the authorities discovered more than 12,500 illegal taps -- nearly double the number discovered in all of 2016 and more than 27 times the number a decade ago.
In a news conference on Saturday morning, Octavio Romero, the general director of Pemex, said that in the past three months, thieves had drilled at least 10 holes in the same pipeline that exploded on Friday, also causing fires.
"Oil theft does not only gravely affect our country's economy," Governor Fayad said in a statement to The New York Times. "Today the state of Hidalgo is crying because of this tragedy, which has taken so many people's lives. Such regrettable events should never happen again in Mexico."
He said the death toll could climb even higher.
"Many of the gravely wounded are battling between life and death," Governor Fayad said.
The governor also appealed to the public to help the authorities curb the fuel-theft epidemic, calling on Mexicans "to help us fight this widespread phenomenon and to stay away from pipelines that have been seized or ruptured."
Mr. López Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, said about $3.14 billion in fuel had been drained from the system last year and sold on the black market. As part of the crackdown, he has deployed about 4,000 military and police personnel to guard the nation's fuel infrastructure.

Texto completo: What would you do if you could spend $1 billion a week on any cause, political movement or society-improving innovation of your choice and still have almost $20 billion left over after a year?
Such is the happy problem that may soon be facing MacKenzie Bezos, one-half of the richest couple on Earth. She and her husband, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, recently announced plans to divorce after 25 years of marriage.
With half of the family fortune, Bezos would be worth about $70 billion, solidifying a title she may already hold - the richest woman in the world.
We don't know her politics or her intentions. The Bezoses have spent money supporting same-sex marriage, early education and help for homeless families. Jeff Bezos is a quirky libertarian, and his Washington Post has been a scrappy counter to a president who has made a punching bag out of the Constitution.
But it's crucial that the Democratic Party, now going through another torturous fight between its soak-the-rich side and the progressive pragmatists, remain open to enlightened people of wealth.
"No to the billionaires," Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in the first days of her campaign for president. "We are the Democratic Party and that is the party of the people."
Her brushback pitch was aimed at candidates rich enough to self-fund their campaigns, like Michael Bloomberg. But this kind of binary thinking is a slight to history. The best president of the 20th century, Franklin Roosevelt, was a product of dynastic family wealth, as was John Kennedy. The Obamas, with their newfound riches from books and ventures into the entertainment industry, will soon have the kind of money to draw snark from the socialist wing of their party.
And Warren may have missed the announcement of another rich guy running for president as a Democrat, the venture capitalist Andrew Yang. He's campaigning on a plan to guarantee every American aged 18 to 64 a basic income of $1,000 a month, paid for by a new tax on companies benefiting most from automation.
I know, I know: The last thing a country struggling with Neo-Gilded Age inequality needs is more influence from billionaire supercitizens. It's bad enough that the Koch brothers bought themselves a budget-busting tax cut and an energy policy hatched in their corporate boardroom. 
The progressive billionaires - Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett - are a different breed of fat cat. Buffett, the third-richest man in the world, has been saying "Tax me more" for years - or at least, "Tax me at the same rate as my secretary." Like Bill Gates, who is the second-richest man in the world, he has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune.
Last year, Tom Steyer spent more than $100 million of his own money helping Democrats get elected, and he says he will drop another bundle on Senate races in 2020. Look what he got for his Democratic House: new members calling for a 70 percent tax rate on earnings over $10 million. Steyer, Gates and Buffett are going to get soaked for their political passions. And good for them.
The ideal financing model is one perfected by Beto O'Rourke. He raised $80 million, without sucking up to PACs or corporate donors, and nearly knocked off the most hated man in the Senate, Ted Cruz of Texas.
But we don't live in an ideal world. Which brings us back to MacKenzie Bezos, a novelist of some acclaim. 
I would bet that the time Bezos spent studying creative writing at Princeton under Toni Morrison did not make her want to build a wall or turn a blind eye to climate change. If her heart is open to benevolence for the greater good, then the least the Democrats can do is not close the door.
Timothy Egan, based in the Pacific Northwest, writes a column for the New York Times.

Texto completo: TURKEY
Graham says slow Syria withdrawal ANKARA — After lengthy meetings with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Senator Lindsey Graham called on Saturday for a slower, smarter withdrawal of US troops from Syria to avoid setting off a broader war and a nightmare for Turkey. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has a long familiarity with Turkey and its place in the NATO alliance, and he said he was on a mission to ensure that the US withdrawal announced by President Trump in December did not cause greater damage that would be against US interests in the long run. “I can understand the desire to withdraw, but withdrawal without a plan is chaos," he told a news briefing in Ankara, the Turkish capital. “It would be Iraq on steroids," he warned, in a reference to how the Islamic State group gained power after the withdrawal of US forces from the country in 2011. Graham's trip to Turkey came after an aborted visit by the White House national security adviser, John Bolton, who left the country without meeting with Erdogan. (New York Times)
FRANCE
Yellow vest protests reach 10th weekend PARIS — Thousands of yellow vest protesters rallied in several French cities for a 10th consecutive weekend on Saturday, despite a national debate launched this week by President Emmanuel Macron aimed at assuaging their anger. In Paris, protesters answered a call from a prominent and provocative protester promoting a march starting at the Invalides monument in Paris, home to Napoleon's tomb, to remember the 10 people killed in protest-related traffic accidents and hundreds injured since the movement kicked off Nov. 17. Police have been criticized by protesters for the use of rubber projectiles that have left dozens injured. Paris deployed 5,000 police around the capital, notably around government buildings and the Champs-Elysees, stage of recent violence. (AP)
BOLIVIA
Two-bus collision kills at least 22 LA PAZ — Police in Bolivia say a head-on highway collision between two buses has killed at least 22 people and injured 37 others. The accident occurred Saturday on the road to Challapata, a town about 155 miles from the main city of La Paz. Challapata Mayor Martin Feliciano said the death toll may rise. A police report said that the accident was due to excessive speed and one of the buses may have driven into the oncoming lane. (AP)
Australia
Man charged in murder of student MELBOURNE — Authorities in Australia have charged a 20-year-old man with the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, an Israeli exchange student who was attacked on a Melbourne street last week. The man, Codey Herrmann, of the Melbourne suburb of Greensborough, was arrested Friday afternoon and was charged in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Saturday. He was being held without bail and was scheduled to appear in court again Monday. The police allege that Herrmann, who has been described by local news media as an aspiring rapper, killed Maasarwe, 21, just after midnight Wednesday. She had been returning from a night out with friends and was speaking via FaceTime to her sister, who was overseas, on the short walk from a public transportation stop to her home when the attack occurred, the police said.

Texto completo: Just before Christmas, a story broke that seemed too strange — and too hypocritical — to be true. As Democratic Party elders were trying to stifle loutish impeachment threats by fanatical House freshmen, it was revealed that Democratic operatives had used cyber fraud to manipulate the 2017 Alabama Senate race.
It’s hard to know precisely who masterminded the plot because the perpetrators have lawyered up and are pointing fingers at one another. But according to the New York Times and subsequent reporting in The Washington Post, the culprits in the self-styled “Project Birmingham” used the same tactics employed by Russian disinformation specialists that lie at the heart of the 2016 U.S. presidential election controversy.
Those tactics included a phony Facebook page, “Alabama Conservative Politics,” intended to divert votes from GOP nominee Roy Moore to a Republican write-in candidate. It entailed a “false flag” effort suggesting that automated Russian bots were supporting Moore on Twitter. The tactics worked. Seven weeks before the election, the Montgomery Advertiser published a piece headlined “Russian invasion? Roy Moore sees spike in Twitter followers from land of Putin.” Other news outlets followed suit, further tarnishing a candidate reeling under sexual misconduct allegations.
Did this effort cost Moore the election, which he narrowly lost to Doug Jones? Did dirty tricks deprive Republicans of a supposedly safe seat at a time when control the U.S. Senate was up for grabs? Some observers are skeptical. “Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted him as their senator before the race even started,” University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith told reporters.
That sounds right, but the same could be said of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Even Democrats who claim the 2016 election was stolen from them would concede that almost everyone had “settled opinions” about these two nominees before Russian troll farms began spewing their garbage during the 2016 general election. But the truly stunning hypocrisy is that Project Birmingham, which included a former Google engineer who worked on the 2012 Obama presidential campaign and for the Obama administration, faithfully emulated the tactics of the Russian troll farms dubbed “Fancy Bear” and “Cozy Bear,” which are under the auspices of Russia’s intelligence services and military.
In other words, Democrats who played games in Alabama did more than erode their party’s moral high ground. In consciously mimicking the enemy, they also put the spotlight on special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his investigation.
Last February, a grand jury impaneled to hear Mueller’s evidence indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for their 2016 activities. The special prosecutor followed this up with July indictments of 12 Russian military officers for hacking, a serious crime. But it’s the February 2018 indictments that are more problematic for Democrats.
Those 13 Russian trolls were indicted on conspiracy charges. But what laws did they conspire to break? Federal election statutes prohibiting campaign contributions, maybe? Abusing their travel visas, perhaps, as none of the Russians who visited the U.S. told U.S. Customs what they were up to? Those are misdemeanors, and it’s not what the government charged them with anyway. They were indicted for conspiring “to defraud the United States.”
It’s not a crime to post political comments under an online alias. It’s not a criminal offense in this country to spew inaccurate information on social media — or tell outright lies about candidates for public office If it were, the U.S. would need a hundred more prisons, at least one of them for politicians and campaign consultants.
Mueller’s theory of the case became clear on June 15, when Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued in court against a motion by Concord, one of the indicted Russian corporations, to dismiss the charges. The special counsel, Concord argued, targeted it “for a contrived crime not specifically defined in any statute, without notice and under a standard known only to the special counsel.”
“We do not need to prove a criminal violation of the underlying statute,” Dreeben told U.S. District Court Judge Dabney Friedrich in response.
If you find that standard alarmingly elastic, you’re not alone. “The federal government does lots of things, more and more every year, and many things private parties do can get in the government’s way,” former Justice Department lawyer Jack Townsend told Weekly Standard writer Eric Felten, one of the few journalists who explored the implications of Muller’s indictment. “It can’t be that each such action is automatically a felony.”
Yet, Dreeben was speaking the truth. “Conspiracy to defraud,” known as a “Klein conspiracy,” comes from a complex 1950s tax case in which the defendants and their accountants went to extraordinary lengths to hide income – they opened no fewer than 17 offshore companies, among other strategies – consistently thwarting the Internal Revenue Service until federal prosecutors secured a conviction on a single conspiracy count. As legal scholars Ben Wittes and Emma Kohse point out, the doctrine is even older than that. It comes from a 1910 Supreme Court ruling that USDA officials who falsified crop reports could be convicted of conspiracy “for impairing, obstructing, or defeating the lawful function of any department of government.”
Fourteen years later, in a decision written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the high court went further, ruling that conspiring to defraud the United States “also means to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful governmental functions by deceit, craft or trickery, or at least by means that are dishonest.”
Such language gives Bob Mueller a lot of leeway. How did the Russians “defraud” the United States? Not merely by technical violations of campaign finance laws, but by running a big con on the American people — impersonating Americans and pitting us against each other. In one instance, Russian trolls pretending to be both anti-Islam and pro-Islam were told to demonstrate at the same Houston location at the same time, apparently in hopes of fomenting violence.
This certainly seems a fraud on the United States. But what are we to make of the real American, a registered Democrat, no less, who posted stories in 2016 from the “Denver Guardian,” with extravagant slanders against Hillary Clinton: She pocketed millions of dollars from the Afghanistan War; an FBI agent investigating her emails was found dead – that kind of thing. Vicious stuff, all of it invented. (There is no Denver Guardian, for starters.) The perpetrator apparently did it for money. Should he be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the country? If so, then what about the utterly specious 2012 ads run by the Obama campaign blaming Mitt Romney for the death of a steelworker’s wife?
That was a form of fraud. It was most definitely a conspiracy – mapped out by Obama’s top campaign aides. I’m not saying federal prosecutors should start parsing campaign rhetoric looking for criminal intent. That would be insane, not to mention unconstitutional. Nor do the Democratic Party computer nerds who fooled around in the Alabama sandbox want any attention from the special prosecutor. But here’s Mueller’s dilemma: If he indicts Russians who targeted Democrats while giving a pass to Americans who used the exact same fraudulent means to harm Republicans, then his investigation no longer looks like it’s about the sanctity of the U.S. election process. It looks like it’s about getting Donald Trump.

Texto completo: Re "Farmers' faith in Trump is slipping," Jan. 15
President Trump's wall along the U.S.-Mexico border would be the biggest boondoggle in the history of boondoggles. This monument to bigotry would have a negligible effect on illegal immigration, despite claims from the president's most ardent supporters that our country's very survival depends on having a wall.
Our nation has vested immense power in the presidency, so Trump is able to inflict great pain upon our country and economy. He has taken hostages and is not treating them well. He has made it clear that there are no limits to the pain and suffering he would inflict on the hostages, and that he is willing to bring down the economy if his demands are not met.

Democrats can end the suffering by giving Trump the $5.7 billion he wants to start building his wall. This is a small price to pay to free the millions of innocent hostages whose lives are being needlessly disrupted.
I beg you, congressional Democrats, give Trump his wall. We can wait until he is no longer president to halt this absurd project.
Louis Mandris, Upland
::
One of the heavy ironies of the government shutdown is that the Coast Guard officers who patrol the border "wall," which extends into the Pacific Ocean, are not being paid.
After my husband and I purchased a boat in Mexico, we took it for a ride off the coast of San Diego. Suddenly, we heard a loud voice telling us that we were about to be boarded.
Minutes later, a small boat containing several Coast Guardsmen roared up. The service members were polite and professional. They searched our boat thoroughly. Had we been guilty of anything, I would have been on the floor with outspread arms in a second.
Real security is far more complex than a physical wall. It is human beings who truly protect us, and it is time for us to honor our commitment to them.
Rachael Lehmberg
Seal Beach
::
Congress knows when it must pass a budget, but time and again it waits until it reaches a crisis point. If leaders in the private sector acted this way, they would be fired.
Shame on all members of Congress and the president. This is not how Americans want the world to see how we are "making America great again."
Tony and Joyce Elia
Mission Viejo
::
The round of "tit for tat" between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) is laughable.
Still, everyone must understand that this level of government paralysis is extremely dangerous. The dysfunction emboldens our enemies and increases the likelihood of a major miscalculation as to our ability to respond to aggression.
The Cuban missile crisis was an Armageddon near-miss. Just imagine if we were to face a similar threat now.
Nicholas LaTerza
Calabasas
::
I am as liberal as the next person, but I am very disappointed by Pelosi's call to postpone Trump's State of the Union address.
This transparent political ploy will feed Trump's Twitter mill, creating a needless diversion from the real and horrifying problems raised by the shutdown.

He acts like a Russian asset
Re "Is Trump really a Russian asset? Not likely" Jan. 15
Jonah Goldberg listed several of President Trump's highly suspicious actions related to Russia while at the same time suggesting that they could have an innocent explanation.
Is Goldberg not aware that lying about or hiding something is evidence of consciousness of guilt? Trump repeatedly denied having any business dealings with Russia, while we now know that his company was pursuing a building project in Moscow deep into the 2016 campaign.
We recently learned that Trump reportedly confiscated his translator's notes from a meeting he had with his Russian counterpart. Vladimir Putin, on the other hand, knows what was said, and he knows that Trump is keeping that information from the American people, which gives him leverage over the president.
Furthermore, Trump has advocated pulling out of Syria and has reportedly wanted to pull the U.S. out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The president may not have intended to become an asset of Russia, but almost everything he has said and done has put him in Putin's pocket.
Dorothy Gravino
Los Angeles
::
All we can do at this point is speculate about whether or not Trump is an asset of the Russians. The New York Times article that Goldberg cites is based on solid evidence, but according to him it is both "understandable and outrageous."
What I find objectionable is Goldberg's assertion that this could all be explained away by Trump's incompetence and petulance. The behavior of our president should not be tolerated by the people in Washington who are supposed to exercise oversight.
Trump is one of the most powerful leaders on the planet. He threatens our security by embracing autocrats like Putin and rejecting our allies. Just listen to what he has said about NATO.
The real national emergency is an incompetent president and lawmakers who are unwilling to hold Trump accountable.

Brexit's warning for California
Re "Can the U.K. exit from Brexit?" editorial, Jan. 16
Earlier, I agreed with the stance of the L.A. Times editorial board: British voters should get a chance to fix their Brexit mess by participating in another referendum. Now, I realize that popular democracy (referendums) is essentially incompatible with representative democracy (parliament).
Any referendum is necessarily a drastic distillation of a complex issue. It can never be a true expression of the people.
Voting for a representative of member of parliament says just who gets to decide. Fine. A vote on an issue or policy says ... what? What does 52% in favor mean? If the question had been worded differently, would that have changed the result?
This is precisely why we have legislators devoted to deciding these complicated issues.
So I say, no new referendum on Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May should have Parliament cancel Brexit and start over. It is far more likely that a new referendum will leave the United Kingdom in another muddle and no better off.
There are many lessons here for California.
William N. Hoke

::
Re "British premier survives a no-confidence vote," Jan. 17
The caption under the photograph of May that ran in the print edition quotes the prime minister as saying that members of Parliament "know they have a duty to act in the national interest."
This is a statement that should apply to all those impotent, enabling members of our Congress who refuse to rein in the abject chaos, dysfunction and corruption in this administration.
Partisan politics should stand aside in order to salvage what is left of this fragile and rapidly disintegrating democracy.

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., met with roughly two dozen former staffers Wednesday to address their claims that they had been sexually harassed during his 2016 presidential campaign.

Sanders has said he was unaware of the alleged harassment and apologized to the former staffers, pledging to “do better” next time he runs for office. The former presidential candidate is weighing another White House run in 2020.

The meeting included senior aides and Sanders’ wife, Jane, also made an appearance, according to the Huffington Post.

Sanders declined to discuss what was said at the hourlong meeting, calling it “private.” A former staffer told CNN that Sanders made an “honest apology,” saying “it was clear that he came to listen and to have us be heard.”

The New York Times reported multiple women had experienced unwanted sexual advances from their male counterparts. A top adviser to the senator was accused of forcibly kissing a subordinate, though he has denied any wrongdoing, according to a Politico report.

“I thank them, from the bottom of my heart, for speaking out,” Sanders said in a statement last week. “What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign, or any campaign, should be about. ... The allegations speak to unacceptable behavior that must not be tolerated in any campaign or workplace. To the women in that campaign who were harassed or mistreated I apologize.”

Texto completo: Michael Cohen paid a technology company in 2015 to attempt to rig online polls in favor of then-candidate Donald Trump, according to a Wall Street Journal report published Thursday that details the payments.
Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, was reimbursed by the Trump Organization for his payment to the company, run by Liberty University official John Gauger, to the tune of $50,000, according to the story. Gauger claims he never received the full amount owed.
The story contains startling details: Gauger claims that he walked into Trump Tower in 2015 and was handed a Walmart bag containing about $12,000 to $13,000 in cash and a boxing glove.
Cohen denies that the payment was made in cash and told the Wall Street Journal that “all monies paid" were by check.
The paper also reports that Gauger was asked to create a “@womenforcohen" Twitter account. The account tweeted flattering comments about Cohen and described the lawyer as a “pit bull" and “sex symbol."
Federal investigators have interviewed Gauger about his dealings with Cohen, according to the report.
Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison after pleading guilty to a number of tax and campaign finance charges. According to the Wall Street Journal, none of those charges were related to the payments to Gauger.
In a tweet on Thursday morning, Cohen placed the blame for his actions on Trump.
A Globe request for comment from the White House was not immediately returned.

Congressman Steve King should resign

Texto completo: Congressman Steve King should resign. He has lost even the potential to effectively represent his Iowa constituents because of his abhorrent comments about white nationalism and white supremacy.
The move by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to strip King of his committee assignments leaves Iowa without a seat on the vital House Agriculture Committee, as well as judiciary. It also leaves King with far less opportunity to work for his constituents on critically important rural development issues.
Not that King has seemed particularly interested in working for his district in recent years. Instead of holding town-hall meetings with his constituents, King spent many congressional breaks globe-trotting to Europe and hobnobbing with hard-right, nationalist leaders. These meetings apparently served to reinforce his own warped views of cultural purity and immigration.
King has often made Iowa a laughing stock on the national stage with his offensive and absurd remarks about undocumented immigrants, comparing them to dogs or disparaging them as drug mules with calves the size of cantaloupes.
But it wasn't until a few weeks before the November election that top national Republicans and corporate donors started to abandon King. That was just after the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. It also was just after it had been revealed that King spent time on a trip funded by a Holocaust memorial organization to meet with a far-right Austrian group associated with neo-Nazis. Meanwhile, King had been under fire for tweeting his support for a Toronto mayoral candidate known for white nationalist views.
We don't make the argument that King should resign lightly, or based on partisan preferences. He was duly re-elected to a ninth term in November by voters who had every opportunity to recognize the Kiron Republican's caustic, racially charged ideology related to immigration. King opened the new year by seeming to recognize a need to spend more time in Iowa: He announced a town-hall meeting in each of his district's 39 counties.
But then, apparently in an effort to claim credit for President Trump's border-wall plans, he gave the New York Times what should be a career-ending quote: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" King said to the Times. "Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
He has since tried to walk back the comments, claiming the quote was taken out of context and denouncing white nationalism and white supremacy. But to no avail: National Republicans and even staunch GOP supporters in Iowa — Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds — have expressed disgust at his original remarks.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said if King doesn't understand why "white supremacy" was offensive, he should "find another line of work." We agree. He may as well mail a cardboard cutout of himself to Washington for all he'll be able to accomplish if no one is willing to work with him.
Some may argue that 4th District voters are getting what they deserve. But the entire state needs a healthy rural economy, including in King's district, to grow and thrive. President Trump's tariffs are a drag on farmers already buffeted by five years of low commodity prices. Iowa needs all of its delegation members working together to push for policies that will help.
Two Republicans, state Sen. Randy Feenstra of Hull and businessman Bret Richards of Irwin, have said they plan to run in the GOP primary. A third GOP candidate is likely to announce plans soon. But that would leave a quarter of Iowa's population without effective representation for two years. If King steps aside, it would be up to Governor Reynolds to schedule a special election for the seat.
We don't expect King to listen to us. But maybe he would listen to Grassley, Ernst, Reynolds and Republicans in his district. They should encourage him to step aside for the good of the Republican Party and, more importantly, for the good of Iowa.

Texto completo: GORDON, Wis. -- Neighbors watch one another's homes in the winter around here. They notice when there are unfamiliar tire tracks in the snow. Most of the 34 graduates of Northwood High School's Class of 2015 keep in touch through text message.
Gordon is a tiny place, with a single convenience store, and until last week, a single resident who appeared to elude public notice despite nearly a lifetime of living here.
Overnight, Jake T. Patterson has gone from local anonymity to national infamy, accused of kidnapping a 13-year-old girl about an hour's drive south, killing her parents and then holding the teenager captive for nearly three months. The awful crime has shattered the town's sense of safety and forced painful questions on the 645 residents.
"In a little town where everyone knows everyone's business, how could we not know that's who he was?" said Shawn Germann, a FedEx driver, during a stop at The Buckhorn Bar and Grill in Gordon. "You always see these other towns, and think, 'Thank God I don't live in a town like that.' Now, evidently, I do."

As chilling details about the abduction of the girl, Jayme Closs, continue to surface, and as cable television trucks cruise the pine-lined, snowy streets of Gordon, residents have wondered how Mr. Patterson, who had bounced between jobs in recent years, evaded notice.
Mr. Patterson, 21, hid in plain sight for 88 days as scores of detectives fanned out across northern Wisconsin and as Jayme's photo circulated on missing person posters and Facebook pages. He was arrested last week after Jayme escaped from under a twin-size bed inside his home, and was charged with her kidnapping and the shooting deaths of her parents, James and Denise Closs.
On Thursday, former classmates said the accusations against Mr. Patterson -- who was voted "most quiet" at Northwood High School and competed on the quiz team -- felt like a punch to the gut.
"He was quiet, for sure, but not any out-of-the-ordinary quiet like something that would alarm somebody," said one former classmate, who declined to be named out of fear of being ostracized in Gordon, where some residents believe speaking about Mr. Patterson is a betrayal of the town. In a photo given to The New York Times, Mr. Patterson sits in a corner, alone and behind his smiling, posing classmates, absorbed with his laptop.
One of his former teachers, in a text message to a handful of Mr. Patterson's classmates, said the man accused of the kidnapping and killings was "not the quiet, smiley, bookish boy in the classroom" she knew. "As the days pass and more news trickles out, I'll still hold the memory of that sweet boy in my heart. His future will look very different than yours."

Since graduation, Mr. Patterson had struggled to hold down a job.
He worked for one day at the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents also worked. He spent two days last fall at a cheese factory. A few years before, the United States Marine Corps sent him home after five weeks of boot camp.
"Patterson's premature discharge is indicative of the fact that the character of his service was incongruent with Marine Corps' expectations and standards," said Yvonne Carlock, a spokeswoman for the Marines, in a statement.
Details of his most recent years were scarce.
Neighbors said Mr. Patterson spent much of his time alone in his home, particularly after his father moved out a few years ago. Efforts to reach his father and other relatives were not successful. In interviews with other news organizations, his mother was described as devastated and one of his grandfathers said the family was heartbroken.
In a 12-page criminal complaint filed Monday, prosecutors said Mr. Patterson laid out in gruesome detail how he stormed into the Closs home on Oct. 15, killed the parents and kidnapped Jayme. He has not yet entered a plea.
Mr. Patterson told investigators that he spotted Jayme boarding a school bus outside her home in Barron, about an hour's drive south of Gordon, and started plotting the crime, purchasing a mask at Walmart and stealing a shotgun from his father. "The defendant stated he put quite a bit of thought into the details of how he was going to abduct" Jayme, prosecutors wrote.
Detectives said Mr. Patterson described modifying his beat-up car, swapping out the license plate so he could not be tracked and removing a device from the trunk so that it could not be opened from the inside. He shaved his head and face to avoid leaving any forensic evidence. And, they said, he described killing Mr. and Mrs. Closs with single blasts of the shotgun, lest any witnesses track him down, then binding Jayme with black tape and placing her in the trunk of his red Ford Taurus.
"The defendant stated he then got in his car, removed his mask and started to drive" with the shotgun on the front seat, prosecutors wrote. About 20 seconds later, he slowed down for three police cars racing toward the Closs home.
Ron Kofal, a lifelong Gordon resident who lives about a mile from the cabin where Jayme was held, said he met Mr. Patterson at the ICO gas station on Highway 53. He said Mr. Patterson, whom he described as "clean cut and shy," sometimes performed odd jobs around town, like yard work and cabin maintenance, and had seemed pleasant in his interactions with him.
The town of Gordon is dotted with small cabins that sit at the end of wooded roads. All-terrain vehicles and snowmobile trails snake through the forest. Residents, especially the hearty few who stay through the harsh winters, take pride in being on a first-name basis with neighbors.
But in recent days, at snowmobile club meetings and at bars where prize bucks are mounted on the walls, residents have asked themselves uneasy questions: How did they fail to notice the horror in their small town? And how had Mr. Patterson, the tall young man with the receding brown hair, managed to live there so long without raising alarm?
"Everyone else is outside having a bonfire and splitting wood, and playing with their kids," said Adam Wilson, a manager of a grocery store who lives near Mr. Patterson. "It's disturbing; it shows you just never know what somebody's up to."
In the weeks that followed Jayme's disappearance, as it vexed detectives and made national headlines, Mr. Patterson described how he used the seclusion of Gordon to his advantage, keeping Jayme out of sight at the cabin where he grew up, just off County Highway Y. When he ran errands, Jayme told detectives, he would force her to stay under the bed, boxing her in with totes secured with barbell weights. When he had houseguests, he would turn on music in the bedroom to muffle any noise she might make.
For a time, Mr. Patterson kept the shotgun at the ready in case the police showed up.
Eventually, he put it away. No one suspected him.

Republican From Texas Who Resists Trump's Wall

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico, which sprawls across four states and nine House districts, a single seat is held by a Republican: Representative Will Hurd of Texas.
And Mr. Hurd, a former undercover C.I.A. officer who barely won re-election in Texas' 23rd District, the largest of the nine, has emerged as perhaps the most persistent critic in his party of President Trump's wall.
Drawing upon his years undercover and his work in the private sector, Mr. Hurd has a starkly different vision for the southwestern border: fiber optic cables, sensors, radar, drones, increased staffing -- but not the concrete or steel barrier that Mr. Trump has demanded before he reopens the government.
He has joined Democrats eight times this month to vote to reopen the government, without wall funding.
"Nobody likes being the cheese that's standing alone," Mr. Hurd said in an interview with The Daily, The New York Times's podcast. "I have a unique perspective because I have so much border, because I have an entire career dealing with these issues. That is more important than any kind of political calculation."
"My specific role has always been to articulate the problems to a level of specificity that people can understand and then give the on-the-ground perspective and experience on what the solutions can be," he added.
Specificity, in this case, lies in the architecture of what Mr. Hurd describes as a "smart wall," a wish list of technology and upgrades that would protect more than 800 miles of the southwestern border that demarcates the southern side of his district. He would dispense with the concrete wall or steel slats that Mr. Trump has advocated in raucous rallies, in favor of more advanced measures, including "a fiber optic cable from sea to shining sea."
"Let's make sure we're using the right tool in the right place," Mr. Hurd said. "We should be thinking about all these different technologies and how they should be used, and when I describe this, nobody disagrees."
He added, "A wall from sea to shining sea is the most expensive and least effective way to do border security."
He is not, as his staff readily acknowledges, inclined to broadcast his perspective or obsessively rope in votes for his cause. He has not sought opportunities to directly lobby the president to endorse the technological barriers he has envisioned. (Mr. Hurd noted that the "key players" are all cognizant of his position.)
Instead, he is content to remain on the periphery of the House Republican Conference, educating his colleagues, extending invitations to visit the border and voting the way he believes the majority of his constituents want him to. That is what resonates in a district that encompasses a large population of cybersecurity professionals -- parts of San Antonio and rural areas -- and has flipped five times between the two parties since the early 1990s.
"My boss is not the president," Mr. Hurd said. "My boss is not the speaker. My boss is not the minority leader. My bosses are those 800,000 people that I represented and sent me up here."
Aides say he often requests analysis of his personal outreach, including social media data and telephone town halls, that quantify who is following his work and their responses -- metrics that inform his support of legislation on Capitol Hill, regardless of the party line or pressure from the presidential Twitter feed.
"You can't take a vocal minority as an indication of the epicenter of where people feel," Mr. Hurd said. The mix of Republicans and Democrats in his district, he said, "believe that we should be able to secure our borders, and they think that's a mix of tools that is necessary to do that."
His ability to deftly navigate the electoral perils of his district and retain a place on Capitol Hill has surprised both his party allies and his opponents across the aisle. His margin of victory in November was so slim -- a little over 1,100 votes -- that Mr. Hurd's Democratic opponent attended new member orientation before conceding to Mr. Hurd.
"I don't know what it is, but it is clearly working for him," said Colin Strother, a Democratic strategist in Texas. He added, "I'm sure among Republicans, there are people who aren't happy that he's not on board."
Conservatives acknowledge that Mr. Hurd is an asset to their conference; he has secured a temperamental electorate for now, and his intelligence, experience and status as the lone black Republican in the House chamber make him invaluable.
"He just approaches it differently than most members," said Matt Mackowiak, a veteran Republican strategist in Texas. "He's also given the benefit of the doubt because of how difficult that district is."
Regardless of ideological differences, most Republicans express respect for Mr. Hurd's knowledge, work ethic and dedication to the people he represents. In an announcement naming Mr. Hurd as a new member of the influential House Appropriations Committee, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, hailed him as "one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial members" in Congress. Democratic colleagues hear a border security solution that resonates with their own border constituents.
"He knows what he's talking about," said Representative Juan C. Vargas, a Democrat whose district traverses the California-Mexico border. "He hangs on because he's smart and knows security."
Representative Pete Aguilar, Democrat of California, first reached out to Mr. Hurd to collaborate on legislation last year that would have secured a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, while enhancing border security. The two men now text with each other so frequently that Mr. Aguilar jokes that his wife is a little jealous of their friendship.
"Even members of Democratic leadership really respect how supportive he is in finding a solution on this issue," Mr. Aguilar said.
"It's not lost on anyone on our side of the aisle," he added, about how Mr. Hurd has crossed party lines to support bipartisan ideas on immigration and rebuff the president's demands for a wall at the border.

Fake issue of The Post handed out in District

Texto completo: Fake editions of The Washington Post claiming that President Trump was leaving office were handed out Wednesday morning at multiple locations in Washington.
The print papers - dated May 1, 2019, and looking strikingly similar to actual copies of The Post - were filled with anti-Trump stories, which also appeared on a website that mimicked the official Post site.
"We will not tolerate others misrepresenting themselves as The Washington Post, and we are deeply concerned about the confusion it causes among readers," Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti said. "We are seeking to halt further improper use of our trademarks."
Late Wednesday morning, a group that describes itself as a "trickster activist collective" called the Yes Men said it produced the bogus newspapers and website - which went offline Wednesday afternoon.
Under the headline "Unpresidented," the fake newspaper's lead story said Trump had left a resignation message on a napkin in the Oval Office and left Washington for Yalta, the Crimean resort that was the site of a meeting of Allied leaders during World War II.
The false story also reported that his abrupt departure was prompted by "massive women-led protests" around the country, suggesting that the stunt was a promotion for a planned women's march on Saturday.
Jacques Servin, who uses the pseudonym Andy Bichlbaum, said he is one of the founders of the Yes Men and that the paper was intended to offer the "grass-roots movement" ideas for how to support the impeachment of Trump. "The idea was a newspaper from the future and how we got there - like a road map for activists," he said.
The print and digital newspapers cost about $40,000, Servin said, adding that $36,000 was raised from the organization's mailing list. The group printed 25,000 copies, and he estimated 10,000 of the papers were distributed.
He said the group - which is a collaboration between Servin and others, including author-activists Onnesha Roychoudhuri and L.A. Kauffman - practices "clowny activism." Several documentaries chronicle the collective's pranks.
It put together a similarly fake copy of the New York Times in 2008. That fake edition, which came out after the election of President Barack Obama, had stories depicting liberal activists putting pressure on the new administration. For more than 20 years they have pretended to represent official groups, such as the World Trade Organization and U.S. Chamber of Commerce, at phony news conferences.
The stunt involving the fake Washington Post newspapers also included two emails sent out Wednesday morning designed to look like they came from a Post account. The first announced the fake news of Trump's departure and the second was labeled as an "errata," correcting the first.
Copies of the bogus papers were handed out at locations around Washington, including outside the White House and Union Station.
The liberal activist group Code Pink posted a video on Facebook of the organization's founder, Medea Benjamin, passing out copies at what appears to be a Capitol Hill office building.
In the video, Benjamin tells people, "The crisis is over - Trump has left the White House." Later, she adds, "You got to believe in The Washington Post."
Benjamin said in an e-mail that Code Pink, which has become well known in Washington for staging protests that disrupt congressional hearings and other official proceedings, helped to distribute the fake newspapers.
The liberal group MoveOn, which some on social media suspected of being behind the fake paper, tweeted that it was not responsible. "While we love the headline, we didn't produce today's satirical Washington Post," it said.

CURRY-TO-BUCKS TRADE REARS UGLY HEAD SEVERAL YEARS LATER

Texto completo: History is written by the winners and not always fact-checked.
For instance:
In March 2012, the Warriors traded guard Monta Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut. The narrative arising from that transaction goes a little something like this: It was a brilliant gambit, the first of several ingenious moves that catapulted the Warriors to a series of NBA titles.
The Warriors finished 20 games under .500 in 2011-12. But the following season, with Bogut at center and Stephen Curry taking over the point guard position from the departed Ellis, the Warriors won 47 games and reached the playoffs for just the second time in 19 seasons.
The next season: 51 wins and a postseason berth.
The next four seasons: Three parades from the franchise that reinvented basketball. It was somewhere in the parade of parades that Warriors owner Joe Lacob told the New York Times Magazine, "We're light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we're going to go about things."
Recently Bucks owner Marc Lasry was chatting up The Athletic when the Lacob quote came up.
"I don't know if they can be light years ahead if they traded Steph Curry to the Bucks for Andrew Bogut," said Lasry, who didn't buy the team until more than two years after the Bogut trade.
History lesson: Curry trade rumors began the night the Warriors selected him in the 2010 NBA draft. "Hopefully I'll go to sleep (tonight) as a Warrior," he told reportersafter a long evening of intrigue.
Winners have their writers. Also-rans have their rewriters. The Athletic described the Curry-Bogut swap somewhere between fact and urban legend.
"That was the deal," Lasry insisted. "But the Bucks' medical staff didn't think Steph's ankle would hold up. That killed the deal."
Hey, if you're going to play a game of what-if, you might as well make it interesting. This one was and apparently still is. Especially considering that Curry was experiencing ankle issues during the 2011-12 season.
"So, I don't know if that's being light years," Lasry said. "It's luck. And that's fine."
That's what all the also-rans say as they await their turn for the quill and parchment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A Democratic measure rebuking Republican Rep. Steve King for his comments about white supremacy won easy approval Tuesday in the House.

In a twist, the nine-term Iowa congressman was among those supporting the measure of disapproval, which was adopted, 416-1.

King said he agreed with Majority Whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, the resolution's sponsor, that white supremacy is an evil that cannot be ignored. King's racist comments have been widely condemned by members of both parties in recent days.

The ideology of white supremacy "never shows up in my head," King said in a speech from the House floor. "I do not know how it could possibly come out of my mouth."

Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois was the sole lawmaker to oppose the measure, saying the House should take the more serious step of censuring King for his "repugnant and racist behavior."

Any measure short of censure is "shallow," Rush said. "Steve King has made a career of making racist statements. That is the only thing he is known for and this pattern of rabid racism must be confronted head on by the House of Representatives."

The vote came as Republicans dialed up the pressure on King, with one GOP leader suggesting Tuesday that the veteran lawmaker leave Congress.

"I'd like to see him find another line of work," Rep. Liz Cheney, the third-highest Republican in the House, told reporters.

It was the most explicit call from a senior Republican for King to leave and the latest GOP effort to inspire him to quit over an article in The New York Times last week, where he was quoted saying: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?"

Republicans looking to avoid worsening the party's relationship with blacks and minorities quickly condemned King's remarks as racist.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., wrote an op-ed saying that any GOP silence in the face of King's remarks would be a blemish on the party and the nation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky condemned King. And tellingly, Republicans refused to say whether they support King's re-election effort.

On Monday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced that King would not be given any committee assignments, the prized seats at the policy table where lawmakers represent their constituents. King served on the Agriculture, Small Business and Judiciary committees in the last Congress, and he chaired Judiciary's subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice.

King vowed to "continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years."

House Democrats moved to formally punish King. Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, introduced a formal resolution of disapproval late Monday.

Addressing what he called "a tale of two Kings," Clyburn said the Iowa lawmaker's remarks were offensive because they embraced evil concepts.

Invoking the memory of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. -- whose 90th birthday is Tuesday -- Clyburn called on colleagues from both parties "to join me in breaking the deafening silence and letting our resounding condemnation be heard."

But other Democrats were pushing for a stronger punishment, censure.

"As with any animal that is rabid, Steve King should be set aside and isolated," Rush said Monday as he introduced a censure resolution.

A third Democrat, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, introduced a separate censure resolution against King.

"It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or Republican, we all have a responsibility to call out Rep. King's hateful and racist comments," Ryan said, noting that the white supremacy comments were not the first time King has made headlines for inappropriate language.

They all returned to a long string of King's remarks that have drawn rebukes.

The text of Rush's censure resolution lists more than a dozen examples of King's remarks, beginning with comments in 2006 in which he compared immigrants to livestock,

McConnell, in his statement, said he has "no tolerance" for the positions offered by King, and said "those who espouse these views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. Rep. King's statements are unwelcome and unworthy of his elected position. If he doesn't understand why ‘white supremacy' is offensive, he should find another line of work."

One Republican did not join the chorus of criticism. Asked about King's remarks Monday, President Donald Trump said, "I haven't been following it."

King said Tuesday he's been misunderstood. He said of his colleagues, "I thought you knew me well."

The Republican said he was advocating for Western civilization, not racism, in the Times interview. He said he rejects the ideology of white supremacy, adding that he comes from a family of abolitionists who "paid a price with their lives to make sure that all men and now all women are created equal."

King's position in the GOP had been imperiled even before his remarks about white supremacy.

Shortly before the 2018 midterm elections, in which King was running, Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, then the head of the GOP campaign committee, issued an extraordinary public denunciation of him.

King has already drawn a primary challenger for the 2020 election: Randy Feenstra, a GOP state senator. Feenstra said Monday, "Sadly, today, the voters and conservative values of our district have lost their seat at the table because of Congressman King's caustic behavior."

Texto completo: We live in a time when we seem to have very little privacy. However, we can be thankful to Abigail Roberson of Rochester for the privacy we have left.
Roberson's place in legal history was called to my attention by Ishaan Jhaveri, a research fellow in digital journalism at Columbia University.
Later, David Cay Johnston, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter on taxes who lives in Brighton, sent along information on Roberson as a possible Remarkable Rochesterian.
Jhaveri wrote about Roberson last year in a Gizmodo story titled, "How a 19th-century Teenager Sparked a Battle Over Who Owns Our Faces."
In it he describes how Roberson, who was born in 1883, discovered a portrait of herself on a poster advertising Franklin Mills Flour, a product manufactured in Lockport, Niagara County.
The picture showed Roberson from the shoulders up in profile. Flattering though it was, it had been used without Roberson's permission. Upon seeing her stolen image, she is said to have collapsed from "nervous shock" and was bedridden for a while. She decided to seek recourse in the courts.
In 1900, when she was 17, through her guardian, Roberson sued Franklin Mills. She also sued Rochester Folding Box Co., which had printed 25,000 copies of the poster.
Roberson's lawyers claimed in state Supreme Court that the use of her image without her permission had caused the young woman mental anguish. And they alleged that the defendants had invaded Roberson's "right to privacy." The court agreed. It awarded Roberson $15,000, the equivalent of nearly $450,000 now.
The defendants appealed. They argued that they had taken nothing of value from Roberson and that there was no statutory right of privacy in New York state.
In 1902, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, in a 4-3 ruling, decided against Roberson. They agree with the plaintiffs that there was no right of privacy and that Roberson hadn't lost anything of monetary value. (Indeed, Alton Parker, the chief judge, wrote that Roberson should have been flattered. Her picture was a "compliment to her beauty," he asserted.)
"The New York Court of Appeals decision was controversial," Jhaveri writes. "It ignited the early 1900s version of a Twitter war, with editorial boards all over the country criticizing the ruling."
The New York state Legislature soon passed a law granting citizens the right to privacy. It meant, among other things, that companies could not use individuals' likenesses without their consent. It was, Jhaveri writes, the first time any state had enshrined a right to privacy.
In 1904, Parker, the judge who had ruled against Roberson, was seeking the presidential nomination. He asserted that he had the right to be left alone by photographers to "assume comfortable attitudes without being everlastingly afraid that (he) shall be snapped by some fellow with a camera."
In a letter to The New York Times, Roberson reminded the judge that she had it on "high authority" — the authority being his own decision in her case — that he had no right to privacy.
Editorial writers throughout the state gleefully took Roberson's side. Parker went on to lose to Theodore Roosevelt in the race for president.
According to the Democrat and Chronicle, after her legal fight was over, Roberson attended music school and then played piano in silent movie theaters, often living in other cities. She resettled in Rochester in 1955 to care for a sick brother. She remained and played the organ in churches. Newspaper advertisements indicate that she often gave lectures on spiritualism.
In 1970, Roberson moved to Salem, Oregon, where she died in 1977 at age 94, leaving behind a right to privacy that exists in New York state to this day.

Remarkable Rochesterians Let's add the name of this champion for privacy rights to the list of Remarkable Rochesterians that can be found at rochester.nydatabases.com:
Abigail M. Roberson (1883-1977): Though her 1900 complaint about the unauthorized use of her photo in an advertisement for Franklin Mills Flour of Lockport, Niagara County, was rejected by New York's highest court, the attention to her case prompted the New York state Legislature to establish a right to privacy in state law. A native of Kansas who settled in Rochester as a young girl, she had argued that the advertisement, which was printed by the Rochester Folding Box Co., left her in a state of shock. In adulthood, she played the piano in silent movie theaters and the organ in churches and gave lectures on spiritualism. She died in Oregon at age 94.
On Remarkable Rochester Retired Senior Editor Jim Memmott reflects on what makes Rochester distinctively Rochester, its history, its habits, its people. Since 2010, he has also been compiling a list of Remarkable Rochesterians. Contact him at: (585) 278-8012 or jmemmott@DemocratandChronicle.com or Remarkable Rochester, Box 274, Geneseo, NY 14454.

Texto completo: According to the New York Times, as a child growing up in Switzerland, Jens Kruger was so fascinated by a broken tenor banjo owned by his father — actually, just the neck of it — that he nailed strings to it and silently taught himself the fingering for several chords. When his mother bought him a proper banjo at about the age of 10, Mr. Kruger said, "I could finally hear how all these chords sounded." Jens and his brother, Uwe, took their banjo and guitar on the road at an early age. They played country, rock, pop standards as well bluegrass in venues ranging from clubs to cruise liners. The Kruger Brothers, including bassist Joel Landsberg, performed at Merlefest for the first time in 1997. The band found a welcoming community in Wilkesboro and eventually left Switzerland to make North Carolina their home.
In their ever-expanding body of work – Jens Kruger (banjo and vocals), Uwe Kruger (guitar and lead vocals), and Joel Landsberg (bass and vocals) – The Kruger Brothers personify the spirit of exploration and innovation that forms the core of the American musical tradition. Their original music is crafted around their discerning taste, and the result is unpretentious, cultivated, and delightfully fresh.
In addition to their regular concert schedule, The Kruger Brothers regularly perform classical pieces penned by Jens Kruger with select symphony orchestras and string quartets throughout the country. Their latest work for chamber orchestra, The Roan Mountain Suite, was inspired by the raw beauty and history surrounding Roan Mountain.
"The Kruger Brothers love to begin their new year in Madison County. We are lucky to have them and know that our audience always looks forward to hearing excerpts from new work, folk classics and their take on bluegrass music," said Laura Boosinger, Executive Director of The Madison County Arts Council. "This year we are hosting the concert at Broyhill Chapel on the campus of Mars Hill University. The audience can look forward to an intimate, up close and personal performance. Get your tickets now, this one is always a sell-out."
The concert will begin at 4 p.m. and tickets are $30. For more information contact madisoncountyarts.com or call 649-1301.
The Kruger brothers will play at Mars Hill University's Broyhill chapel, Jan. 27 at 4 p.m.

AG nominee deserves to make his case

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has certainly surrounded himself with plenty of incompetent and ethically challenged people. But in William Barr, he has nominated someone with a track record of integrity and experience to be the next attorney general.
Such a person is badly needed at the Justice Department. Not only has Trump repeatedly debased law enforcement, his actions also have left many Americans thinking the unthinkable — that the president not only benefited from Russia's interference in the 2016 election but also is somehow beholden to its government.
No less than the FBI has entertained this thought. The New York Times reported Friday that the FBI started a counterintelligence inquiry in 2017 into whether Trump was — gulp! — acting as an agent of the Russian government.
The outcome of that inquiry is unknown, and Trump denied on Monday that he ever worked on Russia's behalf. But he has given Americans plenty of reason for suspicion, including his odd obsequiousness toward Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, his confiscation of notes and records from his meetings with Putin, his real estate dealings with Russians, and his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, leaving a vacuum for Russia and others to fill.
It is into this troubling context that Barr now drops as Trump's pick to become the nation's top law enforcement official and overseer of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry. This would be Barr's second stint as attorney general, a position he ably held during the administration of President George H.W. Bush.
At the very least, Barr would represent a huge upgrade over acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who is wholly ill-suited for the job.
At the Senate confirmation hearings that begin Tuesday, Barr's first imperative must be an unequivocal defense of Mueller, a decorated Vietnam War veteran and former FBI director whom Trump has attacked incessantly.
Barr states in prepared testimony that Mueller should be given a chance to finish his report, and that the report should be made public. This is a good start but is not sufficient. Mueller might plan further legal actions such as subpoenas, indictments and plea agreements. Barr needs to pledge that he would not interfere with those. He also needs to make abundantly clear that he would not fire Mueller.
Beyond these things, Barr needs to explain recent statements and writings defending the firing of former FBI Director James Comey and criticizing Mueller on the grounds that members of the special counsel's team made political contributions to Hillary Clinton.
While some Democrats have urged that his nomination be withdrawn, this is too extreme. Barr has done nothing to disqualify himself and deserves a chance to make his case.
An attorney general can be hired and fired by the president, but ultimately he or she serves the Constitution and the rule of law. At this fraught time in the nation's history, senators shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough.
Another view: Withdraw Barr's nomination The reason I believe William Barr's nomination should be withdrawn has little to do with his experience. As attorney general for President George H.W. Bush, he has long been well-respected within the legal community. But the nominee for our nation's highest law enforcement position must be measured by more than his résumé.
Nor is this a question of politics — which party can "win" Barr's confirmation fight — but rather a question of character and fidelity to the Constitution. Will Mr. Barr rise to the defining challenge for an attorney general in the Trump era and defend the rule of law?
Based on his actions in the months before his nomination, I believe the answer is no.
Last June, Mr. Barr wrote a secret, unsolicited memo attacking special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential obstruction of justice by the president, which Mr. Barr then passed to administration officials.
In November, President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions after months of public abuse over the Mueller investigation. For a temporary replacement, he chose Matt Whitaker, whose primary qualification appears to be an op-ed he wrote decrying the scope of the Mueller probe.
With Mr. Barr's nomination, it has become clear that the president's sole concern is choosing a new attorney general who will shield him from the special counsel's investigation. And Mr. Barr's memo looks much more like a job application.
Special counsel Mueller's investigation into Russia's attack on our democracy has led to numerous indictments and convictions, including that of the president's own campaign chairman. It must continue free from political interference until it gets to the truth.
In the meantime, our country deserves better than an attorney general who auditioned for the job by attacking that investigation. Under our constitutional system, no one is above the law, not even the president. We need an attorney general willing to vigorously defend this principle.
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., is vice chair of the Intelligence Committee.

SCIENTISTS ON FURLOUGH WORRY THEIR RESEARCH COULD BE LOST

Deadlocked, President Trump and Congress remain at an impasse over money for a border wall.
But hungry bacteria in a valuable U.S. Geological Survey experiment remain very much alive.
So a furloughed scientist, against orders, sneaks into the closed Menlo Park-based lab to feed the microbes ensuring that the three-year-long project, while hobbled, doesn't fail.
He is just one of the Bay Area's many frustrated researchers caught in the middle of the power struggle that shows no sign of being resolved any time soon.
So far, President Trump has refused to consider a budget that lacks $5.6 billion for a 2,000-mile border wall. On Monday he told reporters as he boarded Marine One that he has rejected a proposal by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start talks with Democratic lawmakers on funding the wall.
At NASA Ames Research Center, scientists are supposed to be busy getting ready to test software that will fly on the International Space Station this year.
They should be designing air traffic control systems for unmanned aircraft and drones. They've already skipped January's big annual American Astronomical Society conference and missed the deadline to submit their work to the upcoming Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, the largest planetary science meeting in the world.
"I can't even read my email," said Ames scientist Jeremy Frank of Sunnyvale, a Ph.D. in computer science who builds software that helps astronauts operate future missions to Mars without assistance from Mission Control. To fend off boredom, he's doing chores, reading and bird-watching at Los Gatos Creek County Park.
With a doctorate in industrial engineering, aeronautics expert Parimal Kopardekar, who is not allowed to say where he works, is spending his time leading hikes in the Cupertino Hills and cooking dinner for his family.
Larry Miller, who studies the fate of chromium in contaminated groundwater, cleaned the family's chicken coop, helped friends by house-sitting and built a dog run for a new puppy. He's also surfing, leaving his El Granada home before dawn.
"The furlough coincides with a nice run of winter surf," he said.
A NASA scientist who asked not to be identified said, "Our whole program for returning to the moon ostensibly a Trump administration priority is slipping on a day-by-day basis. The Chinese are moving forward with great speed, and their achievements are impressing the entire world  while we're unable to do a thing."
Congress has already passed a bill that will provide back pay to federal workers once they are back on the job when the shutdown ends. But federal contractors will not be paid.
And Bay Area labs, which were separately funded through September Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Lawrence Livermore Lab, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Sandia National Labs in Livermore are safe from this shutdown.
But USGS and NASA Ames are closed. So are the Agriculture Department, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is on partial shutdown. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is continuing to pay 794 essential employees, some responsible for maintaining scientific instrumentation and lab animals, plants and test organisms.
The National Park Service suspended wildlife monitoring of species such as the endangered coho salmon at Point Reyes National Seashore and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, because 80 percent of the park employees are furloughed. Other critical research "windows," such as seasonal shifts in insect populations, are missed.
Visitors to Point Reyes, Merced National Wildlife Refuge and other federal parks say they are quiet and beautiful but without facilities.
"We saw a bobcat right near the closed Visitors Center and watched for a good 15 minutes," said Deborah Petersen of Half Moon Bay, who visited Point Reyes on Sunday. "I hate to see this shutdown and feel badly for all the hardworking government workers going without paychecks. But for those of us who took the chance to visit the national seashore, we were rewarded with a more peaceful and wilder experience than usual."
Because furloughed government scientists are banned from any form of work activity, Kopardekar has created a Facebook group called Shutdown Strategies Support Group, where members share coping strategies.
"What I miss is the interaction with colleagues," he said. "I don't like to sit alone. I like teamwork. If I feel unattached from everybody, I realized others might feel the same way."
Some suggestions are homespun: Bake pies! Empty the freezer! Clean up clutter!
Other suggestions, like Kopardekar's scorecard, are analytical. His four-cell table lets furloughed workers track their daily score on four dimensions: self-development, exercise, diet and connections.
"Try to get 4.0 daily!" he wrote.
Scientists say they are still engaged in professional activities. Kopardekar reviews the online curriculum and course content at Colorado State University's business school. He also is volunteering his time and strategic advice to friends' startup companies.
USGS' Miller continues to fulfill one important and deadline-driven part of his job: reviewing manuscripts of journal articles.
"I agreed to do it, so I felt obligated," he said. "Also, I'm the best person to do the review."
Despite pledges from Congress that they will receive back pay, many furloughed workers have financial anxieties. While their working spouses help shoulder the burden, they say the cost of living in the Bay Area is unsustainable on one salary.
"We had a family discussion and decided that we won't go out to eat at all during the furlough," said one NASA scientist who asked not to be named because the agency asked employees not to give interviews about the shutdown. "We're also postponing or canceling planned purchases, and all of our vacation planning for this year is either on hold or we'll cancel it entirely."
To survive, they may seek jobs in the private sector.
"For many of us highly skilled technical workers at NASA and other agencies we could easily get jobs in the private sector paying far more than we make now," the scientist said. "We stay where we are, despite our lower salaries, because of our dedication to our country and because of our passion for what we do tasks that no one else in the world does. Quite simply, we love our work.
"But the current shutdown, perhaps more than any other in the past, has thrown all of this into question," he said. "We can accept lower salaries, but we can't accept no salary at all."

Texto completo: What happens when immense bigotry gets lodged in a small mind? Rep. Steve King, Republican of Iowa, is what happens.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" It is a question that could only be posed by a bigot. And because it was a rhetorical question, King was assuming that all the rest of us — all right-thinking people — are bigots as well. Shouldn’t the tie between whiteness and civilization be obvious?
As a reminder, white nationalism and supremacy — the ideology shared by Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and, evidently, Steve King — became offensive because of centuries of stolen labor, murder and cruel abuse; because of a bloody war that one side conducted on behalf of slavery; because of repeating waves of anti-immigrant prejudice, alarmism and discrimination; because of routine lynchings and the stinging viciousness of segregation; because of the assumption that robbed, exploited and oppressed people somehow deserve social challenges resulting from robbery, exploitation and oppression.
For King, this was not a slip of the tongue, but the development of a theme. "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies," King has argued. Those babies eventually grow up to be, in King’s words, migrant kids with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." This is threatening because "diversity is not our strength." In fact, it is "cultural suicide by demographic transformation."
Many elected Republicans in Washington have been forthright in their criticism of King after his latest offense. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King’s remarks "reckless" and "wrong." Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, said King’s argument was "abhorrent and racist." To Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, it was "offensive and racist." To Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, it was "an embrace of racism."
McCarthy has (vaguely) promised that disciplinary "action will be taken." If King is not at least censured, it will mean the House has no standards at all. And this, unfortunately, would be no surprise at all.
In their criticism of King, you get the sense that Republicans are actually relieved to be in the position of attacking racism for a change, instead of being forced to defend it from the president. They seem to be signaling that they are not really the bigots that they appear to be. Republicans seem desperate to explain that they are normal and moral, in spite of all the evidence. Attacking King reveals some sense of shame at what they have become.
Yet, in the end, Republican critics of King manage to look worse rather than better. If racism is the problem, then President Donald Trump is a worse offender. And their relative silence on Trump is a sign of hypocrisy and weakness.
Take the last days before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump closed his campaign for Republicans with a hysterical warning that brown people were invading the country. He initially suggested they should be shot. He added that he "wouldn’t be surprised" if Soros was funding the migrant caravan. This is clearly what he regards as his strongest political argument — the racist promotion of animus against outsiders, tied to pernicious conspiracy theories.
Trump feeds ethnic stereotypes of migrants as "rapists" and "murderers." He makes apocalyptic warnings that Democratic control would "turn America into Venezuela" and "totally open borders." And his supporters dismiss criticism against him as a personality thing. Add to this Trump’s attribution of Kenyan citizenship to Barack Obama. And his sympathy for the "very fine people" attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. And his attacks on African-American athletes and other figures. And his pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for racial profiling, terror raids and cruel punishment of inmates. And his attempts at a Muslim ban. And his contempt for "(expletive) countries." And ... a list far longer than I can include.
By any standard, Trump says things that are reckless, wrong, abhorrent, offensive and racist. And until Republicans can state this reality with the same clarity and intensity that they now criticize King, they will be cowards in a time crying for bravery.

Texto completo: President Trump denied Monday he ever worked for Russia, answering a question he declined to directly address over the weekend.
Speaking from the South Lawn before departing the White House for New Orleans, Trump called former FBI and Justice Department officials "known scoundrels" and "dirty cops." He was reacting to a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.
"I never worked for Russia," he told reporters. Trump didn't directly answer the question in a Saturday Fox News interview.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump told Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing."
Trump went on to assert that no President has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other . . . probably any other President, period, but certainly the last three or four Presidents," he said.
White House aides expressed regret over the weekend that the President did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three aides and Republicans close to the administration. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.
Trump on Monday defended his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn the scrutiny of special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump called the Russia probe "a whole big fat hoax."
AP writers Zeke Miller and Catherine Lucey contributed to the story.

GOP boots King from panels

Texto completo: Nation
WASHINGTON - The Republican Steering Committee unanimously decided Monday evening to not seat Iowa Rep. Steve King on any committees for the 116th Congress, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters.
King will still be allowed to attend House Republican Conference meetings, McCarthy said.
King has faced widespread backlash in recent days for questioning, in a New York Times interview, why the terms "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" had become "offensive."
"Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth," King said in a statement Monday evening, adding that his Times quote "had been completely mischaracterized."
The Iowa Republican had served on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Small Business committees in the previous Congress. The Republican Steering Committee hadn't yet made its recommendations for committee assignments for the 116th Congress so Monday's decision was one not to seat him rather to strip him of his assignments.
Accused murderer says he spotted Closs at bus
BARRON, Wis. - The young man accused of fatally shooting Jayme Closs' parents in the family's western Wisconsin home and abducting their 13-year-old daughter first saw the teen as she boarded her school bus one morning and "knew that was the girl he was going to take," according to a criminal complaint filed Monday.
Jake T. Patterson, 21, was charged with two counts of first-degree intentional homicide, kidnapping and armed burglary in connection with the killings and abduction in the early hours of Oct. 15 at the Closs home on the outskirts of town. Jayme remained his captive until she escaped from his home on Thursday.
The charging document says Patterson confessed to the crimes under questioning a few hours after his arrest.
The charges say Patterson also told authorities the night of his capture that as he drove to his job at a cheese factory, he stopped behind a school bus and saw Jayme board. He didn't know who she was, nor did he know anything about her or her family.
"When he saw (Jayme), he knew that was the girl he was going to take," the criminal complaint read.
California utility files
for bankruptcy
SAN FRANCISCO - The nation's largest utility said Monday it is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over the catastrophic wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes.
The move by Pacific Gas & Electric Corp., expected by the end of the month, would be the biggest bankruptcy by a utility in U.S. history, legal experts said.
It would allow PG&E to hold off creditors and continue providing electricity and natural gas without interruption to its 16 million customers in Northern and central California while it tries to put its finances in order.
The filing would not make the lawsuits disappear, but would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. That could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.
Chapter 11 reorganization represents "the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders," Richard Kelly, chairman of PG&E's board of directors, said in a statement.
State officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, a November Northern California blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry.
She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Balancing Animal Welfare and Religious Rites" (editorial, Jan. 9):
The Belgian Council for Animal Welfare reviewed international research on the topic of animal slaughter. The result is remarkable: For sheep it takes 14 seconds to 5 minutes before spontaneous brain activity stops. For cattle it takes between 19 seconds and 11 minutes. Several audits of Belgian slaughterhouses showed that ritually killed animals were still conscious up to several minutes.
There are two options for politicians: ignore or act. I chose to act and submitted a law proposal that led to the ban against slaughter without stunning. All members of Parliament (except one who abstained) voted for the ban, including politicians from the left and with Islamic beliefs.
The Belgian law is not inspired by anti-Semitic feelings or hate against Muslims. To the contrary, the government funded research to fine-tune the halal stunning method that is already in use in Islamic countries.
Religious freedom is an important value of the Enlightenment. But it cannot be a free guide to animal suffering.

To the Editor:
Thank you for your very measured treatment of the disagreement between animal protection supporters and adherents to the rules of kosher and halal slaughter. Animal protection supporters want animals stunned before their throats are cut, while the religious adherents point to religious texts dictating that only conscious animals should be slaughtered.
Judaism and Islam have strong traditions and canonical texts that support animal welfare, and so it is difficult to understand this legitimate disagreement.
The solution that provides reconciliation was discussed in The New York Times a few months ago: growing meat directly from cells requires no slaughter ("Pursuing a Once-Impossible Goal: Kosher Bacon," Business Day, Oct. 1).
This cell-based meat, grown in clean facilities and with significantly lower environmental effects and no animal suffering, is being developed by companies from Silicon Valley to the Netherlands to Israel.
In addition to continuing to pass laws that protect farm animals from cruel treatment, the federal government should be investing financial resources in bringing this slaughter-free meat to market as quickly as possible.

Texto completo: Senator Bernie Sanders, accelerating his efforts to contain the damage from reports of sexism and harassment during his 2016 presidential campaign, plans to meet on Wednesday with a group of former staff members seeking assurances of better practices if he runs again in 2020.
As other potential presidential candidates prepare to roll out campaigns with forceful, positive messaging, Mr. Sanders and his supporters have instead been forced to play defense, addressing allegations during his last presidential bid.
The meeting on Wednesday, which will be held in Washington, will focus on the treatment of women going forward, some invitees and people close to Mr. Sanders said Monday. Mr. Sanders's campaign arm began reaching out to the former staff members to help make travel arrangements and intends to pay for air travel and hotel expenses, the people said.
Mr. Sanders plans to attend a portion of the meeting.
The steps Mr. Sanders and his supporters have taken over the last week underscore the sense of urgency the senator faces as he prepares for a likely 2020 campaign. Though he has not yet announced that he intends to run, he has told aides and advisers that a decision is coming soon.
In the last two weeks, The New York Times and Politico have published reports with accounts of harassment and discrimination from former workers in Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign. Mr. Sanders has twice apologized publicly to women who were mistreated, and promised to do better if he runs again.
The allegations have also contributed to a shakeup of Mr. Sanders's core group of advisers. Should he run again in 2020, three top aides from the 2016 campaign either will not return or will serve in different roles, according to people close to Mr. Sanders. One of those advisers is Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager, who has said he would not return in the same role if Mr. Sanders runs again.
The meeting on Wednesday comes in response to a letter sent two weeks ago by more than two dozen people who worked on Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign, asking to meet with the senator and his leadership team to discuss issues of harassment.
Mr. Sanders and his advisers have emphasized that his 2018 Senate campaign worked with outside experts and consultants to create and implement a new harassment policy and brought in an outside human resources firm for people to report instances of mistreatment. The meeting on Wednesday will be led by Jenny Yang and Pamela Coukos from Working IDEAL, a company that advises on workplace inclusion, fair pay and diversity.
Thatmeeting follows a series of house parties across the country on Saturday in which loyal supporters urged Mr. Sanders to run; part of a live-stream presentation for the events focused on workplace conduct issues.
Sheila Healy, who worked on Mr. Sanders's re-election campaign for his Senate seat in Vermont last year, described steps his campaign had taken to make it more inclusive -- including new human-resources policies that she said were posted on walls in all of the campaign's offices. She reassured the live-stream viewers that these policies would be in place should he run again in 2020.
Ms. Healy had been asked by a moderator to discuss the measures put in place in 2018 to ensure that people working on the campaign "felt welcome and empowered and respected" and what the implications would be for 2020.
"In 2018 here in Vermont, Bernie's campaign took some of the lessons that we learned from 2016 and used them to create new policies that were designed to ensure that accountability, respect and professionalism stay a part of our culture," Ms. Healy said.

Steve King says 'white supremacist' comment 'mischaracterized'

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, quickly shot back at House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy after Republicans voted Monday evening to remove him from his committee assignments in response to comments he claims are being "mischaracterized."

In a statement, King called it “a political decision that ignores the truth."

The controversy began last week when the New York Times published an interview with King. “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? ... Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?" King said, according to the Times.

Much of the ensuing backlash has centered on the assumption that King questioned why "white supremacist" and "white nationalist" had become offensive. King argued Monday that he was only referring to Western civilization — not “any previously stated evil ideology.”

“Clearly, I was only referencing Western Civilization classes. No one ever sat in a class listening to the merits of of white nationalism and white supremacy," King said. “My record as a vocal advocate for Western Civilization is nearly as full as my record in defense of Freedom of Speech,” King said.

McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters Monday that removing King from his committee positions was a “unanimous” decision and cited that King has made similar remarks in the past.

"We will not be seating Steve King on any committees in the 116th Congress," McCarthy told reporters Monday. "It was a unanimous decision by steering in light of the comments. These are not the first time we've heard these comments."

King, who was recently re-elected in the 2018 midterm election, has faced controversy in the past, including for his endorsement of a white nationalist Toronto mayoral candidate who appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast. He tweeted last fall that the candidate, Faith Goldy, was "pro Rule of Law, pro Make Canada Safe Again, pro balanced budget, &...BEST of all, Pro Western Civilization and a fighter for our values. @FaithGoldy will not be silenced."

In his statement Monday, King said he plans to continue representing Iowa's 4th Congressional District for the remainder of his term.

Alexander: Still an uphill battle for Chargers in L.A.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

Texto completo: It took nearly seven years, but the Iowa law "protecting" farmers from surreptitious
Videotaping is finally deemed unconstitutional.
A federal judge on Wednesday struck down the so-called "ag gag" law following a challenge brought by several groups, including the ACLU of Iowa, the Animal Legal Defense Fund and the Center for Food Safety
We objected from the start when the Iowa Legislature and then-Gov. Terry Branstad made "agricultural production facility fraud" a crime. Lawmakers proclaimed they were trying to protect the animal production industry from someone who might surreptitiously videotape what goes on inside those facilities. That begs the question: What's going on that farmers need to hide?
The law likely had a chilling effect on whistle-blowers reporting unsafe or inhumane practices in animal processing and on investigative reporting of abuses within the food chain. That's a highly troubling consequence.
A law such as Iowa's would have blocked public-service efforts of the likes of Upton Sinclair, whose early 20th-century book, "The Jungle," based on his undercover work, exposed the horribly unsanitary practices of the meatpacking industry of that time.
We're living in an era where massive food contamination outbreaks are regular occurrences. Remember just a few months ago, when there wasn't a leaf of romaine lettuce on store shelves, thanks to an e-coli outbreak that sickened consumers in 16 states?
What sense does it make that Iowa law allowed for secrecy in an area that has a direct impact on the nation's food supply? It's good that the court was able to right this legislative wrong. Agricultural facilities should operate with more transparency than other industries, not less.
Nearly everyone knows someone with cancer. The disease is the country's No. 2 cause of death.
It might seem that cancer is more prevalent than ever. But there is good news on the cancer front as well, a U.S. milestone achieved: For 25 years, the death rate from cancer has dropped a little every year. All told, the rate has fallen 27 percent from 1991 to 2016.
The reasons have much to do with the science of early detection and advances in treatment. Changing behaviors is a significant factor as well: Fewer smokers means fewer deaths.
But the news, from the American Cancer Society report published last week, wasn't all good. Obesity-related cancer deaths are rising, and prostate cancer deaths are no longer dropping - perhaps linked to a decrease in routine testing for prostate cancer. Cancers like pancreatic, liver and uterine cancer are among the ones increasing and are often linked to obesity.
The statistics over the past few decades clearly show that human behavior and taking preventive steps can change cancer trends. This latest information linking the increase in obesity to increasing cancer deaths should be motivation to make lifestyle changes when it comes to diet and exercise. Like quitting smoking, it could have life-changing consequences.
It didn't take long into the new Congress' term for Rep. Steve King to say something to embarrass Iowans and make most of them regret that he is one-quarter of Iowa's representation in the U.S. House.
This time, as it so often is, it was a matter of racial bigotry and utter cluelessness.
Here's what King said in an interview with The New York Times published last week. "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
We could rail yet again on King's comments, but let's instead quote from one of the country's premier conservative publications, the National Review:
"King's comments are odious and indefensible and follow a recent pattern of irresponsible demagogy on third-rail political issues. They don't represent conservatism and he should be jettisoned by the Right.
"We doubt King paid much attention in those classes if he doesn't realize that, from Lincoln to MLK, one of the glories of American history is how we finally shed our shameful racist past," its editors wrote. A conservative opinion.
Good news, western Iowans, there will be an option to follow that advice about jettisoning King.
Republican state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced last week that he will challenge King in the next primary for his House seat in Iowa's 4th District. It's always good to have options.
Editorials reflect the consensus of the Telegraph Herald Editorial Board.
Where we stand
The law protecting the ag industry from surreptitious videotaping made us wonder, what was necessary to hide from public view?

MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR WALL

Texto completo: Mr. President, I have a few questions about your wall. I hope someone gets them to you in a format that can handle the length.
First off, since there are already about 580 miles of barriers along the U.S.border with Mexico, will your wall be roughly 1,370 miles or will you replace the existing ones, since they obviously haven't kept people out? In either case, how quickly could contractors, or the military, do this?
The military services are asked to build a lot of things in other countries, but how many members of the armed services do we have available for domestic construction when they are already stretched so thin internationally?
If this is truly an emergency and the wall has to be built posthaste, how carefully will it be built? We don't want to have to pay for a new one if it doesn't hold up.
Will soil be tested? Soil types range greatly from southeast Texas to southern California, as I'm sure you are well aware. Aren't you?
I realize you have been doing surveys, but will environmental impact studies be done? Will archaeologists be contracted to make sure that no cultural artifacts are obliterated by construction?
Will bids be requested to procure the multiple contractors that the job would require - and to make sure it's a fair process? How long will the bidding and vetting for the wall take?
Is it possible that this construction will involve change orders?
How long will the legal battles take when landowners go to court or fight eminent domain in other ways? How long will it take the courts to hand down a decision?
What consideration is being given to the deer and bison and other species that depend on seasonal migration routes between the two countries?
Will Mexico let us build on their side of the Rio Grande? If they don't, wouldn't the wall have to be built to cross the river at El Paso, which would create a barrier to river navigation?
Will there be doors in the wall in places where access is necessary, say, for maintenance on the Mexico side, in case the Mexican government won't pay for maintenance?
Will this wall be high enough to stop drones from delivering contraband? Is it possible that drones will be capable of carrying people one day, maybe soon? Will we be shooting down these drones with people in them?
Have you, or someone who can do it for you, researched the costs of all the steps? How was the $5.7 billion appropriation you are demanding arrived at?
Those are my questions for now. Thanks for your consideration. Bye-bye.
Oh, I know President Donald Trump won't see these questions. Even if he does, I'm sure he wouldn't read them.
They are based on what I know about how construction projects go from concept to reality, but I admit I know more about the processes of getting a multi-unit apartment building built in Pittsburgh than I do about construction of a wall, or parts of a wall. The projects I know more about sometimes take years.
Maybe no one, maybe not even the president, really believes that a seamless fortress could be built quickly or whether one is ever possible.
Many people who live along the border have been interviewed about their opposition to a wall and their preference for better immigration policies. Better immigration policies are crying loudly to be set.
Is anyone listening to conservationists and environmental advocates in their great concerns about migratory species and how devastating a wall would be to their habitats and their quests for native grasses and scanty water sources?
It behooves journalists who have the president's ear to delve deeper into what the process would look like.
The Department of Homeland Security is estimating that the wall would take three years to build and cost $21.6 billion. To spend that kind of money would be folly, especially without a thorough analysis and details provided to the citizens of this country, since it is we who would be paying the price.

Trump-Russia reports spur questions by Dems; GOP allies, White House defend high secrecy with Putin

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Congressional Democrats Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Donald Trump's dealings with Russia, spurred by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.
Trump's Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia, and denouncing as "ludicrous" any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.
The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-breaking fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay. They missed their first paychecks of 2019 last week.
There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week.
Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.
Trump called into a conservative talk show on Saturday to denounce a New York Times report that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump was acting as an agent for Russia.
Asked on Fox News whether he had ever "worked for Russia," Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.
"I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked - I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written," he said.
On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, after the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump's efforts to conceal what was said in meetings with Putin over the last two years.
Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said on "Fox News Sunday" that word of a counterintelligence investigation was "alarming," and that it showed the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller to proceed unimpeded.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that opening a counterintelligence investigation on a sitting president shows the FBI must have had a "very deep level of concern."
With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.
Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump's "bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies."
In a statement issued Saturday night, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader - to the extent of keeping his national security team in the dark - was of paramount concern.
"Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing," Engel said. "America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it."
Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump's demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side's only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said on CNN's "State of the Union" that "this is not a traditional president."
"He has unorthodox means," Johnson said. "But he is president of the United States. It's pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders."
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in previous efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland - but signaled that was about to change.
"Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter's notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin," he said in a statement. "The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?"
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, said, "Shouldn't we find out whether our president is really putting 'America first?' "

Texto completo: Kamala Harris's new memoir, "The Truths We Hold: An American Journey," begins with a prologue set on Nov. 8, 2016, the night Harris was elected a United States senator from California. The rest of the book addresses the urgent political matters that have risen in the wake of that night, but it also goes back to cover, among other things, Harris's tenure as California's attorney general and her childhood in Oakland as the daughter of immigrant parents: her father an economist from Jamaica and her mother a cancer researcher from India. Though rumors of Harris gearing up for a presidential run in 2020 are becoming noisier by the minute (when Stephen Colbert asked her on Thursday if she would run, Harris coyly said, "I might"), she told me the memoir is not meant to help lay the groundwork for such a campaign. "At the expense of sounding immodest," she said, the book is "really about the work I've done already that's had national impact, and what I hope to come from it." Below, Harris talks about how she connects personal experiences to her professional life, the breakneck speed of the news cycle, the inspiration she takes from Bob Marley and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
Election night, 2016. I sat on our couch at home after my night at the election party with a family-size bag of Doritos, which I ate by myself, one after the other, in awe and in shock about what I was watching on TV. It was a night that was bittersweet for my campaign, for all of us. None of us saw it coming.
After that night, I really felt a more urgent need to tell people what we're fighting for. When we talk about a fight, it's born out of optimism; and it's not a fight against something, but it's a fight for something. It was that emotion that led me to speak the words I spoke that night, about the need to fight; and that, by extension, led to the book.
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
I was raised to do things, not to talk about myself or my feelings -- or frankly, even to look back. It was an effort to talk about my feelings as things were happening. It was difficult. I talk about a lot that's really personal, and that I had not talked about in public. That was a component of it that made me feel very vulnerable. But I felt it was important to talk about for a couple of reasons. One, I'm really clear in my mind that there are a lot of experiences I've had, emotional experiences and responses, that are in common with a lot of people. But more important, I wanted to give context to the work I've done. Almost everything I've done professionally has been motivated by some experience I've been exposed to.
The process of writing the book required me to really explore what I was feeling at those moments. For example, the whole chapter that we named "Underwater" -- I had never talked about the fact that our mother bought our first house when I was a teenager. I'll never forget, when my mother came back and said, "This is going to be our home." The pictures and the excitement she had, and the excitement we then had. I connected that emotion to what it meant for all those homeowners who either had that hope when they engaged in what ended up being a fraudulent mortgage scheme or when they lost their homes. Knowing what that meant, when I'm sitting across the table from executives at the biggest banks in the country and feeling a sense of responsibility, that this wasn't simply a financial transaction. When your mother comes home with the picture of the first home you're ever going to have, it's not like someone waving around a piece of paper with a stock portfolio. It's a whole other thing.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
Hopefully the book takes the reader on a journey down memory lane about the last 12 months and how much happened. Everything is happening so rapidly right now that a lot of people tend to forget what just happened six months ago, when the thing that happened six months ago was earth-shattering. There's a lot in the book that was happening in real time; so literally as I'm writing it, it's happening. The book was due and then the Brett Kavanaugh hearings happened, and so how do I handle that? It was important to me to at least try to talk about that, knowing that people will be reading about it months after it happened.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
Certainly my mother. She was incredibly creative, as a scientist. But when I think about performers: Bob Marley. I first started listening to him when I was a child. My father had an incredible jazz collection but also a lot of Marley. I saw him in concert at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. I was hooked.
Jamaica's history is actually not that well known in the context of the issues we deal with in the United States. But Jamaica grappled with vicious slavery for generations, and then colonists, with a very strong sense of identity in terms of what it meant to be particularly a black Jamaican. A lot of his music was about what it means to fight for the people. He was a very spiritual person also. I'm very spiritual. I don't talk a lot about it, but the idea that there is a higher being and that we should be motivated by love of one another -- that also requires us to fight.
Persuade someone to read "The Truths We Hold" in 50 words or less.
I hope you'll walk away renewing your faith in the nobility and importance of public service, and convinced that we are a country that was founded on noble ideals. Imperfect though we may be, what makes us strong, and special, is that we've always aspired to reach those ideals.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, is reportedly slighted by former President Barack Obama's call for "new blood" in politics.

The 44th president, during a private Obama Foundation reception last week in Hawaii, told attendees there was a "deficit" in political leadership and that there was a need for "new blood." Though he appeared to be speaking broadly about politics not specifically the Democratic Party, The Hill reported Sunday that Obama's comments were a cause of consternation for Biden given the longtime senator's loyalty to the former president and the way his ex-boss discouraged him from running in 2016 against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.

“The president loves this guy, loves Joe, thinks the world of him. He would go in a battle ditch with Joe, but that's different than giving his brand to him,” one Obama ally told the outlet. “He has an incredible soft spot for him. And I'm sure he'll do everything he can to make Joe feel good, but he won't come out and make Joe his candidate. And I think that hurts Joe.”

Biden's spokesman, Bill Russo, did not immediately respond to the Washington Examiner 's request for comment.

Obama's remarks in Hawaii come after a Vanity Fair report last month that Biden felt stung by the former president meeting with other potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas.

Biden, who is yet to officially announce he'll launch a White House bid, told a crowd at a recent book tour event he believed he is "most qualified person in the country to be president." The New York Times reported last week that Biden is likely to declare his 2020 plans by the end of January.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.

by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily rejected a New York Times report that said the FBI opened an investigation in 2017 to determine whether he worked, knowingly or unknowingly, on behalf of Russia.
The report said that in the days after Trump fired Comey as FBI director in May 2017, the agency began investigating whether the president had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests.
The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation.
U.S. counterintelligence investigators attempted to assess whether Trump's actions constituted a possible threat to national security, and agents also tried to determine whether Trump was knowingly working for Russia or had unknowingly come under Moscow's influence, the Times reported.
Trump has repeatedly denounced the FBI and Justice Department.
"The corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" the president tweeted. "My firing of James B. Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop."
The president also criticized familiar targets including special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump concluded Saturday by asserting that he'd been tougher on Russia than former U.S. presidents.
S. Korea balks at Trump's push over more funds for U.S. troops
WASHINGTON - South Korea is resisting a Trump administration demand for sharply higher payments to defray the cost of basing U.S. forces on its territory, raising fears that President Donald Trump might threaten a troop drawdown at a time of sensitive diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula.
U.S. negotiators have sought a 50 percent increase in Seoul's annual payment, which last year was about $830 million, or about half of the estimated cost of hosting 28,500 U.S. troops, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the discussions.
South Korea is expected to make a counteroffer this month.
The standoff is straining the alliance as Trump plans a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to renew the U.S. push for elimination of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal.
Former Obama housing chief Castro enters 2020 campaign
SAN ANTONIO - Assailing President Donald Trump for "a crisis of leadership," former Obama Cabinet member Julian Castro joined the 2020 presidential race Saturday as a rush of Democrats accelerates.
Castro, 44, could end up being the only Latino in a crowded Democratic field. He was San Antonio's mayor for five year and U.S. housing secretary in President Barack Obama's second term. He became the second Democrat to formally enter the race, after former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have formed exploratory committees. Casto's first trip as a candidate comes Monday to Puerto Rico, where an outcry has begun as the White House considers diverting disaster funding to pay for a border wall.
U.S. calls for the formation of new government in Venezuela
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - The U.S. stepped up its criticism of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday with an explicit call for the formation of a new government in the South American country.
The State Department said in a statement that it stood behind the head of Venezuela's opposition-run congress, Juan Guaido, who said Friday that he was prepared to step into the presidency temporarily. The statement was the latest in a series of Trump administration attacks on Maduro, whose inauguration to a new term as president Thursday has been widely denounced as illegitimate.
"The people of Venezuela deserve to live in freedom in a democratic society governed by the rule of law," State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said.
Pompeo upbeat on deal with Turkey over Kurds
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - Despite Turkey's vows to the contrary, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday he was confident the two nations can agree on a way to protect U.S.-allied Kurdish rebels in Syria after American troops withdraw from the country.
After speaking to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Pompeo said an agreement was a work in progress but can be achieved in a way that allows the Turks to defend their country while leaving alone Kurds who do not pose a threat.
The top U.S. diplomat said he was "optimistic" that Kurds who fought alongside U.S. forces against the Islamic State group in Syria are not threatened by pledges from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to launch military operations against what he terms Kurdish "terrorists."
Hamas probe: Israel tried to wiretap group in Gaza Strip
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - Gaza's ruling Hamas said Saturday that Israeli undercover forces had attempted to install equipment to monitor the Islamic militant group's landline communications network during a botched mission in November.
The findings of an investigation were announced by the Hamas military wing, Qassam Brigades, in a prerecorded TV statement.
Hamas presented surveillance footage and photos to back up its claims.
Hamas thwarted an attempt to "plant spying devices in the Gaza Strip," a Qassam spokesman said in the statement.
Israel's military has not released details about the operation, which went awry Nov. 11, leading to the heaviest round of cross-border fire, including Hamas rockets and Israeli airstrikes, since a 2014 war between the two sides.
Still missing: Police arrested 12 people alleged to have been involved in the kidnapping of an American in Costa Rica. Police say a joint operation caught nine Costa Rican suspects Friday; three others were arrested in Spain. William Sean Creighton Kopko was abducted Sept. 24, 2018, in Costa Rica. He is still missing.
In Congo: Presidential runner-up Martin Fayulu has asked a constitutional court to order a recount. He has accused the winner, Felix Tshisekedi, of a deal with President Joseph Kabila. An official said Fayulu has two options: accept the vote or it is annulled, which would keep Kabila in power until another election.

Texto completo: Great Molasses Flood anniversary
Jan. 15 marks the 100th anniversary of Boston's Great Molasses Flood when a tank filled with as much as 2.3 million gallons of molasses collapsed, unleashing a wave of molasses that moved as fast as an estimated 35 miles per hour. Twenty-one people were killed; 150 were injured. Historian Stephen Puleo's book, “Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919" (Beacon) came out in 2004 and a new edition is being released Tuesday with a fresh afterword. The book tells the story of the disaster, not just that day and its immediate aftermath, but the decade-long lawsuit that determined who was to blame for the deadly flood, an event that exemplified “[n]early every watershed issue the country was dealing with at the time — immigration, anarchists, World War I, Prohibition, the relationship between labor and Big Business, and between the people and their government." Puleo will discuss the book on the anniversary day at 6 pm at the main branch of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square. And that night, Italian author Leonard G. Luccone will present his new book on the disaster, in Italian, at 6 pm at I Am Books, 189 North St.
Atmospheric pairing of paintings, words
“Cloud on a Mountain: Comics Poems from Greylock" (New Modern) by Boston writer and artist Franklin Einspruch is an atmospheric, elegant pairing of paintings and words.
Explaining the genre of comics poems, Einspruch writes in an e-mail, “Just as poetry uses words to produce a particular kind of literary or artistic effect, comics poetry uses words, pictures, panels, speech balloons, and the rest of the syntax of comics for the same end."
In his fluid brush strokes and distilled language, he deposits us firmly in mountain mode, attunes us to the shifting light, the movement of water and air, the growing things — wild flowers, spreads of fern, “moss is a world."
The book is the result of two residencies Einspruch was awarded at Bascom Lodge at the top of Mount Greylock, the highest point in the state, in 2015 and 2018.
The book is meditative, with a sly humor and a wisdom that's both deeply engaged and transcendentally detached. Above the silhouette of pines against a sky, these words: “everything could be beautiful or poisonous or both."
Journalist tells her own story
Kim McLarin, associate professor and graduate program director for popular fiction and publishing at Emerson, has worked as a journalist for The New York Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer. She's also written novels, including “Jump at the Sun" (William Morrow) and “Meeting of the Waters" (William Morrow), and the memoir, “Divorce Dog: Motherhood, Men, & Midlife" (Uncle Jimmy). Her latest book, “Womanish: A Grown Black Woman Speaks on Love and Life" (Ig), out this week, is a collection of essays, written with candor, wisdom, and depth of feeling, that wrestles with racism, misogyny, and alienation, from the elite halls of Phillips Exeter Academy where she attended high school, to the newsrooms where some white journalists suspected her of having gotten the job only because she was black. The book showcases a powerful, clear-eyed, and necessary voice. McLarin will discuss the book on Feb. 6 at 7 p.m. at the Harvard Book Store in Cambridge.
Coming out
“Off Season" by James Sturm (Drawn & Quarterly)
“The Hundred Wells of Salaga" by Ayesha Harruna Attah (Other)
“Republic Café" by David Biespiel (University of Washington)
Pick of the week
Kirsten Goodale at Sherman's Bookstore in Portland, Maine, recommends “Kindred" by Octavia Butler (Beacon): “A great mixture of fantasy and history that focuses on Dana, a black woman in 1976, who can time travel to the antebellum South. This means she juggles freedom (relatively) in her own time and enslavement in her time travel. A truly heartbreaking account of losing control during a horrible time in history."

Guided by his faith, he led transformation of Raytheon

Texto completo: Two decades into his tenure running Raytheon Co., Thomas L. Phillips paid a visit to a class of business graduate students at Suffolk University and offered uncommon advice.
Mr. Phillips, who was 94 when he died Wednesday in his Weston home, told the aspiring MBAs that he would never reprimand an employee in front of others “because the dignity of the individual must be preserved."
To run a good company, he added, trust and integrity are essential.
An unusual figure among the executives who transformed Route 128 into a premier technology corridor, Mr. Phillips was 40 when he became Raytheon's president in 1964.
“It was under Tom's vision and leadership that Raytheon grew into a global defense technology leader — a legacy we continue to build upon to this day," Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon's current chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “Tom was a link to Raytheon's past and future."
An electrical engineer by training, Mr. Phillips helped turn Raytheon into a billion-dollar business, then a multibillion-dollar enterprise.
And he did so with what Wall Street analysts called a gentlemanly style. More precisely, Mr. Phillips was a CEO grounded in his Christian faith.
A few years into leading Raytheon, he “attended a Billy Graham crusade in New York City and responded to the call," Mr. Phillips recalled in an interview posted on a website of Gordon College, on whose Board of Trustees he served for many years.
“I knew it was all different from that point on," he added. “I walked out into New York City and it was raining slightly and everything was beautiful. It was just an amazing experience."
Mr. Phillips paired his approach to leadership with a professionalism rooted in Raytheon's mission. Before arriving at the company, he had graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute with a bachelor's degree and a master's in electrical engineering.
He joined Raytheon in 1948, the year Charles Francis Adams became the company's president. Adams later served as board chairman during the early years Mr. Phillips was president.
Rising steadily and quickly, Mr. Phillips became manager of the missile systems department five years after arriving. He was named a vice president in 1960, general manager of the missile and space division early the following year, and executive vice president by the close of 1961. Three years later, he was president. He was named CEO in 1968, became chairman in 1975, and retired in 1991.
While Mr. Phillips was CEO, Raytheon “developed the Patriot missile defense system, navigational computers used on the Apollo lunar missions, the Cobra Dane early warning radar installation, and the Standard Missile franchise," Kennedy said. “Tom Phillips's business acumen grew Raytheon's revenue 18-fold during his tenure."
Diversification was a hallmark of his leadership. Though Raytheon's post-World War II reputation and success were closely linked to its missiles, Mr. Phillips and Adams believed the company would need other revenue if military spending tapered off. As a hedge against that possibility, Raytheon acquired companies in the engineering and publishing fields.
In some ways, the two were an unlikely pair to guide Raytheon's success. Adams was the great-great-great-grandson of President John Adams. Born to Greek parents, Mr. Phillips had arrived in Boston as an immigrant, via Canada, with an Anglicized name.
In 1985, Adams told the Globe that Mr. Phillips was “a man with a first-class mind and first-class character."
Among those whose lives Mr. Phillips changed was his friend Charles Colson, who had been special counsel to President Richard M. Nixon and who served a prison term for his role in the Watergate scandal. Inspired by Mr. Phillips's faith, Colson became an evangelical Christian and founded the Prison Fellowship, a now-international outreach organization for inmates, former prisoners, and their families.
“He led me to Christ," Colson said of Mr. Phillips in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. “What had happened in his life became a model in my own."
Amid the Watergate investigation, Colson visited Mr. Phillips in Weston in 1973. Mr. Phillips read aloud to him from the Bible and “Mere Christianity," by C.S. Lewis, “and out on my driveway, right there, he committed his life to Christ," Mr. Phillips recalled in the interview for Gordon College.
Though Mr. Phillips was somewhat private about his faith, Colson was more open and recounted that encounter in “Born Again," a memoir. “As a result of Chuck's book 'Born Again,' I was out of the closet as a Christian for everybody to see at Raytheon," Mr. Phillips said in the Gordon College interview, “and it worked out just fine."
The younger of two siblings, Thomas Leonard Phillips was born in Istanbul to Greek parents, Andromache and Leonidas. He was a boy when his father died and moved with his mother and sister first to Athens, then Paris, and eventually to Canada.
Mr. Phillips was told by his mother and sister that he was born in 1924, though Canadian immigration records suggest he was a year older. He always used 1924 as his birth year.
“My father was very stoic and strong," said his son, Tom of New York City. “He always said he got a lot of breaks along the way."
According to a family story, Mr. Phillips sold newspapers as a young boy in Canada to help his family's finances. He didn't understand why the tips were large and numerous on one particular day until his boss explained that it was Christmas.
When Mr. Phillips was 12, his mother married a widower and they moved to Mission Hill to become a blended family of seven children. Excelling at Boston Latin School, Mr. Phillips started his college studies at Northeastern University, where he played football and basketball.
At a dance, he met Gertrude Van Iderstine, a Wheelock College student, and they married in 1944. Drafted into the military, he left Northeastern and was stationed in Virginia, where he began taking classes at Virginia Tech while still serving in the Army.
After graduate school, Mr. Phillips was about to launch a teaching career when, on the advice of a Boston friend, he inquired about working for Raytheon. He was hired and stayed there his entire career.
To encourage other business leaders to think about ethical questions, Mr. Phillips founded First Tuesday, a group that met for breakfast once a month. Among those who attended over the years were Kenneth Olsen, who cofounded Digital Equipment Corp., and Governor Edward King.
Mr. Phillips also served on many boards, including those for Digital, John Hancock, and Knight Ridder, and he endowed a scholarship fund in his family's name at Boston Latin.
Despite his many business commitments, “he would say, 'Put family first' — that family was ahead of anything professional," his son said. “And he would repeat that throughout his life"
In addition to his son, Tom, Mr. Phillips leaves three daughters, Patty Fraser of Concord, Bobbie Suratt of Wellesley, and Debbie of Rye, N.Y.; 11 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.
A funeral service will be held at 2 p.m. Jan. 20 in Trinitarian Congregational Church in Wayland.
Mr. Phillips was so committed to his faith that he carefully considered the potential use of weapons Raytheon manufactured. “If I thought we were providing provocative or offensive arms then I would feel at an impasse as a Christian," he told the Times in 1976.
Ultimately, he believed defensive weapons were necessary in “an imperfect world," he told the Globe in 1985.
“We would like it to be a world where armies and weapons were not necessary," he added, but people are “flawed, I believe. And nations are flawed. We have to provide for a common defense just as a city must protect its citizens with a police force."

Texto completo: It's been more than two weeks since the partial government shutdown took effect. On Tuesday, President Trump delivered a national address on immigration to make his case for a border wall again, but Democrats and a growing number of Republicans are ready to reopen the government. These three books offer perspective on the current shutdown: the inner workings of the government offices affected, the political precedent for the present bipartisanship and the debate over a border wall.
THE FIFTH RISK
By Michael Lewis
221 pages. W.W. Norton & Company. (2018)
Lewis has a reputation for livening otherwise dry material, and according to our reviewer, "you'll be turning the pages" of this story about government bureaucracy. The fifth risk in his title (after an attack by North Korea or war with Iran, for instance) is project management, or rather the mismanagement he details within the Trump administration. Key government positions remain unfilled, and others are occupied by nonexperts in their respective offices. "The Fifth Risk" provides insight into how government offices function, particularly under the current administration.
THE RED AND THE BLUE
The 1990s and the Birth of Political Tribalism
By Steve Kornacki
497 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. (2018)
In this book, Kornacki argues that the political battles between President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, including a 21-day long government shutdown over budget disagreements, set the stage for the political divisions of today. "The early Clinton era is presented as a parade of confrontations -- over welfare, balanced budgets, health care -- that, for a time, emboldened Gingrich's showdown wing of Republicanism," wrote our reviewer. The government shutdown of 1995-96 is the longest on record, and this book explains the political tensions that caused it.
WALLS
A History of Civilization in Blood and Brick
David Frye
320 pp. Scribner. (2018)
The idea of building walls to protect and separate societies is not new, and in this accessible history, Frye chronicles walls from ancient Greece to Berlin to China. He explains that early walls were built as protection from neighboring tribes, and how the walls in China assured traders safe passage. In addition to exploring walls' role in the development of civilization, Frye also reckons with the psychological impact they can have on the migrants and refugees they keep out.

SOAKING THE RICH OCASIO-CORTEZ ACTUALLY KNOWS A LOT ABOUT TAX POLICY

Texto completo: I have no idea how well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will perform as a member of Congress. But her election is already serving a valuable purpose. You see, the mere thought of having a young, articulate, telegenic nonwhite woman serve is driving many on the right mad - and in their madness they're inadvertently revealing their true selves.
Some of the revelations are cultural: The hysteria over a video of AOC dancing in college says volumes, not about her but about the hysterics. But in some ways the more important revelations are intellectual: The right's denunciation of AOC's "insane" policy ideas serves as a good reminder of who is actually insane.
The controversy of the moment involves AOC's advocacy of a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent to 80 percent on very high incomes, which is obviously crazy, right? I mean, who thinks that makes sense? Only ignorant people like . um, Peter Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economics and arguably the world's leading expert on public finance. And it's a policy nobody has ever implemented, aside from . the United States, for 35 years after World War II - including the most successful period of economic growth in our history.
To be more specific, Mr. Diamond, with Emmanuel Saez - one of our leading experts on inequality - estimated the optimal top tax rate to be 73 percent. Some put it higher. But remember: These rates would apply only on that portion of wealthy taxpayers' incomes above a high threshold; they would pay lower rates on income below that level.
Underlying the Diamond-Saez analysis are two propositions: Diminishing marginal utility and competitive markets.
Diminishing marginal utility is the commonsense notion that an extra dollar is worth a lot less in satisfaction to people with very high incomes than to those with low incomes. Give a family with an annual income of $20,000 an extra $1,000 and it will make a big difference to their lives. Give a guy who makes $1 million an extra thousand and he'll barely notice it.
What this implies for economic policy is that we shouldn't care what a policy does to the incomes of the very rich. A policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, because they will still be able to buy whatever they want.
To put it bluntly, when taxing the rich, all we should care about is how much revenue we raise. The optimal tax rate on people with very high incomes is the rate that raises the maximum possible revenue.
And that's something we can estimate, given evidence on how responsive the pre-tax income of the wealthy actually is to tax rates. As I said, Messrs. Diamond and Saez put the optimal rate at 73 percent, others at over 80 percent - which is consistent with what AOC said.
So AOC, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research. (I hear that she's been talking to some very good economists.) Her critics, on the other hand, do indeed have crazy policy ideas - and tax policy is at the heart of the crazy.
You see, Republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy, based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy. This claim rests on research by . well, nobody. There isn't any body of serious work supporting GOP tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.
If you look at the history of top marginal income tax rates versus growth in real GDP per capita, you see that America post-World War II used to have very high tax rates on the rich - higher even than those AOC is proposing - and did just fine. Since then, tax rates have come way down, and if anything the economy has done less well.
Why do Republicans adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data? Well, ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich, and it's obvious.
And because the party's coffers demand adherence to nonsense economics, the party prefers "economists" who are obvious frauds and can't even fake their numbers effectively.
Which brings me back to AOC and the constant effort to portray her as flaky and ignorant. Well, on the tax issue she's just saying what good economists say, and she definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the Republican caucus, not least because she doesn't "know" things that aren't true.

Amazon’s Ring videos from inside customers’ homes viewed in cybercrime hotbed: reports

Texto completo: Owners of Amazon’s Ring home-security systems can see inside and outside their homes remotely — but so can a bunch of tech workers in a location that’s a hotbed of cybercrime, new reports suggest.
E-commerce giant Amazon bought Ring for $853 million last year, and the New York Times’ popular Wirecutter website soon deemed Ring’s video-equipped doorbell a worthy addition to home security.
But in addition to the doorbells, and a variety of outdoor cameras and sensors, Ring also sells indoor cameras that integrate with its home-security system, and Wirecutter has now added a warning to its review: “A recent story in The Intercept alleges that Ring may have allowed its employees inappropriate and potentially unrestricted access to its customers’ video streams or recordings.”
The Intercept, a tech-focused news site, reported that despite Ring’s mission to keep homes and their occupants secure, “the company’s treatment of customer video feeds has been anything but.”
The company gave its Ukraine-based R&D team “virtually unfettered access” to “every video created by every Ring camera around the world,” according to The Intercept.
“The Ukraine team was also provided with a corresponding database that linked each specific video file to corresponding specific Ring customers,” the site reported.
Citing unnamed sources, The Intercept reported that the Ukraine team was allowed to watch the video feeds so they could improve the company’s image-recognition software by identifying objects in imagery by tagging them.
“A second source, with direct knowledge of Ring’s video-tagging efforts, said that the video annotation team watches footage not only from the popular outdoor and doorbell camera models, but from household interiors,” The Intercept reported, adding that the process appears to still be in use at the company.
“The source said that Ring employees at times showed each other videos they were annotating and described some of the things they had witnessed, including people kissing, firing guns, and stealing.”
The site’s reporting followed an article on investigative-journalism website The Information, which first exposed the purported practice, pointing to late 2016 as the estimated time it started, and noting the significance of the R&D team’s location.
“The risk was heightened in Ukraine, a hotbed of cybercrime,” according to The Information. “If the information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could give would-be thieves a virtual guide for when to break into someone’s home.”
Amazon had imposed stricter controls on Ring employees’ viewing of video, according to The Intercept. “Employees in Ukraine are no longer allowed to download and store videos on their computers, for example,” the site reported.
A Ring spokesperson on Friday acknowledged that the firm views and annotates certain Ring videos, but said Ring takes customers’ personal information very seriously.
“These recordings are sourced exclusively from publicly shared Ring videos from the Neighbors app (in accordance with our terms of service), and from a small fraction of Ring users who have provided their explicit written consent to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes,” the spokesperson said.
“Ring employees do not have access to livestreams from Ring products.”
The company added that it holds employees to a high ethical standard, and said, “anyone in violation of our policies faces discipline, including termination and potential legal and criminal penalties. In addition, we have zero tolerance for abuse of our systems and if we find bad actors who have engaged in this behavior, we will take swift action against them.”
According to The Intercept, Ring describes “Neighbors” — a neighborhood-watch system that allows users to share information and imagery from their Ring cameras — without mentioning image recognition, and without warning that “those who use the feature are opting in to have their homes watched by individuals in a Ukrainian R&D lab.”
The company only addresses image recognition deep in its privacy policy, saying, “you may choose to use additional functionality in your Ring product that, through video data from your device, can recognize facial characteristics of familiar visitors,” the site reported.

Texto completo: Want to know a sign of a great story?
Let it age 50 years and see if it's still relevant.
Rodgers & Hammerstein's "The King and I," now closing in on 70 years old, pass such a test. In fact, it wears its timeliness like a crown upon its head. Though set during a time when Lincoln occupied the White House and written during the Truman administration, you better believe its themes hold up in the age of Trump.
"It's an all-time Golden Age musical," said Greg Zane, the choreographer of the touring show, that pulls into the Central Valley next week for a two-night run at the Saroyan Theater in Fresno. "But it also still has a lot to say to modern audiences."
As news cycles continue to be dominated by border walls, immigration, and #MeToo, the major themes of "The King and I" are very relevant, Zane said.
Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's creation first opened on Broadway in 1951, won five Tony Awards and inspired a 1956 feature film that won five Academy Awards and was revived in 2015. The Lincoln Center Theater rebirth, which sent out a national tour in November 2016, collected another four Tony Awards — including Best Musical Revival and Best Costumes.
The story, set in 1860s Bangkok — a time when Thailand was known as Siam — is centered around the relationship between the country's king and a British schoolteacher. That teacher, Anna Leonowens, is brought to the king's palace to teach his many children (and many wives). It's a clash of cultures in a tense, imperialistic world.
There are feminist currents running throughout the show, too, thanks to Rodgers and Hammerstein's knack for slipping progressive ideas into shows aimed for very broad audiences.
"They weren't afraid of taking on controversial issues – be it racism in 'South Pacific' or sexism in 'The King and I,' " Zane said.
Adding to the story's power is Tony Award-winning costume design by Catherine Zuber, scenic design, lighting design, direction and choreography that all earned Tony nominations.
That choreography, Zane said, was inspired by Jerome Robbins' original work on the musical, but updated with some 21st Century sensibility. But you can't tweak the most iconic scene.
"Everyone waits for the 'Shall We Dance' polka scene," Zane said. "You don't want to fool around with it too much."
Zane and the rest of the creative team behind "The King and I" were successful in their efforts to update the musical to the 21st Century, theater critics said.
"More than any of the great golden-age musicals ... 'The King and I' revel in spectacle," wrote Ben Brantley in a New York Times review in 2015, "But its most impressive achievement is how it balanced epic sweep with intimate sensibility."
Those superficial upgrades are a plus, sure, but wouldn't matter if the story at the heart of the show didn't still hold up. But Rodgers and Hammerstein remain giants of the art world for a reason — their stories resonate.

Texto completo: European authorities are investigating whether the Dutch government illegally allowed the American sportswear maker Nike to avoid paying taxes on profits from sales in the region, potentially exposing the company to huge penalties similar to those imposed on Apple and Amazon.
The inquiry, announced Thursday, is part of a broader European Commission crackdown on countries like Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands over accusations that they gave questionable tax breaks to multinational companies, many of them based in the United States, as a way of attracting corporate headquarters and white-collar jobs.
Similar investigations resulted in an order that Apple pay 14.3 billion euros, or $16.5 billion, to the Irish government in 2016 and a requirement that Amazon pay €283 million to Luxembourg in 2017. Starbucks paid €25.7 million to the Netherlands in 2015, and an investigation into Ikea is underway.
The Dutch Finance Ministry said Thursday that it was cooperating with the investigation. "We fully support the work of the commission," the ministry said in a statement.
Nike said in its own statement that the investigation was "without merit."
"Nike is subject to and rigorously ensures that it complies with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands," the company, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., said in the statement.
The Netherlands has long been a magnet for multinational corporations, attracting more foreign investment than Germany or France because of its business-friendly tax laws and its accommodating officials.
Big companies have typically worked out arrangements with the Dutch Finance Ministry under which they minimized their tax bills by funneling profits to offshore tax havens with little or no corporate taxes. About €22 billion a year flows through the Netherlands to low-tax countries, according to the ministry, which did not provide an estimate of how much Nike might have saved.
Airbus, Fiat Chrysler, Google, IBM and the Renault-Nissan alliance are among the corporations that have headquarters in the Netherlands. Nike's European headquarters are in Hilversum, just south of Amsterdam.
The Netherlands has come under pressure from the European Commission and Dutch citizens disgruntled about special favors for big companies. Officials in Amsterdam have responded by vowing to tighten rules that allow companies to camouflage profits as "royalties" and protect them from taxes.
Dutch officials have also said that they would no longer approve corporate structures that allowed companies to steer profits to low-tax countries and that royalties would be subject to taxation starting in 2021. The Netherlands is also moving to eliminate inconsistencies in international tax laws that corporations can exploit to avoid taxes.
Nike's tax practices in the Netherlands have drawn scrutiny before. It used a common method of shifting profits to a tax haven, according to research published in 2017 by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists based on leaked documents known as the Paradise Papers. (The New York Times is a member of the consortium.)
First, Nike allocated ownership of its "swoosh" trademark and other intellectual property to a subsidiary in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. The subsidiary in Hilversum then paid royalties for the use of the trademarks to the Bermuda unit. The royalties counted as business expenses and therefore were not taxed in the Netherlands.
The company's strategies also lowered its tax bill in the United States and cut its worldwide tax rate to as low as 13 percent in 2017 from 35 percent in 2006, saving billions of dollars, according to the consortium.
The European Commission is investigating whether the Dutch government violated European Union rules by approving the tax avoidance scheme and giving Nike and its Converse unit an unfair advantage over competitors.
From 2005 to 2015, the commission said in a statement, the Dutch authorities endorsed Nike's method for calculating the tax-deductible royalties paid to offshore subsidiaries. The commission said it was examining whether the royalties paid to the offshore units, which had no employees, were higher than the market value of the intellectual property.
By paying an inflated price for the royalties, Nike could claim a larger tax deduction.

Texto completo: A media mystery popped up a week before Christmas: Leslie Moonves, who had just been fired as the chief executive of CBS after multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, appeared to give an exclusive, on-the-record interview to a little-known publication in which he bluntly addressed his dismissal.
Agenda, a news service owned by The Financial Times, quoted Mr. Moonves in an article as saying, "How quickly the board forgets the job I did for CBS. They were a rudderless ship when I went there, when I took over." Later in the article, the interview subject addressed the board's decision to deny him a $120 million severance payment, saying, "I think the board will do the right thing, ultimately."
It was an unlikely-seeming exclusive. Mr. Moonves had shunned all interview requests since the publication of an article in The New Yorker last summer that included detailed, on-the-record accounts from women saying that he had sexually assaulted them.
For much of 2018, reporters at major outlets, including The New York Times, had aggressively sought Mr. Moonves, with little success. The idea that Agenda, a niche outlet with 6,000 subscribers focused on corporate governance issues, had scored his first on-record comments since his firing struck many observers as implausible.
It turns out the interview, published on Dec. 18, may have been bogus.
On Thursday, Agenda removed Mr. Moonves's comments from the article and attached an editor's note that read, in part, "A spokesperson for Mr. Moonves issued a statement denying that Mr. Moonves spoke with reporters from Agenda."
At the same time, the publication did not admit error, adding later in the note, "We stand by our reporters' portrayal of those conversations but, in light of the statement from Mr. Moonves, we have removed the quotes from the article."
Before the retraction, a number of publications, including The Times, had reprinted the executive's supposed comments.
The statements attributed to Mr. Moonves in the Agenda story were potentially significant, since he can appeal the board's decision on the $120 million within 30 days of Dec. 17, the date the CBS Corporation board formally decided to characterize his ouster from the company as a firing with cause.
The board was unequivocal in firing Mr. Moonves. It determined that he had misled the company about the allegations made against him and found that he had tried to hide evidence from investigators in "breach of his employment contract." (Mr. Moonves has said that any sexual contact with the women was consensual.)
The Agenda article suggested, through Mr. Moonves's now-retracted comments, that he was contemplating action against CBS.
So what happened?
The reporters, Stephanie Forshee and Jennifer Williams-Alvarez, did what most writers do when trying to track down a high-profile subject: They trawled the Nexis database. After they entered his name, the database spit back several phone numbers. The reporters tried each one, until someone on the other end of the call identified himself as "Les Moonves."
The interview lasted a few minutes. In a follow-up, the reporters called the same number -- which has a Maryland area code -- to ask a few more questions, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to discuss what happened publicly. They also shared relevant emails with The Times.
A few days after the article appeared, Chris Giglio, a spokesman for Mr. Moonves, said the former executive had not spoken with Agenda. Mr. Moonves himself called Lionel Barber, the editor of The Financial Times, to complain, according to the two people. Mr. Barber, who used to be the managing editor of the newspaper's United States operation, had become friendly with Mr. Moonves over the years.
Mr. Barber told Mr. Moonves that he was unaware of the article and would look into it, one of the people said. But Agenda is editorially independent of The Financial Times, and the decision on how to handle the complaint fell to the Agenda newsroom.
Mr. Moonves, through a spokesman, issued a statement on Tuesday: "Mr. Moonves did not speak with reporters from Agenda in December 2018 or at any other time. Any suggestion that he did is without any factual basis whatsoever."
Agenda added an editor's note to the article reflecting the statement, but did not make any substantial changes to the piece. After inquiries from media reporters, the publication removed the comments attributed to Mr. Moonves.
The editor of Agenda, Andy Willmott, and the reporters offered no statement beyond the editor's note.
Mr. Moonves has yet to give an extensive on-the-record interview on the accusations made against him. The person who answered the call from the Agenda reporters remains a mystery.
When a reporter for The Times tried the same number, a man answered by saying, "Guten Tag" -- German for "good day." Asked if he was Les Moonves, he ended the call.
The Financial Times owns several titles, part of what it calls its "Specialist" group. Agenda charges about $9,600 a year for a subscription, with corporate accounts making up a big portion of its circulation. The CBS board has a subscription, but it's unclear if the directors read it on a regular basis.

American Airlines stock drops, pulling down other airlines, on weaker earnings American Airlines Group stock tumbled more than 4 percent and pulled other carriers in its wake after saying 2018 earnings could fall short of its forecast because domestic fares were weaker than expected. Adjusted earnings will be $4.40 to $4.60 a share, the carrier said Thursday in a regulatory filing. American had forecast profit of as much as $5, and analysts had anticipated $4.62. The update compounded a bleak outlook for US carriers as economic uncertainty threatens global demand. Delta Air Lines Inc. recently trimmed its forecast for a key gauge of pricing power and set the stage for a gloomy earnings season, which kicks off next week for the major carriers. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
EMPLOYMENT
Audit finds program designed for young workers hired a 62-year-old A New York state audit has found lapses at a program that rewards employers who hire young workers — including a 62-year-old who was deemed eligible for the program. The review, published Thursday by Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, found several problems in the state-run program, including nearly $200,000 in questionable tax credits. Some of the companies that received the credits hired employees who were too old for the program, while others didn't adequately verify their employee's eligibility. The jobs program, started in 2011, encourages employers to hire at-risk youth ages 16 to 24 by awarding tax credits of up to $500 for a full-time worker. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

US supplier of T-shirts, team apparel cuts ties to Chinese company over forced labor A United States supplier of T-shirts and other team apparel to college bookstores cut its ties Wednesday with a Chinese company that drew workers from an internment camp holding targeted members of ethnic minority groups. In recent years, authorities in the far west Chinese region of Xinjiang have detained an estimated 1 million Uighurs and Kazakhs in heavily-secured facilities where detainees say they are ordered to renounce their language and religion while pledging loyalty to the China's ruling Communist Party. Last month an Associated Press investigation found the Chinese government had also started forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. The investigation tracked recent shipments from one such factory, the privately owned Hetian Taida Apparel, located inside an internment camp, to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, N.C. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
MORTGAGES
Rates fall to lowest level in nine months Long-term mortgage rates continued to fall this week, reaching their lowest levels in nine months. The decline in home borrowing rates in recent weeks has been a spur to prospective home buyers, reflected in a spike in applications for mortgages. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac says the average rate on the benchmark 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage dipped to 4.45 percent this week from 4.51 percent last week. Rates remain far above last year's levels, however. The key 30-year rate averaged 3.99 percent a year ago. The average rate for 15-year fixed-rate loans fell to 3.89 percent from 3.99 percent last week. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Shaheen, Hassan file legislation to block drug companies from ad expense deductions Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, has introduced a bill that would prohibit pharmaceutical companies from claiming tax deductions for consumer advertising expenses. Under current law, drug manufacturers are allowed to deduct the cost of advertising expenses from federal taxes. A news release from Shaheen's office Thursday said those advertising expenses have more than quadrupled over the past two decades, rising from $1.3 billion in 1997 to $6 billion in 2016. Shaheen said the aggressive advertising also increases demand and allows drug companies to increase prices. She said taxpayers shouldn't be subsidizing the ads. The bill is cosponsored by fellow Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Google wins a round in European 'right to be forgotten' case Google shouldn't have to apply the so-called right to be forgotten globally, an adviser to the EU's top court said in a boost for the US giant's fight with a French privacy regulator over where to draw the line between privacy and freedom of speech. While backing Google's stance, Advocate General Maciej Szpunar of the EU Court of Justice said that search engine operators must take every measure available to remove access to links to outdated or irrelevant information about a person on request. The Luxembourg-based court follows such advice in a majority of its final rulings, which normally come a few months after the opinions. Google has been fighting efforts led by France's privacy watchdog to globalize the right to be forgotten, which was created by the EU court in a landmark ruling in 2014, without defining how, when, and where search engine operators should remove links. This has triggered a wave of legal challenges. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Google shareholder sues over large payouts to sexual harassers A Google shareholder sued the company's board of directors and senior management on Thursday, arguing that the tech giant's leaders breached their duty to investors when they covered up sexual misconduct by executives and gave harassers large payouts. The suit, by shareholder James Martin, stems from revelations last year that the company awarded a $90 million exit package to executive Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android operating system, even as Rubin was being pushed out over sexual misconduct. Google had asked for Rubin's resignation in 2014 after determining that allegations that he had coerced a woman into performing oral sex in a hotel room the previous year were credible. Rubin was celebrated when he left Google, and the real reason for his departure was made public by the Information and New York Times, which also reported the payout. Rubin has denied the allegations. — WASHINGTON POST

Group funded by Coca-Cola undermines Chinese fight against obesity, research finds China's efforts to keep obesity in check have been undermined from the inside by the food industry, according to newly published research. A scholar of Chinese society at Harvard University traced how a group funded by Coca-Cola and other food companies enjoyed close ties to Chinese health officials. The group helped tilt the country's obesity fight with the message that exercise matters more than dietary habits, which health advocates say is a way to deflect attention from food's role in fueling obesity. The International Life Sciences Institute was created in 1978 by a former Coke executive and has 17 branches around the world. In China, its small but influential branch organized obesity conferences focusing on physical activity, with speakers including Coke-funded researchers and a Coke executive, according to the papers published in The BMJ and The Journal of Public Health Policy. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Steve King: How did white nationalist, supremacist language become offensive?

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, wants to know how it became so controversial to talk about white nationalism and white supremacy.

“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King asked the New York Times in an interview published on Thursday. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”

The comments from King, who last year almost lost his bid for a ninth term in Congress despite representing a strongly Republican district, immediately attracted criticism. Among his detractors, Rep. Justin Amash, a GOP lawmaker from Michigan.

"This is an embrace of racism, and it has no place in Congress or anywhere," Amash tweeted.

In the New York Times interview, King reiterated that he was not a racist. He told the newspaper his Twitter account demonstrated how he frequently welcomed constituents of all backgrounds to his Washington office, which once showcased a Confederate flag. But the Iowa Republican said he wanted immigrants to assimilate with "the culture of America."

King's remarks come after Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds told reporters she would not endorse him in his primary challenge in 2020. King served as Reynolds' campaign co-chairman in 2018.

King faced a backlash ahead of his Nov. 6 re-election for statements he made about race and immigration policy. He declined to delete a retweeted Twitter post about "Satan" George Soros, which critics took as anti-Semitic, especially after last year's fatal shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pa.

King also drew negative attention in August for giving an interview to members of the Austria Freedom Party, a group with ties to white nationalists. He additionally backed Faith Goldy, a mayoral candidate in Toronto, who appeared on a neo-Nazi podcast.

McCarthy, Scalise denounce Steve King over 'white supremacist' remarks

Texto completo: House GOP leadership called out Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, Thursday evening for remarks published earlier in the day in which King asked when terms like “white nationalist, white supremacist” became offensive.

In a statement, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., decried King's remarks.

“Everything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation," McCarthy said. "Steve’s language is reckless, wrong, and has no place in our society. The Declaration of Independence states that ‘all men are created equal.’ That is a fact. It is self-evident.”

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said that it was "offensive" that King would "try to legitimize" that kind of rhetoric, adding that white supremacy is "evil." King had told the New York Times he wasn't sure how terms such as "white nationalist, white supremacy, [and] Western civilization" became offensive language.

"I think it's offensive to try to legitimize those terms," Scalise told reporters in his office in the Capitol. "I think it's important that he rejected that kind of evil, because that's what it is: evil ideology."

The Iowa Republican's remarks were just the latest in a history of comments that Republicans have found offensive. Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, had chastised King as "completely inappropriate" for comments he made prior to the 2018 midterm elections.

On Wednesday, Randy Feenstra, an Iowa state senator, announced that he would launch a primary bid for King's seat. When asked if House Republicans or the House GOP campaign arm should take sides against King, Scalise declined to say.

"Oh, I have no idea what's happening in terms of primaries right now," Scalise said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: The man whose story was the basis of the award-winning 2018 Spike Lee film "BlackKKlansman" is coming to Iowa City.
Ron Stallworth, a black man who infiltrated the Klu Klux Klan in Colorado as an undercover member of the Colorado Springs Police Department in the 1970s, will be the first speaker of the University of Iowa Lecture Committee's 2019 spring semester series, according to the committee's Facebook page.
The event is set to take place at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 23 at The Englert Theatre. UI Lecture Committee events are free and open to the public. The event will be unticketed and seats will be open on a first come, first served basis, according to a Lecture Committee spokesperson. Doors will open at 7 p.m.
The event is being produced in conjunction with UI's Division of Student Life and the UI Office of the Dean of Students.
Stallworth's story has seen a resurgence in popularity due to Lee's movie. "BlackKKlansman" won the Grand Prize of the Jury award, the second-most prestigious award at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, arguably the most respected film festival in the world. It was nominated for four Golden Globes and is expected to receive several Academy Award nominations later this month.
The Washington Post's film critic Ann Hornaday ranked the movie as the fifth-best in 2018, calling it "undeniably powerful, as the story grows beyond itself to become both a potent polemic and heartbreaking elegy." Both head New York Times film critics Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott listed it in their top 10 of the year as well.
The movie has been praised for making connections between the racism of the past to the hateful rhetoric and rise of the alt-right of today.
Stallworth, 65, was born in Chicago and raised in El Paso, Texas. In the 1970s, he moved to Colorado Springs. He became a police officer in 1974. In 1979, he became a member of the KKK by calling the hate group and having a white officer pose as him in meetings with the notoriously hooded group.
Throughout the investigation, he had phone conversations with David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the KKK. He also helped identify two employees of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, who were trying to hide their KKK membership.
He never spoke publicly about the investigation until he gave an interview to the Deseret News of Salt Lake City in 2006. In 2014, he published a book about the investigation called "Black Klansman."
Stallworth said in an NPR interview: "To be honest with you, we were getting a lot of laughs out of it, the fact that these so called smart people were being fooled by one of the very individuals that they criticized and condemned as being intellectually inferior to them."
He added that his membership card for the KKK was autographed by Duke and hung on the wall of his office for more than 15 years.

Texto completo: Andy Samberg's cop comedy "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" makes its sixth season premiere on NBC, and the first season of "Lodge 49" is available to stream on Hulu.
What's on TV
BROOKLYN NINE-NINE 9 p.m. on NBC. After Andy Samberg's police comedy was canned from Fox in May, NBC announced that it had picked up the show for its sixth season. The NBC premiere follows Samberg's Jake Peralta and Melissa Fumero's Amy Santiago on their honeymoon, while Captain Holt finds out whether he'll become the new N.Y.P.D. commissioner.
TRUTH AND LIES: MONICA AND BILL 9 p.m. on ABC. It's been nearly 20 years since Congress attempted to impeach President Bill Clinton for charges that stemmed from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but the bombshell political saga continues to reverberate across pop culture. Last year, it became the subject of the second season of Slate's "Slow Burn" podcast, and the events were also considered for an installment of Ryan Murphy's "American Crime Story" series. (The creator reconsidered.) On Thursday night, however, a two-hour special on ABC takes a closer look at the scandal, including hours of phone calls Linda Tripp secretly recorded between herself and Lewinsky, who was then a White House intern. The special also features surveillance material and recordings gathered by the special counsel, and excerpts from Barbara Walters's 1999 interview with Lewinsky. The "Truth and Lies" series has delved into true crimes like the Menendez brothers murders and the Jonestown massacre.
THE GOOD PLACE 9:30 p.m. on NBC. Since the show's midseason finale last month, the only high jinks we've gotten to see from the "Good Place" gang came during the Golden Globes, when Jameela Jamil, who plays Tahani on the show, was hilariously misnamed "Kamilah Al-Jamil," her one-upping onscreen sister, in a title card on the E! red-carpet preshow. But on Thursday fans will finally get to see the group reunited in what appears to be the honest-to-goodness Good Place.
What's Streaming
LODGE 49 on Hulu. Sunday night's Golden Globe Awards celebrated what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association deemed the best of film and television, but many shows that hit the small screen in 2018 may have been overlooked. One such series, which The New York Times named one of the best on TV last year, was AMC's "Lodge 49," which follows the misadventures of a down-and-out surfer, Dud (Wyatt Russell), who, moneyless, jobless and unapologetically aimless, somehow winds up finding purpose in a fraternal lodge that is home to eccentric Californians like himself. The Times critic James Poniewozik named the show a Critic's Pick, and said, "Falling into 'Lodge 49' is like hanging out at an oddball dive bar that you ignored the instinct to keep walking past." The first season is available to stream on Hulu, and is available on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.

Tom Steyer bows out of 2020, announces plans to light his money on fire instead

Texto completo: Most politicians go to Iowa to announce their plans to run for president. Tom Steyer made the trek to do the opposite. From Des Moines, he announced to the country that he won’t be running. He’d rather light his money on fire.

Steyer will spend 2019 continuing his efforts to impeach the current president, dumping $40 million more into the effort.

This left political observers perplexed. His impeachment talk was always quixotic, the stuff that excites Vox bloggers, yes, but always with a larger purpose in mind. The smart play would have been to whip progressives into a frenzy over impeachment, collect all their relevant contact information, and then use that hysteria and those collected email address to fuel a run on the White House.

And for a while it looked like Steyer was building exactly this kind of primary-busting machine. He paid for television ads and conducted polling in early primary states. He put a team together and designated an acting campaign manager. All Steyer had to do, as the New York Times reports, was give the word, and his impeachment advocacy groups would transform into presidential political machines overnight.

It was all for naught though. Steyer isn’t running.

“We have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse,” Steyer said in an announcement that reads like something from Rachel Maddow’s teleprompter.

“Donald Trump’s removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in America — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. It is past time for members of Congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. The question remaining is what will Congress do?”

The obvious answer? Absolutely nothing. Why? The numbers say so.

If he hasn’t already, Steyer should familiarize himself with Article I of the Constitution and the results of the latest midterm election. The House of Representatives must first vote to impeach the president. This requires a simple majority, which is possible thanks to the electioneering efforts of newly minted Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. But then the Senate must decide whether or not to convict. That requires a two-thirds supermajority, which is all but impossible so long as Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., remains majority leader.

There just aren’t enough votes for impeachment, and Steyer won’t get any more votes before 2020, no matter how much money he burns.

This leaves Democrats in something of a bind. They need to find another billionaire, and fast. Perhaps a caffeine-addled Howard Schultz or nanny-minded Michael Bloomberg can fill in. Like Steyer, they have their own billions. Unlike Steyer, they hopefully have a grasp on basic political arithmetic.

Texto completo: At the surface, boiling water kills off most life. But Geogemma barossii is a living thing from another world, deep within our very own. Boiling water - 212 degrees Fahrenheit - would be practically freezing for this creature, which thrives at temperatures around 250 degrees Fahrenheit.
No other organism on the planet is known to be able to live at such extreme heat.
But it’s just one of many mysterious microbes living in a massive subterranean habitat that until recently has been practically invisible. Over the past decade, scientists from around the world have banded together under the Deep Carbon Observatory to make sense of these hidden habitats. The observatory’s researchers presented some of their recent discoveries last week.
With high-tech drills, remotely operated underwater vehicles and submersibles, pressurized collection tubes, the latest DNA technology and computer modeling, the researchers have explored volcanoes, diamond mines, deep-sea hot springs, underwater mud volcanoes and other extreme sites beneath our oceans and continents. What they’ve found turns what we know about the world literally upside down.
So science fiction fans, rejoice. The real journey to the center of the Earth has begun.
Lords of the Underground
Altiarchaeales belong to a domain of nucleus-lacking single-celled microbes called Archaea. Archaea and bacteria make up the majority of life in the deep subsurface, and it’s estimated that there are more of these kinds of microbes below ground than above.
Some 200 to 600 octillion microbes live beneath our continents, suggests an analysis of data from sites all over the world, and even more live beneath the seafloor. Together they weigh the equivalent of up to 200 million blue whales - and far more than all 7.5 billion humans. Subterranean diversity rivals that of the surface, with most underground organisms yet to be discovered or characterized.
That means most microbes on the planet may not resemble our mental picture of a microbe at all, said Cara Magnabosco, a computational biologist at the Flatiron Institute in New York.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
As scientists continue their studies, the organisms they find are challenging and expanding the tree of life.
Just as vegetation varies between deserts, rain forests and Arctic tundras, microbial communities vary between habitats - whether buried beneath sediments or sulfuric crust in the seafloor, or encased within granite, basalt, sandstone or clay beneath continents. There are even some fungi and multicellular organisms, like insects and worms, living deep below ground.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
No Oxygen? Breathe Rocks
There are basically two kinds of feeders in the deep subsurface. Some scavengers survive on leftovers of photosynthesis from the surface that have been buried for up to hundreds of millions of years.
Chemolithoautotrophs, on the other hand, do a kind of sunless photosynthesis and breathe whatever is around.
“We are familiar with oxygen breathing, but the microorganisms have multiple options,” said Isabelle Daniel, a geobiologist at Universite Claude Bernard Lyon in France.
Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator breathes what’s released when certain rocks meet water: “You take a rock. Put it with water. Heat it up a bit, not even extreme heat, and it will produce everything that life needs to go,” said Karen Lloyd, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
Other microbes even breathe uranium and expel the waste as teeny crystals.
Subsurface microbes might only reproduce every 30 years, or take even longer. If nutrients run low, the microbes enter a dormant stage and focus the little energy they have on maintenance.
They’ll reproduce when some other energy source comes along - and that takes time, perhaps geological time. It can take tens to thousands of years for a new population to replace an old one.
Where Life May Have Started
We don’t know where, when or how they got here, but we do know that the chemistry in the deep subsurface supports life and that these deep-dwelling microbes seem to share a common ancestor with surface dwellers.
Earth’s early chemistry, before oxygen became present in abundance billions of years ago, may have been similar to the deep subsurface biosphere. That has led some scientists to ponder whether this could have been where life began.
By modeling the deep subsurface biosphere and how the right chemical reactions could give rise to organic matter, researchers are hoping to get closer to an answer about whether life emerged at the surface or in the deep.
Other scientists wonder if understanding life in the subsurface could point toward life elsewhere in the solar system, like Mars or Europa.
“Could there be a deep biosphere on these other worlds?” said Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory and George Mason University who directs the observatory.
Until that gets worked out, this new-old world is “providing us with a vivid new way of thinking about ‘What is life?’ “ Hazen said.
Digging Up More Answers
Scientists have discovered microbes thriving 3 miles below the continental surface, and methane-producing bacteria 6 miles below the seafloor.
“If you snubbed out the sun tomorrow, these guys wouldn’t even care,” Lloyd said.
We still don’t know how much deeper life may go.
In the 1970s, Soviet scientists drilled 7.5 miles into Earth’s crust in what’s known as the Kola Superdeep Borehole. They didn’t find much living that deep, but they weren’t really looking for it either, Lloyd said.
Now, with a Japanese deep-drilling vessel called Chikyu, scientists like her are trying to make it all the way through to the mantle - an 1,800-mile-thick layer of rocks and minerals between the crust we live on and the core of the planet.
“They haven’t gone that far yet, but we’ve all got our fingers crossed,” Lloyd said. “We have yet to say that we’ve truly drilled past the point where life exists.”
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
It’s hard to know for certain if conditions will be too severe in the mantle to sustain life. These microbes, which can subsist on the tiniest drop of water (many don’t even need oxygen) are constantly testing life’s known limits.
“We find cells in places where we thought there wouldn’t be any cells,” Daniel said.
Heat rises nearer the core, and too much may destroy the proteins and fats that make up cells, as happens in the lab.
“How far does this extend?” Daniel asked.
We won’t know until we get there.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry.
Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m.
An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: ANKARA, Turkey--President Trump's national security adviser is likely to face an icy reception in Ankara on Tuesday over his remarks that a U.S. withdrawal from Syria is contingent on whether Turkey can guarantee the safety of the Kurdish forces across its border.
The comments by John Bolton, calling on the Turks to commit to the safety and security of U.S.-allied Kurdish rebel groups in Syria, angered the government in Ankara, which has insisted for years that Syria's Kurdish rebel groups are terrorists and pose an existential threat.
On Monday, pro-government daily newspaper Yeni Safak carried a front-page photo of Mr. Bolton with a banner headline saying: "Who are you?"
Mr. Bolton, who arrived in the Turkish capital on Monday, is scheduled to meet with top Turkish officials in the hope of laying the groundwork for America's exit from Syria.
Less than a month ago, Turkish officials thought they had struck a deal with the U.S. on Syria, which thrust Turkey into the role of Washington's indispensable partner in the Middle East--a dramatic change of fortune after months of turbulent relations.
During a Dec. 14 phone call with President Trump, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had pledged to relieve the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State extremist group in Syria. Days later, Mr. Trump, citing Turkey's commitment, publicly announced his intention to quickly withdraw from Syria. He had promised such a withdrawal while campaigning for president, but doing so has proved difficult amid fears of a power vacuum in Syria.
Turkish officials applauded the U.S. decision to leave Syria and end its partnership with the Kurdish YPG militia, and Mr. Trump had made no mention of a requirement that Turkey protect those fighters. Only on Sunday, when Mr. Bolton spoke with journalists traveling with him to Israel and Turkey, did the condition come to light.
Now, the entire agreement could be at risk, Turkish officials and analysts said.
"There is no need to explain that a terror organization cannot be a U.S. ally," Ibrahim Kalin, an Erdogan spokesman and Mr. Bolton's counterpart in the Syrian discussions, said Sunday.
Mr. Bolton and his team of negotiators, which includes State Department envoy James Jeffrey and Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, traveled to Turkey in hope of carving out a plan for that nation to take over the fight, as well as to discuss possible measures to ensure Ankara sticks to its pledges.
A senior administration official said the U.S. is, for example, considering maintaining control of the airspace in northern Syria to ensure that allied forces in the region aren't subjected to air attacks by the Syrian government or anyone else.
Kurdish fighters long have provided the U.S. with solid support in the campaign against Islamic State. But Turkey considers itself justified in targeting those fighters and doesn't draw distinctions between those groups and militant groups like Islamic State.
In December, Mr. Erdogan said he would launch a military intervention in northeastern Syria to combat Kurdish rebels it regards as terrorists, drawing a stern warning from the Pentagon.
"We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that's not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum," Mr. Bolton said on Sunday.
In a New York Times opinion piece on Monday, Mr. Erdogan said he intends to use a "complete vetting process" after any U.S. withdrawal from Syria to make sure fighters have "no links to terrorist organizations." "Under Turkey's watch, the Syrian territories that are under the control of the Y.P.G. or the so-called Islamic State will be governed by popularly elected councils," he wrote, noting that YPG has links to the PKK, which both Turkey and the U.S. have labeled a terrorist organization. "Individuals with no links to terrorist groups will be eligible to represent their communities in local governments."
Turkey's unhappiness over the evolving U.S. position on the Syrian troop pullout came after the two capitals appeared to be renewing ties. Turkey released American pastor Andrew Brunson in October, after his two years in detention on terror charges clouded the relationship .
Following Mr. Brunson's safe arrival back in the U.S., Mr. Trump said the U.S. was on track to have "a terrific relationship with Turkey."
At the same time, Turkey was embroiled in a spat with Saudi Arabia over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi , a journalist who had been critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Although Mr. Trump has dismissed a Central Intelligence Agency assessment that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, Mr. Erdogan has seized on the widespread uproar over Mr. Khashoggi's death to rebuild his standing in Washington.
Saudi officials say Prince Mohammed played no role in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.
Turkey has had a lot at stake as it has sought to improve ties with the Trump administration. With its economy in decline and calls for a bailout growing, its place as a regional power has increasingly come into question in recent years.
The Syria issue also is a test for the Trump administration, given the president's promised withdrawal, but with many interpreting Mr. Bolton's comments to be a case of mixed messaging.
"Nobody knows anything about the U.S. withdrawal strategy now," said Murat Yesiltas, an analyst at SETA, an Ankara-based think tank close to the Turkish government. "If the U.S. can't provide Turkey with a clear road map on the withdrawal, Turkey will probably take military action against the YPG."

Cambridge officials want to add gender-neutral option to birth certificates

Texto completo: Officials in Cambridge are pushing for a gender-neutral option to be added to birth certificates for people born in the city who don't identify as male or female, a move inspired by municipalities that have adopted similar legislation across the country.
A policy order introduced by Mayor Marc McGovern this month, and cosponsored by several city councilors, asks the city solicitor to draft a home-rule petition to send to the state Legislature that would allow people to amend their birth certificates and choose “X" as a gender option.
“Cambridge strives to be a welcoming community to all — including our transgender and gender non-binary friends and neighbors," the order states, “a goal that the Council can advance by joining other jurisdictions in offering a third gender category and removing barriers for residents born in this city to amend their birth certificates."
Officials argue that by adding an “X" option residents would be granted “more control in defining for the government who they are and affirming their humanity and dignity."
In a telephone interview Monday, McGovern said a new law in New York City prompted him to introduce the policy order.
In October, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed a bill allowing residents who don't identify as male or female to instead select “X" on a birth certificate.
The bill also removed the requirement for people to get a note from a doctor or mental health professional before amending the gender on their birth certificates, according to the New York Times. It went into effect in New York City on Jan. 1.
California, Oregon, Washington state, and New Jersey offer similar gender-neutral options for people who want to amend their birth certificates, according to the report.
“I read up about it and talked to some people and said, 'All right, we should follow their lead and do that here and hopefully others will follow our lead,' " McGovern said.
Cambridge's policy order — a preliminary step in the process — will go before the City Council during a regularly scheduled hearing Monday night.
Members of the public will have a chance to weigh in on the proposal during an open comment period at the start of the meeting.
If the council approves the order, the city solicitor would then draft a proposal before bringing it back to elected officials for a second vote. From there, it would be sent to the state Legislature for approval, McGovern said.
When asked whether the proposal would be considered for a future vote, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Robert DeLeo said in a statement that he is “proud of the House's leadership in fighting for civil rights for transgender individuals."
“We will review any proposal sent to the House," she added.
McGovern said if it eventually becomes law, Cambridge would be the first community in the state to give residents the option.
“We are a diverse, inclusive community and we should be leading the way on these issues. And you know, I want everyone in our city to feel that they belong here," McGovern said. “I think that this will go a long way in allowing people to really see that the community supports them and they are welcome."

Texto completo: The key to investing success in 2019 is remembering that "V" is for victory.
December was wretched for stocks, but it's over. As I detailed last week, stocks always bounce after extreme nasty stretches. And they do so in a near-perfect V-shaped pattern, it's merely a question of when. You've survived the left side of a V: the terrifying slide. Soon stocks will rocket up the V's right side, if they haven't already started.
So let's talk about the V's left side. Last week, I said December's market action seemed like "mass forced institutional liquidations" – shuttering hedge funds scrambling for cash by year end. There isn't good data on this, but hundreds of hedge funds closed Dec. 31 after botching three straight years. Most were bearish in 2016 and 2017, fearing Trumpageddon. They lagged terribly as U.S. stocks rose 36.4 percent. Then they reversed in 2018, swinging uber-bullish, and getting hammered as stocks fell after September.
The hedge fund business model makes these long, lagging stretches challenging to recover from. The funds are paid largely through a 20 percent fee on any gains above some contractually detailed "high-water mark" in the value of the investments. That mark doesn't ever reset when asset values fall. If they get too far underwater and can't get back above it before long, continuing isn't worthwhile. Their self-interest becomes closing shop and starting fresh later. Hence this year's unusual stampede for liquidating cash by year end.
Then, too, most hedge funds let their investors leave only at contractually specified periods. So many surviving funds likely felt forced to raise cash, anticipating disappointed investors fleeing right about now, when redemption windows open. The result: Mass December selling, which prioritized speed over price. Imagine hundreds of folks in a one-door room. One yells "FIRE!" They all start stampeding together. That was most of December.
They seemingly were largely done liquidating by Dec. 26, when stocks rose 5 percent. That may have reflected others who earlier, expecting more of the same, had sold short (selling un-owned, borrowed shares) to profit from expected further declines but got pinched by the rebound. If so, the V's right side is likely underway now.
Last year reminds me of 2011. Few recall, but stocks had a full-scale 2011 correction from May to October. Using closing prices, the Standard & Poor's 500 fell 19.4 percent. Bear market dread abounded that October, like now. Then came the V. By Feb. 24, 2012, stocks hit new highs, after a 24.2 percent rise. Now 2011's correction is largely long forgotten.
This time, starting in October, the S&P 500 fell 19.8 percent from peak to trough (using closing prices). That's almost big enough for a bear market (a 20 percent fall). Absent another big downdraft, it was a big 2011-like correction. Many will forget it – like most have long forgotten this bull market's prior five global corrections. They're painful in the short term but fade fast from memory, making them blips on a chart. The aftermath is always the V's right side – a big rebound.
Before I got promoted in 2017 to USA TODAY, I wrote columns for Forbes for 321/2 years. My Jan. 29 and Oct. 15 2009, columns detailed exactly how the V would work following that biggest, ugliest bear market since the Great Depression. Read "Anticipate the V" and "Viva The V."
So believe in the V. Own stocks! The stock market is amazingly resilient, and always will be, because humanity is resilient. Don't bet against us.

TSA agents call in sick as closure drags on

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Texto completo: Islamic extremism and militarism are forces all too familiar in our time. Islamic Romanticism, on the other hand, is a tradition that has largely faded - or withered - from view. The new coffee table book "Paradise Gardens," by one of Britain's most eminent horticulturalists, Monty Don, offers a lavish corrective. From the fountains of the Alhambra to the riverbanks along the Taj Mahal, the book is a celebration of the history and enduring romance of Islamic gardens.
The photographs (by Derry Moore) and accompanying essays explore how Muslim gardeners created a vocabulary to reflect the Koran's vision of paradise. Gardens became an extension of spiritual practice, a literal heaven on earth, featuring running streams, fresh fruits and fragrances described in sacred text. As photographs of the gardens prove, they were also gorgeous.
"Paradise Gardens" is being published in conjunction with a new BBC documentary in which the author travels across the Islamic world to explore what inspires and distinguishes Islamic gardens from the English variety. Most of the sites featured in the book originated in the medieval age of Islamic empires, as the faith spread from the harsh Arabian desert into other landscapes and climates. It was the age of migration and creative fusion.
For India's Muslim rulers and their tomb gardens, native Hindu motifs were merged with Arabesque geometry, and the floral patterns of local temples were transposed with Koranic calligraphy. This tradition found its greatest expression in the Taj Mahal and its surrounding gardens.
In the case of Spain's Alhambra palace, designers merged the memory of their native North African courtyards and tropical vegetation with the harsher climate of the Sierra Nevada.
These imaginative mergers required feats of structural engineering and horticultural ingenuity. It was the Muslims who successfully introduced oranges and pomegranates to Spain. To this day, visitors meandering through the shaded orchards and marble pools of Granada ("granada" is Spanish for "pomegranate") are visiting functioning, enduring Islamic gardens.
The new book spans six countries, showcasing unifying principles of garden design across the Islamic world and even in the author's native England. From expansive royal gardens in Istanbul to secret gardens in the residential courtyards of Marrakesh, Morocco, this is a comprehensive volume. Fortunately, the book is not an academic-museum catalogue or a blueprint for gardeners. It is alive with images of families, joggers and loiterers living in the present with ancient gardens.
My favorite images in the book are from Iran - the stunning courtyards and pavilions of Isfahan, the country's former royal capital, as a setting for family picnics and lounging teenagers. It is rare and refreshing to see large-scale images of Iranian life as it unfolds against the beauty of its buildings and landscape - a stark contrast to the images of turmoil and politicians that have become all too familiar.
For two years, I lived in New Delhi near two of the paradise gardens featured in the book. For a moment's reprieve from the pollution and chaos of the street, there was nothing better than walking through the gates into the quiet sanctuary of Humayun's Tomb or Lodi Gardens.
I felt alone even though I was hardly ever actually alone. Young lovers were interlocked beneath leafy canopies, yogis were practicing sun salutations and peacocks were meandering through arched doorways. In the spirit of soul music or soul food, I thought of these as soul spaces, where nature, refuge and contemplation meet. Perhaps that is the guiding spirit and essence of a paradise garden.
Monty Don writes, these "glimpses into paradise have certainly made me a better gardener, and perhaps even a better person."

Why the Fed 'will be patient' on rate hikes

Texto completo: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank "will be patient" as it weighs future interest rate hikes in light of low inflation, adding that policymakers will also take into account recent stock market volatility.
Powell seemed to deliberately convey a more cautious approach to rate hikes this year than he did during a news conference last month after the Fed raised rates for a fourth time in 2018.
"With muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves," Powell said in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at the American Economic Association and Allied Social Science Association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The talk was moderated by New York Times reporter Neil Irwin.
The Dow Jones industrial average, already up about 400 points after a booming jobs report, leaped another 400 points by early afternoon following Powell's remarks.
Powell also said he would not resign if asked to do so by President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell for lifting rates and crimping the faster economic growth Trump has promised. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of firing Powell, news that further intensified a market sell-off last month.
While Fed officials have been providing a generally upbeat view of the economy, Powell noted the market has plunged from its early fall peak because of fears of slowing global growth and the Trump administration's trade fight with China, among other factors.
Powell also said the Fed would be willing to pause its campaign to shrink the $3.5 trillion portfolio of bonds that it purchased during and after the Great Recession to lower long-term interest rates – presumably if the economy weakened significantly.
By contrast, at his December news conference, Powell reiterated the Fed's view that the balance sheet reduction was on autopilot and the Fed was relying on its benchmark short-term interest rate to tweak the economy's temperature.

From the Editorial Advisory Board: RTD fares

Texto completo: Illustration Passengers get on a bus at the RTD Downtown Boulder Station on Dec. 28.

RTD this week significantly raised rates, including a jump from $2.60 to $3 for a one-way fare in Boulder. It now costs more to ride the bus in Boulder than it does in New York City. Your take?
The comparison to New York City is irrelevant , because their transit authority will likely increase fares to $3 in March, according to the New York Times. Also, RTD's new $3 fare is not one-way, it's a 3-hour pass, so if you complete your journey in under 3 hours, you'll save money relative to the old fare structure.
RTD remains a highly affordable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. It costs 90 cents for young people aged 6 to 19 to ride the bus, and $1.50 for seniors 65-plus and people with disabilities. Fully one-third of Boulder County residents qualify for these discounts, and many of the remainder already qualify for a free Ecopass through their employer or neighborhood association. Furthermore, RTD announced a significant discount for people with household incomes below 175 percent of the federal poverty level, rolling out later this year. And anyone can load cash onto a MyRide card and get a 20-cent discount per 3-hour trip; plus, they'll never have to scramble for loose change or overpay again.
People often seem to underestimate the cost of car ownership. AAA estimates the average annual cost of owning and operating a small SUV at $7,869, or $656 per month. For that much money, you could spend $200 on a full-price monthly regional RTD pass and still have $456 left over every month for Lyfts and carshares when you just can't do without a car.
Regardless of how impressively affordable I still view RTD's services to be relative to driving, I'm still in favor of funding more of RTD's services through the general tax base rather than fares. Everyone benefits from the existence of public transit, whether they take advantage of it or not. We have cleaner air to breathe, fewer cars on the road, less road rage, and fewer drunk drivers because of RTD.
Jane Hummer, janehummer@gmail.com
I've long marveled at the city's unrelenting efforts to get everyone to ride the bus , even in the face of overwhelming evidence that people generally don't want to. Now, fares are increasing again and the fear is that the current meager ridership may drop. But, if higher fares are such a concern, then why haven't we heard how Longmont's totally free buses have been a raging success?
This leaves us with the concept of actual convenience. Maybe standing at the below-freezing bus stop enveloped in a cloud of blowing snow is not appealing to many customers. Or, maybe it's the notion of a one-hour trip to get across the city. Decades of experience has clearly shown that big buses driving in circles around town doesn't work very well, even if they are packaged with flavorful messages such as the "Compassion Fruit Express" and the "Sustainability Lime Leap." Circulating bus systems began in the 1800s being powered by horses. Even then, people valued their time and desired more convenience, so the horses eventually gave way to steam, electricity and internal combustion. To continue this logical trend of using improved technology to deliver better customer service, our transportation brain trust should consider engaging in some small-scale experimentation with 21st century "on demand" ridesharing technology, a fleet of smaller vehicles, and flexible routes. This can happen alongside and separate from RTD's services on a few different routes and would be very inexpensive. Assuming it prevails, RTD can then be escorted to the city limits.
One measure of real progress will be when 25 cars don't get backed up on Broadway every time a lumbering bus comes to a stop. So, rather than restricting ourselves to a standard "paradigm shift" this time, Boulder should consider making a real paradigm hop, skip or jump.
Jeff Schulz, bdijxs@bditest.com
When I ventured onto the RTD website to do a little fact-gathering for this piece , I thought I had mistakenly landed on a satirical Onion-type web page that poked fun at the government and exaggerated the Byzantine inefficiencies in certain public programs. It was "Catch-22" redux. It may be possible for RTD to make ridership more confusing and difficult, but I'm not sure how. They have pretty much covered it.
The only thing clear about this website is that RTD's aim is not to make things easier for its riders. The RTD website offers a dizzying array of bus fares depending upon what zone you are traveling in, how long you plan to be out and about, whether you are a parent with small children, student, a senior, or a person with disabilities, and always remember that travel to the airport requires an upgrade — which remains unexplained on the site.
There are Day Passes, Flex Passes, ValuPasses, College Passes, 3-Hour Passes, Neighborhood Eco Passes. Looking for a discount? They are available for students, seniors, disabled people, Medicare recipients. There are upgrades and downgrades, but be sure to tell your driver when you get on the bus that you qualify for a downgrade so you are charged accordingly.
There is the new MyRide program. There are SeniorRide fares and SkyRide fares and Special Event fares but remember that MyRide won't work for a Special Event.
Confused? Don't worry! There are separate FAQs for each of these programs, but the answers are not necessarily illuminating. Rather, you have access to links to explain a program and then links within those links until you are deep in the bowels of RTD World, still searching for a simple answer and ready to tear your hair out because all you want is to get on the bus and go from point A to point B for a reasonable rate.
Fern O'Brien, fobrien@fobrienlaw.com
As a sometime user of the bus to Denver , the $1.50 increase in a round trip ticket is not intolerable when measured against the reliability and convenience provided and the cost of the alternatives. RTD's Board of Directors increased the fares to reach fare and revenue target levels over the next three years after a year of analysis and public engagement (it is also introducing a low-income program and additional discounts for riders between the ages of 6 and 19 — students). So, unlike so many other government funded programs, RTD has to deliver a service grounded in the real world trade-offs with tangible and realistic objectives. Boulder should do the same.
Just think of the bus system Boulder could have in place if we had used what has been spent so far (with no end in sight) on our quest for a community-owned local electric utility ("municipalization"). The estimated $20 million spent fighting with Xcel Energy would have provided a lot of capital for the establishment of a micro-bus network in Boulder that would actually reduce our carbon footprint right now.
Imagine knowing that a bus is available to you within a couple of blocks of your location. Consider what it would mean to know that it would arrive every 10 minutes. Think of being able to get on a bus (with your dog, too) and simply show your "City Pass" to cover the fare (all city residents get one, funded by the revenue from Xcel's franchise tax and our climate tax — that's social equity) and arrive at your destination within 15 minutes. Would you leave your car at home if such an option (obviously tied into RTD) existed? Maybe such a system is prohibited by RTD. But being faced with legal road blocks has not deterred Boulder much in the past (gun ban) or currently (municipalization). Let's demand it.

Texto completo: THE OTHER WAR: President Trump is pulling 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria because he believes their mission aiding local forces battling ISIS has gone on long enough. At the same time, though, 500 U.S. troops are in Somalia, conducting a very similar mission aiding local forces battling al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda affiliate. As in Syria, U.S. troops are largely special operations forces who advise, assist, and accompany the Somali government and AMISOM troops in the field. AMISON is the U.N.-authorized African Union Mission to Somalia. And, as in Syria, the U.S. is providing lethal airpower to enable its partner troops on the ground to prevail in almost every engagement with al Shabaab militants.


IT’S COMBAT: The Somalia mission is based on the same model developed under the Obama administration. Find local forces to do the fighting, and enable them with U.S. expertise, intelligence, and firepower. Just like in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, U.S. troops are not doing the front-line fighting. But they are in dangerous combat zones and do occasionally suffer casualties. Last year the U.S. lost one soldier in Syria and one in Somalia.  


IT’S DEADLY: While al-Shabab extremists still control much of southern and central Somalia, the U.S. airstrikes have methodically reduced their number. The pace of airstrikes (mostly conducted by drones) have dramatically increased over the last six months, as each mission produces a site that can be exploited to get more intelligence about the group’s movements and leaders.


WHO KNEW? The U.S. Africa Command posts a boilerplate news release for every strike, plugging in the location, the number of strikes, and how many enemies it assesses were killed. That includes a standard disclaimer, “At this time we assess no civilians were injured or killed in this airstrike.” But the strikes, which often kill small numbers at a time, get little notice.


Just yesterday, AFRICOM posted the first release of the new year, in which it claimed to have killed 10 al-Shabaab militants Jan. 2. A Washington Examiner tabulation of news releases from 2018 shows that in more than 40 airstrikes, 323 militants were said to have been killed.


THE QUESTION: The Somalia mission is an example of how the U.S., with a small footprint, and minimal casualties, can keep the pressure on a terrorist group thousands of miles away, so that they are more worried about their own survival than plotting against the U.S. or its allies. So, if the U.S. can afford to keep 500 troops in Somalia, why can’t smaller force remain in Syria doing the same thing until ISIS is truly eliminated?


THE DIFFERENCES: The U.S. is in Somalia at the invitation of the Somali government, and with a United Nations mandate. That is not the case in Syria. And unlike Syria, there is no NATO ally like Turkey urging the U.S. to get out. Russia and Iran are not in Somalia, which doesn’t have the strategic location equal to Syria’s.

HAPPENING TODAY, ANOTHER WALL MEETING: President Trump has invited congressional leaders from both parties back to the White House this morning (11:30 a.m.) to try again for a deal to reopen parts of the federal government and satisfy Trump’s demand for $5 billion for a southern border barrier. In a short-notice appearance in the briefing room yesterday afternoon, Trump expressed optimism that perhaps now that Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., has taken the gavel as speaker of the House the dynamic might be different from Wednesday’s meeting, which produced no agreement.


“I congratulate Nancy. Tremendous, tremendous achievement,” Trump said. “Hopefully, we're going to have a lot of things that we can get done together. And I think it's actually going to work out. I think it'll be a little bit different than a lot of people are thinking. ”


On Capitol Hill Pelosi gave no ground. “We’re not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we’re not doing a wall?” Pelosi said last night after the passed a plan to reopen the government without border wall funding on a largely party-line vote, a bill that appears doomed in the Senate.


On the Fox News channel last night, Vice President Mike Pence also dug in, telling host Tucker Carlson , “The president's made it clear, we're here to make a deal, but it's a deal that's going to result in achieving real gains on border security. And you have no border security without a wall, we will have no deal without a wall.”’


SECRETARY WEBB? The New York Times is reporting the President Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, a former Democratic senator and Navy secretary, to be the next defense secretary, citing three unnamed administration officials. The Times notes Webb, 72, was an outspoken opponent of the Iraq war and that his views “align closely with Mr. Trump’s drive to pull American troops from the Middle East and confront China more aggressively.”


But the story also has this caveat: “How seriously he is being considered was unclear; Mr. Trump likes to float names as he considers his options for various openings in the government — sometimes to test responses and sometimes to keep the news media guessing.”


Webb, a 1968 graduate of the Naval Academy, served in Vietnam and was awarded the Navy Cross.


SUPPORT FOR WITHDRAWAL: “This is not a president that's interested in seeing American forces all over the world,” Pence said in that Fox interview. Trump continues “the process of evaluating options” to determine the best way “of putting America first, protecting America's interests in the region, making sure that we can confront terrorism,” the vice president added.


Still, a prominent Trump critic on Capitol Hill agrees with Trump’s withdrawal instincts. In an interview with MSNBC Wednesday, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, “I think it is right to get our troops out of Syria and let me add, I think it's right to get our troops out of Afghanistan.” The Massachusetts senator continued, “I think that everybody who keeps saying, ‘No, no, no. We can't do that,’ in the defense establishment, needs to explain what they think winning in those wars look like and where the metrics are.”


“We're now 17 years in Afghanistan, and we control, what is it — that the government controls less than 60 percent of the all the land. It doesn't have the support of the people. The heroin trafficking is up. There are multiple groups that are terrorist groups throughout Afghanistan,” Warren told Rachel Maddow . “What seems to be the answer from the foreign policy establishment — stay forever. That is not a policy. We can't do that.”


ARKIN’S PARTING SHOT: William Arkin , a highly respected military analyst, has left NBC news — and didn’t just burn a bridge, he nuked it. In a blistering memo to his colleagues, obtained by CNN, Arkin denounces the network’s obsession with what he calls the “Trump circus.”


“My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network,” he writes, citing NBC’s knee-jerk opposition to all things Trump, even as he is clearly no fan of the president.


“Of course he is an ignorant and incompetent impostor,” Arkin writes in the lengthy memo. “And yet I'm alarmed at how quick NBC is to mechanically argue the contrary, to be in favor of policies that just spell more conflict and more war. Really? We shouldn't get out Syria? We shouldn't go for the bold move of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula? Even on Russia, though we should be concerned about the brittleness of our democracy that it is so vulnerable to manipulation, do we really yearn for the Cold War? And don't even get me started with the FBI: What? We now lionize this historically destructive institution?”


MILLEY IN KABUL: Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley showed up in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul yesterday, where he paid a visit to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani . Milley, who is Trump’s pick to become joint chiefs chairman later this year, will be saddled with managing Trump’s abrupt withdrawal plans, which have shaken Afghanistan and played a part in the postponement of key elections.


In a statement, Ghani’s office said Milley supported Afghan-led talks with the Taliban, which are being brokered by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad , according to the AP. Khalilzad has met several times with Taliban representative, who have refused direct talks with Ghani’s representatives calling the Kabul government U.S. puppets.


TRUMP’S FRACTURED HISTORY: Meanwhile Afghan officials were aghast at President Trump’s understanding of Russian involvement in Afghanistan in the 1980s and its role in the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991.


Just a reminder, here’s what Trump said in Wednesday’s marathon Cabinet room media engagement:


“Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan … The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there. The problem is it was a tough fight. And literally, they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again, as opposed to the Soviet Union. You know, a lot these places you’re reading about now are no longer a part of Russia because of Afghanistan.”


Most historians agree that it was the Cold War arms race with the U.S. that helped cripple the Soviet economy, that there were no terrorists going into the Soviet Union from Afghanistan, and that Moscow was not “right to be there,” since the U.S. supported the Afghan Mujahideen and supplied them with the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that helped drive the Russians out.


A statement from President Ghani’s office described the battle against the Soviets as a “national uprising for gaining freedom” and noted, “All presidents of America not only denounced this invasion but remained supporters of this holy jihad of the Afghans.”


On Twitter Afghan Foreign Affairs Minister Salahuddin Rabbani said, “Soviet occupation was a grave violation of Afghanistan’s territorial integrity & nat’l sovereignty. Any other claim defies historic’l facts.”


Ghani’s office says it’s seeking “clarification” of the president's revisionist history.


MUZZLING THE WATCHDOG: The Pentagon is not saying how it will carry out Trump’s order to Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to stop the public release of inspector general reports that Trump thinks give away too much useful information to the enemy. Shanahan was hoping to meet privately with Trump after Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting but that didn’t happen. During the session, Trump railed about the insanity of releasing IG reports and said they should be kept private.


“Some IG goes over there, who are mostly appointed by President Obama — but we’ll have ours too — and he goes over there, and they do a report on every single thing that’s happening, and they release it to the public,” Trump said. “What kind of stuff is this? We’re fighting wars, and they’re doing reports and releasing it to the public? Now, the public means the enemy. The enemy reads those reports; they study every line of it.”


“For these reports to be given out, essentially — forget about the public — given out to the enemy is insane,” Trump said, turning to Shanahan, who was sitting right next to him. “And I don’t want it to happen anymore, Mr. Secretary. You understand that?”


COAST GUARD FUNDING: The Navy League is asking Congress to carve out an exemption for the Coast Guard if the impasse over government funding isn’t resolved soon. “The Coast Guard is the only agency that is simultaneously a military service, as well as a law enforcement and regulatory agency,” writes Alan Kaplan , the league’s national president in a letter to Congress. “Until funding is restored, approximately 42,000 active-duty Coast Guard service men and women will continue to report for duty to this nation without pay, as well as 340 employees of the Maritime Administration,”


“Congress can also introduce and pass a bill similar to S. 545, the Pay Our Coast Guard Act, from the 114th Congress, which provides pay and allowances to members of the Coast Guard and Reserve component, who perform active service, along with pay and allowances to civilian and contractors of the Coast Guard, until enactment of a regular or continuing appropriations provides for the same.”


IRANIAN MISSILE THREAT: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is warning Iran not to proceed with a series of space-related tests that could disguise a ballistic missile program. “The United States will not stand by and watch the Iranian regime’s destructive policies place international stability and security at risk,” Pompeo said in a statement. “We advise the regime to reconsider these provocative launches and cease all activities related to ballistic missiles in order to avoid deeper economic and diplomatic isolation.”


SEN. MCSALLY SWORN IN: Aviation pioneer and former A-10 Squadron Commander Martha McSally was sworn in yesterday along with other new members of the 116th Congress. The former Air Force fighter pilot and two-term Republican congresswoman from Tucson was sworn-in on a Bible recovered from the battleship USS Arizona. McSally is completing the final two years of the late Sen. John McCain’s term.


The Bible was loaned to Sen. McSally for the occasion by the Special Collections department of the University of Arizona library. It was recovered from the body of an unidentified sailor after the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.


McSally will take a seat on the Armed Services Committee, joining fellow new Republican members — Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Rick Scott of Florida, and Josh Hawley of Missouri.

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U. S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California.
Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Sen. John Kennedy: Don't trample on the Second Amendment
Even with Democrats taking power in the House on Thursday, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
► More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns, and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3. 4 per 100,000.
► Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
► Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt “red flag” laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person’s firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks.
American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Do Democrats have magic number?

Texto completo: As the new year turns and Democrats focus on candidates to oppose President Donald Trump in 2020, there’s one number they should keep in mind: 47. Here’s why. Since the end of World War II, Democrats have elected only four presidents who did not hold the office already: John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jimmy Carter in 1976, Bill Clinton in 1992 and Barack Obama in 2008.
Those four successful Democrats share many traits, but one of the most striking is their age on the day they were elected. They range from Kennedy, 43, to Carter, 52, but their average was — yes — 47. In fact, that was Obama’s exact age when he defeated 72-year-old John McCain. Of course, age is a very rough metric, but looking at the emerging field of Democratic aspirants, one impression is unmistakable. The potential candidate who best fits the profile of Democratic winners is Beto O’Rourke, the three-time congressman from El Paso, Texas, who narrowly lost a Senate race in November. On Election Day 2020, he will be 48.
A closer look at the four victorious post-war Democrats shows that their age was really a symbol for a much larger issue. Their youth helped shape their narratives, the stories they told voters about their past experiences and their plans for the future. Kennedy spearheaded the wave of returning World War II veterans who entered politics and assumed the leadership of the country. Carter was not a harbinger of a new generation, but as a naval officer-turned-peanut farmer, and then as a governor who had never served in the capitol, he represented a clean break from the "swamp" of post-Watergate Washington. Clinton was the first baby boomer president who talked about "building a bridge to the 21st century" and played on the name of his hometown in Arkansas when he told the Democratic convention in 1992, "I still believe in a place called Hope." Thirteen years before he was elected president, Barack Obama published a best-selling memoir, "Dreams From My Father," which told a new version of an old American story: a biracial child overcoming adversity and achieving success through his own merit and motivation.
Obama has met with O’Rourke since the election, and in an interview with his close adviser David Axelrod, the former president praised the defeated congressman as an "impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas."
Obama even drew parallels between himself and O’Rourke. He won in 2008, Obama told Axelrod, because "people had a sense that I said what I meant," and he discerned the same attempt to level with voters in the Texan’s failed campaign: "What I liked most about his race was that it didn’t feel constantly poll-tested."
Two New York Times political writers see another parallel between the two men. "Like Mr. Obama as he entered the 2008 campaign," wrote Matt Flegenheimer and Jonathan Martin, "Mr. O’Rourke can be difficult to place on an ideological spectrum, allowing supporters to project their own politics onto a messaging palette of national unity and common ground."
This is all very premature. O’Rourke might not even run for president. But if he does, remember the magic number is 47.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Former Vice President Joseph Biden has the "best case" for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, a Democrat, offered an endorsement Wednesday of a potential Biden presidential campaign, arguing that the Delaware Democrat has "credibility" with the American public.
The governor, who has denied interest in running in 2020 himself, made the comment after he was asked about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential prospects.
"My two cents? I think of all the names that are out there, I think Joe Biden has the best case," Cuomo said on WAMC-FM (90.3) in Albany. "I think Joe Biden has the best case because he brings the most of the secret ingredient you need to win, which is credibility."
Cuomo was asked whether he might want to be Biden's running mate, but Cuomo demurred.
"I am not even focusing on any of that," Cuomo said. "What I'm doing is what I believe I need to do for this state."
Cuomo has long counted Biden as a powerful ally.
Biden delivered a speech endorsing Cuomo for re-election at the state Democratic Convention in May, praising him for pushing big infrastructure projects and emphasizing the need to get things done.
Prior to that, Biden has made trips to New York to hail Cuomo for increasing the minimum wage and mark the groundbreaking on improvements at LaGuardia Airport.
Cuomo, who was inaugurated for a third term Tuesday night, has repeatedly denied he will run for president himself, saying in an August debate that he would serve a full four-year term "unless God strikes me dead."
Another New Yorker, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, has said she's exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
The New York Times reported last week that Gillibrand has been weighing potential campaign managers and a location for a headquarters, likely to be in upstate New York.
On Wednesday, Cuomo said the potentially huge field of Democratic presidential candidates should work on highlighting the positives of their work.
"I think the main issue for the Democrats is not going to be the articulation of the negative," Cuomo said. "It's going to be the articulation of the positive and the credibility of the positive."
The governor said Biden is best suited to do that.
"You don't hire an airline pilot who has never flown a plane," Cuomo said. "Where is the credibility in your argument? Joe Biden can say, 'I was there. I was not the president, but I was the second seat.'"
Former Vice President Joe Biden, left, embraces Gov. Andrew Cuomo after endorsing Cuomo for re-election May 24 on the opening day of the New York State Democratic Convention at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York.

The unassuming Texan who ran the House longer than anyone else

Texto completo: When two old bulls butted heads on Capitol Hill in the early days of the Kennedy administration, the confrontation was dramatic - and unusual.
On one side stood House Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas, a Democrat who was elected to Congress in 1912, the same year Woodrow Wilson won his first term in the White House. Rayburn, 79, had been speaker longer than anyone else and was a key ally of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. Now he was coming to the aid of newly elected President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
On the other side was Rep. Howard Smith, a conservative Democrat from Northern Virginia who came to the House in 1931 and led the House Rules Committee. Working with Southern Democratic allies and Republicans, Smith, 78, blocked civil rights, housing and education legislation favored by liberal Democrats. Syndicated columnist Drew Pearson called him a "dictator."
Rayburn wanted to expand the Rules Committee by three seats to put Smith and his allies in the minority and make it easier for administration proposals to get a vote on the House floor. Kennedy regarded the possibility of defeat as a potentially "disastrous blow" to the prestige of his new administration, which was less than two weeks old, Chalmers F. Roberts reported in The Washington Post.
On Jan. 31, Rayburn - short, stocky and bald as a cue ball - dueled on the House floor with Smith, who Pearson thought resembled "Sherlock Holmes in a frock coat." It was a "do-or-die fight," according to Post reporter Richard L. Lyons, and the galleries were packed with spectators.
The roll-call vote that followed the one-hour debate produced additional drama. "For forty minutes, as the clerk tolled off the names, the tally seesawed," the New York Times reported. "There was dead silence as each vote was sounded and repeated." In the end, Rayburn won 217 to 212 - gaining a victory on what Lyons described as "the most important action of this Congress."
Clashes of this sort were not unprecedented during Rayburn's tenure as speaker. But they were rare. The plain-spoken Texan preferred private persuasion to public confrontation. When the gloves came off, however, the man known on Capitol Hill as "Sam" or "Mr. Sam" was a formidable foe.
Rayburn's 17-year tenure as speaker was interrupted twice, when Republicans took control of the House in 1946 and 1952. But he was so highly regarded by his Democratic colleagues that he returned to the speaker's chair after Democrats returned to the majority in 1948 and 1954. If Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is elected speaker Thursday, as expected, she will be the first to return to the job since Rayburn.
Born in Tennessee in 1882, Rayburn moved with his family to Fannin County, Tex., when he was 5 years old. When he was 12, he heard a speech by Rep. Joseph Bailey (D-Tex.) and decided he wanted to be a member of Congress. He was proud of his Confederate heritage (his father fought with Robert E. Lee) but was not, in Lyons's phrase, a "professional Southerner." He was a staunch Democrat who counted Republican leader Joseph Martin Jr. of Massachusetts among his friends.
While many lawmakers see Capitol Hill as a steppingstone to the presidency, Rayburn aspired for most of his career to nothing more than serving in Congress. He had a reputation for honesty. "Rayburn," said Don Carleton, executive director of the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas in Austin, "was the real thing."
While he was an active legislator in the early days of the New Deal, it was as a leader that Rayburn made his mark. After his death on Nov. 16, 1961, The Post observed in an editorial that Rayburn's clout "has been felt in Washington for a longer period than has that of any other figure in recent American history."
The Times put it another way: "It is as though a part of the Capitol had fallen down."
Rayburn languished as a backbencher during the 1920s as Republicans controlled Congress and the White House, but his influence grew when Roosevelt came to town. Rayburn became chairman of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and, guided by what author Booth Mooney described as a "rural Texan's inborn suspicion of Wall Street," led the way for regulation of the stock market. In 1935, he successfully fought for legislation that broke up public utility holding companies.
Rayburn swapped legislating for leadership in 1937 when he became the House majority leader. Three years later, following the death of William Bankhead of Alabama, Rayburn ascended to the speaker's chair.
An early test of Rayburn's leadership came in the summer of 1941 as the Soviet Union and Britain stood against Nazi Germany in the early phases of World War II. When Roosevelt, with a worried eye on the war, asked Congress to declare a national emergency that would extend the service of Army and National Guard troops and enhance U.S. preparedness, the House resisted. Rayburn buttonholed wavering lawmakers, imploring them to support the measure because "it means a lot to me," according to writer John G. Leyden. It won, 203 to 202.
Rayburn "kept the U.S. Army intact to fight a war that was only four months away," Leyden wrote. "Mr. Sam, up close and personal, was a hard man to refuse."
A key to his power was a nondescript room on the first floor of the Capitol known as "the Board of Education." After the House adjourned for the day, Rayburn presided over an informal gathering that would include congressional power brokers, and, on occasion, members of the Supreme Court and Cabinet members. Lyndon B. Johnson and Truman numbered among those frequently in attendance.
The agenda at these gatherings included "light drinking and informal politicking," Rayburn biographer D.B. Hardeman wrote in Life Magazine in 1961. Lloyd Bentsen, whose career in Washington began with his election to the House in 1948, recalled in an oral history that the gatherings allowed those present to "meet after the day's session and talk about some of the issues that were before the Congress." The Board of Education, Bentsen said, "was more of a socializing time than anything else."
But there was more to it. "There is shoptalk there," the Times's William White wrote in 1949, "but of awfully important things."
Rayburn's guests were sworn to secrecy about these meetings - a notion that would offend modern-day believers in open government, Carleton concedes. "It was, literally, a smoked-filled room. On the other hand, it made things possible."
No one understood that better than Rayburn's fellow Texan, Johnson, who, as Senate majority leader, attended as often as possible. LBJ made a show of deferring to the House leader, Johnson biographer Robert Caro writes, kissing Rayburn on his forehead and calling him "Mr. Sam" or "Mr. Speaker," or, more unctuously, greeting him as "my beloved."
Behind the scenes, Rayburn went to bat for Johnson in 1957 as the Senate majority leader staked his political future on passage of a civil rights bill, Caro wrote. The bill passed in late August and was signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on Sept. 9, becoming the first major piece of civil rights legislation passed by Congress since the end of Reconstruction.
Although not a leader on civil rights questions, Rayburn "didn't go along with the firebrand stuff" favored by some of his Southern Democratic colleagues, Carleton said. In 1948, as Southerners floated the idea of opposing Truman's nomination for a full term, Rayburn said nothing publicly and deprived the movement of an important endorsement, White wrote in the Times. In private, Rayburn denounced the idea "with the explosive monosyllables of an old Anglo-Saxon glossary of epithet," White added.
Rayburn's low-key leadership style was well suited for Capitol Hill in the decades following World War II, when lawmakers stayed in town while Congress was in session and formed friendships across the aisle, Carleton said. Television was in its infancy, and there were no TV cameras in the House chambers.
It was an era when the governing ethos on Capitol Hill was "to get along, you go along." In other words, it was nothing like the media-driven, fractious and ideologically polarized body over which Pelosi will preside if she returns to the speaker's chair.
In one respect, though, Rayburn faced a challenge not unlike that awaiting the veteran California lawmaker. "The House," Lyons wrote in 1961, "is a bucket of eels at best."

Where Mitt Romney's attack on Donald Trump went off the rails

Texto completo: Mitt Romney has spent the past 25 years repositioning himself politically, so it was no surprise that he took to the Washington Post ahead of his swearing in as Utah Senator to signal that -- at least for now -- he wants to be known as an independent-minded Republican critic of President Trump.

As somebody with no ideological core, dating back to his 1994 Senate race, Romney has described himself as everything from an "independent during Reagan-Bush" to "severely conservative." He went from welcoming Trump's endorsement during his 2012 presidential race, to calling Trump a "phony" in 2016, only to go on to cozy up to him in pursuit of the Secretary of State job later that year, and eventually to once again welcome Trump's endorsement in his Senate race. And now, he wants to be known again as a blistering critic.

As a long-time critic of Trump myself (ironically, one of my first public critiques of Trump came when Romney embraced him in 2012), I can certainly relate to many of the complaints Romney has in his op-ed. I, too, have criticized Trump's rhetoric, his softness in speaking about totalitarian rulers, and the dangers to conservatism posed by his flouting of norms.

But there are a few parts of Romney's op-ed where he really lost me.

One signal that it was going to go off the rails was when Romney described as "encouraging" the appointment of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Tillerson proved totally out of his depth in that position, and is broadly viewed, across the ideological spectrum, as objectively one of the worst Secretary's of State in American history. So that struck me as a bit odd, but I moved on.

Then came this garbage:

"The world is also watching. America has long been looked to for leadership. Our economic and military strength was part of that, of course, but our enduring commitment to principled conduct in foreign relations, and to the rights of all people to freedom and equal justice, was even more esteemed. Trump’s words and actions have caused dismay around the world. In a 2016 Pew Research Center poll, 84 percent of people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden believed the American president would “do the right thing in world affairs.” One year later, that number had fallen to 16 percent."


While there are plenty of angles from which to criticize Trump's foreign policy, one of the laziest and obnoxious is to say that his conduct is bad because he is less popular than Barack Obama among the public in socialist countries that do not share American values. The public in those countries also supported the Iran deal among other disastrous Obama era policies -- so of course reversing them is going to change opinion.

It's incredible that Romney would cite the authority of Sweden of all places -- where anti-Semitism is rampant and Jews are attacked by Molotov cocktails. Let's check out what their protesters had to say about Trump's foreign policy in Dec. 2017 (Per the New York Times):

"Last Friday, 200 people protested in Malmo against President Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The protesters called for an intifada and promised “we will shoot the Jews.” A day later, during a demonstration in Stockholm, a speaker called Jews “apes and pigs.” There were promises of martyrdom."


I'm not surprised that such a public would be happier with the Obama administration, which had a hostile attitude toward Israel and allowed the world to gang up against the Jewish state, then they have been with the pro-Israel Trump administration. But it's insulting for Romney to appeal to the moral authority of the Swedes in criticizing the American president.

Citing such international polls in an effort to position himself as "woke Romney" ahead of his swearing in is weak and pathetic. It's right out of John Kerry's infamous 2004 "global test" remark. And it should not be treated as serious criticism.

How to install fog lights on your car and avoid bothering other drivers with them

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Even though fog lights are meant to help drivers see in poor conditions, the debate over whether or not they are really useful remains as shrouded as their namesake.
Fog lights are typically placed as low as possible on the front end of the car so that the beam of light can hit the surface of the road with as little interference as possible, according to Advance Auto Parts.
The lights are installed on the front of a car in addition to the vehicle’s regular headlights. They can help drivers see through fog and other driving obstacles, such as mist, snow or blowing sand, according to Advance Auto Parts.
But there is some controversy over whether or not they do make a difference, and in recent years, they’re disappearing from some newer car models.
Car Talk duo Tom and Ray Magliozzi say most additional lights seen on the fronts of cars are just decorative. Many others are installed or aimed incorrectly, which can lead to other drivers getting a blinding light pointed right at them, according to the Magliozzis.
“By projecting light in that fog-free pocket, you can illuminate the road a greater distance from your car and therefore see farther ahead,” Ray Magliozzi said in a 2002 blog post. “Some people swear by fog lights. Others claim that they don't really make much difference.”
Fog lights are also not to be confused with driving lights. That’s a term that usually refers to additional circular lights that are sometimes mounted on the front of off-road vehicles, according to Advance Auto Parts. Those types of lights are meant for clear weather.
Regular headlights, and especially high-beam headlights, are not very effective in the fog. Light from those will bounce off the moisture in the air, ending up reflecting back into the driver’s face, according to The New York Times.
Many newer models of cars don’t include fog lamps, according to the Times. Higher-tech headlights on some cars essentially do what fog lights do, making them obsolete.
You’re allowed to have up to four lights on the front of your car that project a light up to 300 candlepower, according to Utah law. That’s equivalent to about 3,800 lumens. For lights that are brighter than that, they must be fixed so that the high-intensity beam won’t hit a car coming toward you if it’s more than 75 feet away, the law states.
Passenger cars can’t have flashing lights, except for turn signals and hazard lights, according to the law.
If your car doesn’t have fog lights and you want to install them, Advance Auto Parts recommends making sure you install them in a place on your car where they won’t get damaged if you go over a pothole or hit a low driveway entrance.
Universal fog lights can be installed on almost any car, as long as you can find a place to mount them, the auto parts store said.
If you want your fog lights to have a factory-installed look, you’ll probably have to remove the bumper and install a grille that can be equipped with fog lights, according to Advance Auto Parts.
Though the Car Talk guys say fog lights can blind other drivers if not installed correctly, Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Harley Watkins says light pollution isn’t much of a safety concern for Utah drivers.
“Generally speaking, we just don’t see it as an issue right now,” he said.
If your headlights are abnormal or discolored, that can sometimes result in the loss or revocation of your vehicle registration, Watkins said. Those issues should be corrected immediately, he said.
UHP asks people to dim their lights while on the road, and to remember to be courteous to other drivers, Watkins said.
“On the safety side of things, if you’re dimming your lights, you’re generally just fine, as long as you’re a courteous driver and you’re working on being cooperative with your neighbors,” he said.

Texto completo: The partial government shutdown entered its 12th day on Wednesday, as congressional leaders planned to meet with President Donald Trump.
'Hoping for the best, planning for the worst'
By Ernest Johnson
Everyone affected by the shutdown is a real person, including myself. I have bills, just like everyone. And while I'm just a single guy, others are single parents, have families, are caring for elderly parents, among others. The shutdown has created 800,000 permutations of this example. Just like many Americans, I'm struggling to make ends meet.
Not knowing how long the shutdown would last — and anticipating it might last more than two weeks, and that if we get back pay, it might not be for a couple weeks, as well — I chatted with Ally Auto Finance and asked whether my account was in good enough standing to request a deferment due to the furlough and not having income. Ally allowed it, but a "deferment" is a "pay the interest in January" and February is the difference of a full payment, so I'm still paying $160 this month, but next month it'll be about $360.
Talker: Is Warren the candidate Democrats have been waiting for? Some doubt it
Those of us affected by the shutdown are your friends and neighbors, our children go to the same schools, we attend the same religious centers, and we are all focused on providing for our families and the communities in which we live. We do not go to work waving flags with "Go Team Red" or "Go Team Blue. " My co-workers and team members have common goals of providing the most efficient, quality service to the public who depend on our services.
I'm still waiting on unemployment insurance to be approved, then I can know how much I'll need to borrow from friends come Feb. 1 for rent and bills due early that month.
When you see our #ShutdownStories, please understand that we are regular people. We are nervous, stressed, afraid, worried and concerned about all this, and we are simply expressing our feelings. Personally, I would be fine working with no pay (knowing I will get back pay), just so I can keep my services, responsibilities and commitments to the public. I do not know how all of this will end, all I know is that I will just put one foot in front of the other and make it through another day. Hoping for the best, planning for the worst.

What others are saying
The New York Times, editorial: "For the workers directly affected, among those facing the greatest economic uncertainty are contractors, who make up more than 40 percent of the government work force. This includes not only white-collar positions but also thousands of blue-collar jobs, such as janitors and security guards. Unlike regular government employees, many contractors may not be compensated for lost time. They could simply lose the income. Even for regular, noncontract employees, who have eventually been granted back pay after past shutdowns and can reasonably expect the same this time, the grinding anxiety and financial costs of scraping by in the meantime mount with each passing day. Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck, with little wiggle room. "
Jonathan Bernstein, Bloomberg: "What President Donald Trump has been doing so far is, as political scientist Dave Hopkins points out, following the lead of the House Freedom Caucus. But Freedom Caucus radicals don't have plans for either policy gains or public-relations wins. What they care about is proving that they're True Conservatives by differentiating themselves from mainstream Republicans. In practice, that means finding irrational but tough-sounding tactics to endorse. That's this shutdown in a nutshell. Instead of making a deal last year, when Republicans held unified control of government, Trump has chosen to negotiate from a position of relative weakness as Democrats take over the House majority. "
The Washington Post, editorial: "In the name of securing the border and keeping out illegal immigrants, President Trump has opted for a partial government shutdown. Irony of ironies, that shutdown has paralyzed the nation’s immigration courts, shuttering many of them and allowing several hundred undocumented immigrants to dodge deportation orders each day the shutdown continues. They are among many hundreds of others whose cases will be postponed for years — or, in effect, indefinitely — for every day the closure lasts. "
What our readers are saying
Why is border security any more critical now than it was two years ago when Donald Trump became president? Has Trump made it worse over the past two years? Republicans had two years to get Trump his wall and they didn't.
— John Bertelson
Senate and House Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi have no incentive to end the shutdown. As long as they think the shutdown will hurt Trump politically, they could not care less how much the shutdown hurts the country and its people.
— Robert Johnson
In two years, Trump couldn't get a dime out of a Republican majority Congress for his silly wall. So now he tells his true supporters it can magically happen by constitutionally mugging the nation?
— Dannie Leroy Porath

Elizabeth Warren says she'll donate her salary during shutdown

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll donate her federal government salary to a refugee-assistance agency during the partial shutdown.
“Over 7,000 people in Massachusetts have been sent home or are working without pay," she wrote in a New Year's Day tweet announcing the donation to HIAS, a nonprofit founded in the 1800s to help Jewish families fleeing Russia and Eastern Europe. The group now assists refugee families who resettle in the United States.
United States senators earn an annual salary of $174,000. On Wednesday, HIAS posted a tweet thanking Warren for the donations.
The government shutdown is stretching into its second week after Congress and President Trump failed to come to a spending agreement as 2018 drew to a close. Trump is demanding any legislation include funding for his border wall, a measure that passed in the final days of the Republican-controlled House but which does not have enough support in the Senate.
On Wednesday, the Smithsonian and the National Zoo closed after managing to remain open for several days past the Dec. 22 funding expiration deadline.
As of Dec. 22, about 16,000 Park Service employees — approximately 80 percent of its workforce — were furloughed, as was almost the entire staff of NASA and about 52,000 IRS employees. Nationwide, about 420,000 federal employees were told to work without pay and another 380,000 told to stay home unpaid.
