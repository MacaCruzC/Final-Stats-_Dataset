Texto completo: SOUTH PARIS — A Greenwood man was charged Friday with manslaughter, stemming from a 2019 fatal crash in Stoneham that killed his wife.
An Oxford County grand jury indicted Terrence G. Gordon, 32, on the felony charge, which is punishable by up to 30 years in prison.
In addition to manslaughter, Gordon was indicted on a felony charge of driving to endanger, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
He is charged with two misdemeanor charges of endangering the welfare of a child, because his two children were in the vehicle at the time of the crash, according to prosecutors.
Authorities said Gordon was driving a pickup truck on Oct. 4. 2019, when it slammed into a tree along Main Street in Stoneham.
Gordon’s 31-year-old wife, Ashley, was killed in the crash. The couple lived in Bethel at that time.
Oxford County Sheriff’s deputies said the couple’s two children, who were in the back seat, were taken to a hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening.
Gordon was not injured.
A section of Route 5 was closed while the crash was reconstructed by the Main State Police.
Investigators believe another vehicle was in the area at the time of the crash.
Stoneham is northwest of Waterford, near the Maine-New Hampshire border.

Fewer students in class Friday after TikTok violence scare

Texto completo: AUBURN — Schools ran smoothly Friday despite the outpouring of alarm from parents, students and staff following a wave of TikTok videos which warned of school violence.
Local and national law enforcement agencies investigated the threats on TikTok, which generally did not name any specific schools, and did not find evidence of a valid concern for school safety. Still, many school districts in Maine and across the country bolstered their security presence on school campuses as a precaution.
School staff say there were fewer students than normal in attendance Friday, however, besides the tense start, the school day was uneventful.
The exception was the Lewiston school district, which canceled classes districtwide Thursday night after administrators were made aware of a Snapchat video which showed a student in possession of a gun threatening another student from Lewiston Middle School. Police visited a student at his home, where a firearm matching the description of the one in the video was found, Superintendent Jake Langlais wrote in an email Friday.
The school was not able to definitively identify the suspected student as the one who sent the message because Snapchat videos disappear. All students connected to the incident have been suspended, and Langlais asks that any students with information come forward.
He additionally shared that school administrators worked with law enforcement to investigate three additional social media posts and images since Thursday night, but did not find any to be a credible threat.
The Auburn school district and police worked from Thursday night into early Friday morning to track down a threatening social media message unrelated to TikTok. The threat, which was directed at Edward Little High School in Auburn, was not found to be credible, and schools were open Friday.
Edward Little Principal Scott Annear said the high school was missing about a third of its students, however classes continued as scheduled. The Auburn chief of police, the school resource officer, the superintendent, and extra police officers were all present on Edward Little’s campus Friday morning, and the school addressed concerns of school violence during the morning announcements.
We were “just trying to get the day started, make sure that people were feeling safe and secure, and, from there, we just kind of went through a typical day that really was very uneventful,” Annear said.
It is not uncommon to see more early dismissals on Fridays, he shared, but several students noted they were leaving because they were feeling uncomfortable by concerns of school violence.
Annear said it was an exhausting 24 hours, from receiving word of the TikTok threats Thursday morning to dealing with the Snapchat message superimposed with a gun Thursday night into Friday morning. Many parents called him and the front office looking for assurance and more information on the discredited threats. The school closure across the Androscoggin River in Lewiston only served to heighten the Auburn school community’s concerns, he added.
Oak Hill Middle School Principal Ben Wilson said school was “sedate” on Friday and estimates that 85% of students were in attendance. Only a couple of students left during the school day.
Wilson said this is the first time he has seen this level of concern in Maine schools since he became an educator 20 years ago, and a school administrator 10 years ago. Never before has he experienced several nearby districts, as well as his own school, receive multiple threats in a short time.
The superintendent of Regional School Unit 4 — which serves Litchfield, Sabattus and Wales — closed all schools Dec. 10 due to concerns of school violence directed toward Oak Hill Middle School in Sabattus. Wilson said he has been receiving calls from concerned parents all week, but said there were a few more Thursday night and Friday morning in response to the discredited threats shared over TikTok.
He is concerned by the lost education time, but said that safety is his, and other school administrators’, No. 1 priority when potential threats surface.
Principal Cari Medd of Poland Regional High School shared Wilson’s concerns. She also confirmed that the school day was uneventful.
It is “so discouraging, students have so many things on their (mind), teachers too,” she said, adding that the entire school community is feeling exhausted. Medd said she was discouraged by what she has seen posted to social media this fall, from videos encouraging students to slap teachers and vandalize school property, to the threats shared this week.
“It would be nice to get to Christmas break with a couple of very quiet days,” she said.

CONCORD N.H. — A couple who were found dead in separate waste facilities were intoxicated by drugs and had sought shelter during a rainstorm in a large trash bin that was loaded into a compacting waste removal vehicle, the Office of the Attorney General of New Hampshire said Friday.
Jessica Lurvey, 28, and Matthew Schofield, 29, who were in a relationship, went into the bin on the night of Sept. 8, the attorney general’s office said in a news release.
Lurvey was eventually found dead at a waste transfer station in Belmont, New Hampshire, the next day. Schofield was found dead about two weeks later at the Casella waste facility in Lewiston.
Lurvey’s body was discovered during the waste sorting process in Belmont. She was crushed by the trash compactor while intoxicated by fentanyl, according to Mitchell Weinberg, deputy medical examiner. Her manner of death was accidental.
Schofield’s body was not found at the Belmont facility, but was further transferred with waste products to the facility in Maine. His death also has been ruled accidental. The Office of Chief Medical Examiner in Maine said his cause of death is undetermined, either acute intoxication by more than one drug, or crush injuries.

Letter: King and Golden should help protect Medicare Advantage&#xa0;

Medical care and procedures may often be stressful, particularly when unexpected. For many Mainers, who often live on limited or fixed incomes, this is particularly true. Many fear the thought of forgoing needed services at a time when needed most due to cost.
For more than 120,000 Maine seniors, we are fortunate to be enrolled in Medicare Advantage programs. Medicare Advantage is the only program connecting seniors with the needed benefits while keeping prices manageable. In fact, Medicare Advantage premiums are set to decrease 10 percent for 2022. This means seniors will pay, on average, $19 per month.
Even with the low cost, Medicare Advantage members are not forced to give up any of the benefits we need. Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have access to all of the benefits of original Medicare with the addition of in-home care support, grocery planning and delivery, wellness programs, integrated vision, dental and hearing benefits and more.
With all of the benefits of the Medicare Advantage plans, I encourage Sen. Angus King and Rep. Jared Golden as well as the entire Maine congressional delegation to continue their efforts to advocate for the senior community by protecting Medicare Advantage. Funding cuts would inevitably lead to rate increases or possible loss of currently available services. Rate increases also may make Medicare Advantage plans unaffordable to the millions nationwide who depend on them.

﻿This year, the number of pedestrians killed by drivers in Maine is nearly twice what it was last year and includes two women killed this past week while walking along Maine roads. It's way past time for a serious conversation about designing roadways that accommodate everyone's use of roads.
Deaths on American roads have increased by 10% over the past decade, while deaths in European Union countries have decreased. That's because regulators in Europe insist that manufacturers design cars that are less lethal to a human body and roads in Europe are more likely to be designed to lessen the likelihood of accidents.  
Human error becomes the fallback explanation for accidents, yet that ignores significant other factors such as weather, inadequate or obscured signage and road design.  
Until our roads are designed to accommodate all users, it's imperative that drivers of cars obey speed limits and adjust to changing weather conditions by slowing down. Adopt the mindset that there are walkers and cyclists everywhere you drive and watch for them! Imagine how you'd feel if you were responsible for that empty chair at a family's holiday celebration.
And walkers and cyclists, do everything you can to protect yourself. Wear brightly colored clothing, use crosswalks, put lights on your bike, walk facing traffic and bike with traffic, use hand signals to indicate you're turning your bike etc.  
Diligence on everyone's part can change this tragic trajectory of more deaths to pedestrians and cyclists with each passing year.

Texto completo: A Maine paper mill is asking local residents for cardboard to turn into packaging because of the rising cost of the raw materials it typically uses.
ND Paper in Old Town uses cardboard and corrugated containers to create pulp that is later used to make packaging.
However, it’s becoming more difficult and expensive to obtain those materials, a representative for the company told the Bangor Daily News.
The company is asking residents of Old Town and surrounding communities to drop off cardboard, cereal boxes and pizza boxes, the Daily News reported. The company, which also has locations elsewhere in Maine and out of state, said it’s the first time it has tried to source materials from residents.
The company has tried a similar program for employees at other locations in the past.
Brennan Burks, an ND Paper spokesperson, told the Daily News that supply chain trouble and the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed up the price of raw materials in the last year.
Burks also said “everyone and their brother is also jumping on board to make boxes.”

Omicron variant believed to be in Maine as COVID-19 surge continues

Texto completo: State officials said the new highly contagious coronavirus variant has not been officially detected in Maine, but they assume it is already here and will soon drive more infections.

The highly contagious omicron variant is likely already in Maine even as delta continues to drive rising infections and hospitalizations, the state’s top health official said Thursday.
“Though we have not confirmed the omicron variant in Maine, the Maine CDC believes it is here,” Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, said during a media briefing. As of Thursday, 36 states, including New Hampshire, have detected the omicron variant, according to federal and state statistics.
Meanwhile, the delta variant that arrived in the summer continues to overwhelm Maine hospitals with record numbers of patients, most of whom are not vaccinated.
Maine reported 1,286 new cases of COVID-19 and 27 additional deaths Thursday. And a record 381 patients were in Maine hospitals, the CDC reported.
Public health experts predict the more contagious omicron variant could soon be the dominant strain of the disease in the United States. Omicron may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has fueled the fall surge, but officials say it may add to the burden hospitals are facing because it spreads more easily.
Preliminary studies are showing waning vaccine effectiveness against omicron over time. But they also indicate that booster shots provide similar protection against omicron compared to a fully vaccinated — but non-boosted — person against delta and previous variants.
“Boosters were important before. They are more important now,” Shah said. Maine is now administering about 10,000 shots per day — levels not seen since the spring — with about seven out of every 10 shots being booster shots.
Despite the omicron variant potentially causing another wave of cases, the Mills administration is not considering reimposing restrictions such as limits on gathering sizes, mask mandates or requiring proof of vaccination to attend indoor events, officials said Thursday. Nine states, including California, have reimposed mask mandates, and some jurisdictions, such as New York City, now require proof of vaccination to attend many indoor activities.
Jeanne Lambrew, Maine’s health and human services commissioner, said there are “no plans at this time” to bring back any of the pandemic restrictions.
“We do know vaccines appear to be effective against omicron,” Lambrew said. “Our first line of defense is vaccination.”
The omicron variant accounts for about 3% of all cases in the United States. But based on how the variant has spread in South Africa and other countries, it has “an extraordinary ability” to transmit quickly, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House medical advisor, in an appearance on “Good Morning America” on Thursday.
“It has what we call a doubling time of about three days, and if you do the math on that, if you have just a couple of percentage of the isolates being omicron — very soon it’s going to be the dominant variant,” Fauci said.
Even though illnesses from omicron may be less severe than delta, Shah said, its higher transmissibility means more people may get sick, further overwhelming hospitals.
“When it comes to assessing a variant, contagiousness ranks higher than severity,” Shah said.
Meanwhile, unvaccinated patients sick with COVID-19 continue to strain hospital systems in Maine.
Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state’s largest hospital, is experiencing the largest wave of COVID-19 patients it has seen since the pandemic began.
The 615-bed hospital cared for an average of 52.3 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients each day for the week ending Thursday, up from its previous record set last week of 45.9 per day. On Thursday, it was caring for 58 such patients, just one shy of the all-time single-hospital record of 59 set at Bangor’s Eastern Maine Medical Center in late September.
As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the vast majority of those hospitalized as of Thursday are not fully vaccinated.
There are 381 people in Maine hospitals being treated for COVID-19, with 114 in intensive care and 66 on ventilators, the CDC reported Thursday. It was yet another new pandemic high and marked the 11th consecutive day of at least 350 COVID-19 patients, a trend that has forced many hospitals to postpone elective surgeries such as knee and hip replacements.
MaineHealth, the 10-hospital network that includes Maine Med, reported that only 4 of the 42 COVID-19 patients in intensive care across its system were fully vaccinated against the disease. Only 21 of the 82 inpatients being cared for outside the ICUs were fully vaccinated.
Dr. Joel Botler, Maine Med’s chief medical officer, said the spike is largely due to the growing number of acute COVID-19 patients statewide needing specialized care available only at the Portland hospital, including special oxygenation interventions for people no longer getting enough oxygen while on ventilators.
“With COVID, when people get very ill it is a multi-system illness, not simply a respiratory one, and as that complexity increases, at a certain level they need to come to (Maine Med),” Botler said.
Botler noted the hospital had 19 COVID-19 patients on ventilators at one point Thursday, the highest during the pandemic.
Jennifer McCarthy, Maine Med’s chief operating officer, said capacity at the hospital was incredibly tight, and that cancer and orthopedic patients who would normally be in operating rooms were having to wait many weeks because of the COVID-19 surge.
“We are committed to taking care of the sickest people in the state of Maine, so as people get sicker and the COVID needs increase, we meet that demand by dialing back on anything that can wait a period of time,” McCarthy said.
Other hospitals across the state reported very high numbers of COVID-19 inpatients. Inland Hospital, a 36-bed facility in Waterville, had 6.4 per day, up from its previous record of 6.1 set last week. Mercy Hospital in Portland, Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick, MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston all reported near-record levels of patients.
The high number of deaths reported Thursday includes 20 deaths that were identified through a periodic review of death certificates, in this case in November, according to the Maine CDC. Some of the new infections also occurred over the past week or so but were not immediately processed because of a flood of positive tests.
Several hospitals across the state are getting help this week from the Maine Army National Guard, which deployed 38 Guard members to non-clinical roles. Maine Medical Center in Portland also has been approved to receive a “surge response team” of 15 clinicians from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston hopes to gain approval for a team this week as well.
One of the areas the National Guard will assist with is monoclonal antibodies, which are used to treat COVID-19 patients.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 134,170 cases of COVID-19 and 1,405 deaths. The seven-day average of daily new cases stood at 1,047 on Thursday, compared with 769 a week ago and 532 a month ago.
On the vaccination front, 945,794 people have received their final dose of COVID-19 vaccine, representing 70.36% of Maine’s 1.3 million population. Nearly 400,000 Mainers have received their booster shot.
But there’s a wide disparity in vaccination uptake among counties, and areas with low vaccination rates are fueling the surge. Cumberland County, the most-vaccinated in Maine, is reporting 80.7% of its residents are fully vaccinated, compared with lower-vaccination counties like Somerset, Piscataquis and Franklin, which are recording vaccination rates of less than 60%.

Texto completo: MaineHealth and Hannaford, two of Maine's largest employers, have been affected by a ransomware attack on Kronos, a Massachusetts-based human resources firm that helps companies around the world manage their payrolls, as well as track employee time and attendance.
Kronos said the ransomware attack, which occurred late Saturday night, may keep its systems offline for weeks. The company was unable to offer a definite time frame for restoring services and admits the delay has the potential to impact the issuance of employee paychecks and how companies keep track of when employees clock in and out of their shifts.
Kronos' software is used widely in the United States by municipal governments, university systems and large corporations.
"(Kronos) recently became aware of a ransomware incident that has disrupted the Kronos Private Cloud, which houses solutions used by a limited number of our customers," a company spokesman said in a statement issued Thursday night to the Portland Press Herald. "We took immediate action to investigate and mitigate the issue, have alerted our affected customers and informed the authorities, and are working with leading cybersecurity experts. We recognize the seriousness of the issue and have mobilized all available resources to support our customers and are working diligently to restore the affected services."
MAINEHEALTH DATA NOT COMPROMISED
Kronos is recommending that its customers use backup plans such issuing paper paychecks and having employees manually track their shift start and end times. Kronos did not respond to a request asking how many Maine companies were affected by the attack.
MaineHealth issued a statement Thursday letting its employees know that they will be paid on time following the attack. MaineHealth uses Kronos software to track the hours of its 22,000 employees in 11 counties in Maine and Carroll County, New Hampshire. Two MaineHealth organizations, MaineHealth Care at Home and NorDx Laboratories were not affected by the attack. In its statement, MaineHealth said the Kronos system was used only to log employee hours and was separate from the health care network's payroll system.
"As such, there is no risk that employee Social Security numbers or bank routing information has been exposed as a result of the ransomware attack," MaineHealth said. "The ransomware event targeted Kronos' internet-based services, and no systems or data at MaineHealth have been compromised. MaineHealth has been working around the clock to assure that paychecks will be issued as scheduled tomorrow, Friday, Dec. 17, and has put in place new procedures for tracking employee hours in the coming weeks."
MaineHealth said it will have to manually record some changes in hours worked in the final week of the most recent pay period and reconcile those changes in subsequent paychecks. MaineHealth said the ransomware attacks came at an inopportune time, especially as its hospitals contend with treating a surge in COVID patients.
"Though this ransomware attack affects employers worldwide, it is especially unfortunate that our care team members have to deal with this at a time when the pandemic is at its peak in Maine," Al Swallow, chief financial officer of MaineHealth, said in a statement. "We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of this on our team and help them to continue their heroic work caring for our patients."
process changes at hannaford
Meanwhile, Ericka Dodge, the spokesperson for Hannaford in Maine, acknowledged that the supermarket chain had been affected by the ransomware attack. Dodge said Hannaford uses Kronos to operate its timekeeping system, not its payroll system. Hannaford employs about 10,000 associates in Maine.
"Hannaford is among the many companies worldwide that have been impacted by the Kronos outage, and we have taken steps to ensure associates are paid promptly and appropriately," Hannaford said in a statement. "Our stores are tracking hours worked manually during the outage and have implemented other process changes. We remain in contact with Kronos to learn more about the outage and its likely duration."
Dodge said the Kronos outage occurred on the last day of Hannaford's payroll week, preventing hours for the week from feeding into Hannaford's payroll system. As a result, Hannaford issued paychecks based on the prior work week and made immediate cash advances available for any individual who worked more hours.
"Any errors in an individual's paycheck are being and will continue to be quickly corrected," Dodge said. "Associates are paid for their hours worked."
NPR/Maine Public reported that the hack affected dozens of employers across the country including New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the city of Cleveland, the Oregon Department of Transportation and a number of universities, including the University of Utah and George Washington University.
In a list of steps that it is taking to rectify the hack - published on its private cloud status update - Kronos makes no mention of whether the attackers demanded money.
"We recognize the seriousness of this issue and are committed to supporting our customers as we work to a resolution," UKG said.

Senate passes defense bill with potential benefits for BIW

Texto completo: The annual national defense act authorizes three new Navy warships that Bath Iron Works could bid on.
The Senate has passed the country’s annual defense funding bill, 89-10, and it could be a boon to Bath Iron Works.
The National Defense Authorization Act — or NDAA — authorizes funding for three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the main type of warship constructed at the Bath shipyard.
The House passed its version of the NDAA on Dec. 8, and the bill now will go to President Biden for his signature.
“BIW appreciates the tireless work of our Congressional delegation in support of our shipbuilders and strengthening the Navy fleet,” BIW spokesperson David Hench said in an email to The Times Record. “This was a big effort, and measures that improve the predictability of ship construction enable us to make significant investments in the shipyard and in hiring and training the next generation of shipbuilders who are building ships to respond to today’s emerging threats.”
This year’s defense bill authorizes $4.9 billion for three new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers for the fiscal year 2022, which began Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30, 2022. Only two shipyards build that class of ship, Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi. Those shipyards usually compete to bid on construction of the vessels, with the Navy traditionally splitting contracts between the two.
Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the bill “will help Bath Iron Works plan its future and continue to build the highest-quality ships, sustaining local jobs and ensuring that our Navy has the tools they need to accomplish their missions across the globe.”
The bill also includes a 2.7% pay raise for military service members and the defense department’s civilian workforce, 12 weeks of parental leave for military personnel and new national cybersecurity policy provisions.
The bill also authorizes tests for the next generation of destroyers that will succeed the Arleigh Burke-class later in the decade.
The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery also may benefit from the bill’s passage. The NDAA authorizes $250 million for the next increment of a dry dock project and $225 million in additional authorization to be used for the project. The bill also authorizes billions of dollars for ship depot operations that also may benefit the submarine yard.
Funding in the bill also may benefit companies with a presence in Maine, such as Pratt & Whitney, whose North Berwick factory manufactures the F-35 advanced fighter jet’s engine, and Hunting Dearborn in Fryeburg, which supports the F-35 and the CH-53K helicopter.
“For more than 60 years, the Senate has put aside differences to pass a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act to improve America’s national security, support our service members, and strengthen Maine communities,” King said. “Despite some early setbacks, I’m proud that we could continue the tradition this year to pass a bill that will make our nation safer and stronger.”
Though the House passed its version of the initial NDAA in September, the Senate failed to pass its version of the bill. After the Senate stalled on approving its version of the NDAA, House and Senate defense leaders were forced to negotiate a last-minute compromise bill that could get passed before the end of the year.
In an interview last week, Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, a member of the House Armed Services Committee that helped create the compromise NDAA, said including three Arleigh Burkes in the annual bill “seemed impossible” earlier this year.
The president’s draft of the bill called for only one ship that Golden warned would break the government’s contract with BIW, and could have led to layoffs at the shipyard.
This year’s bill, however, includes provisions from an amendment authored by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine with new reporting requirements when the Department of Defense proposes to break a multiyear ship procurement contract.
“Every year for the past six decades, Members of Congress have fulfilled one of their most important responsibilities — ensuring our national security — by passing the NDAA and setting the policy for our nation’s military priorities,” Collins said. “This legislation will support the brave men and women of our armed forces by supporting pay increases and expanding parental leave.
“Additionally, the NDAA will support hardworking Mainers at BIW, PNSY, Pratt & Whitney, and elsewhere across the state who make invaluable contributions to our defense. The Senate’s passage of this bill comes at a critical time for our national defense as the country faces proliferating threats around the world.”

Judge allows evidence by suspect in '93 killing
A Maine man charged in a young woman's killing 28 years ago at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks will be allowed to present evidence about three alternative suspects at his trial next month.
Steven Downs, 47, of Auburn was charged with sexual assault and murder, and extradited to Alaska, after DNA his aunt submitted to a genealogy website matched DNA from the crime scene.
The trial starts on Jan. 3.
Downs lived in the dorm where the body of Sophie Sergie, 20, of Pitkas Point, Alaska, was discovered in 1993. She had been shot in the head with a .22-caliber gun, stabbed in the cheek and eye, struck with a blunt instrument, choked with a ligature, and shocked with a stun gun.
The judge is allowing the defense to present evidence against three other men in an effort to raise reasonable doubt about Downs' guilt.
The three people were Downs' roommate, who was employed by the school as a security guard and was fired for possession of a gun; a student seen leaving the bathroom where the body was found and who allegedly owned a gun; and a man whose deceased sister claimed he'd confessed.
Downs' defense had sought to present evidence against 16 alternative suspects during the trial.
Portland
Collins: Social Security offices should reopen
A group of Republican senators including Susan Collins of Maine on Tuesday called on the Social Security Administration to reopen its field offices to the public.
Collins said the closure of the offices for more than 20 months has taken a toll on residents who need to access Social Security services. Senators said in a statement that the suspension "created a disruption to the millions of new applicants and beneficiaries receiving Social Security benefits."
The administration stopped in-person operations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The senators said the closure has been especially difficult for older residents in rural areas.
Collins was also among a larger group of senators that last month called on the federal Office of Personnel Management, General Services Administration and Office of Management and Budget to transition federal workers back to in-person work.
LITCHFIELD
Town taps federal funds for high-speed internet
Litchfield is now the most recent central Maine town to sign on with Redzone Wireless, a Rockland-based company offering high-speed internet with the goal of covering underserved communities.
Town officials agreed to use federal American Rescue Plan Act funds toward the project, which will completely cover the town's $375,000 share of the internet project.
In Litchfield, a town with approximately 3,600 residents, there are 239 households without access to reliable high-speed internet.
"We should have 100% coverage," said Litchfield Town Manager Kelly Weissenfels.
Last month the town of Fayette, in which 825 locations were without access to reliable high-speed internet, voted to move forward with a Redzone Wireless contract.
DOVER, N.H.
'Nutcracker,' train ice sculptures vandalized
A bunch of ice sculptures installed in Dover, New Hampshire, for the holiday season have been vandalized, and police are asking the public for their help as they investigate.
The damaged sculptures include characters from "The Nutcracker" at a park that were installed last week and others installed Tuesday at a train station in honor of the 20th anniversary of Amtrak's Downeaster line, Seacoastonline.com reported Wednesday.
"It's unfortunate," Dover Police Lt. Scott Pettingill said. "We typically don't see this type of vandalism that's specifically targeting Christmas decorations and things like that. The city typically puts up decorations every year and that stuff never seems to get damaged."
Jeff Spires, a board member of Dover Main Street, said the vandalism isn't going to stop the group from continuing to spread holiday cheer. The last, and largest, sculpture is scheduled to be installed on Tuesday -- a 5-foot-wide, 6-foot-tall work that spells out "D-O-V-E-R," with Santa's sleigh above it.
PLAISTOW, N.H.
Teacher accused of assault involving student
A high school teacher has been accused of assault charges involving a student, police and school officials in Plaistow, New Hampshire said.
The teacher at Timberlane Regional High School has been charged with misdemeanor counts of simple assault and sexual assault, Brian Cochrane, school district superintendent, said in a news release Thursday.
Cochrane said his office received a complaint on Nov. 18 that the teacher had made an "unprivileged contact" with the student. The district informed the Department of Education and notified the student's parents to contact police. The teacher was placed on administrative leave the next day and will remain so pending the district's ongoing investigation, Cochrane said.
The teacher was was released on personal-recognizance bail and ordered not to have contact with the student, WMUR-TV reported.
He's scheduled to be arraigned on Jan. 31. It wasn't immediately known if he had an attorney, and a phone number couldn't be found for him.
BOSTON
Body cameras given to all troopers after scandal
Massachusetts State Police announced Thursday that all of its troopers have been assigned body cameras, a reform that was ordered in 2018 after the agency was rocked by an overtime scandal.
All 2,200 of the agency's sworn personnel now have body cameras and training on how to use them, police officials said. The agency has also installed cameras in 800 cruisers, with 200 still awaiting cameras.
Col. Christopher Mason, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, said the cameras will document troopers' interaction with suspects, victims and the public.
"This is essential to capturing evidence for criminal cases as well as memorializing the nature of interactions between Troopers and the public," Mason said in a statement. "Body camera video also provides a valuable training tool for recruits and existing officers."
The cameras were part of a series of reforms announced in 2018 by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and police leaders. The reforms also included disbanding Troop E, which patrolled a stretch of the Massachusetts Turnpike from Boston to the New York state border.
The changes were ordered after some troopers assigned to Troop E were found to have taken thousands of hours in overtime pay for shifts they did not actually work.

Texto completo: AUBURN -- Isaiah Lary, who vigorously fought the implementation of mask mandates throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and whose tenure was marked by frequent angry outbursts with his colleagues, has resigned his seat on the Androscoggin County Commission.
His resignation letter was submitted Monday and announced to the commission Tuesday.
The Republican represented Lisbon, Sabattus and his hometown of Wales. He was completing the first year of his second term on the commission and was unopposed both times he ran for office.
Often operating as a caucus of one, Lary rarely sought consensus with his colleagues for his proposals and often saw his motions defeated by a 6-1 vote. His colleagues on the board had at times called his conduct "grandstanding."
In his brief and terse resignation letter, Lary expressed his frustration with his fellow commissioners.
"This commission has violated the Constitution, charter and bylaws and stood by and even supported state tyranny," he wrote. "There is so much you could have done to uphold your oath. If you request examples, just look at the numerous statements I have made as a commissioner on the videos."
"Effective immediately, I am resigning from my position as a county commissioner," he wrote.
Sally Christner of Turner, a fellow Republican and frequent target of Lary's attacks, including an attempt to remove her as chairwoman in September, praised him as "a strong and passionate voice" for his constituents.
She noted his proposal this year to increase the annual death benefit by more than $7,000 for Dawn Rancourt, the widow of Deputy David Rancourt, who died in the line of duty in 2006. The yearly benefit had not been increased since it was established in 2007 and Christner said the commissioners had never considered giving his widow a cost-of-living increase.
But Lary could also be counted on to vote against nearly every motion before the board, especially spending bills. He voted against the county budget, opposed giving county money to Western Maine Transportation Services, a popular mass transit system in the region, and voted no on approving minutes, adopting the treasurer's report and the approval of payroll and the county warrants that paid the bills.
Christner even quipped at Wednesday's meeting that it had been a while since she could announce that a vote passed unanimously.
Lary became a lightning rod for the anti-mask movement after trying several times to pass anti-mask resolutions and policies, but his proposals were rejected by his colleagues.
Lary was incensed by Gov. Janet Mills' executive orders for mandatory masks, social distancing and other measures that forced some businesses to close. Calling Mills' actions unconstitutional, he unsuccessfully urged commissioners to file suit with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to challenge her authority.
Lary's anti-mask rhetoric launched a brief recall effort to remove him from the commission. Spokesman for the group, former Androscoggin County Democratic Chairman Kiernan Majerus-Collins, said at the time that "his attacks on basic science and public health are an embarrassment to Androscoggin County."
Commissioners approved his resolution in June in support of protesters in Cuba, 5-2.
County Administrator Larry Post said county Republicans have 30 days to find a replacement for Lary from his district.

Texto completo: The highly contagious omicron variant is likely already in Maine even as delta continues to drive rising infections and hospitalizations, the state's top health official said Thursday.
"Though we have not confirmed the omicron variant in Maine, the Maine CDC believes it is here," Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a media briefing. Thirty-six states as of Thursday, including New Hampshire, had detected the omicron variant, according to federal and state statistics.
Meanwhile, the delta variant that arrived in the summer continues to overwhelm Maine hospitals with record numbers of patients, most of whom are not vaccinated.
Maine reported 1,286 new cases of COVID-19 and 27 additional deaths Thursday. And a record 381 patients were in Maine hospitals, the CDC reported.
Public health experts predict the more contagious omicron variant could soon be the dominant strain of the disease in the United States. Omicron may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has fueled the fall surge, but officials say it may add to the burden hospitals are facing because it spreads more easily.
Preliminary studies are showing waning vaccine effectiveness against omicron over time. But they also indicate that booster shots provide similar protection against omicron compared to a fully vaccinated - but non-boosted - person against delta and previous variants.
"Boosters were important before. They are more important now," Shah said. Maine is now administering about 10,000 shots per day - levels not seen since the spring - with about seven out of every 10 shots being booster shots.
Despite the omicron variant potentially causing another wave of cases, the Mills administration is not considering re-imposing restrictions such as limits on gathering sizes, mask mandates or requiring proof of vaccination to attend indoor events, officials said Thursday. Nine states, including California, have re-imposed mask mandates, and some jurisdictions, such as New York City, now require proof of vaccination to attend many indoor activities.
Jeanne Lambrew, Maine's health and human services commissioner, said there are "no plans at this time" to bring back any of the pandemic restrictions.
"We do know vaccines appear to be effective against omicron," Lambrew said. "Our first line of defense is vaccination."
The omicron variant accounts for about 3 percent of all cases in the United States. But based on how the variant has spread in South Africa and other countries, it has "an extraordinary ability" to transmit quickly, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House medical advisor, in an appearance on "Good Morning America" on Thursday.
"It has what we call a doubling time of about three days, and if you do the math on that, if you have just a couple of percentage of the isolates being omicron - very soon it's going to be the dominant variant," Fauci said.
Even though illnesses from omicron may be less severe than delta, Shah said, its higher transmissibility means more people may get sick, further overwhelming hospitals.
"When it comes to assessing a variant, contagiousness ranks higher than severity," Shah said.
Meanwhile, unvaccinated patients sick with COVID-19 continue to strain hospital systems in Maine.
Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state's largest hospital, is experiencing the largest wave of COVID-19 patients it has seen since the pandemic began.
The 615-bed hospital cared for an average of 52.3 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients each day for the week ending Thursday, up from its previous record set last week of 45.9 per day. On Thursday, it was caring for 58 such patients, just one shy of the all-time single-hospital record of 59 set at Bangor's Eastern Maine Medical Center in late September.
As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the vast majority of those hospitalized as of Thursday are not fully vaccinated.
There are 381 people in Maine hospitals being treated for COVID-19, with 114 in intensive care and 66 on ventilators, the CDC reported Thursday. It was yet another new pandemic high and marked the 11th consecutive day of at least 350 COVID-19 patients, a trend that has forced many hospitals to postpone elective surgeries such as knee and hip replacements.
MaineHealth, the 10-hospital network that includes Maine Med, reported that only 4 of the 42 COVID-19 patients in intensive care across its system were fully vaccinated against the disease. Only 21 of the 82 inpatients being cared for outside the ICUs were fully vaccinated.
Dr. Joel Botler, Maine Med's chief medical officer, said the spike is largely due to the growing number of acute COVID-19 patients statewide needing specialized care available only at the Portland hospital, including special oxygenation interventions for people no longer getting enough oxygen while on ventilators.
"With COVID, when people get very ill it is a multi-system illness, not simply a respiratory one, and as that complexity increases, at a certain level they need to come to (Maine Med)," Botler said.
Botler noted the hospital had 19 COVID-19 patients on ventilators at one point Thursday, the highest during the pandemic.
Jennifer McCarthy, Maine Med's chief operating officer, said capacity at the hospital was incredibly tight, and that cancer and orthopedic patients who would normally be in operating rooms were having to wait many weeks because of the COVID-19 surge.
"We are committed to taking care of the sickest people in the state of Maine, so as people get sicker and the COVID needs increase, we meet that demand by dialing back on anything that can wait a period of time," McCarthy said.
Other hospitals across the state reported very high numbers of COVID-19 inpatients. Inland Hospital, a 36-bed facility in Waterville, had 6.4 per day, up from its previous record of 6.1 set last week. Mercy Hospital in Portland, Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick, MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston all reported near-record levels of patients.
The high number of deaths reported Thursday includes 20 deaths that were identified through a periodic review of death certificates, in this case in November, according to the Maine CDC. Some of the new infections also occurred over the past week or so but were not immediately processed because of a flood of positive tests.
Several hospitals across the state are getting help this week from the Maine Army National Guard, which deployed 38 Guard members to non-clinical roles. Maine Medical Center in Portland also has been approved to receive a "surge response team" of 15 clinicians from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston hopes to gain approval for a team this week as well.
One of the areas the National Guard will assist with is monoclonal antibodies, which are used to treat COVID-19 patients.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 134,170 cases of COVID-19 and 1,405 deaths. The seven-day average of daily new cases stood at 1,047 on Thursday, compared with 769 a week ago and 532 a month ago.
On the vaccination front, 945,794 people have received their final dose of COVID-19 vaccine, representing 70.36 percent of Maine's 1.3 million population. Nearly 400,000 Mainers have received their booster shot.
But there's a wide disparity in vaccination uptake among counties, and areas with low vaccination rates are fueling the surge. Cumberland County, the most-vaccinated in Maine, is reporting 80.7 percent of its residents are fully vaccinated, compared with lower-vaccination counties like Somerset, Piscataquis and Franklin, which are recording vaccination rates of less than 60 percent.

Texto completo: The name W. Earle Eskilson isn't synonymous with the Press Herald Toy Fund in the way Bruce Roberts is.
But he was there in the beginning, and he represents all the people who quietly helped bring joy to Maine children during the seven decades since then.
Eskilson, who is remembered in one of the donations listed below, has a legacy that includes many contributions to the community beyond his work with the toy fund.
W. Earle Eskilson was born in 1899 and served in the Army at the end of World War I. He served on the Portland City Council in the 1920s and again in the 1930s. During World War II, he worked at the South Portland shipyards building Liberty ship transports that carried cargo and troops across the Atlantic.
In December 1949, Eskilson's good friend, Matthew Barron, needed some help. Barron was Portland's assistant welfare director and he knew a lot of local families were struggling and facing a bleak holiday season. Barron asked another friend, Evening Express Editor Robert Bruce Beith, to help raise money so that no children would go without toys to unwrap at Christmas.
Beith began writing a column asking readers to donate. He wrote it under the pseudonym Bruce Roberts, his first and middle names reversed.
Eskilson jumped in to help behind the scenes as Barron led the effort to purchase and distribute the gifts. And he kept helping as the campaign turned into an annual event, although none of those involved at the time would have predicted it would still be going 72 years later.
Along with helping the toy fund, Eskilson remained a community leader for decades more. In the 1950s, he owned and operated Eskilson's Fish Market on Congress Street at the foot of Munjoy Hill. In the '60s and '70s, he worked for Columbia Market, a grocery store on Brighton Avenue.
W. Earle Eskilson died in 1983. His son, Peter, has donated to the fund every year in memory of his father and his late wife, Sally Ann Eskilson.
Donations from readers of the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, the Sun Journal in Lewiston and The Times Record in Brunswick allow the toy fund to provide gifts to thousands of children in need in York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Lincoln, Androscoggin and Knox counties.

Maine Celtics have winning streak snapped by Long Island
The Long Island Nets held the Maine Celtics scoreless in overtime until a last-second 3-pointer by Sam Hauser and ended Maine's seven-game winning streak with a 97-95 victory Thursday night at the Expo.
Brodric Thomas led the Celtics with 26 points, including a 3-pointer that tied the game with 11.7 seconds left in regulation. Hauser finished with 15 points and nine rebounds.
SKIING
U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS:
The U.S. Alpine Championships are returning to Sugarloaf in 2022, the resort announced Thursday.
The Alpine Championships and NorAm Finals will be at Sugarloaf from March 20-April 1. The event, which features many of the U.S. Ski Team's top racers, will take place a month after the Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, China, and is expected to include several Olympians vying for national championships.
This is the eighth time the Carrabassett Valley resort has hosted the Alpine Championships, and the first time since 2019.
AUTO RACING
FORMULA ONE:
Mercedes ended the dispute over the Formula One season finale when it withdrew its appeal of the controversial finish that cost Lewis Hamilton a record eighth championship.
Mercedes had filed a pair of protests following Sunday's race, in which a late crash at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix helped Max Verstappen beat Hamilton for the title. Both protests were dismissed and Mercedes then asked for reconsideration at the International Court of Appeal, a process that could have dragged into next year.
Mercedes was protesting the use of the safety car following a crash with five laps remaining. Hamilton had a nearly 12-second lead over Verstappen when the crash brought out the yellow flag.
Verstappen pitted for fresh tires while Hamilton stayed on track. The race director initially said lapped drivers could not pass the safety car, then reversed the call in a decision that allowed Verstappen to restart directly behind Hamilton with a lap remaining. Verstappen then passed Hamilton to win his first championship.
COLLEGES
UMAINE:
The University of Maine System has updated its COVID-19 safety protocols for indoor events to include children who are at least 5 years old.
Starting Jan. 4, anyone 5 or older must show proof of vaccination or a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend any event with more than 250 people. The policy applies to all indoor sporting events held at schools within the UMaine system, as well as UMaine games played at Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.
The updated guidance reflects a recent recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that children ages 5-11 receive COVID-19 vaccines.
SOCCER
MLS:
Midfielder Sebastian Lletget was acquired by the New England Revolution from the LA Galaxy for $500,000 in 2022 and 2023 general allocation money.
A regular on the U.S. national team, the 29-year-old had spent the last seven seasons with the Galaxy and will reunite with New England Coach Bruce Arena, the former Galaxy coach.
ENGLAND:
This weekend's Premier League schedule was decimated as coronavirus outbreaks at clubs forced the postponement of five matches, taking the total amount of games wiped out over the past week to nine.
Adding to the postponement of the Manchester United-Brighton game on Saturday, the league said the following matches are also off: Southampton-Brentford, Watford-Crystal Palace, West Ham-Norwich (all Saturday) and Everton-Leicester (Sunday).
Only five league games remain to be played this weekend, with the growing number of infections among squads reflecting the worsening health emergency in Britain as the omicron variant spreads.

Texto completo: Bud's Shop 'n Save at 101 Somerset Plaza is set to begin operations in January under new ownership — the Danforth family, owner of Danforth's Down Home Supermarket.
PITTSFIELD — Bud’s Shop ‘n Save in Pittsfield, an independent grocery store for more than 60 years, is set to begin operations under new ownership.
Beginning in January, the owners of another independent store, Danforth’s Down Home Supermarket in Hermon, will own and operate Bud’s, located at 101 Somerset Plaza.
Dean Homstead, owner of Bud’s, said he decided to sell the store so he could retire.
Homstead’s father began the business in 1953 with a store in Newport. Six years later, he opened stores in Pittsfield and Dexter. Dean Homstead took ownership of the stores in 1985.
Homstead sold the Newport and Dexter locations to Hannaford in 2016. When it came time to sell the Pittsfield store, however, he wanted to find a buyer who would preserve it as an independent grocer rather than having it become part of a large chain. Thus, he approached the Danforth family.
“I thought it was the perfect fit for what they’re looking for and what I was looking for: To have a family-operated business that will continue on, not just for what I want, but for my store associates and for the town of Pittsfield,” Homstead said.
Brett Danforth, the manager of Danforth’s Down Home Supermarket, said his family had been looking for several years to open a second location. Danforth said when Homstead approached him recently, everything fell into place.
“It truthfully was the perfect fit,” Danforth said. “Thirty minutes down the road and we’re familiar with the community. That gives us a leg up to make sure we can continue to run the business the way the community is familiar with, which is locally owned, family-run and with a customer-first and employee-centric business model.”
Danforth’s Down Home Supermarket opened in 2007 and is owned by Richard Danforth, Brett Danforth’s father. Both Bud’s and Danforth’s are Hannaford-supplied stores, one of several similarities that will help with the transition, Brett Danforth said.
The new ownership takes effect Jan. 2, although Brett Danforth said not much will change at first for shoppers. The employees at Bud’s will remain and their original start dates will be honored, Danforth said.
“It’s very important that we respect the history that’s there (at Bud’s) and we appreciate that,” Danforth said. “And I think that’s going to make the Pittsfield community and the employees understand much more quickly how we do business and how we’re going to continue to do business for many, many years.”
It is difficult to determine how many independent grocers remain in Maine because some local owners have multiple stores, according to Christine Cummings, executive director of the Maine Grocers & Food Producers Association in Augusta.
A 2017 economic report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that in 2015, independent grocery stores made up 11% of grocery sales across the country.
The independent markets play an important role because they make food accessible to those in rural and low-income areas, according to the report.
While the number of independent grocers nationwide increased between 2005 and 2015, the report says they were hit hardest by the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and saw diminished numbers.
Cummings said Maine has not necessarily seen independent stores going out of business. Instead, some stores have been acquired by other local owners, by larger chains or transitioned to employee ownership as the original owners look to retire, she said.
As Homstead prepares for his own retirement, he said he plans to remain a familiar face.
“I’m going to stay here,” he said, “and I’m going to shop here.”

Texto completo: The annual national defense act authorizes three new Navy warships that Bath Iron Works could bid on.
The Senate has passed the country’s annual defense funding bill, 89-10, and it could be a boon to Bath Iron Works.
The National Defense Authorization Act — or NDAA — authorizes funding for three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the main type of warship constructed at the Bath shipyard.
The House passed its version of the NDAA on Dec. 8, and the bill now will go to President Biden for his signature.
“BIW appreciates the tireless work of our Congressional delegation in support of our shipbuilders and strengthening the Navy fleet,” BIW spokesperson David Hench said in an email to The Times Record. “This was a big effort, and measures that improve the predictability of ship construction enable us to make significant investments in the shipyard and in hiring and training the next generation of shipbuilders who are building ships to respond to today’s emerging threats.”
This year’s defense bill authorizes $4.9 billion for three new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers for the fiscal year 2022, which began Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30, 2022. Only two shipyards build that class of ship, Bath Iron Works and Ingalls Shipbuilding in Mississippi. Those shipyards usually compete to bid on construction of the vessels, with the Navy traditionally splitting contracts between the two.
Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that the bill “will help Bath Iron Works plan its future and continue to build the highest-quality ships, sustaining local jobs and ensuring that our Navy has the tools they need to accomplish their missions across the globe.”
The bill also includes a 2.7% pay raise for military service members and the defense department’s civilian workforce, 12 weeks of parental leave for military personnel and new national cybersecurity policy provisions.
The bill also authorizes tests for the next generation of destroyers that will succeed the Arleigh Burke-class later in the decade.
The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery also may benefit from the bill’s passage. The NDAA authorizes $250 million for the next increment of a dry dock project and $225 million in additional authorization to be used for the project. The bill also authorizes billions of dollars for ship depot operations that also may benefit the submarine yard.
Funding in the bill also may benefit companies with a presence in Maine, such as Pratt & Whitney, whose North Berwick factory manufactures the F-35 advanced fighter jet’s engine, and Hunting Dearborn in Fryeburg, which supports the F-35 and the CH-53K helicopter.
“For more than 60 years, the Senate has put aside differences to pass a bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act to improve America’s national security, support our service members, and strengthen Maine communities,” King said. “Despite some early setbacks, I’m proud that we could continue the tradition this year to pass a bill that will make our nation safer and stronger.”
Though the House passed its version of the initial NDAA in September, the Senate failed to pass its version of the bill. After the Senate stalled on approving its version of the NDAA, House and Senate defense leaders were forced to negotiate a last-minute compromise bill that could get passed before the end of the year.
In an interview last week, Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, a member of the House Armed Services Committee that helped create the compromise NDAA, said including three Arleigh Burkes in the annual bill “seemed impossible” earlier this year.
The president’s draft of the bill called for only one ship that Golden warned would break the government’s contract with BIW, and could have led to layoffs at the shipyard.
This year’s bill, however, includes provisions from an amendment authored by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine with new reporting requirements when the Department of Defense proposes to break a multiyear ship procurement contract.
“Every year for the past six decades, Members of Congress have fulfilled one of their most important responsibilities — ensuring our national security — by passing the NDAA and setting the policy for our nation’s military priorities,” Collins said. “This legislation will support the brave men and women of our armed forces by supporting pay increases and expanding parental leave.
“Additionally, the NDAA will support hardworking Mainers at BIW, PNSY, Pratt & Whitney, and elsewhere across the state who make invaluable contributions to our defense. The Senate’s passage of this bill comes at a critical time for our national defense as the country faces proliferating threats around the world.”

Texto completo: Avangrid did not make its case that a referendum passed by voters this November should not become law this weekend, a state judge ruled.

A law passed by voters in November banning a controversial power transmission line through western Maine will take effect Sunday after a Maine judge ruled against a last-minute injunction Thursday.
The ruling is another blow to a $1 billion energy project planned for years by Avangrid, parent company of Central Maine Power Co., although it’s not the final word. Avangrid’s lawsuit challenging the ban will continue and it could appeal the injunction ruling to Maine’s Supreme Judicial Court.
Avangrid filed a lawsuit against the ban a day after voters passed it in a Nov. 2 citizen-initiated referendum that followed the most expensive ballot-question campaign in state history. The referendum vote prohibited the construction of New England Clean Energy Connect, a controversial 145-mile high-voltage transmission line through western Maine.
Avangrid, through its affiliate NECEC Transmission LLC, also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to try to prevent the law from going into effect as scheduled while its lawsuit is pending. The law is set to take effect Sunday.
Judge Michael Duddy, ruling for the Business and Consumer Court, said allowing the citizen initiative to become law while the lawsuit works its way through the court would not harm the company irreparably, but could damage democracy.
Duddy agreed that delaying construction of the transmission corridor will mean substantial economic harm to Avangrid.
But, he said, “that harm does not outweigh the harm to voter confidence and participatory democracy that would result from preventing the initiative from becoming law while this legal challenge is pending.”
In a statement, Avangrid said it was disappointed in the decision, but confident the full legal process will determine the law passed in the referendum is unconstitutional.
“As one of the region’s most important clean energy projects, the NECEC will benefit Maine and all New Englanders by reducing the region’s dependence on fossil fuels which will result in cleaner air, lower energy prices and improved reliability,” the company said.
The company is reviewing the order and considering options, but would not say whether it plans to appeal the injunction ruling to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
“The facts are clear: the NECEC project is good for Maine and for the region and will help address the energy, economic and climate issues we face,” it said. “That is why we remain committed to this project and its many benefits and look forward to restarting construction as soon as we are able.”
Avangrid argues that the referendum, which is retroactive to 2014, violates its “vested rights” to the property, meaning it had valid permits to start construction before the referendum.
Avangrid has spent at least $450 million on the project so far, with dozens of miles of woodland in northwest Maine cleared for the transmission line.
In his order, Duddy said he was not convinced by Avangrid’s arguments on vested rights or its contention that the law violated other parts of the state constitution and would irreparably harm the company.
However, Duddy also said the law that applies to the case is uncertain on many disputed points that should be decided by the state’s highest court.
“Thus, while the court is unpersuaded by the plaintiff’s legal arguments, this case presents many difficult questions,” Duddy said. “Plaintiffs have legitimate counter arguments on all disputed points of law.”
Thursday’s ruling was the latest in a string of setbacks for the corridor project. In November, almost 60% of voters approved the referendum to ban the transmission line.
The new law bans the construction of high-impact electric-transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region and requires the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine, both retroactively to 2020. It also requires the Legislature to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public lands retroactively to 2014.
“This is a big win for Maine people who voted overwhelmingly to terminate the CMP corridor,” said Pete Didisheim, advocacy director at Natural Resources Council of Maine, a prominent opponent of the project.
“We appreciate the quick decision by the judge to reject CMP’s effort to subvert the will of Maine voters and look forward to the referendum becoming law on Sunday,” Didisheim said in a statement.
Despite the voters’ rejection, Avangrid continued clearing forest and other development related to the transmission line. It stopped in mid-November after a request from Gov. Janet Mills while pursuing its lawsuit against the referendum.
Late last month, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection suspended the construction license for the corridor. The license will remain suspended until Avangrid wins its court case or legal fight over a public land lease in the project’s path.
At the same time, Avangrid is under pressure to complete the project by August 2024 or risk losing its contract. The transmission line was commissioned to bring 1,200 megawatts of power from producer Hydro-Quebec to the New England grid through a station in Lewiston.
The project is being built to help Massachusetts meet its clean energy goals and will be paid for by electric customers in the Bay State.
Avangrid has argued it would bring cleaner, cheaper energy to New England generally. The company pledged $250 million in benefits to Mainers including electric rate relief, help with energy efficiency and economic development. When construction was suspended, those payments were too.

Maine should build better transportation The increase in pedestrian fatalities is just one sign that roads are unsafe.

Texto completo: Our roads are unhealthy, even deadly. That has to change.
Pedestrian fatalities, air pollution, climate change, even the loss of social connection - all of these are causing us harm, and all have poor road design as a factor.
As roads are built and rebuilt, and as Maine begins to spend funding from the infrastructure bill passed earlier this year, it should make sure to address these problems, helping take cars off the roads and make the roads safer for anyone not in a car or truck.
Motorists have struck and killed 19 people in Maine so far this year, including two older women and a 1-year-old in one incident in Augusta.
Pedestrian fatalities have risen over the last two decades, in Maine and nationwide, as more people began using the roads to walk and bike, while vehicles got much bigger, and much more dangerous to others.
It's past time for drivers to remember that motor vehicles are not the only thing on the road. You may feel safe going fast over Maine's back roads, but there's always a chance that someone is walking on the shoulder just around the next turn - even if only to pick up their mail.
"There is an obligation when you are behind the wheel," a state transportation engineer told the Press Herald. "You have to be thinking: 'I have a responsibility to have eyes on the road, to be vigilant. There are a lot of people out there walking that do not have a choice. They may not have reflective clothing.' "
More than changing behavior, though, we have to change our roads to include proper bike lanes, crosswalks, sidewalks and wide shoulders. Our transportation system was built with cars and trucks in mind, so it's no surprise that they put pedestrians in less-than-ideal situations.
We also have to invest in public transportation, in urban, suburban and rural areas, in ways that people will use in high enough numbers to make a difference.
The state has an initiative focused on some of the worst roads for pedestrians. Investment could start there.
If we build roads that are safe for people on foot and bike, more people will use them for that purpose, taking cars off the road and making them safer for everyone. Public transit can do the same.
Such road construction would also mean more walkable communities - communities where people feel connected to their neighborhood, rather than walled off by wide roads and fast traffic.
Each time an alternative to driving becomes viable through an investment in our transportation system, it helps take vehicles off the road, not only making them safer, but also cutting back on the air pollution and emissions that are making us sick and driving climate change.
Maine needs to make more of those investments. In a normal year, only about 39 miles of road are constructed or rebuilt, cutting down on the amount of progress that can be made in making streets safer.
But Maine expects to get $1.3 billion for highways alone from the infrastructure bill. That money must be used wisely to restructure our transportation so that it is as safe and healthy as can be.

Texto completo: Numerous schools in southern and central Maine said that they plan to have an increased police presence Friday as a precaution in the face of nationwide social media posts threatening schools.
Maine Public Safety spokesperson Shannon Moss said that the Maine Information and Analysis Center, along with other fusion centers across the country, will continue to monitor online activity that might pose a threat, but as of right now there have been no credible threats made against any school in Maine.
Videos shared on TikTok claim that multiple school shootings will take place Friday. TikTok is a social media application that allows users to create and share short videos.
Administrators from Brunswick, Yarmouth, Falmouth, Maine School Administrative District 51 in Cumberland, Regional School Unit 9 in Farmington and Regional School Unit 4 in Wales addressed the social media posts in letters to the school communities on Thursday.
"It appears that individuals far away from Maine have started yet another inappropriate use of the social media platform known as TikTok and they have succeeded in creating the hysteria they clearly desire," Yarmouth Superintendent Andrew Dolloff wrote. "We have been in touch with local law enforcement and they have agreed that, while no threats have been made toward Yarmouth's schools, they are going to increase their visibility and presence around our facilities tomorrow."
The Cumberland and Brunswick school districts also will have heightened police presence on Friday, according to messages written by the superintendents. Both schools say local law enforcement have confirmed that there are no credible threats to their schools.
"Please know that our schools are safe places, we have protocols in place and that we work closely with local law enforcement," Brunswick Superintendent Phil Potenziano said in a message sent to the community. "This continuous and deliberate attention to safety has been and continues to be a central priority for Brunswick. However, I would remind all school community members to be vigilant and report anything out of the ordinary to the police or the schools."
RSU 9 Superintendent Christian Elkington also addressed the posts.
"Please know that our administrators and school resource officer will be working from a higher level of concern over the next several days to hopefully ease concerns by helping our students and staff feel more secure in our schools," Elkington said.
RSU 4 Superintendent Andrew Carlton said he has notified local law enforcement and has asked that officers are present at their schools on Friday as a precaution.
Portland Public Schools did not respond to an email Thursday night seeking information about whether the district was taking steps to address the threats.
The TikTok threats comes just two weeks after a deadly shooting in Michigan resulted in four student deaths. Maine schools have been on alert, with at least three districts canceling school in the last week.
Lewiston schools will be closed Friday due to an unrelated threat. A social media threat from a student following an altercation at Lewiston Middle School was addressed by the Lewiston police, however law enforcement and school officials decided to close all schools in the district out of precaution.
Press Herald Staff Writer Dennis Hoey and Times Record Staff Writer C. Tacher Carter contributed to this story.

Texto completo: You can achieve anything with perseverance, but sometimes we all just need a little help.
This year, I graduated from Walden University with a bachelor's degree in social work. Besides being a mom to my two young children, it is this accomplishment that I am most proud of attaining. Without the Higher Opportunity for Pathways to Employment program, it would not have been possible.
In 2016, my 2-year-old daughter and I fled from Colorado with a one-way ticket and two suitcases. We had spent the past two years in and out of women's shelters for domestic violence. Despite the chaotic situation at home, I managed to remain enrolled in a local university, where my scholarships covered the cost of tuition.
When I resettled here in Maine, I transferred to an accredited online university to finish my studies. The transfer added on more time and less help through scholarships. Because of this, I was forced to utilize loans for both tuition and living costs. Those loan payments and the resulting interest added up, but I kept pushing through.
In 2018, after my son was born, it seemed as though anything that could go wrong did. As an infant, he suffered from breathing complications that brought us in and out of the NICU. At that moment, I needed to spend my energy and focus on my two little ones, and I made the difficult decision to take a leave of absence from the online program.
For many others, this was where their education would have ended: with a lot of debt and no degree. As a single mom of two children - and one with medical complications - I didn't know if it was in me anymore to finish my degree. I knew I needed help, so I reached out to Maine Equal Justice. Without a doubt, that call changed my life.
That's where I learned about a new program, called HOPE. It was designed to help families like mine pursue training and education beyond high school and achieve their career plans by addressing complicated barriers to success. My application was accepted, and I became one of the first members of the program.
For the first time in my life, I had a wraparound support system, both emotionally and financially. HOPE staff were right there with me to help navigate the challenges, like when I almost couldn't finish my senior year because of depleted funds. Instead of being faced with more student loans, the team from HOPE helped me find a $4,000 scholarship.
Unfortunately, many students still struggle to make ends meet over the course of their enrollment in HOPE, and some expenses are just not covered. A recent survey of HOPE students showed that 83 percent of respondents have difficulty making ends meet at the end of each month, and 59 percent of them are just $100-$300 short of what they need to make ends meet on their family budget.
But now, as a result of a generous investment by Sara Gideon and the tireless work of the advocates at Maine Equal Justice, that help will be there for participants.
The Build HOPE Project will provide much-needed financial assistance for students in the HOPE and Parents as Scholars programs. When families are faced with costly home or emergency car repairs, or the internet bill they can't afford, they now have a dedicated fund to turn to. The Build HOPE Project will bridge that gap which can make the difference between success and failure.
I'm proud to say that I graduated at the top of my class, while earning two university awards, being added to two prestigious honor societies and still being able to focus on my children. Being able to model this determination to my children was worth all of it. I was able to turn my life around and chart my own path to success. As a result of hard work, perseverance, a little help and the Build HOPE Project, there will be many more stories like mine in Maine's future.

Texto completo: The Lewiston medical center will open a unit for patients ready for discharge but need some additional nursing and rehabilitation.

LEWISTON — Members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Central Maine Medical Center on Thursday to help ease the staffing shortages as the COVID-19 surge continues.
With their assistance, CMMC will open a swing bed unit, also known as a short-term rehabilitation program, Monday for patients who need noncritical care before leaving the hospital. The unit will care for a mix of people, including hospice patients, and will help open up beds for patients who need treatment.
Many of the 17 members, who come from communities across the state, volunteered for the role. They will be trained as nursing assistants, helping to check patients’ vitals, change beds and assist the clinical staff with rehabilitation.
“A couple months ago, I was here myself, and I saw how short-handed they are here,” Master Sgt. Brian Jones of the Lewiston-Auburn area said. “I think it was a good thing for us to step up and help out. … From what I’ve seen and what I’ve experienced, it’s needed.”
The 16-bed wing previously housed orthopedic and neurosurgery patients, but was closed two months ago, Central Maine Healthcare CEO Dr. Steve Littleson said.
“Their presence here is like a great Christmas gift,” he said. “Our workforce is exhausted, and they’ve been fighting this pandemic since the very beginning, and as we all know, it’s only getting worse. And so, for these guardsmen and women to show up now, before the holidays when our team members are tired but still dedicated to the job is just not only a practical help, we’re literally going to open more beds because they’re here.”
Originally, hospital officials were told 12 members would arrive, but were delighted when five more showed up.
“The emotional lift that the rest of our team members are getting from their presence is really fantastic. It tells them that the rest of the community cares about them,” Littleson said.
Gov. Janet Mills activated the National Guard on Dec. 8 to help understaffed hospitals straining to care for a surge of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. Members of the Guard will additionally be assisting Central Maine Healthcare’s two hospitals in Bridgton and Rumford.
Central Maine Healthcare is the parent company to Central Maine Medical Center.
“This particular unit is going to be geared toward patients who are ready for discharge, but still need some additional nursing and rehabilitation for a couple of days, or maybe a week or two,” Littleson said.
“Those patients have been sitting in our hospital with no place to go because our long-term care facilities are also full and also suffering from workforce shortages,” he said. “This unit is really going to enable us to open up more beds, admit more patients, and keep caring for our community in ways that we really struggled, most recently.”
At times, patients must wait in the emergency department until a hospital bed opens, he added.
The Guard is expected to be deployed at least until the end of January, however Littleson said the hospital may still need help beyond that.
According to chief medical officer for Central Maine Healthcare, Dr. John Alexander, CMMC has between 60 to 100 vacant positions for clinical staff and another 200 to 300 vacant positions throughout the system.
CMMC expects to receive three nurses from the Veterans Administration next week to assist with COVID-19 care. The hospital’s request for a rapid response medical team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is still pending.
“I think one of the hardest parts has been seeing some of the younger people who’ve come in and have developed COVID and then have more severe illness,” Alexander said. “That’s especially challenging for most of our caregivers because you don’t expect that to happen. They’re otherwise healthy people.”

Texto completo: State officials said the new highly contagious coronavirus variant has not been officially detected in Maine, but they assume it is already here and will soon drive more infections.

The highly contagious omicron variant is likely already in Maine even as delta continues to drive rising infections and hospitalizations, the state’s top health official said Thursday.
“Though we have not confirmed the omicron variant in Maine, the Maine CDC believes it is here,” Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, said during a media briefing. As of Thursday, 36 states, including New Hampshire, have detected the omicron variant, according to federal and state statistics.
Meanwhile, the delta variant that arrived in the summer continues to overwhelm Maine hospitals with record numbers of patients, most of whom are not vaccinated.
Maine reported 1,286 new cases of COVID-19 and 27 additional deaths Thursday. And a record 381 patients were in Maine hospitals, the CDC reported.
Public health experts predict the more contagious omicron variant could soon be the dominant strain of the disease in the United States. Omicron may cause less severe illness than the delta variant that has fueled the fall surge, but officials say it may add to the burden hospitals are facing because it spreads more easily.
Preliminary studies are showing waning vaccine effectiveness against omicron over time. But they also indicate that booster shots provide similar protection against omicron compared to a fully vaccinated — but non-boosted — person against delta and previous variants.
“Boosters were important before. They are more important now,” Shah said. Maine is now administering about 10,000 shots per day — levels not seen since the spring — with about seven out of every 10 shots being booster shots.
Despite the omicron variant potentially causing another wave of cases, the Mills administration is not considering reimposing restrictions such as limits on gathering sizes, mask mandates or requiring proof of vaccination to attend indoor events, officials said Thursday. Nine states, including California, have reimposed mask mandates, and some jurisdictions, such as New York City, now require proof of vaccination to attend many indoor activities.
Jeanne Lambrew, Maine’s health and human services commissioner, said there are “no plans at this time” to bring back any of the pandemic restrictions.
“We do know vaccines appear to be effective against omicron,” Lambrew said. “Our first line of defense is vaccination.”
The omicron variant accounts for about 3% of all cases in the United States. But based on how the variant has spread in South Africa and other countries, it has “an extraordinary ability” to transmit quickly, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House medical advisor, in an appearance on “Good Morning America” on Thursday.
“It has what we call a doubling time of about three days, and if you do the math on that, if you have just a couple of percentage of the isolates being omicron — very soon it’s going to be the dominant variant,” Fauci said.
Even though illnesses from omicron may be less severe than delta, Shah said, its higher transmissibility means more people may get sick, further overwhelming hospitals.
“When it comes to assessing a variant, contagiousness ranks higher than severity,” Shah said.
Meanwhile, unvaccinated patients sick with COVID-19 continue to strain hospital systems in Maine.
Maine Medical Center in Portland, the state’s largest hospital, is experiencing the largest wave of COVID-19 patients it has seen since the pandemic began.
The 615-bed hospital cared for an average of 52.3 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients each day for the week ending Thursday, up from its previous record set last week of 45.9 per day. On Thursday, it was caring for 58 such patients, just one shy of the all-time single-hospital record of 59 set at Bangor’s Eastern Maine Medical Center in late September.
As has been the case throughout the pandemic, the vast majority of those hospitalized as of Thursday are not fully vaccinated.
There are 381 people in Maine hospitals being treated for COVID-19, with 114 in intensive care and 66 on ventilators, the CDC reported Thursday. It was yet another new pandemic high and marked the 11th consecutive day of at least 350 COVID-19 patients, a trend that has forced many hospitals to postpone elective surgeries such as knee and hip replacements.
Full story at CentralMaine.com
MaineHealth, the 10-hospital network that includes Maine Med, reported that only 4 of the 42 COVID-19 patients in intensive care across its system were fully vaccinated against the disease. Only 21 of the 82 inpatients being cared for outside the ICUs were fully vaccinated.
Dr. Joel Botler, Maine Med’s chief medical officer, said the spike is largely due to the growing number of acute COVID-19 patients statewide needing specialized care available only at the Portland hospital, including special oxygenation interventions for people no longer getting enough oxygen while on ventilators.
“With COVID, when people get very ill it is a multi-system illness, not simply a respiratory one, and as that complexity increases, at a certain level they need to come to (Maine Med),” Botler said.
Botler noted the hospital had 19 COVID-19 patients on ventilators at one point Thursday, the highest during the pandemic.
Jennifer McCarthy, Maine Med’s chief operating officer, said capacity at the hospital was incredibly tight, and that cancer and orthopedic patients who would normally be in operating rooms were having to wait many weeks because of the COVID-19 surge.
“We are committed to taking care of the sickest people in the state of Maine, so as people get sicker and the COVID needs increase, we meet that demand by dialing back on anything that can wait a period of time,” McCarthy said.
Other hospitals across the state reported very high numbers of COVID-19 inpatients. Inland Hospital, a 36-bed facility in Waterville, had 6.4 per day, up from its previous record of 6.1 set last week. Mercy Hospital in Portland, Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick, MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta, and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston all reported near-record levels of patients.
The high number of deaths reported Thursday includes 20 deaths that were identified through a periodic review of death certificates, in this case in November, according to the Maine CDC. Some of the new infections also occurred over the past week or so but were not immediately processed because of a flood of positive tests.
Several hospitals across the state are getting help this week from the Maine Army National Guard, which deployed 38 Guard members to non-clinical roles. Maine Medical Center in Portland also has been approved to receive a “surge response team” of 15 clinicians from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston hopes to gain approval for a team this week as well.
One of the areas the National Guard will assist with is monoclonal antibodies, which are used to treat COVID-19 patients.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 134,170 cases of COVID-19 and 1,405 deaths. The seven-day average of daily new cases stood at 1,047 on Thursday, compared with 769 a week ago and 532 a month ago.
On the vaccination front, 945,794 people have received their final dose of COVID-19 vaccine, representing 70.36% of Maine’s 1.3 million population. Nearly 400,000 Mainers have received their booster shot.
But there’s a wide disparity in vaccination uptake among counties, and areas with low vaccination rates are fueling the surge. Cumberland County, the most-vaccinated in Maine, is reporting 80.7% of its residents are fully vaccinated, compared with lower-vaccination counties like Somerset, Piscataquis and Franklin, which are recording vaccination rates of less than 60%.

Don't sign Kennebunk recall petition

Texto completo: Want your votes thrown out?
I am dismayed to read about the effort to recall elected members of the Regional School Unit 21 School Board. Two members would be affected: Chair Art LeBlanc and Tim Stentiford, both representing Kennebunk.
According to recent newspaper articles, both men won by large margins. The town website states that LeBlanc won with 2,382 votes in 2020. Stentiford's count is no longer specified - his term is over in June.
In 2020, more than 2,000 people opted not to vote on the school board candidates, probably because they hadn't followed information on the campaign. I'm hoping they are not swayed to sign the petitions.
The recall efforts specify poor leadership, contentious behavior toward teachers and parents, teachers quitting and increased spending. However, research into the actual expenditures of the district shows judicious spending. Legal fees are down, and new human resources expenses are typical of most other school districts in southern Maine. While teacher turnover is also a complaint, RSU 21 has no teacher vacancies, and turnover is less than state averages. Many assistant positions have been vacated - no surprise during the pandemic.
As for poor leadership and contentious behavior, these are subjective judgments. Please attend a board meeting online (easy through the RSU 21 website) and see for yourself.
I ask my fellow voters not to sign the petitions now circulating. They are an insult to the candidates we elected. Those who sign the recall are, in effect, throwing out our ballots.

Make world more livable - support local farms
My name is Clara, I attend King Middle School in Portland, and we are experiencing a food emergency. The mindset of food in America needs to shift to live more healthily and sustainably. Individuals must support our local farmers, who treat their land and animals fairly, over factory farms.
Abusing Earth's resources, instead of harvesting what the environment can sustain, has been occurring for thousands of years. In the Bible, God says to man, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the Earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky, and over every living thing that moves on the Earth." I believe that Mainers should, instead, view all living things as equal, and think about how we can take just what we need.
Maine has always had a strong focus on agriculture, and most of our farms are small and family-owned. Supporting farms like these over factory farms, with terrible carbon footprints, is a necessity in this constantly warming world.
According to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a global shift to a plant-based diet could reduce "mortality and greenhouse gases caused by food production by 10 and 70 percent, respectively," by 2050. These statistics support the idea that eating fresh, plant-based and local is what our planet and bodies need.
If everyone throws their weight behind the local farm movement, and eats less meat, we will have hope for a livable world for years to come.

Collins should support STEM workers in U.S.
Sen. Susan Collins is a cosponsor of legislation that would hurt the employment prospects of our science, technology, engineering and math workers and college graduates and depress wages in those fields.
The bill S.2828, the Preserving Employment Visas Act, would make available approximately 80,000 work visas (in addition to the large number that are already available) to employers seeking cheap imported labor.
Regardless of the rationale used to justify this action, the practical effect is no more nuanced than this: These visas are sought by the employers and corporations looking for cheap labor, disregarding the detriment to American STEM workers and college graduates.
Sen. Collins should work for American workers.

Now is time to switch to renewable energy
"There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth. We are all crew." - Marshall McLuhan
My name is Evie. I attend King Middle School in Portland. I am working on an expedition called "Engineering our Energy Future." I have been debating, researching and discussing the issue of climate change for over two months. My political message is that individuals and governments need to switch to renewable energy to move into the future.
Looking at a satellite view of the Earth's ice caps today is shocking. Earth has lost 28 trillion tons of ice in less than 30 years. Currently, ice sheets are losing 1.2 trillion tons of ice every year, which adds over a millimeter to the global sea level. This is because of the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide and heat, trapping gases into the atmosphere, then they warm up the planet.
To reduce the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere and meet our country's goal of net zero emissions, everyone will have to do their part. We could all begin by switching to a cleaner and climate-friendly alternative, renewable energy.
In conclusion, to secure a safe future on Earth we need to switch to renewable energy. And we need to do it now. We only have one planet, we cannot afford to waste it.

Texto completo: The Lewiston medical center will open a unit for patients ready for discharge but need some additional nursing and rehabilitation.

LEWISTON — Members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Central Maine Medical Center on Thursday to help ease the staffing shortages as the COVID-19 surge continues.
With their assistance, CMMC will open a swing bed unit, also known as a short-term rehabilitation program, Monday for patients who need noncritical care before leaving the hospital. The unit will care for a mix of people, including hospice patients, and will help open up beds for patients who need treatment.
Many of the 17 members, who come from communities across the state, volunteered for the role. They will be trained as nursing assistants, helping to check patients’ vitals, change beds and assist the clinical staff with rehabilitation.
“A couple months ago, I was here myself, and I saw how short-handed they are here,” Master Sgt. Brian Jones of the Lewiston-Auburn area said. “I think it was a good thing for us to step up and help out. … From what I’ve seen and what I’ve experienced, it’s needed.”

Texto completo: Bud's Shop 'n Save at 101 Somerset Plaza is set to begin operations in January under new ownership — the Danforth family, owner of Danforth's Down Home Supermarket.
Bud’s Shop ‘n Save in Pittsfield, an independent grocery store for more than 60 years, is set to begin operations under new ownership.
Beginning in January, the owners of another independent store, Danforth’s Down Home Supermarket in Hermon, will own and operate Bud’s, located at 101 Somerset Plaza.
Dean Homstead, owner of Bud’s, said he decided to sell the store so he could retire.
Homstead’s father began the business in 1953 with a store in Newport. Six years later, he opened stores in Pittsfield and Dexter. Dean Homstead took ownership of the stores in 1985.
Homstead sold the Newport and Dexter locations to Hannaford in 2016. When it came time to sell the Pittsfield store, however, he wanted to find a buyer who would preserve it as an independent grocer rather than having it become part of a large chain. Thus, he approached the Danforth family.
“I thought it was the perfect fit for what they’re looking for and what I was looking for: To have a family-operated business that will continue on, not just for what I want, but for my store associates and for the town of Pittsfield,” Homstead said.
Brett Danforth, the manager of Danforth’s Down Home Supermarket, said his family had been looking for several years to open a second location. Danforth said when Homstead approached him recently, everything fell into place.
“It truthfully was the perfect fit,” Danforth said. “Thirty minutes down the road and we’re familiar with the community. That gives us a leg up to make sure we can continue to run the business the way the community is familiar with, which is locally owned, family-run and with a customer-first and employee-centric business model.”
Danforth’s Down Home Supermarket opened in 2007 and is owned by Richard Danforth, Brett Danforth’s father. Both Bud’s and Danforth’s are Hannaford-supplied stores, one of several similarities that will help with the transition, Brett Danforth said.
The new ownership takes effect Jan. 2, although Brett Danforth said not much will change at first for shoppers. The employees at Bud’s will remain and their original start dates will be honored, Danforth said.
“It’s very important that we respect the history that’s there (at Bud’s) and we appreciate that,” Danforth said. “And I think that’s going to make the Pittsfield community and the employees understand much more quickly how we do business and how we’re going to continue to do business for many, many years.”
It is difficult to determine how many independent grocers remain in Maine because some local owners have multiple stores, according to Christine Cummings, executive director of the Maine Grocers & Food Producers Association in Augusta.
A 2017 economic report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that in 2015, independent grocery stores made up 11% of grocery sales across the country.
The independent markets play an important role because they make food accessible to those in rural and low-income areas, according to the report.
While the number of independent grocers nationwide increased between 2005 and 2015, the report says they were hit hardest by the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 and saw diminished numbers.
Cummings said Maine has not necessarily seen independent stores going out of business. Instead, some stores have been acquired by other local owners, by larger chains or transitioned to employee ownership as the original owners look to retire, she said.
As Homstead prepares for his own retirement, he said he plans to remain a familiar face.
“I’m going to stay here,” he said, “and I’m going to shop here.”

Texto completo: Franklin, Aroostook and Piscataquis counties, where vaccination rates are low, now have the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-highest new case rates per capita in the United States.
COVID-19 is spreading faster in three rural Maine counties than nearly anywhere else in the United States.
Franklin County in western Maine has the fourth-highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 infections out of 3,243 counties nationwide, with Aroostook and Piscataquis immediately behind in the fifth and sixth slots.
Franklin has seen an average of 44 new cases each day for the week ending Thursday, or a rate of 145 new infections per 100,000 people, the fourth-fastest spread of the virus in the entire country, according to The New York Times’ tracker, which compiles official data from state and local health agencies across the country.
Franklin County was not far behind the worst counties in the country: Pike and Piatt in southern and central Illinois and Tompkins in upstate New York, which have rates between 150 and 171 per 100,000.
Aroostook County is now fifth in the nation, at 143 per 100,000. Piscataquis County is sixth, at 142 per 100,000, one per capita case greater than seventh-ranked Jefferson County, a rural jurisdiction in southern Indiana, across the Ohio River from Kentucky.
All three Maine counties have relatively low vaccination rates, with between 59% and 65% of the population fully vaccinated, compared to the statewide average of 75%.
In contrast, Cumberland County has a vaccination rate of 82%, according to federal data — the eighth highest rate in the United States — and the per capita new case average is 49 per 100,000.
New cases, hospitalizations and deaths have closely tracked vaccination rates across the state, with the vast majority of seriously ill Mainers being unvaccinated, hospitals have reported for many months.
The next worst Maine county was Oxford, with 118 new cases per 100,000 over the past seven days, a figure that placed it 22nd in the nation.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, cautioned Thursday against reading too much into the trend, given how the disease flares in one place and then another.
“A lot of these metrics depend on when you take a look at them, on where you start and stop the tape,” Shah said. “As a state, Maine is nowhere near the top, but you can always subdivide into areas that are smaller and have substantially higher transmission rates.”
Maine as a whole is now the third-worst state in the nation by the same metric — new cases per capita — with 91 per 100,000, according to the Times’ data. The worst two states are also in New England: Rhode Island, with 103 per 100,000, and New Hampshire, 91.
Hospitalizations typically lag exposure by about two weeks in those people acutely affected by the disease. Franklin County’s only hospital, Franklin Memorial in Farmington, saw its COVID inpatient burden nearly double for the week ending Thursday to an average of 6.4 people being cared for each day, up from 3.7 last week, but less than its peak of 7.6 per day in late October.
The two major hospitals serving western Maine — MaineGeneral in Augusta and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston — have had a brutal fall, setting COVID-19 patient records for their facilities.
Both remained at high levels for the week ending Thursday.

Maine sees successes in midst of pandemic

Texto completo: Early in the pandemic economic forecasts drew a dismal picture of Maine's economy, but while some businesses and industries are still struggling, the state has seen economic growth in the last year.

AUGUSTA — Only weeks after the global COVID-19 pandemic was declared, one economic study predicted that Maine would be the nation’s most vulnerable state to the economic fallout of the health crisis.
But a year and a half later, that hasn’t proved to be the case.
“Luckily, and because of a lot of good work from a lot of people around the state, that’s not true,” Heather Johnson, commissioner of the state Department of Economic and Community Development, said earlier this week.
The forecast by Oxford Economics cited Maine’s high percentage of older residents and its reliance on hospitality, tourism and retail trade among other factors as contributing to the dismal outlook.
But Johnson, who was talking about the state’s economic recovery Wednesday at the Chamber Connection put on by the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the state’s gross domestic product has grown, putting the state at about 33rd nationally.
“Nobody who has a competitive bone in their body thinks 33rd is where you want to be,” Johnson said via Zoom, “but it’s better than being in the low 40s, which is where we usually are.”
Johnson detailed how more than $200 million in federal recovery funds have been targeted to help businesses and industries damaged by the effects of the global pandemic, which includes the hospitality sector.
Johnson said while the state’s economy still has some key challenges to navigate, the state’s gross domestic product — the total value of finished goods and services produced — has recovered to exceed pre-pandemic levels after taking a steep dive in 2020.
Sales tax collections are also up, she said, and people are feeling a bit more comfortable about spending disposable income.
“We’re actually seeing investment in some new businesses, and we’re seeing new business startups grow,” she said.
That activity is coming from people who decided to start their own businesses instead of returning to work full-time.
That’s something Andrew Silsby, president and CEO of Kennebec Savings Bank, said he’s seeing — growth in new business account openings and a larger trend of strong deposit growth.
“At Kennebec Savings, probably a pretty good year of deposit growth would be $50 million, a really good year would be about $85 million,” Silsby said. “In 18 months, we’ve grown deposits by $350 million.”
Traditionally, he said, demand for loans has been higher than deposit activity. “When I say there’s a really a lot of money on the sidelines, there’s really a lot of money on the sidelines — more than we’ve ever seen before,” he said. “But I really want to see some of those dollars get invested back into businesses.”
Silsby acknowledged that not all businesses are faring equally well and for some hardship continues, but the elevated deposits are across the board for businesses large and small and personal accounts.
Among the concerns voiced at the presentation was the possibility of another shutdown, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads across the United States.
Johnson urged people to stay aware of changing conditions and be concerned about what’s happening.
“When you have to call the National Guard to support your health care system, that’s never happened in my lifetime,” she said, referring to recent action by Gov. Janet Mills to assist overwhelmed hospitals.
But, she said, a shutdown isn’t likely. The protocols that the state put in place early on in the pandemic, including widespread shutdowns were developed because of a public health crisis that people weren’t able to protect themselves from or control. And the emergency powers granted to Mills that allowed those shutdowns to be declared have expired.
“Now we have more options,” she said. “We have vaccines, and we know a lot more about what’s happening. It gives people a chance to protect themselves and their families, and that changes the dynamic of personal accountability and options for protecting yourself.”
One of the impacts the pandemic has had on Maine is population growth, as people from other states with the option to work remotely have chosen to do so from Maine. While those increases won’t be captured by the latest census, Johnson said other indicators illustrate that growth, like the number of out-of-state driver’s licenses that are being converted to in-state driver’s licenses, which she said is the double-digit thousands of people.
That has led to concerns about housing, and whether people being recruited to work here will be able to find any place to live.
“I think the short and the long answer to that is yes,” Johnson said.
In the Maine Jobs and Recovery funding package, $50 million is targeted for workforce housing, she said, which can be used in a number of ways.
She cited the example of the Northern Forest Center in Millinocket, which put together funds from philanthropic and other sources to renovate and update some run-down houses it had bought. Those houses are now low market-rate homes.
“It’s meeting worker demand. I expect we’ll see more of that from the nonprofit world, and I expect that we’ll try to figure out how to help with that,” she said. “Where I am spending my time is this workforce housing piece, which is, if you need nurses, we need a place for nurses to live. If we need teachers, we’ve got to have a place for teachers to live near where they work. And we don’t have that in all of our markets right now.”

Texto completo: Franklin, Aroostook and Piscataquis counties, where vaccination rates are low, now have the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-highest new case rates per capita in the United States.
COVID-19 is spreading faster in three rural Maine counties than nearly anywhere else in the United States.
Franklin County in western Maine has the fourth-highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 infections out of 3,243 counties nationwide, with Aroostook and Piscataquis immediately behind in the fifth and sixth slots.
Franklin has seen an average of 44 new cases each day for the week ending Thursday, or a rate of 145 new infections per 100,000 people, the fourth-fastest spread of the virus in the entire country, according to The New York Times’ tracker, which compiles official data from state and local health agencies across the country.
Franklin County was not far behind the worst counties in the country: Pike and Piatt in southern and central Illinois and Tompkins in upstate New York, which have rates between 150 and 171 per 100,000.
Aroostook County is now fifth in the nation, at 143 per 100,000. Piscataquis County is sixth, at 142 per 100,000, one per capita case greater than seventh-ranked Jefferson County, a rural jurisdiction in southern Indiana, across the Ohio River from Kentucky.
All three Maine counties have relatively low vaccination rates, with between 59% and 65% of the population fully vaccinated, compared to the statewide average of 75%.
In contrast, Cumberland County has a vaccination rate of 82%, according to federal data — the eighth highest rate in the United States — and the per capita new case average is 49 per 100,000.
New cases, hospitalizations and deaths have closely tracked vaccination rates across the state, with the vast majority of seriously ill Mainers being unvaccinated, hospitals have reported for many months.
The next worst Maine county was Oxford, with 118 new cases per 100,000 over the past seven days, a figure that placed it 22nd in the nation.
Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, cautioned Thursday against reading too much into the trend, given how the disease flares in one place and then another.
“A lot of these metrics depend on when you take a look at them, on where you start and stop the tape,” Shah said. “As a state, Maine is nowhere near the top, but you can always subdivide into areas that are smaller and have substantially higher transmission rates.”
Maine as a whole is now the third-worst state in the nation by the same metric — new cases per capita — with 91 per 100,000, according to the Times’ data. The worst two states are also in New England: Rhode Island, with 103 per 100,000, and New Hampshire, 91.
Hospitalizations typically lag exposure by about two weeks in those people acutely affected by the disease. Franklin County’s only hospital, Franklin Memorial in Farmington, saw its COVID inpatient burden nearly double for the week ending Thursday to an average of 6.4 people being cared for each day, up from 3.7 last week, but less than its peak of 7.6 per day in late October.
The two major hospitals serving western Maine — MaineGeneral in Augusta and Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston — have had a brutal fall, setting COVID-19 patient records for their facilities.
Both remained at high levels for the week ending Thursday.

Texto completo: Avangrid did not make its case that a referendum passed by voters this November should not become law this weekend, a state judge ruled.

A law passed by voters in November banning a controversial power transmission line through western Maine will take effect Sunday after a Maine judge ruled against a last-minute injunction Thursday.
The ruling is another blow to a $1 billion energy project planned for years by Avangrid, parent company of Central Maine Power Co., although it’s not the final word. Avangrid’s lawsuit challenging the ban will continue and it could appeal the injunction ruling to Maine’s Supreme Judicial Court.
Avangrid filed a lawsuit against the ban a day after voters passed it in a Nov. 2 citizen-initiated referendum that followed the most expensive ballot-question campaign in state history. The referendum vote prohibited the construction of New England Clean Energy Connect, a controversial 145-mile high-voltage transmission line through western Maine.
Avangrid, through its affiliate NECEC Transmission LLC, also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to try to prevent the law from going into effect as scheduled while its lawsuit is pending. The law is set to take effect Sunday.
Judge Michael Duddy, ruling for the Business and Consumer Court, said allowing the citizen initiative to become law while the lawsuit works its way through the court would not harm the company irreparably, but could damage democracy.
Duddy agreed that delaying construction of the transmission corridor will mean substantial economic harm to Avangrid.
But, he said, “that harm does not outweigh the harm to voter confidence and participatory democracy that would result from preventing the initiative from becoming law while this legal challenge is pending.”
In a statement, Avangrid said it was disappointed in the decision, but confident the full legal process will determine the law passed in the referendum is unconstitutional.
“As one of the region’s most important clean energy projects, the NECEC will benefit Maine and all New Englanders by reducing the region’s dependence on fossil fuels which will result in cleaner air, lower energy prices and improved reliability,” the company said.
The company is reviewing the order and considering options, but would not say whether it plans to appeal the injunction ruling to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.
“The facts are clear: the NECEC project is good for Maine and for the region and will help address the energy, economic and climate issues we face,” it said. “That is why we remain committed to this project and its many benefits and look forward to restarting construction as soon as we are able.”
Avangrid argues that the referendum, which is retroactive to 2014, violates its “vested rights” to the property, meaning it had valid permits to start construction before the referendum.
Avangrid has spent at least $450 million on the project so far, with dozens of miles of woodland in northwest Maine cleared for the transmission line.
In his order, Duddy said he was not convinced by Avangrid’s arguments on vested rights or its contention that the law violated other parts of the state constitution and would irreparably harm the company.
However, Duddy also said the law that applies to the case is uncertain on many disputed points that should be decided by the state’s highest court.
“Thus, while the court is unpersuaded by the plaintiff’s legal arguments, this case presents many difficult questions,” Duddy said. “Plaintiffs have legitimate counter arguments on all disputed points of law.”
Thursday’s ruling was the latest in a string of setbacks for the corridor project. In November, almost 60% of voters approved the referendum to ban the transmission line.
The new law bans the construction of high-impact electric-transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region and requires the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine, both retroactively to 2020. It also requires the Legislature to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public lands retroactively to 2014.

“We appreciate the quick decision by the judge to reject CMP’s effort to subvert the will of Maine voters and look forward to the referendum becoming law on Sunday,” Didisheim said in a statement.
Despite the voters’ rejection, Avangrid continued clearing forest and other development related to the transmission line. It stopped in mid-November after a request from Gov. Janet Mills while pursuing its lawsuit against the referendum.
Late last month, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection suspended the construction license for the corridor. The license will remain suspended until Avangrid wins its court case or legal fight over a public land lease in the project’s path.
At the same time, Avangrid is under pressure to complete the project by August 2024 or risk losing its contract. The transmission line was commissioned to bring 1,200 megawatts of power from producer Hydro-Quebec to the New England grid through a station in Lewiston.
The project is being built to help Massachusetts meet its clean energy goals and will be paid for by electric customers in the Bay State.
Avangrid has argued it would bring cleaner, cheaper energy to New England generally. The company pledged $250 million in benefits to Mainers including electric rate relief, help with energy efficiency and economic development. When construction was suspended, those payments were too.

Maine sees growth in second year of pandemic The state's gross domestic product has recovered to exceed pre-pandemic levels after taking a steep dive in 2020, surpassing experts' predictions.

Texto completo: AUGUSTA -- Only weeks after the global COVID-19 pandemic was declared, one economic study predicted that Maine would be the U.S. state most vulnerable to the economic fallout of the health crisis.
But a year and a half later, that hasn't proved to be the case.
"Luckily, and because of a lot of good work from a lot of people around the state, that's not true," Heather Johnson, commissioner of the state Department of Economic and Community Development, said earlier this week.
The forecast by Oxford Economics cited Maine's high percentage of older residents and its reliance on hospitality, tourism and retail trade among other factors as contributing to the dismal outlook.
But Johnson, who was talking about the state's economic recovery Wednesday at the Chamber Connection put on by the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the state's gross domestic product has grown, putting the state at about 33rd nationally.
"Nobody who has a competitive bone in their body thinks 33rd is where you want to be," Johnson said via Zoom, "but it's better than being in the low 40s, which is where we usually are."
Johnson detailed how more than $200 million in federal recovery funds have been targeted to help businesses and industries damaged by the effects of the global pandemic, which includes the hospitality sector.
Johnson said while the state's economy still has some key challenges to navigate, the state's gross domestic product - the total value of finished goods and services produced - has recovered to exceed pre-pandemic levels after taking a steep dive in 2020.
Sales tax collections are also up, she said, and people are feeling a bit more comfortable about spending disposable income.
"We're actually seeing investment in some new businesses, and we're seeing new business startups grow," she said.
That activity is coming from people who decided to start their own businesses instead of returning to work full time.
That's something Andrew Silsby, president and CEO of Kennebec Savings Bank, said he's seeing - growth in new business account openings and a larger trend of strong deposit growth.
"At Kennebec Savings, probably a pretty good year of deposit growth would be $50 million, a really good year would be about $85 million," Silsby said. "In 18 months, we've grown deposits by $350 million."
Traditionally, he said, demand for loans has been higher than deposit activity. "When I say there's really a lot of money on the sidelines, there's really a lot of money on the sidelines - more than we've ever seen before," he said. "But I really want to see some of those dollars get invested back into businesses."
Silsby acknowledged that not all businesses are faring equally well, and for some hardship continues, but the elevated deposits are across the board for businesses large and small and personal accounts.
Some at the presentation feared the possibility of another shutdown, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads across the United States.
Johnson urged people to stay aware of changing conditions and be concerned about what's happening.
"When you have to call the National Guard to support your health care system, that's never happened in my lifetime," she said, referring to recent action by Gov. Janet Mills to assist overwhelmed hospitals.
But, she said, a lockdown isn't likely. The emergency powers granted to the Mills administration, including widespread lockdowns, have expired.
"Now we have more options," Johnson said. "We have vaccines, and we know a lot more about what's happening. It gives people a chance to protect themselves and their families, and that changes the dynamic of personal accountability and options for protecting yourself."
Maine's population has grown in the pandemic as people from other states move here to work remotely. While those increases won't be captured by the latest census, Johnson said other indicators illustrate that growth, like the number of out-of-state driver's licenses that are being converted to in-state driver's licenses, which she said numbers in the tens of thousands.
That has led to concerns about housing and whether people being recruited to work here will be able to find a place to live.
"I think the short and the long answer to that is yes," Johnson said.
In the Maine Jobs and Recovery funding package, $50 million is targeted for workforce housing, she said, which can be used in a number of ways.
She cited the example of the Northern Forest Center in Millinocket, which put together funds from philanthropic and other sources to renovate and update run-down houses it had bought. Those houses are now low market-rate homes.
"It's meeting worker demand. I expect we'll see more of that from the nonprofit world, and I expect that we'll try to figure out how to help with that," she said. "Where I am spending my time is this workforce housing piece, which is, if you need nurses, we need a place for nurses to live. If we need teachers, we've got to have a place for teachers to live near where they work. And we don't have that in all of our markets right now."

Texto completo: "It was kind of like this tipping point we hit."
Gayle Brown
Co-owner of Cold Hollow
Cider Mill
WATERBURY CENTER – Have you noticed that Cold Hollow Cider Mill apple cider has all but disappeared from the shelves of local grocery stores?
That's because Cold Hollow decided to get out of the wholesale business, and concentrate its efforts on mail order and its retail site in Waterbury Center, where you are promised a look at "Real Live Vermonters," and a taste of "Legendary Cider Donuts."
You can blame COVID-19 for creating a "perfect storm" of problems that made getting enough apples to continue wholesale production of cider all but impossible, said Production Manager Doug Warren. But the change in focus at Cold Hollow has been brewing for quite some time.
"It was kind of like this tipping point we hit," said Gayle Brown, who owns Cold Hollow with her husband, Paul. "Our dream has always been to eliminate the wholesale anyway."
Cider is the big gun
When the Browns bought Cold Hollow in 2000, wholesale cider was the "big gun" of the business, Paul Brown said.
"I spent a lot of time on the road, trying to land new accounts," he said. "I was making calls at Shaw's corporate offices. I landed some of them. One year we had a huge account with Garelick Farms. They took cider by the tanker load, 6,000 gallons. They were taking four tankers a week."
In 2003, Brown started running three shifts on two apple presses to keep up with the demand for cider.
"Stuff was breaking, guys were getting hurt," Paul Brown said. "After that we said, 'Ok, let's cut out all these accounts we're not making money on. Let's whittle it back to a more tolerable level.'"
Garelick Farms was one of the accounts that went by the wayside. Still, Paul Brown said Cold Hollow would probably still be selling cider wholesale — at a reduced level — if not for the problems caused by COVID.
"If fruit was plentiful and we had help," Brown said. "That's another thing. Trying to find somebody to come and press cider? That's like trying to find somebody to pick apples."
Please dad, keep picking
Warren explained that many of the apple pickers for Vermont and the much bigger orchards in upstate New York come from Jamaica — the country. COVID made it impossible for those pickers to travel north. Airports in the Caribbean were closed four of seven days for a couple of months after COVID hit, according to Warren.
"For instance Northern Orchards in Peru, New York, uses an average of 250 pickers a year," Warren said. "He had 72. There's an orchard up in St. Albans we buy a small amount from. It was just his 72-year-old father who was picking."
The owner of the St. Albans orchard opened up more of his trees to pick your own because he couldn't find anyone to help out his dad, Warren said.
"They hired two guys one weekend and paid them $18 an hour to pick, " he said. "Twenty minutes later they said, 'This isn't for us.'"
"Americans don't like to pick apples," Paul Brown chimed in.
Picking apples is labor intensive, and it has to be done in a particular way.
"You pick it wrong and you pick next year's crop as well," Warren said. "You have to twist and leave the bud on top. If you just grab and pull that bud you're pulling next year's crop."
52 bins vs. 15 bins
Warren said a lot of apples stayed on the trees in area orchards, dropping to the ground, wasted. If orchards were fortunate enough to get their apples picked, they ran into the next COVID-related problem: a shortage of truck drivers. Warren had orchard owners telling him they had apples but they had no way to get them to Cold Hollow.
"Now we send our driver with our own truck to go get them," Paul Brown said.
True enough, Warren agreed, but Cold Hollow's truck hold 15 bins of apples weighing about 800 pounds each, while the tractor-trailers Cold Hollow used to rely on carry 52 bins, making them more cost-effective.
"There have been some years during our ownership when we used upward of six million pounds of apples," Paul Brown said. "That's a lot of fruit. We have since that point cut back, but even so with Doug spending all his time trying to locate and buy apples, you can't get them. That was the catalyst that led to 'OK something's got to give,' and it was the wholesale part of our business."
Shoreham orchard deals with supply chain issues
Bill Suhr grows about six million pounds of apples every year on 300 acres in and around Shoreham, where he is the owner of Champlain Orchards. Suhr said he was able to get the Jamaicans here whom he relies on not only for picking, but also for other production jobs. Champlain Orchards sells not only apples and fresh cider, but also pies, hard cider and syrups.
Not that there weren't any problems getting here for the 55 or so Jamaicans Suhr hires at the peak of harvest.
"They dribbled in because they were having COVID issues and challenges from the U.S. embassy," Suhr said. "Our third group was supposed to be 30 men. It took six different trips to pick them up over two weeks, so there were some challenges."
Luckily, Suhr said, his "core group" of Jamaican pickers were in place in February and were able to avoid problems. The Jamaicans are heading home this week for the holidays, and will return to Shoreham in March.
Suhr has also largely avoided trucking problems, because he has his own fleet of four trucks that deliver his wholesale apples.
"Ninety percent of that wholesale is our delivery trucks within two hours of the farm, delivering to supermarkets and co-ops," Suhr said.
Suhr did go four months trying to hire a driver to fill a vacant slot, finally "robbing" a driver from another part of his company to keep the route going. Champlain Orchards has 35 full-time employees.
"There's challenges with all kinds of production staff," Suhr said. "The packing line is a challenge with staffing. It's physical work. I'm a little concerned people aren't motivated to be out and about in the work force."
Suhr has also had a heck of a time getting cardboard as a result of the pandemic. He needs corrugated cardboard to pack his apples and as "master cases" for his pies.
"It used to be a two-week lead time for cardboard," Suhr said. "Now it requires nine weeks. Do the math, that's over two months of thinking ahead, and we have to stockpile larger quantities, tying up capital."
Plastic jugs for fresh cider and aluminum cans for hard cider; flour and butter for baking, all have been challenging to get, Suhr said. But he feels good about his vertically integrated business, from raising his own seedlings for fruit trees to generating his own solar power.
"That's the fun in business, realizing where you're vulnerable," Suhr said.
Get your frozen block of cider here
Fortunately for the Browns, Cold Hollow is one of the leading attractions in the state, drawing more than 400,000 visitors annually, according to Paul Brown. Those visitors buy a lot of apple cider, apple pies, apple syrup, apple jelly, apple cider donuts, apple mustard and apple barbecue sauce, to name a few of the products Cold Hollow produces on-site.
Paul Brown said in October alone, retail business was up 45% over 2020, which was the busiest October in Cold Hollow's history.
"I'll say this about pent-up demand during the COVID," Brown said. "Business was slow coming back, but boy when it hit in the fall, wow. That was definitely pent-up demand in September and October of 2020. You'd be hard-pressed to believe there was a pandemic if you came in here last fall."
In 2021, Cold Hollow's business picked up where it left off in 2020, Brown said, and went from there, with each month busier than the preceding month.
"I think it's because people have come to rely on the fact that Cold Hollow is open," Brown said. "We went there last year and had a great time. This year we're definitely going and we're bringing our friends."
Brown refers to it as the "L.L. Bean mentality," in honor of the Maine outdoor company's flagship store in Freeport, Maine, which is famously open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Cold Hollow doesn't quite match those hours, but it is open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, except Christmas and Thanksgiving.
Not to be outdone, Paul Brown said Cold Hollow's mail order business has grown by 60% during COVID. And the Number 1 item bought mail order is — you guessed it —fresh apple cider, frozen before shipping.
"Which started as a joke," Brown said. "Who would buy a frozen block of cider when you can walk into a Shaw's and get it? Thousands and thousands of people."

NJ's official tall ship sails to Maine for restoration

Texto completo: After a long trip from Port Norris, on the mouth of the Maurice River of Delaware Bay, to Belfast, Maine, our state's official tall ship, has arrived for some much needed restoration. The last restoration of the A.J. Meerwald was in the mid 1990s.
Executive Director Brian Keenan sums up questions about the historic oyster schooner:
"Since that time she has sailed thousands of miles to over 100 ports educating nearly 100,000 passengers on the human impact of the environment. She is well loved, and is in need of some love herself.
"Using $535,000 in grant funds and $500,000 in private donations, the Bayshore Center at Bivalve, owner and operator of the A.J. Meerwald, has found increased labor and material costs (namely wood), have caused a project deficit of $200,000 which BCB is working to fill now."
Restoration is being done in phases. The first phase of new systems like an engine, generator, and galley has been done in New Jersey. The biggest and last phase is the replacement of everything from the waterline up. After much consideration, the Clark and Eisele Traditional Boatbuilding of Lincolnville, Maine, was chosen for this major overhaul.
The owners of this company traveled south in 2017 to inspect the condition of the ship, and decided it was a perfect project for them. There will be replacement of rails and the whole deck in addition the deck frame, cabin structure and bulwarks.
Clark and Eisele say the project will take nine months, Right now the A.J. Meerwald has been encased in a 100 foot structure on land leased from the city of Belfast adjacent to their shipyard. The restorers will have open houses monthly so local and curious visitors can see the work being done. Belfast has been accommodating and shown great interest in working with the historic oyster schooner from so far away.
Working with the New Jersey Historic Trust is specific and detailed in use of wood and materials according to Gerett Eisele and partner Tim Clark. Originally the ship was made with New Jersey local white oak and Atlantic white cedar. They were still available during the first restoration, but other wood such as Alaskan yellow cedar will now be allowed due to lack of the original materials.
The crew
Ethan Nielsen, has risen from a Midwest nonsailor, to a knowledgeable and enthusiastic first mate.
"She's a good boat," he says. "There's a lot of love put in into her."
Typical of any long-distance sail, both the crew and 85-foot ship looked tired and worn as they arrived. Under the leadership of capable Capt. Josh Scornavacchi, First Mate Ethan and senior sailor Leon Brooks (who is mentor to all the young crew in everything from ship maintenance and time spent to manners and life experiences), the trip went smoothly.
The above mentioned crew have spent time in Beach Haven each summer. The New Jersey Maritime Museum has been home and guide to those who ask questions or just want to get out of the hot sun. A local marina has provided showers, while local museum volunteers have kept the crew in their home and barn accommodations. They were almost family, who visited yearly, until COVID-19 kept the ship in her slip at Bivalve for two summers. Most important of all, dock accommodations have been provided by local men who own a pirate ship (yes!), head boat and a private fishing boat. On this trip to Maine, people from the Bay Head and Mantoloking yacht clubs housed, wined and dined the crew.
Capt. Josh told the Bangor Daily News that he is excited about the restoration. "I think it will make us look more professional and presentable. It looks like a working boat right now."
Capt. John Gandy
There is an unusual tie-in to Maine in the A. J. Meerwald's history. After the ship's days as an oyster boat were over — a combination of the oyster disease MSX, over harvesting, and the ship being commandeered as a fireboat during World War II by the U.S. Coast Guard — it was found junked along a creek in Maryland by Capt. John Gandy.
Like other oyster schooners, the A.J. Meerwald had once been part of a lucrative industry where millionaires were plentiful in towns along Delaware Bay, and about 50 box cars of oysters left by train each day to serve in restaurants in Philadelphia and New York. Capt. John and his son worked on the oyster schooner for months just to get it good enough to float. But they were determined to rescue her for posterity. The cost was a bargain at $1, and it was brought back to Delaware Bay. Then the hard work of restoration began with many volunteers who spent hours on her.
Gandy, who now lives in Blue Hill, Maine, saw the old ship and decided she was worth saving. He was part of forming the original Bayshore Discovery Project (now officially the Bayshore Center). Gandy got the project well on its way before his move to Maine, and is credited with saving the historic schooner.
Gandy was asked to be aboard the A.J. Meerwald when she set sail from New Jersey to Maine. Needless to say, he was thrilled to hear that his efforts had been appreciated by so many thousands of people over the years, and enjoyed his long trip north on the 93-year-old oyster schooner.
After tying up at the Clark and Eisele dock, the crew spent the next day derigging the ship; a monumental task, in addition to having the spars removed by crane. No doubt the A.J. Meerwald looked pretty bad. After the restoration is finished, New Jersey's tall ship will shine and will be visiting many New Jersey ports in the years to come.
Executive Director Keenan, summed up the reason to have the ship restored in Maine. We decided on Maine because of the extensive knowledge base and skill set you have there for wooden boat restoration. We're delighted to be here."

Texto completo: Keep students safe by holding parents accountable
Following the recent shooting at a high school in Oxford, Michigan, debate over accountability has come to attention. The parents of the Oxford shooter, Ethan Crumbley, have pleaded not guilty to the four counts of involuntary manslaughter brought against them. Some people believe that the parents should not be held accountable for their son's actions, but I disagree.
It's widely reported that the day of the shooting, James and Jennifer Crumbley were brought into the high school after some concerning drawings and statements made by Ethan during class. The teen held a clean academic record, so he was allowed to go back to class. At no point during the meeting did the Cumbleys' inform the school that they had bought their son a pistol as a Christmas present. They also  allegedl y made no attempt to lock the firearm in a secure place. But should this mistake hold them accountable for the shooting?
Recalling all the evidence prior to the shooting that could have stopped this tragedy, it only makes sense to prosecute those who are accessories in crimes such as this. This trial proves to America that if someone wishes to possess a firearm, it is their responsibility to make sure it is secured. I believe criminal charges against those that fail to do so is the lawful thing to do to keep students safe.

The CMP corridor is not the clean energy project we need
Our message at the ballot box was loud and clear on Question 1, and I appreciate that Maine Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim suspended Central Maine Power's permit for the corridor until Avangrid's pending lawsuit is resolved. A judge ruled against CMP Thursday and will allow the referendum law to go into effect Sunday. I further urge Commissioner Loyzim to suspend CMP's permit until all court cases regarding the CMP corridor are resolved, including Black v. Cutko, the case dealing with the corridor's crossing of Maine public reserve lands.
I believe the CMP corridor was a flawed project from the beginning, with high voltage lines plowing through 53 miles of forests and disturbing streams and remote ponds, all in an effort to supply Massachusetts with Canadian power that upon closer inspection is not as "green" as promoted to be.
We need more truly clean energy transmitted by a more sensible grid that knits together diverse sources of clean power. It's heartening to witness the rapid growth of solar across the state and the recent advancements for offshore wind, as well as discussions of a reconfigured and reliable grid that serves Maine efficiently and effectively. These are projects that I can get behind.

Build Back Better would make historic climate investments
As a young Mainer, I recognize that my state is not perfectly set up for people in my age group. Maine is the oldest state by average age in the country, and we also have the highest percentage of rural residents of any state. For as long as I can remember, young people have been leaving Maine more often than staying, pursuing jobs and lifestyles in more connected regions of the country.
The Build Back Better Act represents a chance to turn this trend around. If passed, the bill would not only provide needed investment in climate solutions, but it would also create programs and infrastructure that would meaningfully improve everyday life for Maine residents. New investment in public transit that would connect Maine towns, a clean energy transition that would create quality jobs and attract investment, a Civilian Climate Corps that would create a new workforce dedicated to climate solutions, and electric vehicle incentives that would make electric cars and trucks more affordable for all Mainers. All this and more is within our grasp as long as our Congress members step up to support this historic legislation.
I'm grateful every day to live in the great state of Maine, and it brings me joy to envision a state that encourages young people to set down roots by improving access to clean energy jobs within the civilian climate corps and sustaining a clean energy economy. The Build Back Better Act would be a leap in the right direction.

Our message at the ballot box was loud and clear on Question 1, and I appreciate that Maine Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim suspended Central Maine Power's permit for the corridor until Avangrid's pending lawsuit is resolved. A judge ruled against CMP Thursday and will allow the referendum law to go into effect Sunday. I further urge Commissioner Loyzim to suspend CMP's permit until all court cases regarding the CMP corridor are resolved, including Black v. Cutko, the case dealing with the corridor's crossing of Maine public reserve lands. 
I believe the CMP corridor was a flawed project from the beginning, with high voltage lines plowing through 53 miles of forests and disturbing streams and remote ponds, all in an effort to supply Massachusetts with Canadian power that upon closer inspection is not as "green" as promoted to be.
We need more truly clean energy transmitted by a more sensible grid that knits together diverse sources of clean power. It's heartening to witness the rapid growth of solar across the state and the recent advancements for offshore wind, as well as discussions of a reconfigured and reliable grid that serves Maine efficiently and effectively. These are projects that I can get behind.

Justices grill Maine on policy denying tuition for religious schools

Texto completo: (JTA) Amy Coney Barrett, the newest justice on the Supreme Court, asked a Maine state official how he would treat a school that based its teachings about the “Jewish-Palestinian” conflict on how it regarded Jews.
Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, suggested the state’s school-funding policy poses an undue burden on Orthodox Jewish parents who send their children to religious day schools.
Their questions came Wednesday the 8th in an important church-state case challenging Maine’s ban on the use of state funds for tuition at religious schools, while subsidizing tuition in certain cases for non-religious private schools.
Church-state separation groups and conservative religious advocacy groups alike are closely watching Carson v. Makin, saying it could have far-reaching consequences for federal, state and local governments that ban funding for religious instruction.
Coney Barrett was seeking a clarification from Christopher Taub, the state’s chief deputy attorney general. He defended the state’s policy of not paying for tuitions at religious schools by saying that a state would also not fund schools that teach that a particular religion or all religions are bad.
“How would you even know if a school taught ‘All religions are bigoted or biased’ or ‘Catholics are bigoted’, or, you know, ‘we take a position on the Jewish-Palestinian conflict because of our position on, you know, Jews,’ right?” Barrett said.
Barrett’s hypothetical did not specify which position the school was taking, nor if its position on Jews was positive or negative. It did, however, seem to equate certain kinds of anti-religious bias with certain attitudes on what is more conventionally referred to as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Barrett, a Catholic conservative, appeared to be picking at Maine’s argument that the state’s policy was religion-neutral. She suggested that while religious schools are automatically denied the funding, the state would have to take proactive measures to assess whether non-religious schools are teaching bias.
The question is relevant because Maine’s argument notes that one of the two schools in the lawsuit that was denied funding requires ninth graders to “refute the teachings of the Islamic religion with the truth of God’s Word.”
Taub’s response was that the state is deeply engaged with the curricula in public schools and in the private schools that receive state-subsidized tuitions.
Maine is one of two states that allows parents in districts without a high school to use state funds to send their children to a private school rather than bus them to a school in a neighboring district. Religious schools are banned from using the funding, and two sets of parents have sued, saying the practice is unconstitutional.
Jewish groups have lined up on opposite sides in the case. In friend-of-the-court briefs, the Anti-Defamation League sided with Maine and the Orthodox Union supports the parents.

Texto completo: BASKETBALL
The Long Island Nets held the Maine Celtics scoreless in overtime until a last-second 3-pointer by Sam Hauser and ended Maine’s seven-game winning streak with a 97-95 victory Thursday night at the Expo.
Brodric Thomas led the Celtics with 26 points, including a 3-pointer that tied the game with 11.7 seconds left in regulation. Hauser finished with 15 points and nine rebounds.
AUTO RACING
FORMULA ONE: Mercedes ended the dispute over the Formula One season finale when it withdrew its appeal of the controversial finish that cost Lewis Hamilton a record eighth championship.
Mercedes had filed a pair of protests following Sunday’s race, in which a late crash at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix helped Max Verstappen beat Hamilton for the title. Both protests were dismissed and Mercedes then asked for reconsideration at the International Court of Appeal, a process that could have dragged into next year.
Mercedes was protesting the use of the safety car following a crash with five laps remaining. Hamilton had a nearly 12-second lead over Verstappen when the crash brought out the yellow flag.
Verstappen pitted for fresh tires while Hamilton stayed on track. The race director initially said lapped drivers could not pass the safety car, then reversed the call in a decision that allowed Verstappen to restart directly behind Hamilton with a lap remaining. Verstappen then passed Hamilton to win his first world championship.
COLLEGES
UMAINE: The University of Maine System has updated its COVID-19 safety protocols for indoor events to include children who are at least 5 years old.
Starting Jan. 4, anyone 5 or older must show proof of vaccination or a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend any event with more than 250 people. The policy applies to all indoor sporting events held at schools within the UMaine system, as well as UMaine games played at Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.
The updated guidance reflects a recent recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that children ages 5–11 receive COVID-19 vaccines.
SOCCER
MLS: Midfielder Sebastian Lletget was acquired by the New England Revolution from the LA Galaxy for $500,000 in 2022 and 2023 general allocation money.
A regular on the U.S. national team, the 29-year-old had spent the last seven seasons with the Galaxy and will reunite with New England Coach Bruce Arena, the former Galaxy coach.
ENGLAND: This weekend’s Premier League schedule was decimated as coronavirus outbreaks at clubs forced the postponement of five matches, taking the total amount of games wiped out over the past week to nine.
Adding to the postponement of the Manchester United-Brighton game on Saturday, the league said the following matches are also off: Southampton-Brentford, Watford-Crystal Palace, West Ham-Norwich (all Saturday) and Everton-Leicester (Sunday).
Only five league games remain to be played this weekend, with the growing number of infections among squads reflecting the worsening health emergency in Britain as the omicron variant spreads.
Two matches were played Thursday night. Liverpool won at home against Newcastle, 3-1, but said three players – Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho and Curtis Jones – were missing because of suspected positive tests for the virus.
Chelsea Manager Thomas Tuchel said Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Callum Hudson-Odoi were all unavailable for a 1-1 draw at home against Everton after positive tests. Ben Chilwell, who is out injured, also tested positive, and Kai Havertz was missing beacuse he felt unwell.
SPAIN: Real Madrid may have run into its toughest opponent of the season: COVID-19.
An outbreak of the virus has infected six Madrid players. The club said Thursday that Gareth Bale, Marco Asensio, Rodrygo, and backup goalkeeper Andriy Lunin were infected, a day after both midfielder Luka Modric and Marcelo tested positive.
The club did not mention the health status of any of those infected.
While Madrid made the outbreak public, the Spanish soccer federation said it was putting back into place a ban on shaking hands and other greetings as well as any tributes held before kickoff “as additional preventative measures given the rise in cases.”
The infections come with Madrid breezing toward the winter break with a commanding lead in the Spanish league.

Wave of TikTok threats puts Maine schools on high alert

Texto completo: Schools in central and southern Maine are expected to be on high alert Friday following a wave of threats posted to TikTok that warned of violence.
The TikTok videos claimed multiple school shootings will take place Friday.
Police said they did not believe the threats, most of which did not name specific schools, were credible. Still, many school officials in Maine and across the country said they were aware of the social media posts and were bolstering police presences at their schools.
TikTok is a social media application that allows users to create and share short videos.
Administrators from the Mt. Blue school district in Farmington, Wales-based Regional School Unit 4 and Brunswick, Yarmouth and Cumberland schools addressed their concerns Thursday in letters to the school communities.
“It appears that individuals far away from Maine have started yet another inappropriate use of the social media platform known as TikTok and they have succeeded in creating the hysteria they clearly desire,” Yarmouth Superintendent Andrew Dolloff wrote. “We have been in touch with local law enforcement and they have agreed that, while no threats have been made toward Yarmouth’s schools, they are going to increase their visibility and presence around our facilities tomorrow.”
The Cumberland and Brunswick school districts also expected to have heightened police presences Friday, according to messages written by superintendents. Both districts said local police have said there were no credible threats to their schools.
“Please know that our schools are safe places. We have protocols in place and that we work closely with local law enforcement,” Brunswick Superintendent Phil Potenziano wrote. “This continuous and deliberate attention to safety has been and continues to be a central priority for Brunswick. However, I would remind all school community members to be vigilant and report anything out of the ordinary to the police or the schools.”
Mt. Blue Superintendent Christian Elkington addressed the TikTok concern in a message that mostly addressed an unrelated threat from the middle school earlier this week.
“I want to assure everyone that your RSU 9 administration takes threats to our students, staff, school and district with the utmost importance,” Elkington wrote. “Lastly, please know that our administrators and School Resource Officer will be working from a higher level of concern over the next several days to hopefully ease concerns by helping our students and staff feel more secure in our schools.”
RSU 4 Superintendent Andrew Carlton said he had notified local police of the concern and asked that officers be at district schools Friday.
Shannon Moss, spokesperson for the state Department of Public Safety, said the Maine Information and Analysis Center, along with other fusion centers across the country, will continue to monitor online activity that might pose a threat. As of Thursday night, Moss said, there had been no credible threat made against any school in Maine.
The TikTok threats came two weeks after a school shooting in Michigan resulted in four student deaths. Maine schools have been on alert, with at least three districts canceling school over the past week.
Lewiston schools will be closed Friday due to an unrelated threat. While a social media threat from a student following an altercation at Lewiston Middle School was addressed by Lewiston police, school officials and city police decided to close all schools in the district as a precaution.
Times Record Staff Writer C. Thacher Carter and Portland Press Herald Staff Writer Dennis Hoey contributed to this report.

In “The lobster trap,” The Boston Globe and the Portland Press Herald zoomed in on a small island central to Maine’s signature industry, smack dab in the crosshairs of global climate change. Reporters immersed themselves in the lives of local lobstermen reckoning with change and struggling to plot a path into the future.
Here are seven key takeaways from the series:
1. The forces that sparked a lobster boom, and brought unprecedented prosperity to Maine lobstermen, can also take it all away.
The American lobster thrives in chilly waters between 54 and 64 degrees but can stay healthy up to 68 degrees. Long-term exposure to anything hotter spells serious trouble such as respiratory and immune system failure.
As ocean temperatures rise, the epicenter of the lobster population is shifting north to cooler waters. Right now the thermal sweet spot is off midcoast Maine, where Vinalhaven and Stonington lobstermen fish.
But scientists warn the good times won’t last: As warming continues, they predict the catch will decline by half within 30 years.
2. The Gulf of Maine, which stretches from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, is one of the fastest warming bodies of ocean water on the planet. And the pace is picking up: For the last 15 years, the gulf has warmed at seven times the global average.
Scientists say the shape and depth of the gulf are two factors. And the powerful currents that feed it, which influence its temperatures, are also changing, due to melting Arctic ice.
3. The potential loss of lobster in Maine is almost too big to comprehend. Lobster is a $1.4 billion industry in Maine, a critical economic foundation for its 3,400 miles of remote coastline. Lobster fishing employs 4,100 people directly and generates another 35,000 jobs for dock workers, dealers, truckers and processors, plus others in lobster-related businesses like trap making and boat building.
“When the fishermen do good, everybody does good,” said Vinalhaven captain Walt Day. “And if it’s a lean year, everybody has a lean year.”
Maine lobster accounts for 81 percent of all lobster caught in the U.S.
4. Vinalhaven and its island fishing culture is unique — but the threat it faces is the same one bearing down on all of us around the world.
Maine’s second busiest port is a working island of 1,200 people, 15 miles at sea, but its challenges aren’t dissimilar to those of countless cities and industries ― mining, logging and farming among them ― that are being forced to adapt to a warming climate.
5. Ocean warming is thrusting marine life into turmoil, and disruption is cascading up the coast.
The plankton that the North Atlantic right whale feeds on is averse to warming water and, like lobster, has shifted to cooler zones. The endangered whales have followed, putting them at greater risk of ship strikes and gear entanglements. As whale deaths multiply and extinction looms, the government is imposing stricter restrictions on fishermen to try and save the species.
6. In its quest to save the right whale, the U.S. government is considering steps that could transform the lobster industry within 10 years.
Regulators are closing off swaths of the ocean to traditional lobstering, and requiring captains to convert to so-called “ropeless” technology.
The goal is to protect whales from undersea entanglements by eliminating the vertical ropes that connect lobster traps on the sea floor to buoys on the surface. But the new high-tech gear is still being tested, and fishermen fear it won’t work as promised, and that its cost will force them out of business. Environmental advocates have urged the federal government to help subsidize the transition of the fishery to ropeless gear.
7. While Vinalhaven’s industry weathers immense change, other forces are silently shaping the island’s future.
By even the government’s most conservative projections, the Gulf of Maine will rise by at least 19 inches by 2050, breaching 30 homes and 20 businesses on the island’s Main Street.
As islanders plan and prepare for that threat, some are also trying to envision a future economy that depends less on fishing. They are experimenting with salt-water crops like kelp, and contemplating the unsettling prospect of a more robust tourist industry. “Do we want to become Camden, or Nantucket?’ they ask.
This island has embraced adaption before. When its thriving granite trade cratered in the 1900s, islanders turned to cod and haddock fishing. When those fisheries collapsed and poverty set in, they pivoted again, to lobstering.
Their track record suggests a deep resilience. “They can use their ingenuity,” said Sam Belknap, a community development officer with the Rockland-based Island Institute. “That’s what fishermen do.”

Texto completo: As usual, there’s bad news and there’s good news. The bad news is, there is no Moore’s Law for carbon-free energy production. The good news is, there IS a Wright’s Law for carbon-free energy production! A recent study points out that traditional economic models have consistently over-estimated the cost of renewables over time, and that a transition to carbon-free energy will happen with a net positive impact on the economy.
Some of our tech-savvy readers may have heard of Moore’s Law. This is a phenomenon in the progress of computer development where the number of transistors on a microchip doubles roughly every two years, thus doubling their computation ability – so the cost to do the same computation gets halved. This law has held true since the late 1960s when it was predicted by Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel Corporation. Since then, computing power has doubled about 23 times, a 10 million-fold increase. Your typical smartphone is quite literally millions of times more powerful than the world’s largest computers of the late 1960s. And thousands of times less expensive.
A physics student once asked me if there was something like Moore’s Law for energy. My response then was that there is not. I dug out a book I was given back in 1965, when I was 11, called “Man and Power.” It described the historical sources of energy and how they had changed over time: It talked about the dramatic shift in energy usage with James Watt’s development of an efficient steam engine and how it drove the industrial revolution. Then there was another shift in the early twentieth century with the internal combustion engine and the electrification of society.
But in terms of where we get our energy and how efficiently we use it, things did not look dramatically different in 1965 than they do today. Nuclear power did not grow at the rate predicted in the 1950s. The only significant renewable energy sources then were hydropower and biomass. Today there is wind and solar, but only about 4.5% of our energy comes from these. Yes, the costs of wind and solar are decreasing over time, but nothing so dramatic as Moore’s law.
But now for the good news: There is Wright’s Law. Applied to developing technologies, this law relates the amount of deployment of a certain technology to its cost. As deployment increases, the cost per unit decreases. In the case of solar, it turns out that for every doubling of the total amount deployed, there tends to be about a 20% decrease in cost per unit. (This is not to be confused with economy of scale which relates more to the size or scale of an individual project.)
A recent paper from The University of Oxford Institute for New Economic Thinking has used Wright’s law to make predictions on the cost of future deployment of wind and solar. Asserting, with documentation, that traditional economic models have consistently overestimated the cost of renewables over time, they show how Wright’s Law predicts that the cost of wind and solar will continue to decrease exponentially at these rates.
Not only do they predict that these costs will continue to decrease, but that it is possible to transition to a practically carbon-free energy world with a positive, not a negative, impact on economic growth. In fact, we could save 26 trillion dollars over the next 50 years if we shift our investments to these renewables going forward. In other words, we could transition to these renewables purely on economic grounds, even without the threat of climate change. They predict that with a rapid transition to these renewables we could achieve emissions reductions of 80% by 2040, which is well below the goals of the Paris Agreement of 2015.
There are, of course, vested interests that could well hold up such a transition: namely, the fossil fuel industry, which has a powerful lobbying contingent in high places. Policies are needed that put the interests of the planet before those of some corporations. For example, enacting a price on CO2 output and removing subsidies for fossil fuels would go a long way to pushing this transition. Facilitating electrical transmission infrastructure would definitely help, as society’s understanding of the need for this seems to lag far behind.
Policymakers can address these matters, including making certain that the transition is done in a just manner. Potentially disruptive effects of the transition such as the displacement of workers in the fossil fuel industries can and must be addressed, of course. Policy is a matter of political will and intention – there are many ways to help economies around the world to leapfrog over the use of polluting energy directly to renewables,p as they aspire to raise their standard of living to that of developed countries. We all just need to be on the same page – saving the planet – without conflict of interest.
In short, done properly, this transition will be good for our economy, developing countries’ economies, and everyone’s atmosphere.

Texto completo: AUBURN — Isaiah Lary, who vigorously fought the implementation of mask mandates throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and whose tenure was marked by frequent angry outbursts with his colleagues, has resigned his seat on the Androscoggin County Commission.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-28032584 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/Image20211216185903-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/Image20211216185903.jpg" />
His resignation letter was submitted Monday and announced to the commission Tuesday.
The Republican represented Lisbon, Sabattus and his hometown of Wales. He was completing the first year of his second term on the commission and was unopposed both times he ran for office.
Often operating as a caucus of one, Lary rarely sought consensus with his colleagues for his proposals and often saw his motions defeated by a 6-1 vote. His colleagues on the board had at times called his conduct, “grandstanding.”
In his brief and terse resignation letter, Lary expressed his frustration with his fellow commissioners.
“This commission has violated the Constitution, charter and bylaws and stood by and even supported state tyranny,” he wrote. “There is so much you could have done to uphold your oath. If you request examples, just look at the numerous statements I have made as a commissioner on the videos.”
“Effective immediately, I am resigning from my position as a county commissioner,” he wrote.
Sally Christner of Turner, a fellow Republican and frequent target of Lary’s attacks, including an attempt to remove her as chairwoman in September, praised him as “a strong and passionate voice” for his constituents.
She noted his proposal this year to increase the annual death benefit by more than $7,000 for Dawn Rancourt, the widow of Deputy David Rancourt, who died in the line of duty in 2006. The yearly benefit had not been increased since it was established in 2007 and Christner said the commissioners had never considered giving his widow a cost-of-living increase.
But Lary could also be counted on to vote against nearly every motion before the board, especially spending bills. He voted against the county budget, opposed giving county money to Western Maine Transportation Services, a popular mass transit system in the region, and voted no on approving minutes, adopting the treasurer’s report and the approval of payroll and the county warrants that paid the bills.
Christner even quipped at Wednesday’s meeting that it had been a while since she could announce that a vote passed unanimously.
Lary became a lightning rod for the anti-mask movement after trying several times to pass anti-mask resolutions and policies, including calling one of his proposals a health freedom policy, but all were rejected by his colleagues.
Lary was incensed by Gov. Janet Mills’ executive orders for mandatory masks, social distancing and other measures that forced some businesses to close. Calling Mills’ actions unconstitutional, he urged commissioners to file suit with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to challenge her authority.
Like they often did, commissioners disagreed.
Lary’s anti-mask rhetoric launched a recall effort to remove him from the commission. Spokesman for the group, former Androscoggin County Democratic Chairman Kiernan Majerus-Collins, said at the time that “his attacks on basic science and public health are an embarrassment to Androscoggin County.”
That effort eventually fizzled.
Commissioners did like his resolution in June in support of the protesters in Cuba, which passed, 5-2.
County Administrator Larry Post said county Republicans have 30 days to find a replacement for Lary from his district of Lisbon, Sabattus and Wales.

Texto completo: PARIS — After voting by a large margin at their Dec. 6 meeting to release students an hour early on Fridays following the holiday vacation break, SAD 17’s board of directors scheduled a special meeting for Dec. 10 to rescind the measure. Instead, the board voted to change the early release time on Wednesdays from one hour earlier to two.
The extra hour will be protected time against training, administrative meetings, and other events, providing instructional staff with opportunities for individual and group planning and preparation, improvement of the online classroom spaces, and any work-related activities selected by the classroom-based instructional staff. School staff may also request to use the protected time for meetings with supervisors to review teacher goals.
Child care will continue to be provided in all elementary schools through their regular dismissal times in support of the early release.
Superintendent Dr. Monica Henson had requested providing educators with the extra hour in response to continued COVID-related absences and other disruptions. District-wide many teachers become responsible for twice as many classes during times that their colleagues are in quarantine and ed techs are pulled from their regular classroom duties to substitute teach elsewhere.
The final vote Friday evening to rescind the plan for Friday early release and change the schedule for Wednesday early release was 12-4.

FAIRFIELD — Thirty-four communities across Maine will be tested for environmental pollutants associated with serious health conditions, after the so-called “forever chemicals” were found in chicken eggs and deer meat harvested in the Fairfield area.
The state’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention hasn’t said the exact sites that will be tested, but they include Westbrook, Windham, Gorham, Auburn and Skowhegan, The Portland Press Herald reported Tuesday.
In addition to Fairfield, testing is already taking place in Leeds, Presque Isle, Chelsea, Unity Township, Benton, Bowdoinham and Knox, the newspaper reported.
These per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are used in products like nonstick cookware, carpets, firefighting foam and fast-food wrappers.
Authorities are working to understand how these chemicals make their way through the ecosystem and into the water and food supply after farmers spread municipal and industrial sludge that contained the chemicals as fertilizer.
State CDC toxicologist Dr. Andrew Smith urged Mainers not to overreact to the reports of PFAS in eggs at two homesteads in Fairfield, the newspaper reported.
“Everywhere we’ve worked so far are places where this is a known source that’s resulted in water that’s fairly high” in contamination, Smith said.
In October, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a broad new strategy to regulate PFAS, which have been associated with serious health conditions, including cancer and reduced birth weight.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Maine’s 126,842 military veterans and active-duty service members are at risk of being targeted by scammers. According to a new AARP report, veterans, the military, and their families are nearly 40% more likely to lose money to scams and fraud than the civilian population. Additionally, 4 out of 5 military/veteran adults were targeted by scams directly related to their military service or the benefits they receive.
Scammers often use military jargon and specific government guidelines to craft an effective pitch to steal money from military members and veterans. One in three military/veteran adults reported losing money to these types of service-related scams.
To make scams easier to spot, AARP’s Fraud Watch Network recommends signing up for the National Do Not Call Registry and using a call-blocking service. Additional measures include: using strong and unique passwords for each online account; using two-factor authentication when available; and placing a free security freeze on credit reports at each of the three major credit bureaus. Also, veterans never have to pay for their service records or earned benefits—if told otherwise, it’s a scam.
There are resources out there to help: Operation Protect Veterans—a joint program of the AARP Fraud Watch Network and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service—helps Maine’s veterans, service members, and their families to protect against fraud. The Fraud Watch Network also offers biweekly fraud alerts and a free helpline (877-908-3360) through which veterans, the military, and the public can report suspected scams.

Texto completo: WOODSTOCK — In just her second year of hunting Aleah Mack nailed it. By shooting a turkey, deer, moose and bear during the 2021 season she has claimed the grand slam, a feat that most hunters go a lifetime without completing.
Even the chance to go for the grand slam is a gamble requiring nothing but luck. This year Maine’s Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department awarded 3,480 through a lottery that drew more than 72,000 applicants. Aleah’s name was picked and the family made plans to spend a week at Rose Lake Camps in northern Maine, the same place where her older sister Lexi shot her first moose in 2014.
Aleah’s went hunting for the first time last year after completing her hunting safety course through 4H camp at Bryant Pond. She said when she went out with her grandfather, Rick Mack, she found it a bit nerve wracking. She was not sure if she would see anything. When she does, sometimes she gets a little excited.
“She was a little impatient, if you know what I mean,” said Rick. “We had the most fun turkey hunting last spring, calling them in. Sometimes they’d go right around us. It might take an hour and a half before we could get a shot.
“She got a deer last fall. We do all our own cutting and she’s been helping with that for years. So she was able to skin her own deer.”
This year, with moose permit secured, Aleah got her turkey and then shot a young black bear on her first day out. It was the first bear she ever saw in the woods.
The moose she got was a young bull, which again luck played into, just slightly. The weather when they were at Ross Lake was warmer than usual so there was not a lot of activity in the woods, but more hunters looking for opportunity. She took down the moose on the very last day of their hunting trip.
Rick has got close to his own grand slam during a couple of seasons but came up short. His Midas touch seems to be in teaching the women in his family efficient hunting skills. His wife Lisa is a hunter as well as all three of their girls. One daughter narrowly missed out on the grand slam in 2009. Like Aleah, Lexi got her grand slam at the age of 11 in her second year of hunting.
To Rick’s chagrin, his three grandsons have not shown much interest in hunting, although Lisa added that one may join in so it is not just the girls getting all the trophy glory.
At the time of the Macks’ interview there was still time to do more hunting. Aleah had one more tag she could use with a muzzle loader if she chooses, although she has never shot with one.
Next up, for sure, is to get back outside and hit the lakes for ice fishing season.

REGION — Picture this: 11:30 p.m., the night before Farmington’s Chester Greenwood Day; one Kay Neufeld (me) is hunched over a counter, frantically trying to transform green M&Ms and pretzel sticks into trees; her body is covered head to finger to toe in flavorless frosting.
At the time, I expected that would be the moment that stuck with me most during my first Chester Greenwood Day, held in Farmington Saturday, Dec. 4. But that would discount the rest of my adventure, from winding through the crowds of an ear-muff filled downtown Farmington and a conversation with Gov. Janet Mills to a swim in the coldest water I’ve ever had the displeasure of submerging in.
Leading up to the event, I had decided my number one activity for the day would be to compete in the Gingerbread House Building Competition, put on by the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce. It would be the first gingerbread house I had ever built.
At the time, I was envisioning a “Great British Bake Off” moment where I present and wax poetic about my vision for the creation.
Local artisans Emma Schurink and John Nichols, my partners in crime for the competition, quickly COVID-19 reality checked me that it was going to be a virtual competition.
When I expressed that I was “in it to win it” — which I repeated countless times over the course of the weekend — John also gave me another reality check. In previous years, he said, it has been an incredibly competitive competition where people spend days, even weeks on their creations. I couldn’t fathom people spending that much time on a house of cookies. But John confirmed that he’s dedicated that amount of time and more on his gingerbread creations.
I was dragged back down to Earth. Here, among the dreamless, I accepted my fate and decided to just have fun. I would not stress about winning (for the most part).
We decided a ski cabin would be our ticket in to the “Vacationland fun” theme.
The next night, the three of us met at Hannaford to buy our supplies. After a lengthy search, we bought enough ginger bread building materials to create (or feed) a whole ski village. We had a pre-made gingerbread house and a gingerbread village, Hershey’s bars, gum drops, Twizzlers, tinfoil wrapped chocolate snowmen, Nilla wafers, sprinkles, coconut flakes, sugar, sugar and sugar.
After spending $60, I realized I might have gone a bit overboard. My editor was certainly not enthused. But I knew it would be worth it. We reconvened a half an hour later at John and Emma’s house.
I, a newcomer to gingerbread house building, underestimated how hard it would be when it was time to get to work. We spent 40 minutes alone gluing the houses together. It was likely even longer because I had skipped the part where you read the instructions and accidentally mixed up all of the pieces.
After ample time sorting and re-sorting, I couldn’t even get the houses to stick together with the frosting. Emma and John, both woodworkers, swooped in and saved the day. Though they are my friends, I might have invited them to compete on my team with the selfish intention to get builders on my team.
I felt the constructing took an exceedingly long time. And then came the monstrous decorating. The remaining three hours were spent trying to make the sweets look like an actual village. We had a ski mountain and we envisioned a ski lift carrying the little chocolate snowmen. That turned into a rope tow. We envisioned trees made out of pretzel sticks and green frosting. Those ended up falling over and staining green on the pristine white frosting-snow. Much of the evening went like that. White frosting rushed down the mountain slope, past the village’s cardboard base, and coated the floor. The frosting bag kept getting jammed. The gingerbread house came in a package missing a chunk of the wall.
Around 10 p.m., Emma and John called it quits. They claimed it was because they had to work one of the Chester Greenwood Day crafts fair the next morning. But I anticipated it was because they knew we had hit a dead end and it wasn’t going to get any better.
Ever determined, I began working tirelessly. I was desperate to make the village a little less shabby looking. It wasn’t all that shabby, I suppose. But I was anticipating some fierce competition. I decorated the houses with more frosting until the bag broke and exploded all over me. I frantically tried several different ways to make trees — a ski slope needs trees!
I gave myself a cut off of 11:00 p.m., at which point I’d be hands in the air, “Bake Off” style. 11:00 p.m. came and went and at 11:30 p.m. I tore myself away, throwing my hands into the air and whispering “okay baker, your time is up.”
“It is what it is,” I thought. “At least it’s over and done with.”
I cleaned up the kitchen as quietly as I could and dragged myself home. I returned the next morning bright and early to add the finishing touches and take pictures to post. The competition, this year, would be hosted via Facebook where the person with the most amount of likes wins.
The FCCOC stated that the deadline was 10 a.m. At 9:40 a.m., I decided to add the trees I had made and stuck in the fridge the night before. At 9:50 a.m., I decided to try and bring the house outside to take some pictures with an aesthetically-pleasing background. At 9:55 a.m., I decided the submission needed a lavish description to go with it. Thirty seconds to go, I submitted our creation with trembling fingers.
Our final submission was a “small chunk” of a ski resort based on the ski mountains of Franklin County. Snowpeople scattered the property, some on skis made out of pieces of Hershey’s chocolate bars with candy-cane poles. The roads were paved with Nilla wafers. The snow was covered in coconut flakes. The last-minute trees, M&Ms coated in green frosting and stuck to pretzel sticks, really did tie it all together. It was a masterpiece.

The caption reads:
Welcome to Le Montagne, Maine’s premier ski resort — inspired by the many slopes of Franklin County. The snowpeople of Maine travel far and wide for Le Mont’s pristine white peaks and picturesque views.
Pictured is the bunny hill and some of the premier chalets, chateaus and bungalows — just one sugary chunk of Le Mont’s vast property. Snowpeople interested in visiting or learning more about Le Mont can reach out to the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce.
I was pretty proud of myself for that one.
With the gingerbread building over and done with, I headed to downtown Farmington to dive into a sea of earmuffs, locals and floats. When I rounded the corner near Main Street, I realized I had completely forgotten to get a pair of earmuffs. I couldn’t decide on which kooky design to get the earmuffs in, so I didn’t order a pair at all.
But I got lucky: nearly every shop that lined the block had piles of their own stock.
I went with a pair that looped around the back of your head, rather than a pair with a headband that gives you a headache. It was the most creative take I’d seen on a pair of earmuffs. And the first time I had worn them since I was 10 years old.
The parade itself was fun. The floats were decked out. The onlookers were excited. At one point I ran to the center of the parade to ask the paraders themselves how they were doing. It was pretty thrilling to walk in the center of it — ‘feh,’ to the consequences!
After a flag raising ceremony, I got to speak with Gov. Janet Mills, a Farmington native who was in attendance (and donning a pair of cheetah print earmuffs).
As a cub reporter, this was probably the most high-profile person I’ve interviewed in my career to date. I gassed myself up before introducing myself and squealed excitedly when I walked away. I had to resist the urge to grill her on some more serious questions for other stories I’m working on. My gut told me not to risk getting on her bad side since it was only the first time meeting her. I told myself there’d eventually be another opportunity to ask in what I’m sure will be my prolific career.
Following the parade, I headed home for a break and to write up a feature for the Sun Journal. While I was supposed to be writing, I began campaigning for the contest.
Truthfully, Dear Reader, I asked every family member, friend, distant acquaintance and barista I knew to go and vote for our ski village. It felt like cheating, but I was “in it to win it,” remember?
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-28015022" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/DSCN7059.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="308" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/DSCN7059.jpg" />
I figured this would be the end of my day, gingerbread politics and writing. And then, 20 minutes before 3 p.m., I spontaneously threw on my swimsuit and headed to Clearwater Lake in Industry for the “Polar Bear Dip.”
On the ride there, I tried to convince myself I’d be okay because I’ve gone swimming in the coastal waters of Maine during off season. I’m warm blooded, I repeated over and over again.
I walked up to the lake with trepidation and excitement for the thrill. I briefly chatted with a whole crew of men who had been doing the icy dip for around 35 years (there was no consensus) since it first started in the mid-1980s.
Their excitement rubbed off on me. “Alright, let’s get going,” one member of the group yelled. No announcer or horn, I suppose. They marched right into the lake and laughed gleefully.
I, on the other hand, stood at the lake’s edge until nearly everyone had gone in. I was busy contemplating my life choices and decision making skills. Finally, I went for it. It wasn’t so bad at first. In fact, I could have stayed in at least a couple minutes. But then I dunked my head — because I am going to commit if I set out to do something. Pins and needles rushed up my arms. My survival instincts kicked in and I rushed out of the water.
On the shore, I ripped the warm change of clothes out of my bag, but I was shaking so hard I couldn’t get my socks on my feet, my feet in my boots.
Staff writer Pam Harnden came up to me to ask me some questions. Looking back on it, I don’t remember anything I said. All I remember is the cold.
Once fully dressed, someone informed me it was 30 degrees Fahrenheit outside and 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the water. Though I rushed out, I was proud of myself for dunking; for going in, at all.
<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-28015034" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/IMG_1868.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="337" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/IMG_1868.jpg" />
I drove home in my car with a heating system that had broken a few weeks prior and contemplated my life choices once again. Following a scalding hot shower at home, I opened Facebook and realized I was in a strong lead for the gingerbread contest with 29 likes.
Though the winners would not be named until Monday, Dec. 13, I declared my team the winner on Sunday, Dec. 5. I’m going to level with you, Dear Reader: there was only one other adult entry and our group creation was by far and large the superior (sorry, fellow competitor).
I did contemplate whether or not I’d have won if there was some stiff competition. But I don’t care enough to ruminate on it — I’m a winner, baby! It was nice to get $25 chamber bucks. But really, I was in it for the bragging rights. And it was well worth it. That pride and glory will last me a lifetime.
Today, “Le Mont” sits in Emma and John’s backyard, where a squirrel has been periodically munching away on it. I just hope he doesn’t get sick. The unethical campaigning, I’m willing to do. But even in the name of victory, killing a squirrel might cross a line.

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — Mt. Blue School District (RSU 9) has received two grants to serve its homeless students totaling around $32,941.6, Cape Cod Hill School Principal Lisa Sinclair reported to the Board of Directors during the Tuesday, Dec. 14, meeting.
Sinclair is the liaison for the McKinney-Vento Act, a federal law that requires public school districts to identify homeless or housing-insecure youth in their student populations and then provide them with specific services.
Sinclair told the board there are 29 homeless students in the district. Thirteen housing insecure students are at the Kindergarten through fifth grade level, six are in the middle school and 10 are in the high school.
Students are considered “homeless” if they are “doubled up with friends or relatives due to loss of housing or economic hardship,” “living in a shelter,” “living in motels/hotels,” “living outside or in cars,” “migratory students that qualify,” or “living in RV’s/tents in cold weather.”
Young people without stable housing have also told the Franklin Journal that they prefer the term “housing insecure” over “homeless.”
According to the Maine Department of Education, schools are required under the McKinney-Vento Act to provide services which include but are not limited to: a guarantee that housing-insecure youth can remain enrolled at their school even if they are not currently living in the district; educational services; transportation services to and from school and school-sponsored events; and referrals for the entire family to health care services such as health, dental and mental health treatment.
Sinclair said that the law and the district’s new grants are “important … because: one, it’s the law; two, it’s the right thing to do for our students; and three, if students are in crisis, they are not available to learn.”
The district has received two grants: $9,000 from the “American Rescue Grant for Homeless I” and $23,492 from “the American Rescue Plan Homeless Children and Youth II grant,” Sinclair said.
The first grant “is for any expenses necessary to facilitate the identification, enrollment retention or educational success of our homeless students,” Sinclair said.
So far, $2,o00 of the $9,000 has been spent “largely on supplying kiddos with immediate needs that they have,” Sinclair added.
In the second grant from the American Rescue Plan Act, Sinclair told the board that the Department of Education advises the district use the money “to train points of contact [staff] at each school in our district so we can better identify and support kiddos at the school level.”
The grant can also be spent on building food pantries, clothing closets and other services that can meet the needs of housing insecure students, she said.
Sinclair ended her presentation by stating that “the percentage of State of Maine kiddos that are homeless is 1.1%. And with us at 29, we are right on that mark at 1.1%.”
However, the correspondence between the statewide and district percentages do not necessarily account for housing-insecure students who have not yet been identified at Mt. Blue. According to a study, it also does not reflect the specific number of housing-insecure people, youth statewide and specifically those in rural areas such as Franklin County. It also overlooks the differences between rural and urban experiences.
Preble Street published a study in 2015 titled “Conducting an Accurate Count of Rural Homeless Youth.” It finds rural states such as Maine are missing out on a large portion of the housing-insecure youth population. This is especially true in rural regions, authors Jon Bradley and Thomas Chalmers McLaughlin write.
This is because the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts point-in-time (PIT) counts of housing-insecure people “at shelters and where they may be found on the street.”
This, authors say, is problematic because there are only three youth shelters in the entire state. Locally, there is no longer a homeless shelter in Franklin County after the Western Maine Homeless Outreach shelter shut down in March 2020.
Through interviews and data collection, “the Maine Youth Count discovered large numbers of youth who were unstably housed and missing from” the PIT counts.
“Many individuals in rural communities who are struggling with housing are not included in the federal point-in-time counts,” the study states.
Additionally, the PIT counts do not capture “meaningful counts of youth” who “tend to double up with friends or other family members while the HUD definition only counts those who are in shelters or on the street” as homeless.
“The number of youth found in the study indicates a true estimate of unstably housed and homeless youth in Maine to be many times greater than previously documented,” the study concludes. “The data suggests the current point-in-time method of counting youth who are homeless does not accurately estimate the nature or extent of homelessness among youth.”
However, Sinclair said during the meeting that the corresponding figures “tells me that we’re doing a good job at identifying our kiddos.”
“And now we just need to expand our supports for them,” she concluded.
During discussion, directors asked Sinclair about the specific services the school is providing, the school’s collaborations with local advocacy organizations for housing insecure youth, outreach to youth, mentorship services, and how the students without essential amenities are being cared for during winter.
Director Kirk Doyle asked how the district would “identify folks that might fall into this [homeless] category.”
“Is there anything that we can do … to show to students that there are resources available if they [found] themselves in that spot? Or if they know somebody that’s in that spot that maybe is shy to speak up?” Doyle asked.
Sinclair responded that “education is going to be key” so that students know that they won’t get in trouble, be kicked out of school if the district learns they are doubled up or living outside of the district.
“I think maybe destigmatizing so that students feel comfortable expressing that they have a need,” Sinclair added. “It’s just kind of being aware and building relationships [between counselors, teachers] with kids such that they’ll be willing to come to us with the needs that they have.”
In addition, Sinclair mentioned earlier in the presentation that she had implemented a “housing questionnaire” at the back of students’ back-to-school packets. This resulted in classifying an additional 11 students as housing insecure, she said.
According to DOE data acquired by the Franklin Journal, RSU 9 had eight students across the entire district registered under “Homeless counts by night-time residence” in April 2021. That number had previously been around 25-30 students in April 2020.
Director Cherieann Harrison said she was “concerned” about the categories of homelessness, particularly in a line from the report that said “some [housing-insecure students] have inadequate housing (no heat/water).” She asked what support the district is offering.
Sinclair said that the solution was for “destigmatizing, because those are families in need, who may not feel comfortable in sharing that.”
“It goes back to building relationships with our community members, and reaching out to them, often with ‘we’re here to support,'” Sinclair said.
Sinclair did not provide concrete plans for providing support to housing-insecure students without heat or electricity or collaborations with local housing-insecure youth advocacy organizations such as the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies.
Director Doug Dunlap also suggested that students be provided mentors.
“Is there an adult who can shepherd them through this process?” Dunlap asked.
Sinclair said she hopes to use the ARPA funding to create “points of contact at each building level.”
“Right now, there’s me, but I’m not in each building and the kiddos don’t know me, you know, other than my kiddos,” Sinclair said. “So we need a point of contact at each building that the kiddos know and know who to go to.”

New England’s getting hammered by COVID-19 these days.
Only two states — Rhode Island and New Hampshire — have a higher infection rate than Maine, where the disease is slamming rural counties. Connecticut and Massachusetts are also in the top six.
Three Maine counties are among the six worst counties in the nation for having the most cases per 100,000 residents in the last seven days, according to The New York Times’ tracker. Franklin County is coping with the fourth highest rate of new infections in the country.
It’s no surprise that soaring infection rates — they’ve nearly doubled in the past two weeks in Maine — have led to a new high for the number of Mainers on ventilators at the state’s hospitals.
The Maine Center of Disease Control & Prevention also announced Thursday that 27 more Mainers have died of the disease, most of them added to the tally after a review of November vital records. Four of them were from Androscoggin County and three were from either Franklin or Oxford counties.
A Flourish bar chart race
This news comes before a single case of the fast-spreading omicron variant has been detected in Maine.
Dr. Nirav Shah, the head of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention said it is “just a matter of time” before the variant turns up in the state. He told a briefing Thursday the agency is acting on the assumption it is “already here.”
Though unvaccinated people make up only a quarter of Maine’s 1.3 million people, they constitute two-thirds of the people in critical care units in the state’s hospitals, Shah said, and “80% or 90%” of those on ventilators.
The counties in Maine with the best vaccination rates are also posting far better overall case numbers than the ones such as Franklin, Aroostook and Piscataquis counties that are among the nation’s hardest-hit places in recent days.
The best thing individuals can do to protect themselves, Shah said, is get vaccinated. It is also, he said, “increasingly important” to get a booster shot as well, once they become eligible.
The booster “restores the performance of the vaccine to a strong level,” Shah said and is an important tool to keep COVID-19 at bay, or at least minimize its impact, if a fully vaccinated person comes down with a case.
It’s not all bleak news, however.
Shah bemoaned that, “sometimes I just feel like a perpetual thrower of wet blankets,” before touting growing success in getting more people vaccinated.
“We are continuing to make strong progress on vaccines,” Shah said.
He said the number of daily doses given each day in Maine has reached the high levels seen last May, in large part because people are seeking boosters six months after their eligibility.
There’s still a lot of room for improvement.
Shah said that about 40% of the population older than 18 has gotten a booster, which leaves tens of thousands of people who got vaccinated not yet boosted as well.
“We’ve got more work to do on the booster front,” Shah said.

The U.S. Alpine Championships are returning to Sugarloaf in 2022, the resort announced Thursday.
The Alpine Championships and NorAm Finals will be at Sugarloaf from March 20-April 1. This year’s Alpine championships, which feature many of the U.S. Ski Team’s top racers, will take place a month after the conclusion of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games in Beijing, China, and are expected to feature Olympians vying for national championships.
This is the eighth time the Carrabassett Valley resort has hosted the Alpine Championships, and the first time since 2019.
“Sugarloaf has been a great partner for decades,” Lindsay Arnold, U.S. Ski & Snowboard Event Director, said in a news release. “Their hospitality in welcoming the ski racing community is unmatched. We are thrilled they are hosting not only the Toyota U.S. Alpine Championships but also welcoming back the NorAm Finals. We look forward to a great two weeks of watching the top North American athletes compete.”
Among the skiers expected to compete in the Alpine Championships is Sam Morse, who grew up in Carrabassett Valley and graduated from Carrabassett Valley Academy, which is based at Sugarloaf. Morse currently is on the U.S. Ski Team’s Alpine B team.
In 2019, Ryan Cochran-Siegle won the men’s downhill and super-G championships, while Luke Winters claimed the men’s combined title. Alice Merryweather won the women’s downhill, Nina O’Brien took first in the super-G and Keely Cashman was the women’s combined champion.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — All public schools will be closed Friday because of a threat to the middle school posted to social media, Superintendent Jake Langlais advised Thursday evening.
The person responsible has been identified and Lewiston police are investigating, he said.
“This is out of an abundance of caution as LPD has neutralized the situation,” Langlais wrote. “We will ensure we have all the information together before opening schools back up.”
Students reported seeing a post on social media late Thursday, which allowed school administrators and the police to quickly take action.
According to Lewiston police Lt. Derrick St. Laurent, the post may have stemmed from an altercation at the school Thursday.
“This is a reminder to all — if you see something, say something,” Langlais wrote. “Students did today, and it allowed administration and LPD to follow up.”
An anonymous threat of school violence happening Friday circulated on TikTok has school districts across the nation on edge, and many superintendents have written messages to parents addressing the concern.
Wales-based Regional School Unit 4 Superintendent Andrew Carlton wrote: “Please know that this Tik Tok trend/comment/sensation has been investigated by US law enforcement officials at all levels and has been found NOT to be credible at this time!” Carlton wrote Thursday.
The Lewiston threat does not appear to be related to the video shared on TikTok.
Several nearby districts have dealt with similar threats of school violence in the past week. Rumford-based RSU 10 closed schools Tuesday after intruders took over the online school board meeting Monday night and threatened the school. School officials from RSU 4 canceled school Dec. 10 due to an abundance of caution after a threat was made against Oak Hill Middle School.
Additionally, school officials addressed a threat made to Mt. Blue middle school earlier this week in a Thursday memo. Officials found the threat was not credible.
Langlais was unavailable for further comment Thursday evening.

Texto completo: NORWAY — The pandemic roller coaster continues in Maine, two years after the coronavirus was first detected.
Just in the last seven days, Oxford County has reported 463 cases of COVID-19, according the Maine Center for Disease Control’s website.
The influx of hospitalizations throughout Maine has made it necessary to transfer regular patient rooms to COVID wards, causing potential peril to patients with other serious medical conditions and disruptions of both inpatient and outpatient procedures.
The Portland Press Herald reported over the weekend that Stephens Memorial Hospital’s emergency department was so overwhelmed by COVID that cars carrying the ill stretched through the parking lot because it had no capacity to admit new patients.
<img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-27911993" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/27911744_20211209_rural-hospital_4-1024x695.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="695" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/27911744_20211209_rural-hospital_4.jpg" />
Gov. Janet Mills has deployed dozens of National Guard to hospitals throughout the state, including SMH.
The Oxford Hills school district, which saw a lull in student quarantines following the Thanksgiving holiday is once again spiking due to exposures. As of Tuesday, Paris Elementary, Otisfield Community and Oxford Hills Middle schools accounted for 197 quarantined students and staff and 29 of the district’s 52 positive cases.
Otisfield in particular was buckling: 69 of the school’s 116 students were reported to be in isolation. By Wednesday administrators moved to take all students to remote learning. The school is expected to reopen Jan. 5, following the Christmas break.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-16099898 size-large" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2020/03/otisfield-comm-school-4.2.20-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/otisfield-comm-school-4.2.20.jpg" />
The delta variant of COVID has hospitals scrambling now but the threat of another, omicron, is on Maine’s threshold: cases have been reported in Massachusetts to the south and Quebec to the north, where the Canada/Maine border only recently reopened.
Vaccinations against COVID are on the increase as well, mostly in the form of booster shots. The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for children between the ages of 5-11. Teens aged 16 and 17 were also added to the list of those eligible for boosters as of Dec. 9.
The Maine CDC reported that by Saturday almost 70% of Maine’s eligible population has been vaccinated and more than 370,000 have received boosters. But as positivity rates continue to climb and more seek protection from shot, demand for tests and appointments are following suite.
Oxford County vaccination rates lag behind other Maine counties; positivity rates in Oxford have exceeded 20% some days with no improvement in sight.
Vaccinations continue to be offered at retail pharmacies throughout Oxford Hills. Central Maine Healthcare is holding walk-in vaccination clinics at the Auburn Mall Tuesdays through Fridays from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.
The Portland Press Herald has reported that 700 doses of the vaccine are being administered each day at the Auburn Mall.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Maine’s 126,842 military veterans and active-duty service members are at risk of being targeted by scammers. According to a new AARP report, veterans, the military, and their families are nearly 40% more likely to lose money to scams and fraud than the civilian population. Additionally, 4 out of 5 military/veteran adults were targeted by scams directly related to their military service or the benefits they receive.
Scammers often use military jargon and specific government guidelines to craft an effective pitch to steal money from military members and veterans. One in three military/veteran adults reported losing money to these types of service-related scams.
To make scams easier to spot, AARP’s Fraud Watch Network recommends signing up for the National Do Not Call Registry and using a call-blocking service. Additional measures include: using strong and unique passwords for each online account; using two-factor authentication when available; and placing a free security freeze on credit reports at each of the three major credit bureaus. Also, veterans never have to pay for their service records or earned benefits—if told otherwise, it’s a scam.
There are resources out there to help: Operation Protect Veterans—a joint program of the AARP Fraud Watch Network and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service—helps Maine’s veterans, service members, and their families to protect against fraud. The Fraud Watch Network also offers biweekly fraud alerts and a free helpline (877-908-3360) through which veterans, the military, and the public can report suspected scams.

Texto completo: NORWAY — The Select Board on Thursday evening accepted nearly $8,000 from donations, the sale of scrap metal and criminal forfeitures.
The Acts of Kindness Foundation, a nonprofit arm of Daddy O’s restaurant in Oxford, donated $2,500 to assist needy residents who are not eligible for General Assistance funds.
“It is extremely important to us that no one be turned away should they fall between the cracks of the government’s requirements,” according to a letter accompanying the donation. “We want no one to be judged, just simply helped, with the assumption that they are asking because they truly have a need.”
Restaurant co-owners Aaron and Amanda Ouellette of Mechanic Falls have also presented $2,500 each to Paris and Oxford.
The board accepted $1,000 from New Balance shoe manufacturing company to provide portable heaters at the town ice rink. The company has a factory in Norway.
The Office of the Maine Attorney General gave the town $2,678 from a criminal forfeiture. Police Chief Robert Federico recommended the money be placed in the drug prevention account.
Lastly, the town earned $1,768.78 from the sale of scrap metal from the old highway garage. Highway Foreman Art Chappell had asked that it be put in the safety account.
The four donations totaled $7,946.78.
Town Manager Dennis Lajoie announced that Code Enforcement Officer Scott Tabb has submitted his resignation. His last day is Dec. 29.
Four residents in the area of Yagger Road expressed frustration with neighbors who moved in a couple of months ago on property owned by family members and are reportedly living in a trailer.
The four said there was an explosion on the site after midnight Dec. 10 and complained of activity before sunrise, which one described as the grinding of metal with generators running at all hours of the night. A walking path in the area no longer feels safe, they added.
Officials are working to address the issue through policing and code enforcement. Federico said his officers have been on the property at least a dozen times but found no criminal violations.
Any potential code issues are being addressed by Tabb.
Officials said they understood the frustration, but nothing could be done immediately.
“We need something concrete to move on,” Federico said, adding the investigation is ongoing.
The board approved an application for a BYOB event the the American Legion hall at 212 Main St. A Valentine Masquerade Ball and Dinner is planned at at 5 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 5.
Also approved were requests from Central Maine Power for poles at Pleasant Street and Abbott Road and a sec0nd pole at Solon Street and Paris Street.
Lajoie provided a list of members on the committee and subcommittees for the upcoming visioning and comprehensive plan, which the board approved.

GLASTONBURY, Conn. – Elizabeth “Beth” Ann (McAllister) McCashland, 81 of Glastonbury, Conn., passed away on Monday, Dec. 13, 2021. She was born to the late Gerald and Muriel (Marston) McAllister on Nov. 7, 1940 and grew up on Judson Street in Mechanic Falls.
Beth attended Central Maine General School of Nursing in Lewiston, class of 1962, and was a registered nurse working at Central Maine General Hospital in Lewiston, New Britain General Hospital and St. Francis Hospital, both in Connecticut, over the course of her 38-year career.
She met John Arthur McCashland on a blind date while in nursing school after swearing off men. They married on leap day, Feb. 29, 1964 – she let him pick the date. She became a mother in December 1965 to Catherine May and again in October 1976 to Judith Ann, Johanna Beth, Jean Catherine and Gerald Glenn. She raised her family with John until his abrupt passing at the young age of 47, then continued to raise them on her own, switching to working nights so she could be home during the day for them and never letting on how indescribably difficult it must have been without Dad, while having the patience of a saint with all of us.
She was active in her community over the years, teaching Sunday School at South Congregational Church in East Hartford, Conn., a member of the Welcome Rebekah Lodge #47 for over 30 years and, of late, attending bingo at the Glastonbury Community Center – which she always looked forward to, even if she did not win. She was also an active member of Twin Mothers of Connecticut, which later became Mothers of Multiples for obvious reasons, serving on the national board and attending their yearly national conferences. She turned these conferences into family vacations – except for the time in New Orleans, when she left us behind with relatives. Beth was an avid fan of the UConn Women’s basketball team, and loved bowling, playing bingo, and animals.
She loved her family so very much and enjoyed every minute with them, especially her grandchildren.
She is predeceased by her parents; brother, Charles McAllister and sister, Ovis Pooler-Billington; husband, John; and son, Gerald Glenn.
Mourning her passing are daughters Cathy Gerke and her husband Christopher of Amston, Conn., Judith Gass and her husband Travis of Brewer, Johanna McCashland of Glastonbury, Conn. with whom she made her home, and Jean Mumley and her husband Scott of South Windsor; along with grandson, John Gerke, and granddaughters Ashley and Mary Catherine Mumley. She also leaves several nieces, nephews; and dear friends.
She has had so many health setbacks over the past 15 years, but kept smiling that beautiful smile of hers through it all. Her strength of will shall continue to inspire us all. Her family wishes to thank all that cared for her over the years. As we mourn, we take solace in knowing she is enjoying some full belly clams in batter, a good bowling alley and loved ones who departed before her. Love you, Mom!
Visitation will be held at the D’Esopo East Hartford Memorial Chapel, 30 Carter St., East Hartford on Friday, Dec.17 from 3 to 6 p.m. Funeral service celebrating Beth’s life will take place on Saturday morning, Dec. 18 at 10 a.m. at the funeral home chapel with Rev. Fredd Ward officiating. Interment will follow at Rose Hill Memorial Park, (Section 23D), Elm Street, Rocky Hill.

Texto completo: BUCKFIELD — Serving one’s country in times of war does not always end with glory. That is what one Buckfield family learned after digging into its history and discovering that an ancestor who was killed in battle during the Civil War had no burial.
Private Atwood Young’s military trail ends with a mass grave on a small beach island along the South Carolina coast. His descendants of today, brothers Philip McAlister, Jr. and Jamison McAlister, combed through military records that provided only suggestions of Young’s fate beyond his stated date of death as Aug. 11, 1863.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-27976652 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/affidavit-atwood-young-241x300.jpg" alt="" width="241" height="300" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/affidavit-atwood-young.jpg" />
Dead Union soldiers were laid in two large trenches following the Battle of Fort Wagner where Private Atwood Young was killed in 1863. One was for Black soldiers (from the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment) and the other for their white brethren from regiments of northeastern states from Pennsylvania to Maine.
The McAlister brothers could not be sure which of those graves their great grandfather would have been in, as Young’s mother was Native American and he could have been mistaken for either race in the sweltering heat.
Many of the dead were later exhumed and reburied at Beaufort National Cemetery in South Carolina bearing headstones that read “unknown.” But as Morris Island, where the battle was fought, was subject to erosion and shifting sands, several bodies were washed away by ocean tides before they could be reclaimed.
Private Atwood Young had no final resting place.
The McAlisters were able to piece together much of Young’s life before the Civil War, including the deception he used to enlist.
Accounts of teenage boys lying about their age in order to serve their country during times of war have been well documented, going back to colonial times. More unusual is the case where an older man fudges his birth date the other way when he enlists.
That is what Young did, intent on joining the Union Army when the Civil War broke out. He was born in 1812. His first stint in the military was during the Aroostook War during the 1840s. The presence of American militia soldiers in northern Maine as British and American diplomats negotiated where to draw an indisputable boundary between Maine and Canada was likely helpful. But in the end no shots were fired and the militia called to the border disbanded, returning to their hometowns unscathed.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-27976721 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/atwood-young-stone-151x300.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="300" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/atwood-young-stone.jpg" />
In his mid-thirties during the Aroostook War, Young would have to wait 10 more years for his opportunity to serve his country.
When the Civil War gave him his chance he was already at the cusp of his 50s.
Determined to enlist, he cited May 9, 1825 as his birth date. He joined the 9th Maine Infantry Regiment and headed south.
The 9th Maine saw action around coastal areas in the deep south. In July of 1863 it took part in the Battle of Fort Wagner in South Carolina.
The Union Army staged attacks to take the fort on July 11 and then again on July 18, both of which saw heavy casualties and Yankee retreats.
During the aftermath, the Confederate forces left in control of the fort buried the dead Union soldiers in two mass graves, Black soldiers in one and whites in the other.
In the Civil War it could take days, even weeks, for a regiment to regroup following battle. Young did not return to his unit and one eye witness reported that he had seen him take a musket ball to the head. His date of death is where his story ended, for 158 years.
As he researched Young’s history Phil, Jr. came to the conclusion that his great-great grandfather’s remains would never be recovered. The McAlister descendants wanted him to have the military burial honors he deserved. Jamison, a military veteran himself, took on the bureaucracy required to get Young his headstone.
“Being a military veteran means you get a headstone,” Jamison explained from Iraq, where he works as part of a contractor security detail. “I said to my family, ‘we can get a grave stone. Let’s put it in Buckfield,’ in our family cemetery.”
Jamison reached out to the Veterans Administration and petitioned it for a stone. He had proof of Young’s service that Phil, Jr. had acquired, his military records including an affidavit another soldier had made as a witness of Young’s death.
The McAlisters also needed to get the closest relatives in name to Young to sign off on the request. Jamison submitted the information in June.
Young’s marker was delivered to the McAlister home in Buckfield on Dec. 7. Jamison is also making headway to get Young a United States flag through the Maine V.A. The McAlisters plan a ceremony honoring their grandfather in the spring.
His gravestone will be placed in the family’s private cemetery next to Wilma McAlister, Phil Jr.’s and Jamison’s mother who passed away in 2000 and Young’s great-granddaughter.

HARRISON — Harrison resident Lynn Hearl, who has been taking photographs since childhood, loves the play of light and fog found in Maine, and has found a wealth of rich images in both Harrison and further afield in the state. Some of her work is on view and for sale now at Harrison Village Library, and Lynn will generously donate all the proceeds of the sales to the library.
Moody and introspective, these scenes beautifully capture the beauty of the Maine countryside, and would make a perfect gift. The photographs may be viewed during the library’s regular open hours: Monday and Wednesday 1-7, Thursday 11-5, and Saturday 10-2. For more information, please contact the library at 583-2970.

WILTON — In the small town of Wilton, a two-time national pageant title-holder and prominent anti-bullying advocate lays her head to rest every night.
Valerianne Hinkley, 19, has been doing pageants since she was 15 and thrust into action for anti-bullying advocacy.
Hinkley was the victim of bullying among former friends and peers. As a result, Hinkley was struggling in her classes, often skipping school.
“I realized that if I was doing this and if I was feeling this way, there were definitely other kids that were feeling that way,” she said. “So I created my platform, ‘Be Bold, Stand Up to Bullying.'”
The first of Hinkley’s projects for anti-bullying, which would become her pageantry platform, was the “positive post-it note project.”
Hinkley handed out over 800 post-it notes donning kind words, words of encouragement such as “you are worth it” and “shine bright like the diamond you are.”
“I joined pageants after that in order to widen my platform and make people more aware of bullying, the harm that it can cause and the ways that they can prevent it,” she said.
Over the years, Hinkley has competed in countless pageants and competitions for teen systems across the state and U.S. Hinkley’s won many titles, including Miss Teen Maine International 2018 and National Heart of America Miss Maine 2019.
Most prominently, Hinkley competed at the National USA Ambassador Teen pageant in July 2021. Here, she was crowned the USA Ambassador Teen 2021 winner and the 2021 ambassador for “Success Through Leadership, Integrity, Character and Confidence” (SLICC).
When she won, Hinkley said she thought “it was a Miss Universe moment when they call the wrong name” – referencing the 2015 Miss Universe pageant when the wrong winner was momentarily crowned.
Hinkley said that winning “still feels like a dream.”
Hinkley was excited to win the SLICC title because the National USA Ambassador Teen system is “so community driven and they love when girls in their system are out there in their communities helping out.
Hinkley’s mom, Jennie Bouchard-Young, said that though it’s taken some time, Hinkley has finally found the systems that “that truly let her be herself, where she didn’t need to cake the makeup that changed her looks.”
“USA Ambassador Pageant let her be her, show her freckles, let her shine as a teen and it felt great seeing that,” Bouchard-Young wrote.
Though she’s proud of all her successes, Hinkley also loves how the girls, women she competes against — or “competed with, rather than against” – become one big “family” that empower one another.
“Through pageants, I met some really amazing girls and women that encouraged me to be who I am and to not worry about what other people think,” she said.
While spending time, bonding with fellow competitors, Hinkley said she’s “able to experience that all together as pageant sisters, without the stress and worry about competition.”
Hinkley said she’s made great friends from across the world at these pageants. Most prominently, she’s been a bridesmaid in the wedding of one “sister” from Oregon.
“They are my sisters. And I do care a lot about them,” Hinkley said. “And in the end, for me, I’m just in it for the experience and to meet new people and make new friends.”

Ultimately, Hinkley is most proud of her anti-bullying platform and the way she has “inspired other people to get their voice and speak up about their experiences, as well.”
“Being in pageants gave me a bigger of a voice. They got me out there in my community. Being able to talk about my platform and talk about my experience,” she said.
“I’ve cried many times looking at Valerianne and what she has achieved in such a short time,” Bouchard-Young wrote. “I give credit to the peers and the adults who bullied her in high school because they made her what she is today … a positive role model to many around the world.”
Hinkley is currently studying elementary education at the University of Maine at Farmington. She hopes to incorporate her anti-bullying platform into her work in the classroom.
“At a young age, kids look up to adults. And they learn their behaviors because they want to be just like us.
“I’m hoping that I can teach them to be kind to everyone no matter who they are, no matter how they treat us. Just be kind to everyone because you never know what they are going through at home,” she said.
Hinkley would also like to become a staff member for the USA Ambassador System and, of course, continue competing in pageants and spreading her platform.
Hinkley is also nominated for Teen of the Year at the 6th Annual “Beauty It’s Everywhere” Awards. Voting, which ends January 10, is decided by the public and announced February 12. More information can be found at www.beautyitseverywhere.org/awards.

Texto completo: <img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-27914957" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/12/Rumford-Hospital-300x205.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="205" data-full-size="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/print/Rumford-Hospital.jpg" />
REGION — Highlighting its nationally recognized achievements in patient safety and quality, both Bridgton Hospital and Rumford Hospital have been named Top Rural Hospitals by The Leapfrog Group. Announced today, the Leapfrog Top Hospital award is widely acknowledged as one of the most competitive awards American hospitals can earn.
“This is a great honor and the best reflection of the commitment to the highest standard of quality, safety, and service to our community. I have always maintained that the most important part of ‘community hospitals’ is ‘community,’” said Peter J. Wright, FACHE, president of Bridgton and Rumford Hospitals and vice president of operations of Central Maine Medical Center. “We are here to serve and it is critically important that we provide the highest quality of healthcare. I could not be more proud of the more than 500 team members who come together every day to make this happen again this year.”
The Top Hospital designation is bestowed by The Leapfrog Group, a national watchdog organization of employers and other purchasers recognized as the toughest standard-setters for healthcare safety and quality. Central Maine Medical Center recently received its seventh consecutive “A” – the highest grade possible – for hospital safety from The Leapfrog Group.
“This recognition of Top Rural Hospital for Bridgton and Rumford Hospitals on the heels of our seventh ‘A’ grade for Central Maine Medical Center once again shows that quality and safety are a system-wide commitment that all of our team members, at every location, work to uphold,” said Steven G. Littleson, DBA, FACHE, president and CEO of Central Maine Healthcare. “I am humbled by their talents and passion for excellent patient care.”
To earn the Top Hospitals distinction, hospitals must rank top among their peers on the Leapfrog Hospital Survey. Over 2,200 hospitals were considered for the awards. Bridgton Hospital and Rumford Hospital were among a total of only 23 selected as Top Rural Hospitals.
“We are honored to be recognized with this commendation for our two critical access hospitals,” said John L. Alexander, MD, MHCM, FACEP, chief medical officer of Central Maine Healthcare. “Our team members’ dedication to providing the highest quality of care for all of our patients throughout the region is something we all take pride in. This award shows that our ongoing commitment to quality and excellent care is consistently upheld across our entire system.”
The quality of patient care across many areas of hospital performance is considered in establishing the qualifications for the award, including infection rates, surgery, maternity care, and the hospital’s capacity to prevent medication and other errors. The rigorous standards are defined in each year’s Top Hospital Methodology.

Texto completo: LEWISTON — Members of the Maine National Guard arrived at Central Maine Medical Center on Thursday to help ease the staffing shortages as the COVID-19 surge continues.
With their assistance, CMMC will open a swing bed unit, also known as a short-term rehabilitation program, Monday for patients who need noncritical care before leaving the hospital. The unit will care for a mix of people, including hospice patients, and will help open up beds for patients who need treatment.
Many of the 17 members, who come from communities across the state, volunteered for the role. They will be trained as nursing assistants, helping to check patients’ vitals, change beds, and assist the clinical staff with rehabilitation.
“A couple months ago, I was here myself, and I saw how short-handed they are here,” Master Sgt. Brian Jones of the Lewiston-Auburn area said. “I think it was a good thing for us to step up and help out . . . from what I’ve seen and what I’ve experienced, it’s needed.”
The 16-bed wing previously housed orthopedic and neurosurgery patients, but was closed two months ago, Central Maine Healthcare CEO Dr. Steve Littleson said.
“Their presence here is like a great Christmas gift,” he said. “Our workforce is exhausted, and they’ve been fighting this pandemic since the very beginning, and as we all know, it’s only getting worse. And so, for these guardsmen and women to show up now, before the holidays when our team members are tired but still dedicated to the job is just not only a practical help, we’re literally going to open more beds because they’re here.”
Originally, hospital officials were told 12 members would arrive, but were delighted when five more showed up.
“The emotional lift that the rest of our team members are getting from their presence is really fantastic. It tells them that the rest of the community cares about them,” Littleson said.
Gov. Janet Mills activated the National Guard on Dec. 8 to help understaffed hospitals straining to care for a surge of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. Members of the Guard will additionally be assisting Central Maine Healthcare’s two hospitals in Bridgton and Rumford.
Central Maine Healthcare is the parent company to Central Maine Medical Center.
“This particular unit is going to be geared toward patients who are ready for discharge, but still need some additional nursing and rehabilitation for a couple of days, or maybe a week or two,” Littleson said.
“Those patients have been sitting in our hospital with no place to go because our long-term care facilities are also full and also suffering from workforce shortages,” he said. “This unit is really going to enable us to open up more beds, admit more patients, and keep caring for our community in ways that we really struggled, most recently.”
At times, patients must wait in the emergency department until a hospital bed opens, he added.
The Guard is expected to be deployed at least until the end of January, however Littleson said the hospital may still need help beyond that.
According to chief medical officer for Central Maine Healthcare, Dr. John Alexander, CMMC has between 60 to 100 vacant positions for clinical staff and another 200 to 300 vacant positions throughout the system.
CMMC expects to receive three nurses from the Veterans Administration next week to assist with COVID-19 care. The hospital’s request for a rapid response medical team from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is still pending.
“I think one of the hardest parts has been seeing some of the younger people who’ve come in and have developed COVID and then have more severe illness,” Alexander said. “That’s especially challenging for most of our caregivers because you don’t expect that to happen. They’re otherwise healthy people.”

Bates College now requires booster shots for students in a bid to keep college safer from COVID-19

Texto completo: LEWISTON – Bates College told students Thursday they must get a booster vaccine for COVID-19, when they become eligible.
“The booster will give us the best chance of preserving the in-person student experience, in the face of a highly transmissible variant,” said Joshua McIntosh, vice president for campus life.
The move comes in the wake of a spate of outbreaks at colleges across the Northeast, that caused some campuses to close and send students home to take finals. The breakthrough cases appear to be tied to the growing spread of the omicron variant of the potentially deadly disease.
McIntosh said that despite “very high vaccination rates” at places such as Middlebury College and Princeton University, they have had to switch to remote learning in the face of large outbreaks of COVID-19, in the final days of their fall semesters. Bates saw cases bump up at semester’s end, but not enough to revise its existing policies for combatting COVID-19.
Bowdoin College and some others have already mandated that students get booster shots as soon as they are eligible, given growing evidence that boosters are crucial to coping with the omicron variant, that is swiftly infecting many people worldwide.
McIntosh said in his message Bates students will need boosters unless they have medical exemptions. Students are already required to be vaccinated.
Like others, students are eligible for a booster shot six months after completing the primary COVID-19 vaccination series from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or two months after completing the single-dose COVID-19 vaccination of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen.
The immunity by the initial jabs, which offer significant protection against COVID-19, declines over time. The booster, officials said, brings protection levels back up again.
McIntosh said that because Bates offers both housing and dining, mixing students together, “it is particularly important, as the omicron variant continues its spread, that students receive the booster, as soon as they become eligible.”
He said that during the first two weeks in February, students will be required to provide the college with “an updated image of their vaccine card which notes their booster information.” That’s about a month after they return for the second semester.
“If you are eligible for the booster shot and have yet to get it, I urge you to use your time over the winter break to get the booster,” he told students, adding they will also have opportunities to get one after they return to campus.

SCARBOROUGH — Maine Connections Academy, the state’s first online public charter school, has selected Kathryn Small, an 8th-grade student from Norway, as its November 2021 STAR Student of the Month. The STAR Student is a Maine Connections Academy scholar, selected from students throughout the state, who represents the school’s accomplishments and spirit.
Kathryn is in her second year at Maine Connections Academy. She enjoys it because “I learn more. At first, it was a little confusing, but pretty soon I caught up and now I’m doing well. All of the teachers are great, and it’s super-easy to reach them.”
Outside of school, Kathryn trains extensively in gymnastics. Five days a week, her grandfather drives her from Norway to Westbrook, where she trains at the Maine Academy of Gymnastics. Now at Level 6, Kathryn works out year-round with a competitive team on vault, bars, beams, and floor exercises. The competition season, from December to March, has her on the road here in Maine and outside of the state. Last year, Kathryn was Maine State Champion in floor exercises for her level.
Her demanding gymnastics training is why Kathryn attends Maine Connections Academy. Working out in the gym 20+ hours a week—plus the annual competition season—requires an academic environment that accommodates her sports schedule. By taking her classes online, Kathryn can study from wherever there is an Internet connection.
Maine Connections Academy also has opportunities for live field trips, like the one Kathryn recently took to the Maine Mineral & Gem Museum in Bethel. “It was really cool. They let us walk through all on our own. And I got to meet Ms. Ambrose, my homeroom teacher, whom I hadn’t met in person yet.”
Maine Connections Academy is proud to select Kathryn as the November 2021 STAR Student of the Month.
Maine Connections Academy is Maine’s first statewide, tuition-free, online public school for students in grades 7-12. In addition to academics, teachers focus on emotional well-being and social development, working closely with families to help students learn how they learn best. Here, students gain the skills and confidence they need to direct their own educational journey, learning to thrive in the real world by first learning how to be resourceful and resilient. For more information, call 1-800-382-6010 or visit www. MaineConnectionsAcademy.com.

Texto completo: I am thrilled the House passed the Build Back Better Act in November. Build Back Better will help 300,000 new low-income renter households finally get assistance to afford a place to live. It also extends the new child tax credit payments, which already have lifted more than 3 million children out of poverty and helped millions of families pay the rent, put food on the table, find child care and more.On Dec. 15, the next monthly child tax credit payment went out to American families. If the Senate does not pass the Build Back Better Act this month, that payment will be the last, forcing millions of children back into poverty in January. There is too much on the line for Congress to fail. The Senate must pass the Build Back Better Act. I strongly urge our senators to demand immediate consideration of the Build Back Better Act and to vote yes.

Aid drivers' families
I ride Santa Fe buses and the senior ride all the time. I feel I am lucky to be able to ride with such a polite group of working people who have risked their lives during the first year of the pandemic and are still doing so. I am interested in these people's welfare. I am appalled that it was not a requirement to be vaccinated for a driver, nor were drivers tested until recently.
I would like a mayor's fund set up to provide assistance to the families of the drivers that we have lost. I feel very sad that we couldn't protect these people, and in turn protect the ridership.

A cleanup weekend
'Tis the season of giving Santa Fe - to give gifts that are meaningful, that are everlasting, that make a difference and that say, "I care and you matter to me." Consider the gift of giving back to the city we all love and cherish and are blessed to call home. This weekend, consider this gift: grab your gloves, a trash bag and clean up our city. Driving to work, school, parks or church, those terrible eye sores that we see every day and think, "how can this trash be in our beautiful city and who would do this?" It doesn't matter. What does is those of us to rise above and step in and give our city a Christmas gift of picking it up. So, Santa Fe, grab your children, friends, co-workers and yourself. Join in this weekend to make a difference and bring a wonderful gift to all of us.

Solid decision
I'm thankful the Public Service Company of New Mexico-Avangrid merger was rejected. I spent a week in Maine this fall, viewing hundreds if not thousands of signs complaining about Avangrid, which was seeking to erect a power line through the state for the purpose of increasing profitability of power sales to lower New England. The residents of Maine felt they'd been suckered by Avangrid. To them, the company's mindset is profit over service, and Avangrid's merger with Central Maine Power had been solely for the purpose of gaining control over the state's power lines so Avangrid could advance business interests elsewhere. All of this was compromising Maine, its people, its forests, its tourist trade - all for the benefit of Avangrid. They rued the day that Maine's power company had been taken over by Avangrid; we saw not a single sign in favor of the project. I am proud of our New Mexico regulators for seeing this company for what it is. Thank you for rejecting the merger.

Cacophony from above
At the very moment when a person might have been feeling sympathy for PNM, with the news that it had succeeded in fighting off the advances of big bad Avangrid, PNM goes and creates another set of terrible optics in the form of a low-flying helicopter inspection of its power lines. I have difficulty believing this inspection necessitated the use of a loud, expensive and potentially dangerous helicopter to accomplish. For the cost of a helicopter, PNM could have employed multiple crews on the ground, and where needed, a drone in the air. While I'm happy that we won't be surrendering our public utility to a foreign corporation, there are serious questions about the the reckless decisions of that utility, PNM. Who signed off on this wrong-headed scheme?

Texto completo: Unlike 12 months ago, the vans carrying girls basketball teams will be back on the roads again this winter.
Area teams are back in action for holiday tournaments after missing out last December due to COVID-19.
Going on the road is nothing new for Hersey’s girls basketball team which spent a stretch of six straight games away from its Carter Gymnasium earlier this season.
Coach Mary Fendley’s top-ranked Class 4A team (10-1) will travel to Naperville for the Grow the Game tourney, an event that features all female head coaches to be played at North Central College. Going into her Huskies’ game against Hoffman Estates on Wednesday, Fendley stood just 8 wins from 500 for her career.
The Huskies were in the showcase event in 2019.
However, that time they played just one game (vs. Stevenson at Glenbard West) as part of the event’s ‘shootout’.
This time, they are in the eight-team bracket tourney which kicks off with quarterfinals on Dec. 20, followed by the semifinals Dec. 21 and the championship Dec. 22 at 4 p.m. The third-place game is set for 2:30 p.m.
The Huskies open with Walter Payton at 12:30 p.m. on the 20th. The rest of the field includes New Trier, Mother McAuley, Norcross, GA., Yorkville, St. Ignatius and Thornton Fractional North.
Among the other tourneys involving area teams are Dundee-Crown (Barrington, Buffalo Grove, Maine South, Maine West), Morton College (Rolling Meadows and Fremd), Libertyville (Wheeling and Conant), Wheaton North’s Bill Neibch Falcon Classic (Palatine, Schaumburg and Elk Grove).
Barrington is the No. 2 seed behind Stevenson at D-C, where the Fillies (7-4) placed sixth in 2019.
"Oh my goodness, this is so much fun," said Fillies senior Laura Mahlum about getting to play in a holiday tourney again. "The D-C tourney is really a good tournament for us. We play a lot of very good competition. And I think our team really bonds in that tourney with the bus rides four straight days and everything."
During the past volleyball season, Mahlum committed to Illinois Wesleyan to play basketball. Her volleyball team took third place in the Class 4A state tourney. Basketball teammate Gwen Adler was also the setter on that Fillies’ state volleyball team.
"I actually roomed with Gwen when we were downstate for volleyball and we talked about playing basketball and doing it again (getting down state in basketball)," Mahlum said. "Our team has a lot of potential. I’m excited to see where it goes."
The event hosed by a Northwest suburbs school is the 38th annual Blenner Classic at St. Viator, which features the host Lions, Prospect, Glenbrook North and Leyden. The tourney runs from Dec. 27 through Dec 30 with the final day featuring the title game at 7 p.m., third place at 5:30 p.m. and fifth place at 4 p.m.
Catching on: Second-season Prospect coach Matt Weber, the receivers coach for Prospect’s Class 7A state football semifinalist, has his team off to a solid start.
The Knights have won eight of their 10 games and are 2-0 in the Mid-Suburban East.
Weber has been getting contributions from many different players.
In a scrappy 54-47 win at St. Viator (Lions were 6-2 at the time) last week, senior guard Katie Neal came off the bench to provide some big moments.
"When the bench came in (vs. Viator), those players maintained the same level as the starting five and that’s the sign of a good team," Weber said. "We’re excited and the St. Viator game was a lot of fun," Weber said. "But we’ve got bigger goals than just winning nonconference games."
In a big come-from-behind win over Glenbrook South on Tuesday, senior Summer Srodulski had a season-high 18 points, including 2 3-pointers.
The Pape line: Cornell recruit Emily Pape of Maine South took her stellar game to Lincoln Way West last weekend and produced one of the all-time finest performances in program history.
The southpaw senior’s stats line showed a game-high 34 points with 17 rebounds in a 69-65 win for the 6-5 Hawks.
That effort placed Pape third on the all-time list for most points scored in a single game by a Maine South girls basketball player.
All-around gem: South Dakota recruit Joy Bergstrom didn’t miss a statistical category when St. Viator pushed its record to 7-3 and 2-0 in the East Suburban Catholic with a 56-44 win over Joliet Catholic Academy last week. The four-year senior starter collected 22 points, 10 rebounds, 5 steals, 3 blocked shots and 2 assists.
All-around gem II: Hersey junior Megan Mrowicki missed a triple-double against New Trier by 1 point and 1 assist.
The Huskies’ soccer standout, who is committed to Notre Dame, kicked into high gear with her passing skills, handing out 9 assists in the 61-50 nonconference win in Arlington Heights last Saturday. She also had 10 rebounds (8 on the offensive end) and 9 points.

Lobstering, climate change, and Maine. Read 7 takeaways from our 'Lobster Trap' series

Texto completo: In “The lobster trap,” The Boston Globe and the Portland Press Herald zoomed in on a small island central to Maine's signature industry, smack dab in the crosshairs of global climate change. Reporters immersed themselves in the lives of local lobstermen reckoning with change and struggling to plot a path into the future.
Below are seven key takeaways from the series:
1. The forces that sparked a lobster boom, and brought unprecedented prosperity to Maine lobstermen, can also take it all away.
The American lobster thrives in chilly waters between 54 and 64 degrees, but can stay healthy up to 68 degrees. Long-term exposure to anything hotter spells serious trouble, like respiratory and immune system failure.
As ocean temperatures rise, the epicenter of the lobster population is shifting north to cooler waters. Right now, the thermal sweet spot is off midcoast Maine, where Vinalhaven and Stonington lobstermen fish.
But scientists warn the good times won't last: As warming continues, they predict the catch will decline by half within 30 years.
2. The Gulf of Maine, which stretches from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, is one of the fastest-warming bodies of ocean water on the planet. And the pace is picking up: For the last 15 years, the gulf has warmed at seven times the global average.
Scientists say the shape and depth of the gulf are two factors. And the powerful currents that feed it, which influence its temperatures, are also changing, due to melting Arctic ice.
3. The potential loss of lobster in Maine is almost too big to comprehend. Lobster is a $1.4 billion industry in Maine, a critical economic foundation for its 3,400 miles of remote coastline. Lobster fishing employs 4,100 people directly and generates another 35,000 jobs for dock workers, dealers, truckers, and processors, plus others in lobster-related businesses like trap making and boat building.
“When the fishermen do good, everybody does good,” said Vinalhaven captain Walt Day. “And if it's a lean year, everybody has a lean year.”
Maine lobster accounts for 81 percent of all lobster caught in the United States.
4. Vinalhaven and its island fishing culture is unique — but the threat it faces is the same one bearing down on all of us around the world.
Maine's second-busiest port is a working island of 1,200 people, 15 miles at sea, but its challenges aren't dissimilar to those of countless cities and industries ― mining, logging, and farming among them ― that are being forced to adapt to a warming climate.
5 . Ocean warming is thrusting marine life into turmoil, and disruption is cascading up the coast.
The plankton that the North Atlantic right whale feeds on is averse to warming water and, like lobster, has shifted to cooler zones. The endangered whales have followed, putting them at greater risk of ship strikes and gear entanglements. As whale deaths multiply and extinction looms, the government is imposing stricter restrictions on fishermen to try and save the species.
6 . In its quest to save the right whale, the US government is considering steps that could transform the lobster industry within 10 years.
Regulators are closing off swaths of the ocean to traditional lobstering, telling captains who want to fish there that they must apply for permits and convert to so-called “ropeless” technology.
The goal is to protect whales from undersea entanglements by eliminating the vertical ropes that connect lobster traps on the seafloor to buoys on the surface. But the new high-tech gear is still being tested, and fishermen fear it won't work as promised, and that its cost will force them out of business. Environmental advocates have urged the federal government to help subsidize the transition of the fishery to ropeless gear.
7. While Vinalhaven's industry weathers immense change, other forces are silently shaping the island's future.
By even the government's most conservative projections, the Gulf of Maine will rise by at least 19 inches by 2050, breaching 30 homes and 20 businesses on the island's Main Street.
As islanders plan and prepare for that threat, some are also trying to envision a future economy that depends less on fishing. They are experimenting with salt-water crops like kelp, and contemplating the unsettling prospect of a more robust tourist industry. “Do we want to become Camden, or Nantucket?” they ask.
This island has embraced adaption before. When its thriving granite trade cratered in the 1900s, islanders turned to cod and haddock fishing. When those fisheries collapsed and poverty set in, they pivoted again, to lobstering.
Their track record suggests a deep resilience. “They can use their ingenuity,” said Sam Belknap, a community development officer with the Rockland-based Island Institute. “That's what fishermen do.”

Who's headed to ND, Illinois, NU, NIU? [Corrected 12/16/2021]

Texto completo: What began four years ago as college football's "early signing period" is now the undisputed main event. More than 70% of FBS scholarship players sign their national letters of intent in December rather than the traditional signing day on the first Wednesday of February.
Wednesday marked the opening of the early period -- and it saw one of the most shocking plot twists in recruiting history when cornerback Travis Hunter, the consensus No. 1 player in the country and a longtime Florida State commitment, signed to play for coach Deion Sanders at FCS Jackson State.
The early period runs through Friday; any players who don't sign by then will have to wait until Feb. 2.
Here's a look at the recruiting classes Notre Dame, Illinois, Northwestern and Northern Illinois have brought in so far, as well as key additions from the increasingly active transfer market. (Class and individual rankings are according to the 247Sports.com composite as of 7 p.m. Wednesday.)

Notre Dame
Signees: 21.
Class rank: Seventh nationally.
Top recruit: Five-star linebacker Jaylen Sneed committed to the Irish in July over Tennessee and Oregon. Then-defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was the primary recruiter for the South Carolina native, so it certainly didn't hurt in terms of keeping Sneed in the fold when Freeman was promoted to head coach to replace Brian Kelly. Notre Dame had only three decommitments after Kelly left for LSU. Sneed is the top-ranked player in South Carolina, the No. 3 linebacker in the country and the No. 35 recruit overall.
Local angle: The Irish have no players from Illinois in their 2022 class.
Transfer market: Notre Dame hasn't added any transfers yet, but Freeman didn't rule it out Wednesday when asked about potentially adding to the recruiting class before February. "I'm going to lean on our staff and look at, 'Hey, what roster needs do we need to address right now?' " he told reporters, per 247Sports. "And this could be transfer portal. ... You know, is it another high school kid? Or is it somebody that we can go into the portal and address with a guy that has some college experience?"
Notable: The Irish loaded up at offensive line (five signees) and linebacker (four), with seven of their nine highest-rated recruits playing one of those positions: linebackers Sneed, Joshua Burnham and Niuafe Tuihalamaka and linemen Aamil Wagner, Ty Chan, Joey Tanona and Billy Scrauth. ... On the flip side, Notre Dame added only one wide receiver, Tobias Merriweather, after longtime commitment Amorion Walker flipped to Michigan. That could be a position where the Irish look to the transfer market.

Irish signees
* Steve Angeli, QB, Westfield, N.J.
* Jayden Bellamy, CB, North Haledon, N.J.
* Joshua Burnham, LB, Traverse City, Mich.
* Ty Chan, OL, Lowell, Mass.
* Ashton Craig, OL, Lawrenceburg, Ind.
* Tyson Ford, DL, St. Louis
* Aiden Gobaira, DL, Fairfax, Va.
* Donovan Hinish, DL, Pittsburgh
* Bryce McFerson, P, Indian Trail, N.C.
* Tobias Merriweather, WR, West Camas, Wash.
* Jaden Mickey, CB, Eastvale, Calif.
* Benjamin Morrison, CB, Phoenix
* Jadarian Price, RB, Denison, Texas
* Eli Raridon, TE, Des Moines, Iowa
* Billy Schrauth, OL, Campbellsport, Wis.
* Jaylen Sneed, LB, Hilton Head Island, S.C.
* Holden Staes, TE, Atlanta
* Joey Tanona, OL, Zionsville, Ind.
* Niuafe Tuihalamaka, LB, Granada Hills, Calif.
* Aamil Wagner, OL, Yellow Springs, Ohio
* Nolan Ziegler, LB, Caledonia, Mich.

Illinois
Signees: 22.
Class rank: 45th nationally, 12th in Big Ten.
Top recruit: Oswego East edge rusher Jared Badie picked the Illini over Michigan State, Minnesota and Tennessee. The three-star prospect is the 12th-ranked player in the state. At 6-4 and 220 pounds, Badie projects to play outside linebacker in Illinois' 3-4 base defense.
Local angle: Coach Bret Bielema hit the state much harder in his first full recruiting cycle at Illinois than predecessor Lovie Smith did. Badie was one of 10 in-state signees, including seven from the Chicago area. Also headed to Champaign are Fenwick wide receiver Eian Pugh, Joliet Catholic running back Jordan Anderson and linebacker Malachi Hood, Brother Rice tight end Henry Boyer, Stagg safety TJ Griffin and Loyola linebacker James Kreutz.
Transfer market: With Brandon Peters out of eligibility and Artur Sitkowski coming off two surgeries for a broken left arm and right shoulder injury, Illinois reached into the transfer portal for quarterback help in Syracuse's Tommy DeVito. The former four-star recruit started 18 of his 27 games with the Orange over the last four seasons, completing 59% of his passes with 28 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, but he entered the portal after getting benched three games into the 2021 season. The Illini also added former Northwestern defensive lineman Te-Rah Edwards.
Notable: Bielema's teams at Wisconsin and Arkansas were known for their massive offensive lines and bruising running backs, and he hasn't changed his style in Champaign. The Illini signed six offensive linemen Wednesday -- including the 6-9 Magnus Möller out of Denmark -- while Anderson checks in at 6-3, 230. ... Kreutz is the second son of former Bears center Olin Kreutz to sign with Illinois. Josh Kreutz was a freshman center for the Illini this fall. ... Hood's uncle, Marcus Hood, also played linebacker at Illinois. ... The Illini flipped Florida edge rusher Gabe Jacas from Tulane on signing day and added Georgia safety Tyson Rooks, who didn't play high school football until this fall.

Illini signees
* Isaiah Adams, OL, Garden City (Kan.) CC
* Jordan Anderson, RB, Joliet Catholic
* Owen Anderson, TE, Skillman, N.J.
* Jared Badie, OLB, Oswego East
* Hank Beatty, WR, Rochester, Ill.
* Henry Boyer, TE, Brother Rice
* Matt Fries, OL, Cranford, N.J.
* TJ Griffin, DB, Stagg
* Ashton Hollins, WR, Lucedale, Miss.
* Malachi Hood, LB, Joliet Catholic
* Gabe Jacas, OLB, Port St. Lucie, Fla.
* James Kreutz, LB, Loyola
* Aidan Laughery, RB, Gibson City, Ill.
* Donovan Leary, QB, Sicklerville, N.J.
* Clayton Leonard, OL, Danforth, Ill.
* Elijah Mc-Cantos, DB, Miami
* Shawn Miller, WR, Chandler, Ariz.
* Magnus Möller, OL, Vejle, Denmark
* Joey Okla, OL, Hartford, Wis.
* Eian Pugh, WR, Fenwick
* Tyson Rooks, DB, St. Simons Island, Ga.
* Hunter Whitenack, OL, New Carlisle, Ind.

Northwestern
Signees: 15.
Class rank: 47th nationally, 13th in Big Ten.
Top recruit: Four-star Naperville Central wide receiver Reggie Fleurima was the first member of the Wildcats' 2022 class, having committed in March. He's the sixth-ranked player in Illinois and No. 226 in the country, and his offer list included seven other Big Ten schools, including Penn State, Michigan State and Iowa. The son of former Notre Dame defensive lineman Reggie Fleurima Sr., the younger Fleurima brings good size (6-2, 205) and speed to an NU passing game in dire need of playmakers.
Local angle: Fleurima was one of four Chicago-area recruits Northwestern signed Wednesday, joining Marist offensive lineman Danny "Deuce" McGuire, Maine South tight end Chris Petrucci and Brother Rice quarterback Jack Lausch. Lausch was the last of that group to jump on board, switching his commitment Monday from Notre Dame, where he would have been a preferred walk-on in baseball and football.
Transfer market: Linebacker Wendell Davis announced this week he's transferring from Pittsburgh to Northwestern, potentially filling the void left by departing starters Chris Bergin and Peter McIntyre. The 6-2, 240-pound Davis played in 28 games over the last four seasons for the Panthers, totaling 45 tackles, five tackles for a loss and two sacks. He has two more years of eligibility after a redshirt season in 2018 plus the COVID-19 waiver for 2020. Davis is the son of a former NFL player named Wendell Davis Sr. -- but it's not the former Bears wide receiver. His father played tight end for the San Diego Chargers in the late 1990s.
Notable: Among the players committed to the Wildcats as a preferred walk-on is Lemont running back Albert Kunickis, who was born without a right hand and forearm. He told the Daily Southtown last month that playing in the Big Ten was "always a dream I had." Said Kunickis: "I wanted to compete at the highest level I could. Putting in work daily got me there. I always believed in myself, even when others didn't." ... Maryland edge rusher Anto Saka gives the Wildcats two four-star prospects in this class. He picked Northwestern over USC and Penn State. ... Connecticut linebacker Kenny Soares was a signing-day flip from Colorado.

Wildcats signees
* Braydon Brus, LB, Glendora, Calif.
* Austin Firestone, DL, Niceville, Fla.
* Robert Fitzgerald, DB, Dallas
* Brendan Flakes, DL, Winter Garden, Fla.
* Reggie Fleurima, WR, Naperville Central
* Nick Herzog, OL, Olathe, Kan.
* Joseph Himon II, RB, Little Rock, Ark.
* Jack Lausch, QB, Brother Rice
* Deuce McGuire, OL, Marist
* Chris Petrucci, TE, Maine South
* Anto Saka, DL, Phoenix, Md.
* Evan Smith, DB, Birmingham, Ala.
* Kenny Soares, LB, New Canaan, Conn.
* Braden Turner, DB, Mobile, Ala.
* Devin Turner, DB, Little Elm, Texas

Northern Illinois
Signees: 12.
Class rank: 87th nationally, fifth in MAC.
Top recruit: Three-star linebacker Jake Gassaway of Omaha, Neb., has the highest composite rating among the Huskies recruits. He committed to NIU in March after drawing interest from Army, Wyoming and North Dakota State. Nebraska has been fertile recruiting ground for the Huskies the last couple of cycles, with three freshmen on the MAC champions' 2021 roster, including running back Jay Ducker, the conference's Freshman of the Year.
Local angle: A third of the NIU class is from the Chicago area. Shepard defensive end Roy Williams is joined by a trio of wide receivers -- Metea Valley's Jalen Johnson, Minooka's Malik Armstrong and Downers Grove South's Eli Reed.
Transfer market: The Huskies announced four transfers Wednesday, three of them former area high school players. Outside linebacker Izayah Green-May was the No. 9 recruit in the state in 2017 coming out of Bolingbrook, but he spent an injury-plagued five seasons at Wisconsin, getting hurt in the 2019 and 2020 openers. He played in nine games this past season. Former Mount Carmel quarterback Justin Lynch -- the younger brother of 2013 NIU Heisman Trophy finalist Jordan Lynch -- played in 11 games with one start for Temple as a true freshman this fall, but Owls coach Rod Carey, the former NIU coach, got fired after the season.

Texto completo: Cancun Mexican Restaurant must immediately address violations found by a state health inspector, according to a reported dated Dec. 8.

WATERVILLE — A downtown Mexican restaurant is closed because a state health inspector last week found numerous health violations that include improper hygienic practices, inadequate heating and cooling of foods, and inadequate steps taken to prevent food contamination, according to a state report obtained this week.
The health inspection report, dated Dec. 8, said two people in charge at the Cancun Mexican Restaurant didn’t demonstrate that they were knowledgeable about how to handle food.
“The facility presents an Imminent Health Hazard to the public and is being asked to voluntarily close until the Critical Violations have been corrected,” the report said. “The facility is NOT permitted to re-open until a follow-up inspection is conducted and all health hazards have been corrected.”
It went on to say that, “Neither staff member was able to correctly discuss cooking temperatures, hot holding temperature minimum, reheating requirements, or cooling parameters required by the food code. No active managerial control of hand washing or prevention of bare hand contact with RTE (ready to eat) foods.”
The eight-page report, signed by restaurant owner Hector Fuentes and state health inspector Barrett Evans, said restaurant staff that handled food did not appear to wash their hands. Equipment and surfaces where food was placed was not clean, it said.
The “inspector notes apparent rat droppings and evidence of rodent harborage in the food storage areas in the establishment,” the report said. “Health inspection staff observed multiple rat traps with fresh cheese present as well as rodent poisons applied. No licensed pest control in place. Please note: the conditions allowing harborage must be eliminated.”
Meanwhile, the plumbing system was not properly maintained, plumbing fixtures such as hand-washing sinks, toilets and urinals were not cleaned often enough and rest rooms were not being properly cleaned, according to the report.
“There is evidence of someone living in the food establishment,” it said. “Various personal hygiene products (shampoo, toothbrush, razors) and personal living items (clothing, shoes and bedding with beds) present downstairs in the establishment. Possible cooking being conducted in an area not approved by the fire department.”
The next official inspection date for the restaurant at 14 Silver St. has not been determined. The report said the restaurant must obtain licensed pest control, provide a report to a state health inspection program and all rodent and pest cleanup must be done according to Maine health guidelines.
Supervisors at Cancun must retake a food protection management course within two months, and other changes must be done within certain timeframes, such as correcting 15 “critical violations” within 10 days. If the restaurant fails to act then it will be subject to further enforcement proceedings such as fines and other penalties.
Robert Long, spokesman for the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, said most restaurant operators are eager to reopen after they’re forced to close and are willing to correct violations.
“The Health Inspection Program’s first action after identifying violations is to educate owners about the problems and work with them to fix them,” Long said. “The program’s intent is to help businesses stay open, but in a way that does not put the public at risk.”
Asked if it is unusual for a restaurant to have as many violations as those found at Cancun, Long said, “While more than 10 noncritical violations can be identified during inspections, it is less common to find this number of critical violations.”
Cancun was dark inside Wednesday and a sign on the door said it was closed.
The owner said Wednesday afternoon via email that all the violations have been fixed, and he expects the inspector to return on Thursday. Fuentes added that regardless of Thursday’s outcome, he expects to be closed another eight to 10 days because two of his employees have tested positive for COVID-19.
Daniel Bradstreet, Waterville’s director of code enforcement, said Tuesday that a city code enforcement officer also attended the health inspection and noted some potential life safety, plumbing and electrical code violations.
“We scheduled an additional inspection for today (Tuesday) in conjunction with the fire marshal and Fire Department regarding those issues,” Bradstreet said in an email. “I have been out this week and was not able to attend today’s inspection but expect that further citations for those violations will be forthcoming.”
This is not the first time the restaurant or its owner have been cited for violations.
Cancun was forced to close for a week in April for violating COVID-19 requirements. A state health inspector found that staff were not wearing face coverings and the restaurant failed to quarantine a sick employee while awaiting test results.
Fuentes was sentenced to a 30-month prison term in 2014 after pleading guilty in U.S. District Court to knowingly hiring 10 or more undocumented immigrants over the course of a year at his Westbrook restaurant and making false statements to federal agents.

Litchfield sets deal for internet coverage

Texto completo: In Litchfield, a town with approximately 3,600, there are 239 households without access to reliable high-speed internet, and town officials say the new arrangement will get 'unserved households served quickly.'

LITCHFIELD — Litchfield is now the most recent central Maine town to sign on with Redzone Wireless, a Rockland-based company offering high-speed internet with the power to completely cover underserved communities.
Town officials agreed to use federal American Rescue Plan Act funds toward the project, which will completely cover the town’s $375,000 share of the internet project.
In Litchfield, a town with approximately 3,600 residents, there are 239 households without access to reliable high-speed internet.
“We should have 100% coverage,” said Litchfield Town Manager Kelly Weissenfels.
Last month the town of Fayette, in which 825 locations were without access to reliable high-speed internet, voted to move forward with a Redzone Wireless contract.
According to Redzone Wireless CEO James McKenna, the service is able to connect unserved and off-grid locations wirelessly, just like mobile broadband has been doing for over two decades. Last month he said the company’s purpose-built wireless technology is “specifically engineered to form a non-line-of-sight last-mile bridge between the fiber network on the home.” This is made possible through Redzone’s collaboration with Tarana Wireless, a company whose Gigabit 1 technology delivers speeds over a long range, hitting otherwise unreachable spots.
McKenna said the company provides service to more than 100 Maine communities. In late November the company was responding to proposal requests from at least 30 Maine communities, and McKenna said the list of towns requesting proposals and information from Redzone is increasing each week.
Weissenfels said the pricing, architecture, proposed timeline and cost-share is the same for Litchfield as it was in Fayette.
He said the total cost for the project is about $1.2 million, with Litchfield’s share being $375,812. Redzone would also cover any future costs for operating expenses, technical support, network, maintenance and technology.
The service would give most residents access to the service within six months and be available to all within nine months.
Redzone’s residential packages range from $50 a month to $99 a month.
As part of Redzone’s agreement, the town can simultaneously establish another internet service if they choose.
“We’re happy about that, because it’s going to increase competition,” Weissenfels said. “But anybody who is happy with their existing service can keep it. It’s not an exclusive contract, so the idea is that we can get unserved households served quickly, and this is a very high-quality addition to the current available offerings.”

Texto completo: William Harwood is an attorney with broad experience working on utility issues and currently serves as the senior adviser for regulatory affairs in the governor's energy office.

Gov. Janet Mills is nominating William Harwood, an attorney with broad experience working on utility issues, as the state’s next public advocate, the governor’s office said in a news release Wednesday.
If confirmed, Harwood, who currently serves as the senior adviser for regulatory affairs in the governor’s energy office, would represent Maine utility consumers in matters pending before the state Public Utilities Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.
“When it comes to utilities in Maine, few people are more experienced or knowledgeable than Bill Harwood — and no one is better positioned than Bill to stand up for Maine people and hold our utilities accountable to them,” Mills said in a written statement. “Bill’s deep expertise, built over his decades long career, will serve Maine well and will advance our efforts to hold our utilities accountable and deliver reliable service for Maine people.”
As former senior counsel at the Portland-based law firm Verrill Dana, Harwood has represented a wide range of interests over his 40-year career, including consumers, public utilities, renewable energy companies, technology companies, paper mills, and colleges and universities. He has also helped landowners, from blueberry growers to nursing homes, in negotiations with renewable energy developers regarding the siting and benefits of new solar projects.
Harwood, who served as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Maine School of Law, also has experience with water utilities, representing consumers in disputes involving charges, supplies and access.
“I am honored to be nominated as Maine’s Public Advocate. If confirmed, I will work hard every day to defend the interests of Maine people,” Harwood said in a written statement. “The bottom-line is that Maine ratepayers deserve reliable service at just and reasonable rates, and I will fight every day to make sure that’s what they are getting.”
The nomination was welcomed by the Acadia Center, a group advocating for a bold response to climate change in the Northeast. Jeff Marks, the group’s Maine director and senior policy advocate, noted Harwood’s experience, skills and temperament.
“The trust he’s earned during his more than four decades of legal and regulatory work will serve him well, especially as the public grows more weary of high-profile controversies in Maine’s utility sector,” Marks said. “We hope Bill will use his leverage to elevate equity concerns in environmental justice, frontline and other vulnerable communities that are underserved or overburdened by current energy policies, programs and systems due to geography, race, income or other socioeconomic factors.”
Harwood’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee, as well as the state Senate. It’s unclear when those proceedings would take place, although a confirmation hearing is expected before Jan. 15.
If confirmed, Harwood would replace former Public Advocate Barry Hobbins, who retired from the position in June. Andrew Landry, deputy public advocate, has served as acting public advocate in the interim.
Harwood, a graduate of Harvard University and Fordham University, lives in Yarmouth with his wife, Ellen, and has five grown children.
A Mills spokesperson said Harwood, if confirmed, would earn $93,400 to $140,000 a year.

Texto completo: Approval comes after developers and state officials revise plan to no longer require overhead power lines on Tall Pines Way, through part of the Bond Brook Recreation Area.
AUGUSTA — The Planning Board has approved a proposal to build a 7.5-megawatt solar farm on 18.42 acres at the Augusta State Airport.
The approval came after the developers and state officials offered a revised plan that would no longer require overhead power lines to be installed on the city’s Tall Pines Way, through part of the Bond Brook Recreation area.
The original plan for the site was also modified to reduce the impact on trails — used by hikers and mountain bikers — on state- and city-owned land in the surrounding area.
The project, which received permit approval in a 6-0 vote Tuesday, would consist of ground-mounted solar panels on an enclosed area spanning 18.42 acres, with solar arrays attached to a fixed tilt racking system.
It would be located on undeveloped, forested land northeast of the airport’s main runway. The project would feed electricity into the power grid, offsetting the state’s electrical costs over the 21-year lease with a private developer that would build, operate and maintain the system for the state.
State officials expect the project to generate electricity that could save Maine $6 million over 20 years.
The project, which would be completed by a private developer for the state, has been revised to no longer require overhead power lines to be put in on Tall Pines Way, through Bond Brook Recreation Area. Instead, the developer has reached a tentative agreement with a neighboring property owner to bring power to the site across its land.
The potential for the project to require power lines through Bond Brook prompted worries by some city councilors the project could marr the scenic wooded views of the recreation area.
A change in the solar farm’s layout and a last-minute agreement with the abutting property owner, Dotton Properties, to negotiate an easement to allow power lines to come from Bond Brook Road into the site across the Dotton property are expected to greatly reduce the impact on users of the Bond Brook Recreation Area’s trails.
Power lines on state property from the solar array to the Dotton property will be buried underground, Steve Barrett, of Barrett Energy Resources, said of the revised project. And overhead lines on the Dotton property won’t be visible from Bond Brook’s trails.
“Most significantly for any trail users, they won’t see utility lines,” Barrett said.
The plan was also altered to preserve a loop trail that was initially going to be eliminated. The trail is to be moved and come with views of the solar farm, but will remain, which pleased Christopher Riley, president of Augusta Trails and the central Maine chapter of the New England Mountain Bike Association.
Riley said the loop trail is key to the recreation area. He added that when he saw the initial plans for the solar farm and its impact on the trails — on which he has worked for 10 or 12 years to help design, build and promote — his concerns put him into a cold sweat. He said those concerns eased somewhat after he walked the site with Barrett and they discussed ways the project could be modified to preserve the trail, with some changes to its route.
“It provides a loop so walkers, runners, bird-watchers (and) mountain bikers can go in a loop, rather than having a dead end, and they can go around Tall Pines Way and down the hill, across the hill and then back up the opposite side and have a relatively natural experience,” Riley said of the now-preserved trail.
“There is no denying that the nature of the trail is going to change with the installation, but the experience of the way the network was designed will still be intact.”
A driveway into the site, which Barrett said would likely be used quarterly to check on the site, is to cross one of the trails, but speed bumps are to be installed on the road to slow any vehicle that approaches the trail crossing.
Barrett said developers will work with trail advocates to finalize the design of the crossing and location of the trail’s section that is to be moved. In some places, the trail will be within 5 feet of the fence surrounding the site.
The solar panels are to be out of sight from most areas of Augusta, according to Matt Nazar, development director for the city.
The Augusta State Airport is owned by the state but run by the city of Augusta, through an ongoing contract.
The developer of the project, MEVS ASA LLC, based in Carlsbad, California, and state officials are working with Barrett Energy Resources Group of Concord, Massachusetts, on the approval process.

Texto completo: After its 2021 season was canceled midseason amid a hazing investigation, Brunswick's varsity football program faces two-year ban from competition.
for 2022 season
Brunswick High School will try to convince the Maine Principals’ Association next month that it should field a varsity football program in 2022.
The Brunswick School Department on Oct. 6 canceled the remainder of the team’s season and fired longtime coach Dan Cooper in the wake of its investigation into an alleged hazing incident during a preseason team retreat at Thomas Point Beach in Brunswick.
High school varsity teams that can’t complete a season face a two-year ban from competition, according to MPA rules.
Mike Burnham, director of the MPA, said the rule does not apply for schools that shuttered seasons because of COVID-19 safety concerns.
Schools whose varsity sports teams couldn’t finish a season can file an appeal to the MPA’s Interscholastic Management Committee to have the two-year ban waived.
“We did file a waiver,” Brunswick Athletic Director Aaron Watson said. “We’ve petitioned the MPA to hear our appeal. We’ve requested to present our appeal at the committee’s next meeting. We are hopeful that when we present, when we get opportunity, that they’ll see how important it is, that they’ll see we’ve taken appropriate steps all the way through. We feel good about our appeal.”
Burnham said the MPA will hear the appeal when the Interscholastic Management Committee meets during the third week of January.
“The process for any appeal heard by this committee is to give the school asking for the appeal an opportunity to explain their rationale,” he said. “The committee then asks clarifying questions, almost always they go into executive session to discuss the appeal, and will most often render a decision on the appeal once they return from executive session.
“There have been cases where additional information has been requested prior to a decision being made but that’s not common. This has nothing to do with the two-year non-completion. This is for any appeal.”
Burnham added that the committee’s decision is final.
Matt Barbour, whose son, Gavin, was a junior captain on the Brunswick football team this fall, said Wednesday that parents are eagerly anticipating the outcome.
“The waiver piece is mission critical,” he said. “It’s good that this piece of the puzzle is starting. We know things are progressing and there is potential for a positive outcome, which is exciting. But we are still in a position that we don’t have a coaching staff, and there’s been no communication with the school. The coaching situation needs to get moving, but we also know that without the waiver we can’t even look to getting a new coach.”
Brunswick schools Superintendent Phil Potenziano previously said he began an internal investigation into the football program around Sept. 8 after he became aware of possible hazing, bullying or assault at the preseason team retreat.
A week later, Potenziano canceled the team’s homecoming game and placed head coach Cooper and assistant coach Greg Nadeau on non-disciplinary administrative leave.
Then, on Oct. 6, Potenziano announced in a letter to the community that the season was over.
“I am writing with some regrettable news about our football season. I wanted first to inform you that Daniel Cooper is no longer affiliated with our athletic department,” Potenziano wrote at the time. “His departure, the removal of some players from the team, and the number of ineligible or injured players on the team have caused the administration and I to seriously evaluate our ability to safely field a team for the remainder of the season. After very careful deliberation, we have concluded that we cannot safely field a team and continue playing contests for the remaining three games of the season.”
Brunswick police announced in early November that there would be no criminal charges after its investigation into the alleged hazing incident.
Potenziano did not return phone calls seeking comment for this story.
Burnham said the MPA routinely hears a variety of appeals, although most are based on eligibility issues.
Some schools in Maine have had to cancel their varsity football seasons for a variety of reasons in recent years.
Camden Hills, for example, abruptly canceled its season after the third game of the 2015 season, citing safety concerns. Camden did not field a varsity team in 2016, but it returned in 2017 in a newly formed Class E, which was designed to help struggling programs stay competitive.
The MPA ultimately replaced Class E with eight-man football in 2019.
Traip Academy in Kittery couldn’t finish its varsity football season in 2017, also because of low numbers in the program.
However, the MPA Management Committee granted Traip an exemption for safety reasons as it, too, was competing in the developmental Class E.
“They were as supportive as they possibly could,” Traip athletic director Mike Roberge said.

Texto completo: The Celtics have won seven consecutive games and have the second-best record in the NBA G League at 9-1.
It’s been nearly a month since the Maine Celtics played a home game at the Portland Expo.
Nov. 19, to be exact, a 118-91 victory over Capitol City. And the Celtics haven’t lost since.
In fact, the Celtics have won seven consecutive games and at 9-1 have the second-best record in the NBA G League, just behind the 10-1 Delaware Blue Coats – the only team to beat Maine this season, back on Nov. 12 (though the Celtics responded by handing Delaware its only loss the next day).
“It’s crazy,” said guard/forward Theo Pinson. “I think it’s just, you never know with our team who’s going to have a good night. We’re going to have one or two guys, maybe the whole team, have a good night. We’re pretty balanced.”
The Celtics play the Long Island Nets in back-to-back games Thursday and Friday at the Expo, both games starting at 7 p.m. Entry into the Expo requires a proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result. Masks must be worn inside the Expo.
“We love the fans, that’s what drives us,” said guard Brodric Thomas, who leads the Celtics with 18.3 points per game and 2.2 steals. “We’re looking forward to having the fans come out and be able to watch us continue this good run we’re on.”
What they’ll see is team operating at high efficiency at both ends of the court. The Celtics are averaging 115.3 points per game (fourth in the G League), while leading the league in field goal percentage (50 percent), 3-pointers made (165), 3-point percentage (41.6 percent) and assists (28.3 per game). They are allowing just 100.8 points per game.
Beyond that, the Celtics have eight players scoring in double figures, led by Thomas and Pinson (17.3 points). Guard Sam Hauser, like Thomas a two-way contract player (he has been up with the Boston Celtics this week but is expected to be back for the game Thursday), averages 17.1 points, followed by Jaysean Paige (13.8), Chris Clemons (13.7) and Luke Kornet (13.0).
“We have a lot of veteran guys,” said Thomas. “So it’s easy to play off each other because we understand the spots and spacing of this game at this level. When you have a bunch of guys willing to sacrifice for the greater of the team, it helps everybody’s game as a whole. You see the success of the team and the individuals when everyone is on the same page.”
“We’ve got a really good team, a lot of guys who make plays for each other,” said Pinson. “When you share the ball the way we do, it’s hard to guard.”
Head coach Jarell Christian said it all starts in practice, where the players push each other and hold each other accountable. “We’ve got a lot of guys who understand what the right way to play is,” he said.
In a league known for its offense, Maine’s defense has been most impressive. And that’s no accident.
“We know if we want to win, we’ve got to defend,” said Pinson. “We do a good job with our schemes. And we’ve got a lot of guys who know that if they want to get back in the (NBA) and have quality minutes, we’ve got to defend.”
Thomas added, “I think (defense) is the biggest separation when it comes to players. Can you defend? There’s a lot of guys at this level who can put the ball in the hoop”
Christian said Thomas has made a big impact the defensive end since his return. He missed the first four games of the season with an injury.
“He leads it on defense,” said Christian. “That just adds to complexion of team. You’ve got to understand if you want to play in the NBA, you’ve got to be able to guard your position. And that’s something our guys understand.”
They also understand that the team’s success will potentially lead to individual success, and possible NBA call-ups.
“I think we understand the more we win, the more everyone is going to get recognized,” said Pinson. “That’s what we’re doing, trying to win games, and play together at the same time.”
NOTES: Following the two games against Long Island, the Maine Celtics will compete in the Winter Showcase in Las Vegas, starting Sunday and ending on Dec. 22. All NBA G League teams are guaranteed two games in the showcase, with the top eight teams playing in the Showcase Cup Tournament. The winning team not only gets a trophy, but a $100,000 prize to be split among its members. “We’ve got a lot of competitors on this team,” said Pinson. “We’re going to do everything we can to win it.” … Following the showcase, the NBA G League season will reset for a 36-game regular season that won’t include the records of games playing before the showcase. Christian said the restart will give the team a chance to evaluate what it has done. “The things we’ve done well, we’ll continue to try to implement them,” he said. “The things we haven’t done well that teams haven’t taken advantage of yet, we’ll look to improve.”

Texto completo: As we enter our second pandemic holiday season, Liz Soares contemplates all we've been through and what may lie ahead.
A friend recently wondered how there can be anybody left in Maine who could get sick with COVID-19.
And this was before the staggering 2,148 cases announced on Dec. 10. Before Gov. Janet Mills called out the National Guard to help with the crisis hospitals are facing due to the surges in COVID numbers.
I have taken up her comment as a kind of mantra when I see the latest numbers. An incredulous voice inside my head says: “We’re such a small state. How long can this go on?”
In my darker moments, I think, “Forever.”
I’d like to be more optimistic, but this is our second pandemic holiday season. Thanksgiving brought that Dec. 10 spike in cases; what will Christmas deliver?
I’ve seen bright spots on the horizon before, but right now I can’t even imagine closure. I can’t picture the day when I don’t have to wear a mask for my job as a school librarian.
I’m angry, too. We didn’t have to be in this position. The virus is running rampant here because too many Mainers are still unvaccinated. The situation we’re in is mind-boggling.
The pandemic is a public health issue, obviously. But I also see its effects on education. And, of course, we are all experiencing our personal journeys.
When the vaccines first became available last year, there was great excitement. I was ecstatic when appointments were opened up to those over 60, like me. But my mood quickly fell when, before I could schedule a shot, educators and other frontline workers were added to the eligibility list, regardless of age.
I panicked, convinced I’d have to wait for weeks. People were proudly posting their appointments on social media, but I hadn’t managed to find an opening. Then my husband, Paul, got up very early in the morning and found me a slot at Walmart.
I am troubled by the thought that this country is so divided that we have some people who couldn’t wait to get their vaccines in March and others who refuse to do so in December, even when they (or a loved one) are on a ventilator. They harbor their crazy conspiracy theories while others are frantic to secure a booster appointment.
Mutual concern is a bedrock of democracy. Retirees are expected to support the school budget at town meeting even though their own children are long past their classroom days. Though self-determination is also a major tenet, we have always acknowledged that “your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.”
Today, too many don’t care about their neighbors’ well-being. All they think about is their “rights.” But no one’s rights are being violated. The vaccine is a choice — for the greater good.
I’ve given up trying to understand those who oppose vaccines and masks. From my perspective, masks enable schools to stay in session. I hate wearing a mask all day, but I know it works. There’s little (if any) transmission in schools when a mask policy is strictly followed. My district is participating in pool testing, which also allows more students to remain in school when they are close contacts of infected people.
It’s not perfect. There always are students who have to quarantine. That puts added stress on both them and their teachers, as their school work has to be done during their absence. Parents have to arrange for child care, although now they do have the option of having their elementary-aged offspring vaccinated.
Many students were dealing with mental health issues before the pandemic; case numbers have now skyrocketed. Educators are struggling as well. I find the uncertainty of life during the pandemic to be extremely stressful. Teaching and interacting with students while wearing a mask is challenging.
Most of all, I have a sense that nothing is the way it’s supposed to be. And it’s been that way for way too long now.
I remember the fear I felt in the spring of 2020, not knowing how bad things would get, how long it would last. I worried less about the actual illness than about being quarantined. Having my life totally disrupted for two weeks seemed unimaginable.
I missed going to the movies and eating out. But once the weather broke, Paul and I went on many outdoor adventures. I even packed a bag with paper plates, utensils, a tablecloth and napkins to keep in the car for our picnic lunches.
I’ve adapted to this new lifestyle — which includes routinely wearing a mask indoors in public places — but I’m not happy about it.
Still, I was grateful that we were able to say goodbye to our chocolate lab, Aquinnah, in late February 2020. A few weeks later and we would not have been able to share his final moments at the veterinary hospital.
Although it turned out to be an ordeal, I say thanks that I was able to undergo surgery at the end of October. It was a necessary procedure, but I bet it would have been delayed for weeks if I was trying to schedule it now.
To wit: Maine Medical Center recently closed six operating rooms. This move frees up staff and made room for — you guessed it — more COVID patients.
My ability, and willingness, to find silver linings only goes so far. All I want for Christmas is my old life back.

Texto completo: In Litchfield, a town with approximately 3,600, there are 239 households without access to reliable high-speed internet, and town officials say the new arrangement will get 'unserved households served quickly.'

LITCHFIELD — Litchfield is now the most recent central Maine town to sign on with Redzone Wireless, a Rockland-based company offering high-speed internet with the power to completely cover underserved communities.
Town officials agreed to use federal American Rescue Plan Act funds toward the project, which will completely cover the town’s $375,000 share of the internet project.
In Litchfield, a town with approximately 3,600 residents, there are 239 households without access to reliable high-speed internet.
“We should have 100% coverage,” said Litchfield Town Manager Kelly Weissenfels.
Last month the town of Fayette, in which 825 locations were without access to reliable high-speed internet, voted to move forward with a Redzone Wireless contract.
According to Redzone Wireless CEO James McKenna, the service is able to connect unserved and off-grid locations wirelessly, just like mobile broadband has been doing for over two decades. Last month he said the company’s purpose-built wireless technology is “specifically engineered to form a non-line-of-sight last-mile bridge between the fiber network on the home.” This is made possible through Redzone’s collaboration with Tarana Wireless, a company whose Gigabit 1 technology delivers speeds over a long range, hitting otherwise unreachable spots.
McKenna said the company provides service to more than 100 Maine communities. In late November the company was responding to proposal requests from at least 30 Maine communities, and McKenna said the list of towns requesting proposals and information from Redzone is increasing each week.
Weissenfels said the pricing, architecture, proposed timeline and cost-share is the same for Litchfield as it was in Fayette.
He said the total cost for the project is about $1.2 million, with Litchfield’s share being $375,812. Redzone would also cover any future costs for operating expenses, technical support, network, maintenance and technology.
The service would give most residents access to the service within six months and be available to all within nine months.
Redzone’s residential packages range from $50 a month to $99 a month.
As part of Redzone’s agreement, the town can simultaneously establish another internet service if they choose.
“We’re happy about that, because it’s going to increase competition,” Weissenfels said. “But anybody who is happy with their existing service can keep it. It’s not an exclusive contract, so the idea is that we can get unserved households served quickly, and this is a very high-quality addition to the current available offerings.”

Texto completo: William Harwood is an attorney with broad experience working on utility issues and currently serves as the senior adviser for regulatory affairs in the governor's energy office.

Gov. Janet Mills is nominating William Harwood, an attorney with broad experience working on utility issues, as the state’s next public advocate, the governor’s office said in a news release Wednesday.
If confirmed, Harwood, who currently serves as the senior adviser for regulatory affairs in the governor’s energy office, would represent Maine utility consumers in matters pending before the state Public Utilities Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.
“When it comes to utilities in Maine, few people are more experienced or knowledgeable than Bill Harwood — and no one is better positioned than Bill to stand up for Maine people and hold our utilities accountable to them,” Mills said in a written statement. “Bill’s deep expertise, built over his decades long career, will serve Maine well and will advance our efforts to hold our utilities accountable and deliver reliable service for Maine people.”
As former senior counsel at the Portland-based law firm Verrill Dana, Harwood has represented a wide range of interests over his 40-year career, including consumers, public utilities, renewable energy companies, technology companies, paper mills, and colleges and universities. He has also helped landowners, from blueberry growers to nursing homes, in negotiations with renewable energy developers regarding the siting and benefits of new solar projects.
Harwood, who served as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Maine School of Law, also has experience with water utilities, representing consumers in disputes involving charges, supplies and access.
“I am honored to be nominated as Maine’s Public Advocate. If confirmed, I will work hard every day to defend the interests of Maine people,” Harwood said in a written statement. “The bottom-line is that Maine ratepayers deserve reliable service at just and reasonable rates, and I will fight every day to make sure that’s what they are getting.”
The nomination was welcomed by the Acadia Center, a group advocating for a bold response to climate change in the Northeast. Jeff Marks, the group’s Maine director and senior policy advocate, noted Harwood’s experience, skills and temperament.
“The trust he’s earned during his more than four decades of legal and regulatory work will serve him well, especially as the public grows more weary of high-profile controversies in Maine’s utility sector,” Marks said. “We hope Bill will use his leverage to elevate equity concerns in environmental justice, frontline and other vulnerable communities that are underserved or overburdened by current energy policies, programs and systems due to geography, race, income or other socioeconomic factors.”
Harwood’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee, as well as the state Senate. It’s unclear when those proceedings would take place, although a confirmation hearing is expected before Jan. 15.
If confirmed, Harwood would replace former Public Advocate Barry Hobbins, who retired from the position in June. Andrew Landry, deputy public advocate, has served as acting public advocate in the interim.
Harwood, a graduate of Harvard University and Fordham University, lives in Yarmouth with his wife, Ellen, and has five grown children.
A Mills spokesperson said Harwood, if confirmed, would earn $93,400 to $140,000 a year.

Texto completo: OUT Maine plans to provide free training via Zoom for all partners of this project Feb. 9.
GARDINER — Healthy Communities of the Capital Area seeks partners for a summer project to increase summer programs for LGBTQ+ youth in Kennebec County.
The project is funded by a $15,000 United Way of Kennebec Valley Innovation Grant.
“LGBT high school students are more than twice as likely to feel sad or hopeless, and almost four times more likely than their non-LGBT peers to seriously consider suicide,” said Joanne Joy, program manager at HCCA, in a news release from the nonprofit. “Most have more support at school than when out of school, and very few LGBTQ+ specific activities or programs currently happen in the summer when mental health concerns and other risky behaviors are more likely to happen.”
Youth organizations report that they would like to engage more LGBTQ+ youth but don’t know how. Others have lost prior connections with LGBTQ+ youth because of COVID. The project called LGBTQ+ YeSS (LGBTQ+ Youth Experiencing Summer Supports) pulls together interested organizations that already serve youth to find tangible, doable, low-cost/no-cost ways to modify existing opportunities and reach more youth.
Partners so far include libraries, Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCAs, recreation programs, and others who serve youth. They share their ideas with each other about what works to engage LGBTQ+ youth and brainstorm to collectively creative ideas.
OUT Maine (outmaine.org) will provide expertise on effectively engaging LGBTQ+ youth, and HCCA will do the behind-the-scenes organizing work and provide micro-grants to help get things started.
OUT Maine plans to provide free training via Zoom for all partners of this project at 10 a.m. Feb. 9, 2022. Training will include using supportive language, why pronouns are important, and guidance on developing strategies that work.
For more information, contact Joy at j.joy@hccame.org or 207-588-5350. More information can be found at hccame.org/lgbtq-yess.
Healthy Communities of the Capital Area is a public health nonprofit that works to improve the health and quality of life in Kennebec County. Its mission is to convene and support people, organizations and communities to collaborate on quality of life and public health issues.

In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus scarred the world anew

Texto completo: Few words in the English language are as loaded as the three-letter conjunction "but."
As in, "I totally get how Native Americans feel about Christopher Columbus, I really do. But this is history! You can't just erase history!"
I heard numerous variations on that theme during a visit on Tuesday to Bucksport, where the Nao Santa Maria, a replica of the flagship sailed by Columbus during his first expedition to America in 1492, sat placidly at the public dock. The tranquil setting belied the cultural winds that have swirled around the vessel since its arrival in Maine 10 days ago.
To recap: The Nao Santa Maria originally came here as part of a four-ship flotilla that was to visit four ports - Bucksport, Orrington, Bangor and Searsport - from July 9-24. Organized by the Penobscot Maritime Heritage Association, the rolling event aimed to commemorate Maine's seafaring history during the state's pandemic-delayed bicentennial celebration.
The Nao Santa Maria had no sooner arrived at Bucksport, its first port of call, on July 8 when Maine's Native Americans objected to its presence. Given the pivotal role the ship's historical namesake played in the eventual slaughter and subjugation of Native Americans far and wide, the Penobscot Nation took issue with the Nao Santa Maria plying up and down a river that runs like a vein through the tribe's ancestral territory.
For starters, as Penobscot Nation Tribal Ambassador Maulian Dana noted to Maine Public last week, Columbus never sailed the Santa Maria anywhere near the Maine coast. Thus, one wonders, why was its replica even taking part in a celebration of Maine's maritime heritage?
Beyond the geographical overreach festered a deeper insult: Columbus didn't just discover a new people in a new land - he created a blueprint for killing and enslaving them that would persist for centuries. The tightly drawn reservations and rampant social inequities that resulted stain the story of America to this day.
Organizers quickly and apologetically pulled the plug on their "4-Port Loop" event before it even got underway. Yet in Bucksport through Tuesday and in nearby Castine through today, the Nao Santa Maria show went on.
Standing near the dock Tuesday morning as the line for tours grew in anticipation of the 10 a.m. opening, a man who said he'd come down from Bangor spoke for many when he said sending the Nao Santa Maria packing was not the answer.
"It has its negative aspects to it, but that kind of negativity should not be hidden. It should be used as a teaching tool," he said, declining to give his name. "I am so happy that there are tours through concentration camps (in Europe). Teach it, don't hide it."
Therein lies the problem here. After plunking down $15 to get aboard the vessel, I found no such attempt to put the Nao Santa Maria into its proper context - a goal the remnants of the Nazi concentration camps achieve by their very existence.
In fact, throughout the relatively short self-guided tour, I found only one mention of Columbus on a dimly lit plaque: "The Santa Maria was the flagship with which Admiral Christopher Columbus carried out one of the most significant ocean crossings in history. On August 3rd, 1492, it set sail ... together with the caravels Pinta' and 'Nina' and reached America on October 12th 1492, creating an encounter between two worlds that had been unknown to each other until that point."
Creating an encounter? That's how they skip over the legacy of a man who wrote in his journal on Oct. 14, 1492, "I do not ... see the necessity of fortifying the place, as the people here are simple in war-like matters as your Highnesses will see by those seven which I have or'dered to be taken and carried to Spain in order to learn our language and return, unless your Highnesses should choose to have them all transported to Castile, or held captive in the island. I could conquer the whole of them with fifty men, and govern them as I pleased."
The Nao Santa Maria posted on its Facebook page Tuesday that the Nao Victoria Foundation, which oversees the operation, is "deeply sorry" the ship's presence in Maine "could cause sore feelings and be misinterpreted."
It continued: "Our aim is, and always has been, to contribute spreading the knowledge of maritime history in general. When we interpret and remember the historical voyages and encounters that were lived between the two known worlds, we do so with the intent to educate and stimulate our collective progress for the future. In no way do we intend to celebrate the possible errors made at the time and disrespect any community."
Someone needs to take away this gang's shovel before they dig themselves all the way to China.
We're not talking about "possible errors" made by Columbus upon his arrival in what are now the Bahamas. We're talking about deliberate genocide.
And no one's accusing the Nao Victoria Foundation of "celebrating" the dark side of an expedition that only recently has elbowed its way into our collective conscience. The criticism here is that the foundation - by focusing on the ship and not the guy who commanded it - ignores outright what the voyage was all about in the first place: conquest, forced religious conversion, exploitation and, above all, money.
For all the backlash the Penobscot Nation endured last week after raising its legitimate protest, it's worth noting that our Native American neighbors are on the right side of the truth here. Monday evening, Passamaquoddy tribal members set up an educational display and film screening near the Bucksport Public Dock that attempted to do what the Nao Santa Maria doesn't - tell the whole story.
If only we were all willing to hear it. Just beneath the Nao Victoria Foundation's not-really-an-apology last week, a woman posted: "You have nothing to apologize for. Those who get 'offended' live in their own sad revisionist little world that they want normal people to be as miserable as they are. I loved both times I visited the Nao. Thank you so much for such a cool experience."
A cool experience for one "normal" tourist perhaps. But - and there's that word again - this maritime roadshow doesn't come even close to reflecting how Native American history took a horrible turn after Columbus, as the singsong rhyme goes, "sailed the ocean blue ..."
For $15 per adult and $5 for kids, the Nao Santa Maria doesn't honor history. It sails right past it.

What's next for venerable Maine art camp? Following the death last year of founder Reg Grauert, Bearnstow's new leaders try to figure out how to make the Mount Vernon site sustainable going forward.

Texto completo: OUNT VERNON -- Time has changed a few things along the shoreline at Parker Pond over 75 years. But not much has changed at Bearnstow, an art and nature camp that opened in 1946 on the granite-rimmed pond at the headwaters of the west branch of the Forty Mile River in central Maine, taking over an existing but neglected hunting and fishing camp.
A New York dancer and lighting designer with a sense of adventure and a commitment to inclusion, Ruth "Reg" Grauert founded the camp the summer after World War II ended with her life partner, Frances Reid, on the principles of diversity and generosity and with an agenda that encouraged creativity and natural wonder. Grauert died last year at 101, which also happened to be the only summer Bearnstow was unable to host campers since it opened, because of the pandemic.
But Bearnstow, under new leadership, is back in business - and Grauert's spirit is very much present.
"I just got chills - thank you, Reg," said Bebe Miller, feeling what she took as Grauert's soft touch as she spoke of her friend during a recent interview from the porch of the camp's dining hall. Both Grauert and Reid were laid to rest on camp grounds, with Grauert memorialized in late June, a year after her death, her burial site outlined with flower pots.
Miller, an internationally recognized choreographer, began coming to Bearnstow as a young girl from Brooklyn in the 1950s and now, as board chairperson, is helping to lead the camp toward a sustainable future.
Grauert operated Bearnstow on guile, genius and passion, creating magic by assembling the right mix of people along a stunningly beautiful setting on a small, quiet and pristine lake. It began as an overnight camp for kids, who learned about the trees and bugs and how to dance, sing, swim and ride horses. Over the years, the camp added adult components, primarily dance workshops and related activities, reflecting both Grauert's professional expertise and a growing organic bond that developed between Bearnstow and the Bates Dance Festival in Lewiston.
With both founders deceased, Miller and her team are looking ahead to what comes next. After a work week of maintenance by volunteers, they welcomed young day-campers in early July, resuming the tradition of kids having fun with nature and art. But the question remains, what will the future be? Under Grauert's firm leadership, change came slowly to Bearnstow. She resisted trimming tree branches, let alone making substantial improvements to the buildings, to the point of neglecting necessary maintenance.
On the other hand, she danced with abandon at age 100 during the last summer she was at camp, in 2019.
With her passing, her friends are balancing the tradition of the past with the need for a sustainable future. That means tackling long overdue physical improvements, as well as changes to programming to encourage more adult users.
"We are moving past what we thought the camp would be with Reg," said Miller, who holds the most institutional knowledge of the place. "And so, what is that relationship between what it was and my memory of how things were and where things are going? It's a vibrant conversation about finding our way - not solve it, but find our way through this."
As she spoke, Miller pointed to structural changes made this spring to the lodge, the oldest of the camp buildings, dating to at least 1880, and the oldest structure on Parker Pond. There is a new roof on the porch, new paint and glaze on the windows and frames, and new sills underneath. "And it's all in a straight line. Reg would be very proud," Miller said.
The camp is something of a time capsule, harkening to an era before Grauert purchased it, when the complex was known as the Spruce Point Camps. In many ways, it's similar to other Maine sporting camps up north and in the nearby Belgrade Lakes region. But as with each of those camps, this one has its unique character, drawn from the clarity of the water, the lay of land, and the four-legged, finned and winged creatures that occupy both, as well as the spirit of humans who have spent time here.
In addition to the lodge and a dining hall that doubles as the performance space, there are 10 sleeping cabins along the camp's half-mile of shoreline, connected by meandering dirt paths. Some of the gabled cabins are situated just 20 feet from the shore; others are 50 feet from the water. They all have working toilets, showers and electricity, but all are rustic, built without foundations and supported by wooden posts and stones, with exposed stud walls and rafters. All have screened-in porches, with rocking chairs, and wood stoves, though they're not used anymore because of the fire danger.
Loons are ever present.
The camp property occupies about 65 wooded acres, most of which are covered by an easement held by the Kennebec Land Trust, which maintains public trails throughout the property. The camp itself, because of its historic status as a classic Maine sporting camp, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It was established in 1915 as Stevens Camps, named for a local man who purchased 12 acres and the lone building. In 1922, it was renamed Spruce Point Camps, with most of the sleeping cabins added around that time. Ownership changed over the years, and electricity was added, but the camp ceased operation around 1940.
When Grauert and Reid arrived from New York at the end of World War II, they were eager buyers, committed to creating a camp with an emphasis on the creative arts and natural sciences as an alternative to the traditional Maine sporting camp. From the beginning, Grauert and Reid linked arts-related activities to environmental responsibility. They believed in the resonance of place, and the camp's unspoiled environment offered an ideal setting to encourage artistic expression of all kinds and creativity in general. The name Bearnstow is said to come from the West Saxon words for "child" and "place."
Grauert's background was dance. Born in 1919, she danced in the Nikolais Company and the Charles Weidman Dance Company in New York. Later, after she established the camp in Maine, she worked as production stage manager for Nikolais and other dance companies, touring the world. She also taught lighting, as well as dance, and was a widely published writer about dance.
During the early years with Nikolais, she also supervised the children's classes at the Henry Street Playhouse on the Lower East Side, and that is where Miller first encountered Grauert when her mother signed her and her siblings up for classes.
"They had children's classes, so my mother brought us - my brother, my sister and I. Reg was my first teacher, when I was 3," Miller said.
Grauert and Miller's mother became friends, and when Grauert learned that Hazel Miller had worked as a nurse, she offered her the job as camp nurse. "My mother brought us all up for eight weeks of the summer, until we were all 13. But I stayed longer. I didn't want to leave."
Now in her 70s, Bebe Miller is still here listening to the loons.
Many years ago, when Miller and her siblings were campers and their mother was the nurse, they stayed in their own family cabin. ("We called her Hazel, except when we were in Cabin 10, when we called her Mommy.") A city kid, Miller found the woods of Maine enchanting. "I loved it right away. I loved the woods - a little scary at night, but wonderful sounds, and darkness. And a loud silence - I remember thinking that when I was a kid, sleeping here, the silence seemed so loud. It was all magical."
She recently ran across a photo taken when she was 7, holding a horse bridal, and an essay she wrote at camp when she was 14, in which she quoted Socrates - wildly divergent experiences and both essentially unique to her camp experience. She remembers watching Grauert sharpen knives on a sharpening stone, demonstrate how to use a two-person saw, and swim in the pond without making a ripple.
"You see all that, and you take it in," Miller said, attributing at least some of her success in dance to the feeling of being grounded that she learned from Grauert at Bearnstow. "It stays with you."
But camps cannot survive on memories alone. Laura Faure, the former director of Bates Dance Festival and a member of the Bearnstow board, is leading an effort to raise money for the camp to sustain its future. She's also raising awareness, in hopes of encouraging arts organizations and others to consider renting the camp for workshops and other activities. This summer, she is introducing Bearnstow to as many people as she can.
"It's been all dance, because that was Reg's world. That is what she knew best. But we need to diversify the programming. We need to reach more people," Faure said. "No one knows about this place. We want to change that."
The camp operates on a relative shoestring. This year's budget is $120,000, which reflects minimal programming and ongoing maintenance.
Over time, the camp became a money-losing enterprise. Faure said. "Reg has always been very generous, and she wanted people here. She had eight interns every summer and ran workshops whether they had enough people or not," she said. "She just wanted people here, and she wanted to be around artists."
With only a small endowment, the board needs to change the financial equation so the camp survives. Faure envisions the camp could be used as a retreat for visual artists, writers and musicians, as well for people and organizations interested in ecology and the environment. In the realm of historic summer art retreats in Maine, Bearnstow is similar in some ways to both the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, which also was established in 1946, and Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, which shares a remote waterfront setting uniquely suited to immersive creativity in a quiet community. But unlike Skowhegan, Haystack or the Watershed Center for the Ceramic Arts, Bearnstow lacks an international reputation or much recognition beyond its web of alumni and supporters.
Faure wants to change that. "It needs to be better known," she said.
But first she and her colleagues must raise some money. Their goal is to raise $120,000 for a three-year restoration effort, involving upgrading the cabins to make them more hospitable for adults, with better showers, more comfortable beds and brighter lights so people can read at night, along with other deferred maintenance. They just installed a commercial grade dishwasher, for example, and are on the hunt for a better range. The camp no longer has horses, and there is talk of converting the stables into open-air art studios.
"There is a lot of energy and a lot of ideas," Faure said.
They're about halfway there, with $55,000 in the bank at the end of June and grant applications pending. Over and above the maintenance, this fall they will try to raise another $40,000 for a new multi-use arts building that might be built in three or four years.
"We have another year or two of just restoration. But over this winter, we will start to dig into the programming conversation again. We have to move forward, so I want to reach out to as many people in the visual art community, the literature community, ecology, environment science. The fundraising is easy. It's straightforward - you have got to fix the toilets. But figuring out sustainable programming is really hard."
Molly Hess, Bearnstow's associate director, who is also a dancer and choreographer, described the camp as a place "where almost anything seems possible." She arrived 11 years ago as an intern and quickly became day camp director. Grauert gave her more responsibilities with time, and with Grauert's death, Hess is now in charge of day-to-day operations.
The camp is whatever the people who are there at the moment make it, said Hess, who lives in western Massachusetts when not living on Parker Pond. Nature, ecology, science, dance and theater are always present, and summer interns who lead the day camp are expected to teach campers their specialty. That might be kick-boxing, salsa dancing or circus arts. Hess arranges tree-identification talks with foresters and discussions with biologists about aquatic macroinvertebrates or animal camouflage techniques.
This year, there are two, two-week sessions of day camps for kids, with 15 campers each. There are also two, one-week adult workshops and a week for alumni.
Campers swim in the lake and hike the trails, and they all eat their meals around a series of tables in a screened-in porch just a few feet from the lake. When Grauert ran the camp, she sat the at the head table and told stories - about how she and Reid discovered the camp, how they salvaged Guy Lombardo's peg-leg gold piano from a storage house in Augusta, or the first time she met Alwin Nikolais.
"She had an arsenal of stories, but she was so good at telling them, I never got tired of hearing them," Hess said.
With the storyteller missing from the the head of the table, change hangs in the air, as inevitable the sunset, and no one knows what that means or what it might look like. But they also don't seem too worried.
The charm of the camp also ensures it can't change very much. There are only 33 beds, and the easement limits growth. The key is figuring out how to make use of those beds going forward so the camp survives without the generosity of its founder.
Miller is philosophical.
"I am not afraid of change, because it will change," she said. "When you introduce new elements, you don't know where it will take us. We can't control it - that is what going forward is. But we can guide it. We know what is important to us. So the question is, how will that resonate with others and will it become clear enough that others understand it, too?"
She is confident they will, once they settle in, eat a meal and listen to the loons.

Texto completo: It's always fun to read the tourist-guide descriptions of a place where you actually live.
In Portland, my day is supposed to be filled with riding my bike down cobblestone streets to my community garden plot, maybe stopping to pick up an artisanal loaf or some knitting supplies, pausing only to watch a majestic ship slide into the harbor.
In reality, I don't knit, the garden is dead most of the year and riding on cobblestones will rattle your joints.
So, when a national publication highlighted my hometown of more than 30 years last week, I was ready to find fault.
U.S. News and World Report included Portland in its list of top 10 places in the country to live, behind Boulder, Colorado (No. 1), but ahead of the other Portland (No. 10), with its heatwaves, forest fires and street fighting between armed insurrectionists.
There was the usual puffy stuff: "Artful living and farm-to-table dining are not just trends in Portland - they have been a way of life for years ... ." And the aspirational: "The metro area has a thriving music and night life scene with crowds buzzing along Congress Street and Old Port almost any night of the week."
But I was surprised (and for the purposes of this column, disappointed) to see how much the writer, Ed Pfueller, got right. Especially this paragraph:
"Though more people discover its charms, Portland is at a crossroads on how to move forward. New development is often met with opposition, while demand for affordable housing is high. An aging rental and housing stock combined with a tight market on mid-tier units has left middle-income earners struggling to settle in Portland."
We've been writing the "Portland at a crossroads" story at least since the 1990s, when the reality sunk in about the loss of manufacturing jobs, so that's not news.
But decades of people discovering Portland's charms are forcing us to think about how the city is changing.
One thing that hasn't changed much is Portland's population. It was 64,157 in 1990 and 66,215 in 2019, according to the Census Bureau. That's 3 percent growth over almost 30 years.
The most recent decade, often described as a period of explosive or transformational development, the population has grown only by 24. Not 24 percent - 24 people.
The city has changed in other ways. We have more hotel rooms than ever. We get on more "best-of" lists. People come for a visit and want to stay.
And that means more competition for "aging rental and housing stock," along with higher prices and fewer options the lower you are on the wage scale. The only way you can get in-migration without population growth is by crowding some people out.
One answer has been to put a lid on rents, and city voters passed a referendum last year that instituted rent control.
That will help people who already have housing at a rent they can afford, but it won't do anything for those who have already been priced out of the market or for people who haven't come here yet but would like to.
It won't keep out the U.S. News and World Report readers, but it does make it harder for students and all the people who work in the restaurants, bars, microbreweries, quirky shops, hotels and office buildings who give the city the life the magazines rave about.
Here's the crossroads that Portland faces: We can become the city that the guidebooks think we are, cobblestone streets and farm-to-table restaurants staffed by people bused in from someplace less charming - think Disneyland with six months of bad weather.
Or we can be the city those of us who moved here fell in love with, the one with a little bit of everything, from a working waterfront to a symphony orchestra and a place for everyone who wanted to be here.
That means we need room for more people - more housing, and not just luxury condos or apartments for professionals and tech workers. We need more decent, affordable housing for low-income families and people with disabilities who have to be close to hospitals and other services.
More housing means more density, which has got to mean less reliance on cars as the only way to get around. Despite all the superlatives, the magazine noted that Portlanders are well below the national average in their use of transit, and that would have to change.
The pandemic showed us that Maine's real estate market heats up when people around the country realize that their work is portable. As climate change heats the world up, we should expect that more people are going to want to pack up and move north, and we ought to be ready for them.
Portland is at a crossroads (again). Which way will we go this time?

Texto completo: The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday reported 58 new cases of COVID-19 and four additional deaths, adding to a continued rise in the seven-day average, which now stands at 36.4 cases.
A week ago, the seven-day average of new daily cases was 17.1. The past week's increase brings averages closer to where they were in late October - above where they were at their lowest last summer, but far from the peaks that Maine saw in January and April. The all-time highest seven-day average in Maine was 624 cases, on Jan. 15.
Maine's cumulative COVID-19 cases rose to 69,474 on Saturday. Of those, 50,812 have been confirmed by testing and 18,662 are considered probable cases of COVID-19. The 14-day average was 28.9 daily cases.
Eight hundred eighty-two people have died with COVID-19 in Maine since the pandemic began. Information about the four people reported Saturday to have died was not provided by the Maine CDC.
The University of Maine System, meanwhile, is planning to require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students once existing vaccines receive final approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines now have emergency use authorization from federal authorities.
Officials with the university system said the vaccine requirement would work in tandem with testing and quarantine restrictions to ensure a safer fall semester. The University of Maine System is planning a more traditional fall term, with most classes held in person.
"We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it," Chancellor Dannel Malloy said in an announcement Friday. "It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don't wait and have to scramble."
By Saturday morning, Maine had given 801,238 people the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Among people 12 and older, the population currently eligible for vaccination, 67.66 percent are now fully vaccinated.
County by county as of Saturday, there had been 8,460 coronavirus cases in Androscoggin, 1,928 in Aroostook, 17,333 in Cumberland, 1,400 in Franklin, 1,386 in Hancock, 6,643 in Kennebec, 1,164 in Knox, 1,093 in Lincoln, 3,667 in Oxford, 6,394 in Penobscot, 593 in Piscataquis, 1,477 in Sagadahoc, 2,296 in Somerset, 1,068 in Waldo, 950 in Washington and 13,622 in York.
By age, 18.9 percent of patients were under 20, while 18.2 percent were in their 20s, 15.2 percent were in their 30s, 13.4 percent were in their 40s, 14.5 percent were in their 50s, 10.2 percent were in their 60s, 5.3 percent were in their 70s, and 4.2 percent were 80 or older.
Maine hospitals on Saturday had 27 patients with COVID-19, of whom 11 were in intensive care and four were on ventilators.
Around the world on Saturday evening, there were 189.8 million known cases of COVID-19 and 4.07 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States had over 34 million cases and 608,870 deaths.

Texto completo: People & Places: Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce hires vice president of operations.
Employees at Gardiner Federal Credit Union have been putting in time at Spectrum Generations’ Cohen Center, to help package meals for the center’s Meals on Wheels program. All of FCU’s staff is eligible to help, and interest has been strong.
Every Tuesday morning, two staff members don their hair nets and aprons and spend two hours filling to-go containers with nutritious meals.
The credit union team raises money for Ending Hunger year-round but wanted to do more. The Cohen Center is one of the eight organizations and food pantries to receive Ending Hunger funds from the credit union.
In May, Gardiner FCU presented a total of $19,859 to area food pantries and to groups like Meals on Wheels. The credit union raises these funds throughout the year.

Chamber names new VP of operations
The Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce has a new vice president of operations. Brandi Meisner studied at Thomas College in Waterville, earning her Bachelor of Science degree in business management. She also holds a master’s degree in business from the school. Meisner formerly served as community banker for Skowhegan Savings Bank. The MMCC job is a new position for the chamber. Meisner is expected to focus on member growth and retention, marketing, social media and website development.
She lives in Skowhegan with her husband and daughter. Together they help run two family businesses, Maine Cedar Hot Tubs and the Skowhegan Wooden Ruler. The latter is a web store that sells custom rulers that parents can use to mark a growing child’s milestones.

Tourism businesses saw Fourth boost
The tourism sector in Maine is bouncing back from lockdowns and social-distancing requirements, if sales on July Fourth are any guide. The Maine Tourism Association recently polled its members about the holiday weekend’s business, visitor trends and how the workforce shortage is playing out.
According to chief executive officer Tony Cameron, 40% of respondents said that business was better than during a normal year like 2019, while 47% said their businesses were performing at 75% to 100% of a normal season. Only 5% said business was worse than usual over the holiday weekend.
Cameron cautioned that plentiful challenges remain, referring to closed Canadian borders as well as a workforce shortage. Both are “tremendously affecting all aspects of tourism,” Cameron said.
The Canadian border closure has impacted 33% of businesses significantly or moderately, according to survey respondents. Forty-six percent said they had half or fewer of the employees they needed this summer. This has led to 37% of respondents reducing business hours. “The surge in business this summer is terrific, but clearly we are leaving millions in tourism dollars on the table due to staffing shortages,” said Cameron.

Isacke to join Health Network
Ross Isacke will join Franklin Community Health Network, a member of MaineHealth, as chief medical officer Sept. 7.
As CMO, Isacke will be a leader for the FCHN physicians and advanced practice providers. He will also oversee the clinical operation that includes quality of care, patient safety and more.
Isacke has worked as a hospitalist at Maine Medical Center in Portland and Stephens Memorial Hospital in Norway. Born in Gorham and raised in Yarmouth, he worked at his local fire department in his youth, then in emergency medical services and as a nurse’s aide during his Bates College and medical-school years. He received his medical degree from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine, and completed his residency in internal medicine at Maine Medical Center.

LaBarbera to join Belgrade center
Rita Alfonso LaBarbera, a clinical social worker, will join the staff at Belgrade Regional Health Center in August.
A graduate of Boston University, LaBarbera has over 31 years of experience working with people of all ages in outpatient, residential, private practice and education settings.
She will join physicians Amy Madden and Michael Landrum, nurse practitioners Jennifer Caudell, Katie Gillihan and Josephine Poulin, and psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner Dianne Raymond.

Trail of ‘forever chemicals’ leads to Maine paper mills

Texto completo: The industry, which has used PFAS extensively for decades, faces a reckoning as the state grapples with widespread soil and water contamination.

FAIRFIELD — For 32 of its 33 years in this quiet corner of central Maine farm country, the Saunders family has reveled in the solitude, the wildlife and the views that stretch 40 miles to the coastal mountains on clear days.
Even the cornfields across from Nathan Saunders’ modest, saltbox-style home and 5-acre lot added to the peaceful setting where the couple raised three boys.
Since January, however, the couple has questioned whether they’ve been poisoned for decades in their own sanctuary. Water collected from their well contained 850 times as much PFAS as new Maine health standards say is safe, and 185 times more of the industrial chemicals than federal regulators say should be in drinking water.
The cause of the contamination is now clear: Fertilizer that contained high levels of the “forever chemicals,” unbeknownst to the farmers who spread it for years on those cornfields or homeowners all along Saunders’ road whose wells draw from underground water tables.
And the source of those chemicals? Well, that’s just “a matter of deduction,” Saunders said.
“These are man-made chemicals, they shouldn’t be in our well water — and I have two paper plants within a few miles of my home,” he said.
For well over a century, the paper industry has been a core part of both Maine’s economy and the state’s environmental challenges. Today’s paper mills are dramatically cleaner than a few decades ago, thanks to better technology and environmental laws shepherded through Congress by the late Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie, who grew up along the heavily polluted banks of the Androscoggin River.
But growing health concerns about PFAS — per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances — are shining an intense spotlight on industries that utilized the substances for decades to produce everything from nonstick cookware to waterproof jackets and countless other products that are everywhere in modern culture. Dubbed forever chemicals because of their extreme durability, some compounds within the PFAS family have been linked to cancer, kidney disease, low birthweight, high cholesterol and immune system disruption, among other problems.
Paper mills have used a lot of PFAS — and in some cases still do — in the coatings that keep grease or liquids from soaking through picnic plates, takeout food containers, pizza boxes, microwave popcorn bags and fast-food wrappers.
“They have legacy use of PFAS, almost certainly,” said John Gardella, an attorney at CBMG3 Law in Boston who specializes in environmental law and advises clients on PFAS issues. “The question is, how long were you using it and what did you do with the (sludge) that came from the waste?”
According to records compiled by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, which licensed and regulated the land application of sludge, eight paper companies spread more than 500,000 cubic yards of paper mill waste in Maine between 1989 and 2016. That is a conservative and potentially incomplete figure, nor does it include the hundreds of thousands of cubic yards spread by wastewater treatment plants, some of which process paper mill sludge and wastewater.
Not all paper mills in Maine or nationwide have used PFAS. And while environmental and health advocates disagree, chemical industry representatives say newer varieties of PFAS do not pose the health threat of earlier compounds no longer in use.
But DEP staff members now face the daunting task of determining which among more than 500 sites that received sludge from wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities should get top priority for testing, based on the volume of waste and the source of that sludge. Sites that received waste from paper mills, tanneries and electroplating facilities could get higher priority because of potential PFAS contamination.
“It is absolutely a huge undertaking,” said DEP Commissioner Melanie Loyzim. “We are going to be sweeping across the state and keeping fingers crossed that we will find positive results rather than the heartrending results we shave seen out of Fairfield.”

CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT Gardella said as more states begin testing drinking water for PFAS — as Maine is set to require by the end of next year — their regulatory agencies will also try to track down the source of any contamination that turns up.
Manufacturers’ legal use and disposal of the chemicals decades before the current health concerns “doesn’t protect any company from legal liability down the line,” said Gardella, who has written about PFAS lawsuits for the National Law Review.
“And that is the issue that these companies, particularly paper mills, have to face,” he said. “The fact that they didn’t know the dangers of PFAS because (chemical manufacturers) duPont or 3M didn’t tell them, that doesn’t matter in these lawsuits.”
In fact, Saunders filed one of the lawsuits that Gardella and other attorneys are closely tracking.
The Fairfield resident is the lead plaintiff in a class-action suit accusing paper companies of “willful, wanton, reckless and outrageous use, emission, discharge, disposal, distribution and spraying of PFAS throughout Somerset and Kennebec Counties.”
The lawsuit initially named only one paper mill as a defendant: The Sappi North America facility in Skowhegan, although previous owners S.D. Warren, Scott Paper and Kimberly-Clark were also named. But Saunders’ attorney expanded the list of defendants last month to include Huhtamaki’s paper mill in Waterville, the Jay mill now operated by Pixelle Specialty Solutions (formerly Verso) and a half-dozen other companies currently or formerly involved in papermaking in Maine.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Determining which Maine paper mills have used PFAS in their manufacturing processes is extremely difficult because they were not required to report that data under either state or federal laws. Paper companies are also notoriously competitive and secretive about their processes.
That changes this year.
Industrial facilities nationwide were required to report discharges of more than 120 types of PFAS in reports due to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month. All of Maine’s paper mills as well as hundreds of other facilities, both public and private, are required to file reports to the Toxics Release Inventory.
Data from the closely watched TRI likely won’t be available until later this year. But the reports will provide the first-ever comprehensive assessment of PFAS releases into the air, water and soils in Maine and across the country.
Unfortunately, those reports will only reflect current, not historic, uses of PFAS.
Few representatives of paper companies responded to interview requests or questions from the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram about current or past use of PFAS.
One of the companies that did not respond to multiple requests is Huhtamaki, the Finland-based company that manufactures the Chinet brand of paper dishware in Waterville. A California class-action lawsuit against Huhtamaki claims Chinet is made with PFAS. And the Waterville facility is the largest single contributor of wastewater to the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District plant that was licensed to spread treated sludge on farm fields in Fairfield, Unity, Benton and other towns.
Sappi has denied any responsibility for the PFAS contamination in Fairfield and other towns.
“Sappi strongly disputes the contention that Sappi’s Somerset mill is the source of the PFAS contamination in Fairfield,” Olga Karagiannis, spokeswoman for Sappi North America, said in a statement. “Sappi is well known for its record of environmental stewardship at the Somerset mill and the rest of our manufacturing facilities. As Sappi has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit, we won’t be providing any further comment.”

MADAWASKA PLANT But a representative for one major papermaker in Maine, Twin Rivers Paper Co., has spoken openly about both the use of PFAS at the company’s Madawaska plant as well as efforts to phase out the chemicals.
“Twin Rivers Paper has a large business — nearly half of its production in Maine — built on food packaging grades, some of which use PFAS chemistry,” Brian McAlary, vice president of business development with Twin Rivers, told state lawmakers in May. “Twin Rivers is committed to finding innovative solutions to replacing PFAS in its food packaging products over the next two years, according to the EPA guidelines.”
At the time, Maine lawmakers were considering a DEP-backed bill requiring that all manufacturers disclose to the agency any products sold in Maine containing “intentionally added” PFAS. The bill, which became law last week, also prohibits the sale of PFAS-treated carpets and rugs starting in 2023 and expands that prohibition to all products in 2030 unless the DEP deems PFAS an “unavoidable use.”
McAlary pointed out that PFAS manufacturers are phasing out the chemicals in coatings for paperboard food packaging and grease-resistant papers — such as clamshell takeout food containers, disposable dinnerware and fast-food wrappers — under a July 2020 agreement with the Food and Drug Administration.
Twin Rivers is committed to ending its use of PFAS by the end of 2023, but McAlary added that it “will not be easy, quick, or an inexpensive process.” In a subsequent interview with the Press Herald/Sunday Telegram, McAlary said the company already offers multiple PFAS-free varieties in the U.S. and Europe and that products containing the chemicals “are not a large portion of the business.”
“If you go back four or five years ago, there was a real push for our company internally to move,” McAlary said. “We saw this happening in Europe and there was an opportunity to differentiate with our competitors.”

MILK SAMPLES It was random sampling of milk taken from grocery store shelves that led state regulators to detect startling levels of PFAS in milk from a Fairfield dairy farm. That discovery sparked additional testing, which to date has discovered 164 PFAS-contaminated wells in Fairfield, Unity, Benton and Oakland — with more expected as the investigation’s circle expands outward.
All of these localized hot spots have a common denominator: Nearby crop fields fertilized with sludge. Much of that sludge appears to have come from the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District, which processes wastewater from Waterville, Fairfield, Winslow, Benton, Oakland and Vassalboro.
Between 1981 and 2003, the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District spread more than 285,000 cubic yards of biosolids — the industry name for treated sludge — at sites in more than a dozen towns, according to DEP documents.
There is no wrongdoing suggested on the sanitary district’s part or among the dozens of other wastewater treatment facilities statewide that operated biosolids programs, some of which are still active today. The application sites were fully licensed and approved by the DEP under a state-promoted “beneficial reuse” program that provided farmers with free nutrients for their crops and helped municipalities and sewer districts avoid paying landfill costs — costs ultimately borne by ratepayers.
“That’s the way it was — it was a hot commodity for farmers to be able to have compost for their farms,” said Nicholas Champagne, superintendent of the Kennebec Sanitary Treatment District.
Since spring 2019, treatment plants that plan to land-apply sludge are required to periodically test their biosolids for PFAS. Land applications of the materials have declined significantly as a result because test results showing elevated PFAS levels would trigger additional testing at the fertilization site.
Champagne, who only took over as superintendent at the Kennebec district in January 2020, said all of the facility’s sludge is now landfilled. Sludge testing results from May 2019 showed concentrations of the two most heavily scrutinized compounds, PFOS and PFOA, above the state’s screening levels but nowhere near the levels found in drinking water in Fairfield and neighboring towns.
“We are seeing these astronomical test results come out of Fairfield and the thing that is puzzling is we are testing our sludge today, but it could have been something from 20 or 30 years ago,” Champagne said.
The state’s recently enacted budget contains $30 million for PFAS-related initiatives at the DEP and the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The DEP share includes 11 permanent full-time positions and six temporary positions to help test more than 500 sludge application sites and to pay for installation of activated carbon filtration systems on contaminated wells. A separate fund aims to help impacted farmers recover financially.
Loyzim, the DEP’s commissioner, said it was unclear whether those tests will reveal additional large hot spots similar to that of Fairfield tied to any industries in Maine. She noted that Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire have been more aggressive than most other states in testing for PFAS contamination.
“I can’t help but suspect that we may appear to have a bigger problem, in part, because we have been proactive in looking for it,” Loyzim said.

PAPER MILL WASTE No one knows how much PFAS was in sludge or paper mill waste spread across Maine 30, 20 or even five years ago because industries were not required to report usage or discharge of the chemicals until this year.
But paper companies spread a lot of waste across the landscape, according to a DEP compilation of licensed application sites.
Great Northern Paper, which operated mills in the Millinocket region, applied more than 100,000 cubic yards of waste in the 1980s and 1990s in towns or unorganized territories in Penobscot and Aroostook counties, according to an analysis of the DEP data.
Likewise, the International Paper (later Verso) mill in Jay disposed of another 100,000-plus cubic yards of waste through either land application or conversion to compost from the late 1980s to late 1990s. Fields that received “bio-ash” from the facility were located throughout western and southern Maine, from Richmond and Bowdoinham to West Paris.
DEP records indicate that the mills operated by S.D. Warren and Scott Paper in Westbrook and Skowhegan applied several hundred thousand cubic yards of sludge and bio-ash to dozens of locations in farm fields and land owned by paper or timberland companies between 1988 and 1998. Some was also landfilled.
One of S.D. Warren’s more than 25 application sites was Stoneridge Farm in the York County town of Arundel.
In late 2016, farm owner Fred Stone was notified by the local water district that a well located on his property contained elevated levels of types of PFAS. That discovery cracked open the first case in Maine of PFAS contamination linked to application of sludge and/or paper mill waste.
In the years since, Stone has lost all his livelihood because he is no longer able to sell milk from his century-old dairy farm commercially. He has disposed of much of his herd — “The 35 left are animals I just can’t kill,” he said — and been the subject of international media coverage about the unfortunate intersection of PFAS and farming.
While testifying on a bill to create a special PFAS testing program for farm fields, Stone presented lawmakers with a copy of a 1986 licensing letter from the DEP stating that biosolids “will not pollute any water of the state” and “will not constitute a hazard to health or welfare.”
“They were pushing this to beat holy hell,” Stone said in an interview. “DEP was out here telling us how great this material was as a soil amendment. … We were trying to bring in money wherever we could bring in money and we were trying to cut down on the cost of production, and that’s why we did what we did.”
Stone said he knows that farmers in Gorham, Westbrook, Steep Falls and other towns also spread waste from the paper mill on their farms. Some of those are still farms, Stone said, while others grew housing developments.

‘RACING TO FIND ALTERNATIVES’ Patrick Strauch, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council, said paper mills in Maine have diversified in recent years to replace paper products that are no longer in high demand — such as newsprint — and expanded to packaging, boxboard and other products, some of which use PFAS.
“It’s a very competitive situation but the industry is racing to find alternatives,” he said.
Strauch, who represents paper and forest industry companies in regulatory and legislative matters in Augusta, has urged state lawmakers not to treat all PFAS the same as PFOS and PFOA, two well-studied compounds that are no longer produced or used in manufacturing in the U.S.
Asked about the paper industry’s liability concerns regarding PFAS, Strauch said companies and society as a whole need to figure out how best to respond to contamination concerns.
“The sites that were contaminated by PFAS in the past were all sites that were permitted by the DEP and biosolids were tested, so everyone has to take some ownership in this new information,” Strauch said.
He added, however, that market demand is already driving companies to seek out “more natural solutions.”
“Everybody is working at it,” Strauch said of the transition to PFAS-free products. “It is certainly where consumers want to go.”
Gardella, the Boston-based attorney with CMBG3 Law who counsels clients on PFAS legal and regulatory issues, agreed that paper companies switching to alternative chemistries is “a good step, and one they absolutely need to take.”
Nonetheless, companies in every industry — not just papermaking — that used PFAS in the past are still “at incredibly great risk right now” as public pressure builds on state and federal regulators to respond to existing contamination.
“The regulatory agencies don’t care, truthfully, that you had a permit to discharge this effluent or waste,” Gardella said. “It doesn’t matter. Now there is a problem with PFAS contamination and they want that contamination cleaned up.”

AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE Back in Fairfield, Saunders is unsure what the future holds for his home and others in this rural neighborhood where he has lived for more than three decades.
“The view from here is wonderful for me,” Saunders said. “There are no houses. … We are very close to town. We just love being here.”
A few minutes later, however, he added: “I picked the worst place to live as far as high levels” of PFAS.
Within two months of his well water testing at 12,910 parts per trillion for PFAS — compared to a federal health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion — the DEP had installed a water filtration system in his basement at no cost to him. Other homes on his road had PFAS levels in excess of 20,000 and 30,000 parts per trillion compared to the state’s new health level of 20 parts per trillion.
Saunders’ water now reads “non-detect” for the roughly two dozen PFAS compounds analyzed by the monthly follow-up tests. Even so, Saunders’ wife, who has endured kidney problems in recent years that the couple speculates could be linked to PFAS, won’t drink the water.
Like many homeowners, Saunders had hoped the years of sweat equity his family spent expanding their home and landscaped grounds would help pad his retirement savings if and when the couple decides to sell. But who is going to want to buy a house with a contaminated well and potentially contaminated soils? he asks.
The class-action lawsuit Saunders filed wants the paper companies to pay for ongoing medical monitoring for anyone in Somerset and Kennebec counties who may have been exposed to PFAS.
Personal injury lawsuits have not yet been filed, but they are likely coming.
Standing in his kitchen, Saunders dipped into a packed folder to pull out a federal chart showing the range of PFAS levels in blood samples from workers at the duPont and 3M factories where the chemicals were produced and utilized.
On the highest end, factory workers averaged roughly 1,000 and 700 parts per trillion for the two most problematic compounds, PFOS and PFOA. Saunders’ blood levels were 1,100 and 1,400 parts per trillion.
“And I got that sitting in my living room,” Saunders said. “That’s enough to make someone upset.”

Texto completo: Holden Anderson, Windham senior, midfield: One of nine boys' All-America selections in Maine, Anderson was one of the best in the state taking faceoffs, winning 82 percent against a tough schedule. He scored 12 goals, to go with 18 assists and 108 ground balls as a two-way middie. He will continue his career at Vassar College.
Alex Callahan, Scarborough senior, defense: An All-America selection, the sturdy 6-foot-1 defender excelled and earned respect against the state's best teams. Callahan had 33 ground balls and 14 caused turnovers. He will continue his career at Seton Hill, a top Division II program in Greensburg, Pennsylvania.
Colin Campbell, Cape Elizabeth senior, midfield: When Campbell returned from missing the first third of the season because of an ankle sprain, the already powerful Capers really took off thanks to his all-around offensive skills and a wicked outside shot. Campbell finished with 30 goals, 24 assists, 29 ground balls and nine caused turnovers.
Padraic Condon, Berwick Academy senior, midfield: The most dominant faceoff man in the state, winning 89 percent, the South Berwick resident led the Bulldogs to the top seed in Class A South and a near upset of unbeaten Cape Elizabeth in the regional final. Condon also scored 20 goals and had 17 assists. An All-America selection, he will continue his career at St. Lawrence University.
Wyatt Kerr, Falmouth senior, attack: Possessing an extremely hard and accurate shot, Kerr led one of the top attack units in the state for the Class A North champions. An All-American, he finished with 43 goals and 16 assists, scoring on 51 percent of his shots, while picking up 21 ground balls and causing seven turnovers.
Jacek Kudas, Kennebunk junior, goalie: The consensus pick as the top goalie in the state, Kudas averaged 17 saves a game. "We relied on him to be able to stop outside shots and he kept us in a lot of games. We beat Yarmouth, 4-3, and it was all because of him," said Rams Coach Christopher Gassman. Kudas has verbally committed to play at Lafayette University.
Tiernan Lathrop, Cape Elizabeth junior, midfield: A physically dominating player, Lathrop raised his game in the playoffs, scoring four goals in a tense 11-9 Class A South final win at Berwick Academy and six in the 19-6 state final victory over Falmouth. Lathrop routinely cleared the ball on long solo runs through would-be defenders. The All-American scored 53 goals and had 17 assists.
Archie McEvoy, Cape Elizabeth senior, attack: A quick player with slick stickhandling skills, McEvoy was a consummate playmaker on offense and the unquestioned leader for the Class A champions. An All-America pick and the Varsity Maine Player of the Year, McEvoy had 56 goals, 35 assists, 39 ground balls and 18 caused turnovers. He will continue his career at Union College.
Gavin Simopoulos, Cape Elizabeth senior, defense: Strong and rugged with nimble footwork, Simopoulos consistently shut down the top attack threat for opponents, and along with senior goalie Charlie Whitney, led a defense that allowed only 65 goals in 16 games. Simopoulos caused 25 turnovers, picked up 40 ground balls and scored once, with three assists.
Colin Senger, Yarmouth senior, long-stick midfielder: Senger's coach, Jon Miller, considers him "the best long-stick middie in the state," and the "leader of our team." Yarmouth won the Class B state title. Senger covered opponents' top midfielder, played nearly all defensive possessions and was a wing on faceoffs. Senger had 61 ground balls and 30 takeaways.
Alex St. John, Thornton Academy junior, defense: It's not often a defender is voted a league-wide player of the year, but St. John earned that honor in the SMAA. A starter on Thornton's 2019 state title team, St. John scooped up 95 ground balls and caused 24 turnovers while scoring 10 goals with five assists. He has verbally committed to play at Division I High Point.
Ben Tukey, Gorham senior, attack: A captain, Tukey led the Rams to an 11-1 regular-season record and 12-2 overall mark. He led Gorham in goals (53) and ground balls (56) while adding 34 assists, and scored on 52 percent of his shots. Tukey will continue his career at Castleton State.
COACH OF THE YEAR
Ralph Ruocco, Marshwood: In his second stint as Marshwood's head coach, Ruocco guided a team loaded with sophomores to a 12-4 overall record and a Class B runner-up finish. Ruocco coached the Hawks from 2010-13 and then 2017-21, but now is retiring. "This is the second time Ralph's taken Marshwood form a non-contender to a legitimate state champion contender," said Thornton Coach Ryan Hersey.

Texto completo: We need to stay vigilant and focused as the shadow of COVID remains ever present, J.P. Devine writes.
And I begin. I wash my hands so many times a day I no longer have any feeling in the fingers, but I follow the rules and continue to focus.
This habit was tattooed on my brain by the nuns, my mother and She, who took over from them.
Unlike many survivors of this pandemic, I suffer from a touch of OCD. When this horror broke out, I was the first to sign up for compliance 101. (I have a long record of this. The last hand I shook was Bobby Kennedy’s, and you know how that turned out.)
For example, consider visiting a store’s men’s room, a chamber of pandemic horrors, when a common error occurs.
You’ve touched the handle to two doors without thinking. What to do?
You pause. What, do you not touch?
I learned some tricks in this dilemma. I can’t share them with you here. You have to learn on your own. Focus.
And there’s cash. I stopped using cash long ago, but when I was recently handed a $10 bill, I froze.
It could have been given as a tip in a bar in Honolulu, then moved to San Francisco, through Las Vegas, where they’ve just seen the highest rate of infection in the nation, to Boston, over to East L.A, where it was found in the pocket of a corpse in the morgue.
I left it somewhere … as a tip.
Long ago, mid-pandemic, I resorted to using any one of the pile of credit cards I carry in my sanitized bag.
If on occasion, I have to hand one to a clerk, I only use the index finger and thumb to retrieve it, handling it like a deceased rodent. You should see the looks I get when I do that.
But I don’t wipe everything down the way I did when this madness swept into our lives. Focus fades. COVID? Delta? Alpha? Which one is it now? I forget. I’d better check it out. Focus.
Masks? I still wear one of my collection of 30 masks everywhere, even when it gets weird. And it does.
Now, as rules have eased, I find that I’m the only masked shopper remaining in my local market.
Keeping focus, I persist, even though I feel like a Sioux warrior in the 7th Calvary men’s room. Everyone stares at me and giggles.
Avoiding crowds grows harder. Look at these recent headlines:
• Maine’s fairs, and some festivals, plan to return this summer and fall
• Summer entertainment season returns to central Maine
• Crowds turn up at final day of the Monmouth Fair
Humans, especially American humans, are addicted to crowds, from Black Fridays to car sales to every sporting event in the book.
This weekend, I scanned the award-winning photographer Michael G. Seamans’ shots of one such crowd at the opening of the 24th Maine International Film Festival.
I counted one mask and scant social distancing in the audience.
Was everyone there completely vaccinated? The lady to the right? The fella to your left? The young kids behind you? Really?
And the band plays on as COVID cases rise in 41 states and D.C.
Get your shots. Wear your masks and stop giggling at me. Focus.
Breaking News:
Maine CDC reports 22 new COVID-19 cases, no more deaths.
FOCUS!

Texto completo: Galen Hand never drank a lot of soda when he was growing up in Portland. His parents gave him water with fruit in it to drink instead.
When he became an adult and hard seltzer hit the market, it seemed like the perfect drink for Hand. But he couldn't stomach it - literally. He couldn't enjoy the seltzer, he said, "without any of the discomfort of carbonation - the bloating, the burping. For me, I always get heartburn."
Figuring other people must share the same problem, Hand and two of his college friends - he graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 2016 with a business degree - founded a company called NOCA, shorthand for no carbonation.
Now this 2012 graduate of Cheverus High School is now selling boozy water without the burps. His company is based in South Boston, and his product can be found in most of New England, greater Philadelphia and New Jersey. It launched in Maine early last summer, and is available here at Hannaford and Market Basket.
Hand said three Maine experts in the beverage industry offered him valuable advice that helped him build his company: Fred Forsley and Paul Sottery at Shipyard Brewing Co., and Luke Livingston, founder of Baxter Brewing Co. "I had no experience other than as a consumer in the alcoholic beverage space," Hand said. "I think they saw a young entrepreneur who was trying to do something different, and they offered perspective that was really appreciated."
Like most hard seltzer, NOCA water has a fermented cane sugar base. It's gluten free, and has 95 calories and 3 grams of carbs in a 12-ounce can. The ABV is 4.5 percent, similar to that of hard seltzer. What it doesn't have: bubbles.
The water comes in eight flavors, including mango, berry, and watermelon lime.
Hand says although he can't handle hard seltzer, he still likes to drink craft beer.
"Trust me," he said, "I can't grow up in Maine without drinking Shipyard."

Texto completo: Most folks in southern Maine have heard of Portland's First Friday Art Walk. But what you might not know is that 30 minutes north of Portland, Brunswick has a Second Friday Art Walk. All sorts of galleries open their doors, including Spindleworks.
Spindleworks isn't just an art gallery. It's a nonprofit arts center for adults with disabilities and a day program of the Independence Association of Brunswick, "whose mission is to help children and adults with disabilities achieve full and inclusive lives in their chosen community."
It was rainy, and late in the evening, so I was the only visitor, which made me feel pretty special. Spindleworks is housed in an old Victorian, and it has what my generation calls "a good vibe," humming with creative energy.
If you're into architecture at all, you have got to go see the wide floorboards (most of which are paint-splattered) and the tin ceilings (most of which are not). It's the sort of house where every closet feels like it could conceivably lead to Narnia. There's even a secret hidden staircase, which isn't usually accessible to members of the public. (I got to see it because, full disclosure, I'm dating a staff member.)
The house is divvied up into rooms that are each dedicated to a particular craft - the sculpture room, the drawing room (which may have once, in a previous lifetime, been the home's - well - drawing room), the painting room; a media studio; an enormous textile room with looms and embroidery hoops hanging from the exposed beams. There are fiber art sculptures protruding from the wall; mannequins with costumes tucked in the corner, and a whole series of paintings of Bill Clinton, for some reason.
I love browsing funky little shops and galleries, places where you can buy bright and colorful items that you might not need, but that you want. And I realized, as I was standing there devouring sculptures with my eyeballs, that this was the first time I had been to any sort of shop other than Hannaford in well over a year. So I went a little wild. Actually, I went a lot wild.
I walked out of there with a large canvas painting of daylilies; a coordinating throw pillow; a purple woven chenille scarf and matching sachet stuffed with pine potpourri; a dishtowel embroidered with a patriotic Stars-and-Stripes-and-a-Liberty-Bell theme (for my mom, who loves fancy dishtowels), and a shirt with a shiny gold leopard printed on the front. If I'd had more arms for carrying and more wall space to display, I probably would have walked out of there with even more stuff
My boyfriend tried to tell me, gently, that while Spindleworks appreciated the support, didn't I maybe think I was going a little overboard? I hissed at him and after that he was very supportive of my patronage of the arts. (The profits, by the way, are split: Seventy-five percent of the sale price goes to the artist, and 25 percent of it goes back to the program for purchase of supplies.)
A lot of art looks the same to me, regardless if it was made by an amateur or a professional, if it's selling for $10 or a million. An abstract painting is an abstract painting is an abstract painting. A lot of art galleries have vast amounts of blank space; they take the pieces and display them in a white void without context.
Those places tend to feel sterile and expensive to me - I don't feel particularly comfortable in them, mostly on account of I am broke and uncultured and failed the only art history class I ever took in college. Maybe it's because of the building, which was once a home, or maybe because it is a place of creation, not just display, or maybe it's because of the people who work there, but Spindleworks feels warm and welcoming when you walk in, even for an English major who doesn't know a Monet from a Matisse.
Our society tends to define people with disabilities by what they can't do, not by what they can. Even the word "disability" contains the negative prefix "dis," from the Latin "away" or "apart" - so "dis-ability" can, and often is, thought of as being away or apart from ability.
But at Spindleworks, the artists, who do have disabilities, are defined by their abilities: specifically, their creative or artistic abilities. I don't have a disability, but I certainly don't have the artistic ability that these artists do. (My talent, writing, is descriptive, rather than generative.) At Spindleworks, it's not particularly important that Anna has Down syndrome; what's important is that she weaves gorgeous chenille scarves. She's also published two books so far. (I wish I were half as talented as she is.)
If all you hear about in the media is haggling over funding for services (never enough) and arguments over accommodations (also never enough) you might find yourself thinking of disability in the negative - all take, no give. But go to the bright blue house on a quiet residential street in a seaside town in Maine and you will see it bursting with life and love and all kinds of beautiful things being brought into the world.
Anyway, the next Second Friday Art Walk in downtown Brunswick is on Aug. 13. I don't know what the weather will be like, but if you get the chance, I would absolutely recommend visiting Spindleworks at 7 Lincoln St. After all, if some horrible mutant strain of COVID-19 emerges and we all have to hide inside our houses for an entire year, you're going to want something nice on your wall to look at.

Texto completo: In Maine, Swinger was well-known for hosting and producing the cable TV music show, 'ALIVE! From Johnson Hall,' for nine years in Gardiner.

Martin Swinger dedicated his life to music and songwriting, inspiring countless musicians throughout the country and entertaining captive audiences for decades. His unexpected passing on July 5 at age 66 devastated family, friends and fans, but they said his impact will continue to resonate throughout the state and beyond.
In Maine, Swinger was well-known for hosting and producing the cable TV show, “ALIVE! From Johnson Hall,” broadcast in Gardiner. The program lasted nine years and showcased numerous Maine musicians.
Martin’s music is described by those who knew him as personal, heartfelt and authentic.
“In the classical sense, you’d call him a folk singer,” said Michael Miclon, executive and artistic director of Johnson Hall, “but he was truly a singer-songwriter. His songs were quite beautiful. His style was very personal, and his personality seemed to shine through his music quite well to me. He was very accomplished in both playing and singing.”
“His music is so diverse,” said Ed DesJardins, who has known and performed with Swinger for several years, and also produced and engineered his last two albums. “It always reminded me of show tunes in a way. These weren’t simple folks songs; these songs were really big. They had a lot going on, much more in the way of a super high quality piece that would be written for a play or a show, rather than a hit you’d hear on the radio. He could write extremely tender, tear-jerker songs, but he could also be outrageous.”
Alfred Lund, a fellow musician who performed with Swinger for more than two decades, described his songs similarly.
“His songwriting was deeply descriptive,” said Lund, “often times showing compassion through descriptive and accessible imagery. He absolutely knew his craft, and chose to write songs that illustrated how much caring he brought into his own view of the world.”
Swinger grew up in Georgia and began singing in the first grade. He was already writing his own songs by the time he was a teenager. Inspired by a love of poetry and artists like Paul Simon and Harry Nilsson, he formed a band in high school. His love of performance led him to major in theater at Valdosta State College in Georgia and, in 1977, he helped found the iconic Theatrical Outfit in Atlanta, which created original plays for all audiences that frequently featured his original songs.
His talents led him to begin performing on the East Coast, and he eventually won a Certificate of Merit for his song “Look Who’s Cryin’ Now” at the American Song Festival.
And in addition to inspiring, teaching and collaborating with countless Maine musicians, he and his husband, Brian Kaufman, were among the first couples in Maine to have a same-sex wedding.
Together, Swinger and Kaufman also worked on the creation of an educational board game called “Rainbow Quest!” which teaches lessons about LGBTQ milestones.
“It’s a game anyone can play, but it’s specifically designed to help people be more open about their sexuality,” said DesJardins. “It’s just a gentle, smart game, and I think it’s going to help a lot of people who are struggling. He was always working on the game, and that was really going to pay off for him.”
DesJardins produced Swinger’s final two albums: “Moon” and “Living Things.” He said Swinger was likely the most memorable musician he’s worked with as a collaborator, producer and engineer.
He describes “Moon” as an ethereal album, with spacious reverb and electric guitars and “Living Things” as a purely acoustic album, with mandolins, upright basses and acoustic guitars.
“The idea was to keep it grounded and real sounding,” DesJardins said of Swinger’s final album. “The subject of the album was nature, so it turned out to be an acoustic record.”
The album begins with the song “God Loves,” which suggests that God’s love is similar to that of the unconditional love that dogs provide.
“He’s slyly putting together the kind of love a dog gives you, where they’re just happy you’re alive and want to play,” said Lund. “It says something about his relationship with God, that there is something playful about his relationship with God. That’s my favorite song of his, bar none.”
Lund first met Martin about 25 years ago during an AIDS walk in Hallowell. At the time, he was working as a massage therapist and he and his wife volunteered massages for people after the walk.
“My impression then was that he was a real pied piper,” he said. “He had an infectious, positive attitude and brought a lot of love into everything he did. I’ve been a musician all my life and I was just struck by how positive, upbeat, enthusiastic and caring he was, and this was at an event that was trying to bring awareness to what was, at that point, a difficult issue.”
Swinger also taught songwriting to children, and Lund commended his ability for helping people foster their natural talents.
“He was really excellent at helping people come up with their own lyrics, and then turning that into a song,” Lund said.
Miclon first met Swinger in the early 1990s at a New England vaudeville festival, and saw him perform with a group called “Zingo Zango Generic Jug Band.”
“They were hilarious,” he said, “but you could also tell that they were actually really great musicians. I was a performer there as well, and Martin’s personality on stage was just as lovely off stage.”
And while Miclon was not director of Johnson Hall at the time Swinger hosted his television series at the theater, he said the show undoubtedly left a lasting impact on the arts and musical scene in the state.
“It elevated the profile of Johnson Hall significantly, but it also showcased some incredible singers and bands from around the state and gave them a lot of exposure,” he said. “That’s part of our mission at Johnson Hall, to elevate artists.”
Before he took the job at Johnson Hall, Miclon recalled a show at which both he and Swinger were about to perform, and discussed the facility’s future potential.
“He wanted it to be a dance space, and wanted to figure out a way to make the seats retractable and have a stage that lowers into the floor with the push of a button,” he said. “He never thought you should be sitting still when listening to music, and that’s what he was afraid of — people building this beautiful hall but nobody can move.”
Miclon laughed and said he could remember thinking, “This is crazy, but it’s a great idea.”
Both Miclon and Lund said they are discussing hosting a tribute show in honor of Swinger later this year, however no firm plans have been finalized as of mid-July.
“He was such a dear person,” said Miclon. “He was very giving to other artists, too. He loved to give people other opportunities and did a lot of songwriting classes. He tried to nurture people that way. There are a lot of great musicians, singers and songwriters out there, but not many people like Martin who really gave themselves to what they were doing. That’s part of why this is leaving such a big hole, he was such a caring person and not everyone is like that.”
“Martin worked at Slates as a waiter, and he brought a spark to everything he did there,” said Lund. “And in Augusta he worked at Margaritas. He was an ‘old man’ to all the kids there, but he was the first one to jump up and sing ‘Happy Birthday.’ He was a spark, absolutely.”
DesJardins said working together with Swinger helped him grow as an artist.
“He certainly left a huge impact on me,” said DesJardins. “I’ve never been quite so sad about losing someone as I was about losing him. As a songwriter, producer and engineer, he always said that I helped him, that he couldn’t do it without me, but what he did for me is immeasurable. If I’m mixing an album now, I think about the decisions he made. If I’m writing a song, and I want to make it count, I’ll think about him and what he would’ve done. It helps me write a better song. I’m pretty sure he did that for a lot of people.”

Texto completo: The annual summer football game was back Saturday, but as a 7-on-7 tournament, Travis Lazarczyk writes.
with a twist
LEWISTON — The Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl has been a staple of Wyatt Hathaway’s summer pretty much his entire life. Almost every year, his father, Leavitt High School football coach Mike Hathaway, volunteers to coach in the game. Young Wyatt was almost always at his father’s side, even staying in the dorm at training camp some nights.
“I’m 18 years old and I’ve probably been to 15, 16 of them,” Hathaway said.
Hathaway and the rest of the class of 2021 got their Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl moment Saturday, at Don Roux Field at Lewiston High School.
It was different, as so much has been different in the 16 months since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
This year, the Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl was a 7-on-7 two-hand touch football tournament. Maine high school football teams played 7-on-7 last fall instead of either 11 or 8-man tackle football. There wasn’t enough time for the Shriners to organize a real game for this year’s event. Really, after a season in which nobody in the state played tackle football, making the Lobster Bowl a 7-on-7 game was a good idea. Nobody has made a tackle in over a year.
Eight teams, each featuring some of the best high school football players in the state. Players won’t take home a blue West jersey or red East jersey this season. Their souvenir will be a t-shirt. This year, you didn’t play for a region in the Lobster Bowl. You played for a color.
“I was looking forward to the game, like every teenage kid that plays football in the state of Maine. I’m just glad we can all come out here, get with all the best players in the state of Maine and play football,” Hathaway said.
These guys won’t share memories of two-a-day practices and staying in the hot dorm rooms during training camp at Foxcroft Academy. They won’t talk about bonding with that kid who was a fierce rival during the high school season, and feeling those grudges melt. The eight teams met for the first time Saturday morning, when they got together for a quick practice.
Most years, the Lobster Bowl participants raise between $100,000 and $120,000 for the Shriner’s hospitals for children in Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts. In a typical year, the athletes have three or four months from the time they are selected to participate to when they report to training camp. This year’s even came together over the last few weeks. Despite that, players raised $16,000.
Hathaway raised a little of $500.
“We have a little corner store a couple minutes away from my house, and I put a donation jar out there. I think I got almost 70 bucks from it in one day,” Hathaway said. “People around the community supported me. I’m glad everybody knows how good a game this is for all the children in the hospitals.”
Two-hand touch or in full pads, put these guys on a football field and the competitive fires are stoked. Games were played inside the 40-yard line at each end of Don Roux Field, as well as the infield of the track next door. When Hathaway completed a 35-yard pass down the middle to Tyreek Rose of Noble, then hit Noble for the winning 2-point conversion on the next play, Team Green celebrated as much as they would’ve in a regular game.
“All morning we were talking about it. Some people may not take it that serious, but we came here to win. We all want to win. All the guys over there are just as competitive as me and the three coaches behind me,” Hathaway said, pointing over his shoulder at the Team Green coaching staff: his father, Cony head coach BL Lippert and Bonny Eagle head coach Kevin Cooper.
One of the players catching passes from Hathaway was Robby Dorman of Dexter. The last time Dorman played in a tackle football game, he was anchoring the offensive line as Dexter’s center. Saturday, he was a sure-handed tight end, reaching behind himself to catch Hathaway’s first touchdown pass of the day. Dorman downplayed his position change.
“I played tight end freshman year and got moved sophomore year. I have some experience. At a small school, you’ve got to move around a lot. I played tight end in 7-on-7, and I was going to senior year if we had a regular season, but obviously that changed,” Dorman said.
Had this been a normal Lobster Bowl, Dorman and Hathaway would have been on opposing teams. Instead, they got to be teammates, and the converted center caught passes from a state champion quarterback.
“He’s insanely good. He’s the best quarterback I’ve ever played with,” Dorman said of Hathaway. “It’s different, but I’m glad we’re having something.”
The patients at Shriner’s hospitals will be glad too. The players in the 2021 Lobster Bowl won’t have the memories their counterparts from earlier seasons made. Knowing they helped a lot of kids, that memory, the most important Lobster Bowl memory, they’ll share.

Texto completo: heck out Berry the Bear on Instagram, and you'll catch a video of him tearing down the road on a motorcycle with his friend, Shell the Lobster, as "Born to Be Wild" plays loudly in the background. They end their road trip roped up and rock climbing together, slaking their thirst with a can of hard seltzer.
In another video, Shell picks up a hitchhiking Berry and they drive to Portland. They wander around the Old Port, where they visit a few restaurants, including, of course, the Thirsty Pig.
Berry and Shell are mascots for Wild Maine Hard Seltzer. (A third, Mitch the Moose, likes to jet ski.) They are, the company's slogan goes, "your favorite party animals." Wild Maine Hard Seltzer is owned by Orono Brewing Co., and its new marketing campaign clearly speaks to the thousands of university students nearby who have helped make hard seltzer so popular - remember 2019, aka "White Claw Summer?" It's their love for the bubbly drink that prompted Maine breweries to start canning their own and serving it in their tasting rooms, right next to their latest craft beer.
Maine breweries used a portion of their down time during the pandemic to work on recipes, and a new crop of locally made hard seltzers is now appearing all over the state - both in cans and on tap.
Lone Pine Brewing's OH-J seltzer, brewed with tangerine puree and hops, is crafted to mimic the Portland brewery's popular double IPA. Fogtown Brewing Co. in Ellsworth followed up its Fog Melon with Fog Berry (made with cranberries) and Fog Blue (blueberries and lemon juice), and occasionally makes Fog Blanc, which is blended with sauvignon blanc.
Orono Brewing's Wild Maine Hard Seltzer comes in flavors such as mango-pineapple (Mitch the Moose), blueberry (Berry the Bear), and lemonade (Shell the Lobster). Abe Furth, co-owner of the brewery, says the company plans to release another flavor in August; he wouldn't reveal it, although he did say the mascot would be a raccoon.
As of this writing, Après, which makes hard cider and seltzer, was scheduled to open this weekend in Portland's East Bayside, serving hard seltzers such as the gin-and-tonic-inspired Vesper, made with fresh juniper, coriander and citrus peel.
In March, Sean Sullivan, executive director of the Maine Brewers Guild, took an informal survey of craft breweries to find out how many are making hard seltzers or planned to. The survey is already out of date. He now estimates that at least 20 Maine breweries make hard seltzer, and a handful of others are considering it.
When customers walk through breweries' doors, Sullivan said, they always ask tasting room managers, "What do you have that's new?"
"This summer, I think a lot of our brewers are answering that question with seltzer," he said.
AN INTERNATIONAL TREND
Global hard seltzer sales were more than $4 billion in 2020, an increase of 160 percent over 2019, driven in part by more consumers discovering a taste for it during the pandemic. IRI, a data analytics and market research company, ranked new product launches in 2020 in terms of what was resonating with quarantining consumers, and Bud Light Seltzer was No. 1 on the list, with more than $100 million in sales.
According to Nielsen, sales of hard seltzer in bars and restaurants increased by 73 percent in the summer of 2019, the equivalent of 7.5 million new drinkers.
"The seltzer category is growing rapidly," Sullivan said. "A lot of people love craft beer, yet they also love being active and outdoors and living healthy lifestyles."
Most hard seltzer is made in one of two ways: Many breweries ferment a mixture of cane sugar and water, then add carbonation and flavoring. Others start with distilled spirits rather than doing the fermentation themselves, then add carbonation and flavoring at some point during the process. The hard seltzer craze feeds into consumers' desire for healthier options with less alcohol and fewer calories and carbs than beer or mixed drinks, but just as much flavor. A typical 12-ounce can of flavored hard seltzer clocks in at about 100 calories - sometimes less - and 2 grams of carbs. Hard seltzer is popular with gluten-free consumers because it's not made with grains.
And flavored seltzers appeal to people who like variety. Three summers ago, Peak Organic Brewing Co. in Portland was ahead of the curve when it started making hard seltzer (it produced the first certified organic hard seltzer in the country, according to founder Jon Cadoux). Its repertoire now includes a dozen flavors such as blackberry lime, strawberry cucumber, and lemon elderflower. Cadoux says the seltzers have become "a decent part of our business."
"People are looking for variety packs with multiple flavors, versus one 12-pack of the same flavor," Cadoux said. "No one wants six packs, we've found."
Tom Madden, brewer and co-founder of Lone Pine Brewing Co., believes that the craft beer movement set the table for seltzers in part with the production of fruit-forward beers and "making beer a little less beer-y."
When the local craft beer movement began, its image was of beer geeks brewing in their garages and dreaming of making beer for the masses. It felt like an exclusive club, and intimidating to some casual beer drinkers. Madden says seltzers help brewers be more inclusive, just as his own brewery tried to do with its Portland Pale Ale -- a beer that could stand on its own but was also an easy introduction to craft beer -- and its Holy Donut series of brews made with the popular local doughnuts.
"We're sort of softening the edges of craft beer, making it feel a little less like an exclusive group and more of an opportunity for everybody to enjoy," Madden said, "and I think that's also what seltzer provides to the general public."
That's an important tactic to embrace at a time when tasting rooms are more like community gathering spaces than bars, welcoming families and people of all ages who may or may not be craft beer drinkers. Not offering options for everyone, Maine brewers say, is akin to reserving a table for four at a restaurant and then only one or two people get to eat dinner.
Maine-crafted hard seltzer also provides local options for consumers who have been drinking national brands like White Claw and Truly, just as local craft beer offered alternatives to mass-produced beers such as Miller and Coors.
DRINKER PROFILE
A lot has been made of the appeal of hard seltzer to younger people who grew up after the craft beer explosion and are said to have more adventurous, flavor-seeking palates than their parents. Most brewers say interest does tend to skew younger, but unlike Zima -- a sweeter beer alternative from the '90s that late-night comedians made fun of and was like kryptonite to men - people across the gender spectrum seem to enjoy hard seltzers.
"It definitely crosses gender, and it's maybe skewing younger," Cadoux said. "But that was true with craft beer, too."
Furth examined the demographics of Wild Maine Hard Seltzer's Instagram followers and found that the majority are ages 21 to 44, with the largest age group - 52 percent - falling into the 25-to-34 category. Women account for 56 percent of the followers, men 44 percent.
Kim O'Donnell, 55, likes craft beer just fine - Rising Tide Brewing Co. is right in her neighborhood - but the Portland resident and her partner became big fans of hard seltzer during the pandemic after trying a can of Lone Pine Brewing's blueberry lemon flavor.
"I thought wow, this is dangerously good because it wasn't cloyingly sweet, it was very light, and it went really well with pizza," she said. "It felt like a better alternative to a heavy beer. And now that we've had some hot weather and it's been August in June and July, I personally find the seltzers to be so much more refreshing than a beer because it's not as heavy. It doesn't feel like you're having a vodka tonic or a gin and tonic. It feels a little bit less intense."
So, will hard seltzer seduce Mainers away from craft beer? Is the growth in locally produced craft seltzers an attempt to ward off competition in a crowded craft beer market and cash in on a trend? Maine brewers say it's not that simple, and not one or the other, beer or seltzer, either. (Also, beer has been around for thousands of years and likely isn't going anywhere.) Furth says his team got into making hard seltzers because it's what a lot of the brewery's college-age employees and customers were excited about. And, he points out, Orono Brewing's beer production is actually increasing.
"There's still a lot of room for all the breweries," he said. "And there certainly are a whole lot more people making beer than seltzer here."
According to Nielsen, 75 percent of hard seltzer drinkers also buy beer.
Sullivan said hard seltzer is indeed taking market share away from craft beer, but don't sound the death knell of your favorite IPA just yet. He notes that Maine's craft beer industry has gone from zero to 100 in the past 10 years, which is "a very small amount of time for an industry to mature." He uses the analogy of L.L. Bean: At one point the company decided it could sell something other than hunting boots. Did that mean they were giving up on hunting boots?
"It's the same thing with breweries offering lodging, partnering with farms to do food, growing some of their own ingredients," Sullivan said. "They're hearing from customers and growing and changing on the fly to build long-term, sustainable businesses."
For her part, seltzer fan O'Donnell thinks the diversification is "a really smart move."
"Just like you can have a favorite brewery," she said, "you can now have a favorite hard seltzer brewery."

Texto completo: The Maine CDC reported 58 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the seven-day average to 36.4 cases.

The Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention on Saturday reported 58 new cases of COVID-19 and four additional deaths, adding to a continued rise in the seven-day average, which now stands at 36.4 cases.
A week ago, the seven-day average of new daily cases was 17.1. The past week’s increase brings averages closer to where they were in late October — above where they were at their lowest last summer, but far from the peaks that Maine saw in January and April. The all-time highest seven-day average in Maine was 624 cases, on Jan. 15.
Maine’s cumulative COVID-19 cases rose to 69,474 on Saturday. Of those, 50,812 have been confirmed by testing and 18,662 are considered probable cases of COVID-19. The 14-day average was 28.9 daily cases.
To date, 882 people have died with COVID-19 in Maine since the pandemic began. Information about the four people reported Saturday to have died was not provided by the Maine CDC.
The University of Maine System, meanwhile, is planning to require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students once existing vaccines receive final approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines now have emergency use authorization from federal authorities.
Officials with the university system said the vaccine requirement would work in tandem with testing and quarantine restrictions to ensure a safer fall semester. The University of Maine System is planning a more traditional fall term, with most classes held in person.
“We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy said in an announcement Friday. “It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don’t wait and have to scramble.”
By Saturday morning, Maine had given 801,238 people the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Among people 12 and older, the population currently eligible for vaccination, 67.66% are now fully vaccinated.
County by county as of Saturday, there had been 8,460 coronavirus cases in Androscoggin, 1,928 in Aroostook, 17,333 in Cumberland, 1,400 in Franklin, 1,386 in Hancock, 6,643 in Kennebec, 1,164 in Knox, 1,093 in Lincoln, 3,667 in Oxford, 6,394 in Penobscot, 593 in Piscataquis, 1,477 in Sagadahoc, 2,296 in Somerset, 1,068 in Waldo, 950 in Washington and 13,622 in York.
By age, 18.9% of patients were under 20, while 18.2% were in their 20s, 15.2% were in their 30s, 13.4% were in their 40s, 14.5% were in their 50s, 10.2% were in their 60s, 5.3% were in their 70s, and 4.2% were 80 or older.
Maine hospitals on Saturday had 27 patients with COVID-19, of whom 11 were in intensive care and four were on ventilators.
Around the world on Saturday evening, there were 189.8 million known cases of COVID-19 and 4.07 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States had over 34 million cases and 608,870 deaths.

Many older Mainers all-in on climate

Texto completo: As I do every Sunday morning, a couple Sundays ago I eagerly ambled to our rural mailbox to fetch the anticipated paper. (I thoroughly enjoy its diversity of articles, its interesting recipes and the many thought-provoking stories.) The Maine Millennial's offerings generally get my attention. I find her column very open, honest, personal and even rather raw at times.
After I had read more than half of Victoria Hugo-Vidal's July 4 column, which focused on the topic of global warming, I read the following words, which I find disturbing and prejudicial. She stated that Mainers were dragging their feet on this crucial issue because "they're old ... it won't affect them." While many Mainers are old, to lump them all together as having a negative mindset about the critical matter of climate change is called "ageism"!
I firmly believe that most of our older citizens care very deeply about the future of our planet - not just for themselves but also, especially, for their children and grandchildren. Many have the resources and time to be strong advocates for change and are out there doing just that. And, yes, there are many among us who do not have access to education, nor the resources to make the necessary changes in their lifestyles to help mitigate the effects of global warming.
You, Victoria Hugo-Vidal, have the media at your disposal and, therefore, are in a position to influence public policy and to promote educational opportunities for the public good. You go, girl!

Insects' disappearance strikes an ominous note
When I was growing up in central Maine, in the 1950s, any time we filled the tank in the car with gas, we had to wash the windshield because it was covered with the remains of many moths and insects.
As a kid, I delighted in going onto the front lawn and seeing many lightning bugs flying above the lawn. It was fun to catch them and release them before bedtime.
At a fishing camp in the Rangeley Lakes, in the 1970s, the camp kitchen had a screen door and one very sultry warm night, I vividly remember, it was covered with hundreds of moths that were attracted by the light in the kitchen.
Here we are in the summer of 2021. Since the beginning of bug season, I have not had to wash our car windshields. Maybe there is a single moth or whatever. As I think back, I have not had to wash dead bug bodies from the wind shields or the fronts of our cars for many years.
This summer, I saw two lightning bugs in our backyard trying to find a mate.
The light is still in the kitchen on the shore of one of the Rangeley Lakes, but there are no moths on the door on warm, sultry nights
So where are the bugs? If there are no bugs, what do the birds eat? If they find no bugs, what happens to them? And the next question is: Who will be next to go away?

We've forgotten how to be friends and get along
The country is slowly starting to open up after the COVID lockdowns. People are short-tempered and, like me, didn't realize it. The lack of social interaction, combined with the financial strains, have tested everyone's patience.
I remember as a toddler, I was taught to how to respect others, how to not pick fights with anyone and how to be nice to people. Taking care of ourselves was natural. But how to treat others was a completely different story!
People are now frustrated and angry. Everyone seems to blame someone. We don't focus on how to respect others anymore - instead, we are blaming them. Everyone's focus became what we are entitled to, not others. It seems we are blaming someone else because we don't have what they have, and it is someone else's fault!
As a 6-year-old, I knew that if I was intentionally mean to another kid I would get in trouble. If I picked a fight with another kid, or if I didn't respect them, I got in trouble. I knew I was wrong, and I was made to apologize. Now, it seems it is a competition on how to insult someone in the quickest way possible.
I feel like the whole world just got out of timeout. I think we forgot how to be nice and respect other people. And most importantly, we forgot how to be friends.
Can't we all just get along? Please?

Bishops trying to shut people out of the church
As a practicing Roman Catholic, do I accept all that is put forward by the leadership of our church? No, I do not. God has given us a conscience, intellect and free will. We can rationalize things for ourselves. I have attended Catholic schools K-12, as have all of my children. Unfortunately, none of them are practicing today. I am deeply saddened by it. Bishops should ask them why they don't practice.
I am concerned for my church by what the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops are professing by wanting to deny Holy Communion to pro-choice Catholic politicians. President Biden is one such Catholic. Do I sense a bit of politics in that the USCCB is coming up with this now? You betcha!
What an insult to our Catholic president of the U.S. and other Catholic politicians. Another insult is to those non-Catholics who attend Catholic weddings and funerals, when they are told they cannot receive Holy Communion. Is the body and blood of Christ only for Catholics, or does Jesus want to feed his entire flock? Should non-Catholics not be fed by the body and blood of Christ? We are all God's children, made in His image and likeness. God does not discriminate.
As alleged shepherds, bishops are supposed to lead their flock. They have allowed the 99 sheep to flee in order to save the one. If they keep it up, they will find more empty pews and close more churches. Bishops, open your eyes!

EPA says Windham dealership tampered with truck emissions controls

Texto completo: The federal agency is seeking a $168,700 fine for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seeking a $168,700 penalty from a Windham dealership and service shop for allegedly tampering with emissions controls on diesel vehicles in violation of the federal Clean Air Act.
The government is accusing APlus Truck Sales Inc. of selling and installing aftermarket parts known as “defeat devices” more than 50 times between 2017 and 2019. The EPA announced the complaint in a news release Friday.
“This action sends a strong message that tampering with emission controls on vehicles will not be tolerated,” said Deb Szaro, the agency’s acting regional administrator. “Emission control systems on vehicles are designed to protect public health by reducing pollution. To ensure that we all have access to clean air, it is critical that vehicle repair facilities comply with the Clean Air Act.”
Attorney Leonard Sharon, who said he is representing the business owners, said they are working to negotiate a fair settlement with the government but were blindsided by the complaint.
“First, the complained-of violations were a very small part of APlus’s business,” Sharon wrote in an email. “The owners of APlus have passionately made sure and continue to make sure that they are now in compliance. The offer made by the EPA would financially cripple APlus. We are exceedingly interested in reaching a fair settlement but believe the offer is disproportionate to other settlements in similar cases.”
He added that the business remains open and APlus Trucks has been in compliance with all EPA regulations since the last violation in 2019.
More than half of the airborne pollutants in the United States come from motor vehicles and other mobile sources, according to the EPA. The emissions include smog-forming volatile organic compounds, toxic air pollutants that can cause cancer, asthma or heart disease and gases that contribute to climate change.
The Clean Air Act requires engines to meet emissions standards, and it prohibits manufacturing, selling or installing devices that disable, bypass or reduce the effectiveness of emissions control systems.
Tampering with or overriding the systems can increase a vehicle’s power or fuel economy and may reduce maintenance costs and vehicle downtime.
While not common in Maine, the EPA has taken action around the country against dealerships and service centers accused of tampering with emissions controls. More than 30 vehicle and engine enforcement cases were resolved in 2020 nationwide, according to the EPA’s website.
Violators are subject to civil penalties up to $45,268 for each noncompliant vehicle or engine and $4,527 for each tampering event or sale of defeat device.
The complaint against APlus Trucks says the EPA requested and received a warrant for records at the business in 2019.
In an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court of Maine that year, an environmental engineer for the agency said that he had reason to believe APlus Trucks was violating the Clean Air Act after he reviewed social media posts and a Maine State Police sergeant had met with the business’ owners.
“Those postings indicate that APlus Trucks is an entity that sells or installs devices that illegally modify or replace motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine emission control devices, including exhaust systems that remove emission after treatment devices and electronic devices that replace computerized engine control and diagnostic systems,” the affidavit says.
Court documents show two inspections took place that year after the judge granted the request for a search warrant. The complaint says the EPA then issued a notice of violation to APlus Trucks in 2020.
The company’s website says APlus Trucks was established in 2011 as a small garage specializing in autobody repair.
“Since then we have grown and evolved into a shop where we offer anything you need or want done to your truck, or check out our sales department where we can help you with your next vehicle purchase with our clean late model model inventory of diesel trucks,” the website says.

Texto completo: A season that began in a 10-day quarantine - lifted just prior to the first game after three players had tested positive for COVID-19 - ended with championship hardware after Kennebunk went 16-0 and claimed its first Class A girls' lacrosse state title.
It seemed appropriate that senior captain Lily Schwartzman cradled the ball in the netting of her stick for large chunks of the final minutes, literally running out the clock on a 9-8 victory over two-time defending champ Falmouth at Fitzpatrick Stadium.
Schwartzman was Maine's most prolific scorer this spring with 77 goals. Yet in the championship game, she slid into a different role, winning the majority of draws and allowing defensive attention on her to open offensive opportunities for teammates. Sophomore Ruby Sliwkowski took advantage by scoring six goals, to the delight of her senior teammate.
"I think that goes along with some of the most important lessons that I've learned as a result of playing sports," Schwartzman said. "What it took for us to win that game was Ruby scoring six goals, and not the one goal and one assist that I had. I wasn't focused on how many goals I could score. I have been saying since last March that I want to win a state championship. That was my one goal coming into this year, not individual goals."
For being the leading actor on the only unbeaten team in the state, Schwartzman is our choice as Varsity Maine Player of the Year for girls' lacrosse.
Kennebunk Coach Annie Barker, who also coached Lily's older sisters, Kyra and Hallie, said Lily's leadership skills and tutelage of younger players were as important to the team's success as her athletic prowess and lacrosse smarts.
"If we needed her to play midfield or defense, she could," Barker said. "She knew every aspect of the game, if she needed to be put in any of those positions."
Schwartzman also won 65 percent of draws, meaning Kennebunk gained possession nearly twice as many times as its opponents.
"That's a huge piece of the game," Barker said.
Schwartzman, who plans to continue her career at Skidmore College, was one of three Maine girls to earn All-America status this spring. The others, seniors Annie Lowenstein of Yarmouth and Eva Clement of Falmouth, both saw their teams lose tight contests to Kennebunk.
Rams teammate Emily Archibald, crowned Miss Maine Basketball in March, returned to lacrosse this spring for the first time since 2018. She said Schwartzman set an inspiring example.
"She was hustling all the time and she's a vocal leader in such a positive way, just a great communicator," Archibald said. "She's a phenomenal player. I can't say enough good things about her."
As a rather stubborn younger sibling, Schwartzman refused to follow her older sisters into lacrosse - not right away at least - and instead rode horses. Not until sixth grade did she deign to pick up a stick with any regularity.
The transition from individual to team sport struck a chord in her. Being a part of something bigger than yourself, creating harmony by working in concert with others, "it showed me why people do this," she said, "and why people love playing sports and especially playing lacrosse."
Having that taken away, first by the pandemic last spring and then again on the eve of this season, raised awareness of how quickly that could disappear, and the responsibility of each team member to the whole.
"Once you were in practice, and then went back on Zoom and had to work out at your house, it wasn't the same," she said, "which is what made us come back even more ready to play than we were before. We knew something like that could happen at any time during the season. It makes you so grateful for what you have, rather than what you don't have."

Texto completo: LITTLE WHALEBOAT ISLAND -- From a rocky beach on the north shore of this 22-acre island, I could watch an orange smear of a near-solstice sun melting into the western mainland. Four hours later, with the half-moon set, glimpses of the Milky Way streaked the darkness overhead. It was hard to find time to sleep because in another four hours, the sun, somehow, already had scurried east and was peeking above Harpswell Neck.
Some of the shortest nights of the year are still upon us. And there are few better places to marvel at the changing sky than on a remote Maine island.
Mainers and visitors will be able to enjoy these views forever. With the planned purchase of Little Whaleboat Island, the Maine Coast Heritage Trust and its partners will have created a protected constellation of island destinations in upper Casco Bay. Within sight of each other and in reach of small boats and ocean kayaks, Little Whaleboat, (Great) Whaleboat and The Goslings form a recreation and conservation triad in a growing region where no trespassing signs can put special places like these off limits.
"In my mind," said Keith Fletcher, project manager at the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, "it's a birthright of every Mainer to be able to go to a wild island and enjoy it."
The trust is leading an effort to raise $1.3 million by December to buy the island from a family corporation that has acted as a benevolent steward for many years. The campaign is about halfway there, with fundraising slowed last year because of the pandemic. The group plans to announce a significant donation later this month, and step up a publicity campaign to get across the finish line.
The three islands will join other trust preserves in the bay with remote island destinations, including Lanes Island at the mouth of the Royal River in Yarmouth and the east side of Clapboard Island in Falmouth. The organization has been working with local land trusts and others for roughly 15 years to stitch together a collection of preserves around the bay, including some on the coastal mainland.
"But it's a rare event for a whole island to become available," Fletcher said.
I've landed small boats on dozens of islands in Casco Bay over the years, and Little Whaleboat is among my favorites. It's the diversity of experience; there's a lot happening on 20 or so acres.
Little Whaleboat is actually a cluster of islands and rocky ledges connected - or sometimes not - by the ever-changing tide. Coves and a sandy spit on the northern side that are protected from prevailing summer winds offer easy access for kayaks and small motor boats. Vessels with deeper draft can anchor off and crew can row ashore.
I didn't know until the fundraising campaign that each of the four distinct islands making up Little Whaleboat have names. The dominant island is West. The two smaller masses facing the mainland are Nate and Tuck, named by the family that owns the property. East, which faces (Great) Whaleboat and Harpswell, is not for sale and will remain privately owned.
The interior of West is heavily wooded and home today to resident osprey. I remember when those tall trees hosted a great blue heron rookery. One late summer day, I bushwacked in to show my older kids the clusters of stick nests. We spotted broken eggs on the ground and even the remains of tiny fledglings that didn't survive. The colony abandoned this rookery years ago, perhaps for another nesting site in the bay.
While native people used the Casco Bay islands for thousands of years, white settlers built houses on (Great) Whaleboat during the 19th century. I'm not sure if they ever occupied Little Whaleboat, but I did once find a stone-lined well near the northern tip. Even now, what looks like a tile drain pipe is sticking out of the ground in that area.
Modern visitors can spend the night at two low-impact campsites managed by the Maine Island Trail Association. The site near the north point is especially beautiful - in a clearing with flat ground, steps from ledges and a rocky beach. This is a fine place for viewing the night sky because the tree canopy blocks the glow of Greater Portland. My oldest son and I tented here on a clear June day, midweek. Except for a cruising sailboat that anchored overnight in the northeast cove, we had the place to ourselves.
MITA's logbook records from 2019 show that 238 visitors took the time to register their visit to the island. Of those, 153 were day-trippers and 85 were campers. Powerboats brought out 153 visitors, while 43 of them paddled and 42 arrived by sailboat.
The north campsite looks across 2 miles of water to The Goslings, a trio of islands that includes Irony Island and is known for its sandy beaches and popular anchorage. To the east, Whaleboat is a quick hop away. At 122 acres, Whaleboat is the largest wild island in the bay. It features an elevated meadow with panoramic views that extend to Mount Washington on clear days.
The Goslings can get busy, resembling an aquatic Woodstock on a hot summer weekend. Whaleboat is more chill, with campsites at two separate locations. But the meadow approach drains out with the falling tide, making for a tricky landing in a power boat. Having Little Whaleboat formally in the mix will expand recreational options and spread out activity.
"It creates a great synergy," said Doug Welch, MITA's executive director. "You can make a nice weekend with kids of hitting the three islands and sleeping on two of them."
Securing Little Whaleboat will give the Maine Coast Heritage Trust seven preserves in Casco Bay. Historic Malaga Island in Phippsburg, site of a mixed-race fishing community in the late 19th century, and Woodward Point in Brunswick, once a saltwater farm and accessible from the mainland, round out the offerings.
Fletcher said these acquisitions are part of a planned, focused effort by the trust and its partners to protect a series of coastal resources for both wildlife and recreation in the bay.
"We want to have a system in place," he said. "Between Whaleboat, Lanes, The Goslings and the others, we're really starting to put together some wonderful places for people to enjoy."

Texto completo: The Legislature approved the proposal by a two-thirds margin, but some critics worry that embedding the language in the Maine Constitution could have unintended consequences.


Maine voters in November will be the first in the nation to consider embedding in the state constitution an amendment that establishes a fundamental right to grow and consume food for their own nourishment.
The proposal, which will be on the Nov. 2 ballot, is the result of a nearly decadelong effort that represents an evolution of the movement that produced the Maine Food Sovereignty Act. That landmark law authorized cities and towns to adopt local food ordinances, and more than 90 have done so.
“You have to have a right to food because food is life,” said Sen. Craig Hickman, D-Winthrop, an organic farmer who has long championed the cause. “This is a foundation we are putting in the constitution.”
But while the idea of guaranteeing a fundamental right to food may seem benign, or even unassailable, the proposal has met resistance. Critics say the amendment, while well-intentioned, could have unintended consequences for food safety, animal welfare or other areas as judges interpret the amendment in future court cases.
Hickman said he expects an onslaught of misinformation ahead of the vote, likely from opponents backed by multinational agricultural companies and the factory farm industry.
The ballot question will ask:
“Do you favor amending the Constitution of Maine to declare that all individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being?”
If passed, Maine would be the first state to adopt a constitutional amendment enshrining a right to food. West Virginia and Washington are also considering right-to-food amendments for their state constitutions.
The language to be added to the Maine Constitution would read:
“All individuals have a natural, inherent and unalienable right to food, including the right to save and exchange seeds and the right to grow, raise, harvest, produce and consume the food of their own choosing for their own nourishment, sustenance, bodily health and well-being, as long as an individual does not commit trespassing, theft, poaching or other abuses of private property rights, public lands or natural resources in the harvesting, production or acquisition of food.”
The bill calling for the new constitutional amendment, L.D. 95, was approved by a two-thirds majority in both the state House and Senate. Constitutional amendments do not require the approval of the governor and go directly to the ballot for consideration by voters.
One of the bill’s strongest supporters is Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham, R-Winter Harbor. In written testimony in support of the amendment, he said the right to food, growing a garden or raising livestock may not be in question today but the situation could change.
“Jumping ahead 25 or 50 years into the future, could we see our government creating roadblocks and restrictions to the people’s right to food?” Faulkingham wrote. “Will the government be telling people what they are allowed to eat and where they can grow it?”
Faulkingham, a lobsterman, also voiced concerns about the influence on food policy of multinational food producers or industrial agriculture. And he pushes back against those who say food safety will suffer if the amendment is approved.
“They’re going to say, ‘The sky is falling, the sky is falling,’” Faulkingham said. “But it hasn’t yet and it is probably not going to.”
He pointed out that Mainers for generations, even before statehood, have bartered for or bought and sold food products from one another in their local communities. And he said there have been no reports of food-borne illnesses since Maine starting allowing cities and towns to govern the exchange of food locally.
Heather Retberg, a farmer from Penobscot and a leader in the food sovereignty movement, has been a longtime proponent of the right-to-food amendment. She testified in favor of the proposal at a February public hearing. Retberg said the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in the food supply chain, when early in the pandemic many store shelves went barren as people stockpiled food and other supplies.
“Maine people can increase resilience to external shocks in systems beyond our control by growing and producing much more of our own food,” Retberg said. “By securing the right to grow and raise food in our Constitution, it will be protected in the most fundamental form of law.”
But opponents to the amendment, including lawmakers who are also farmers, say it is unnecessary and would undermine a food safety system in Maine that works well.
Senate Minority Leader Jeffrey Timberlake, R-Turner, said he voted against the measure because nobody could tell him when food rights had ever been denied to Mainers. “For that matter, when in the history of the United States has anyone ever had their right to food denied?” Timberlake asked.
Timberlake and Sen. Russell Black, R-Wilton, own commercial farming operations and produce processed foods under state licensing regulations. Black worries what the unintended consequences of the amendment could be.
“This is so vague, how are the courts going to interpret this?” Black said. “An inherent right to food. Are people going to be able to go to town government and say, ‘I don’t have food. I don’t have seed and I don’t have a place to grow it. I want you to take care of that for me.’”
He said state government is already working to bolster food security and reduce hunger, including through a recent law that will provide free school meals to all public school students, among other policy changes.
He fears a food safety problem from an unregulated producer could undermine the many years Maine farmers have spent building a reputation for quality, safe, healthy food products. “Why would we want to take the chance of blowing that up?” he asked.
The administration of Gov. Janet Mills, a former state attorney general, has remained neutral on the amendment, stating it supports local food production and farms while at the same time expressing concerns over the uncertain impact a new constitutional right might have on existing laws — including fish and game, among others.
The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry submitted testimony neither for nor against the amendment. Emily Horton, policy director at the department, said the state had concerns about language in a previous version of the bill that could create conflict with food safety standards, hunting laws and property rights. But she said the current version of the bill no longer includes the potentially troublesome language.
“With that said, the department does acknowledge that constitutional amendments will preempt state law and may be subject to legal interpretation going forward,” Horton said.
Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal said her department strives to balance the promotion of locally produced food products with consumer health and safety.
“There are a lot of diverse opinions out there about how relaxed can our regulations be versus where do they need to be more defined,” Beal said. She noted that the right-to-food constitutional amendment focuses more on the ability for people to provide food for themselves and their families.
“And as the language focuses on self-provisioning rather than commerce, we did not have outright concerns,” Beal said. Beal also confirmed Faulkingham’s assertion that there have been no reported outbreaks of food-borne illness in Maine that were triggered because of weak or ineffective local food ordinances.
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey declined to answer questions about how enshrining a new right in the state constitution could affect existing law. But other legal scholars say there’s little doubt a new right would be defined in the courts.
Emily Broad Leib, director of the Food Law and Policy Clinic of the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation at Harvard Law School, said the establishment of a protected right was likely to lead to new case law and legal precedent.
“This puts a thumb on the scale towards generally allowing food transactions to take place, while still maintaining reasonable restrictions,” Broad Leib said. “It provides a comfort to the citizens of Maine that they are allowed to obtain or procure food of their choosing, and that they do not have to constantly be worrying about whether they are breaking a law in doing so.”
Still, any ruling by a judge would have to be viewed in the complete context of the case, and Maine’s amendment would be paving new ground. “Context is so important for things like this,” Broad Leib said. The first courts to hear cases on the newly established right will likely consider not only the language of the amendment but also the intent of the Legislature in approving it, she said.
She noted that more than half of state legislatures have considered or passed laws expanding the sale of food without licensure in the past year, a recognition by lawmakers of the constraints the COVID-19 pandemic put on access to food. But Maine’s constitutional amendment takes a different approach in guaranteeing individuals the right to obtain the methods of production for themselves, Broad Leib said.
Maine led the nation in 2017 with the passage of the Food Sovereignty Act, which allows cities and towns to pass their own ordinances regulating the exchange of food, with the exception of poultry and meat. Since passage, more than 90 municipalities have adopted their own food ordinances.
An amendment to the act that gained broad bipartisan support this year in both bodies of the Legislature would have given counties the authority to set food production ordinances for Maine’s unorganized territories or plantations. The amendment also would have eliminated a “face-to-face on the site of production transaction” requirement, replacing it with a requirement that those engaged in the exchange of food do so on terms that are mutually agreed to.
But that change was vetoed by the governor.
“I have heard deep concern from several sectors of the agriculture community and other entities that sell perishable or processed food items about the negative impact that this bill could have on the reputation of Maine’s local foods if someone becomes ill from uninspected products,” Mills wrote in her veto letter.
Beal also noted her agency is concerned about expanding the point of exchange and said the state’s licensing process also includes education and guidance from state inspectors for those who want to produce food from their homes. Licensing fees are nominal, only $20 for a license to sell baked goods, for example, Beal said. That license involves only one kitchen inspection and no follow-up inspections, unless there is a complaint made, Beal said.
Lawmakers will cast override votes on the veto when the Legislature returns to session on Monday. It’s unclear whether supporters can build the two-thirds majority needed to overcome Mills’ opposition.

Recent standoff must raise awareness of 'sovereign citizen' threat Rise of the Moors, arrested en route to Maine, is just one of many unauthorized paramilitary entities in the U.S.

Texto completo: The armed men from Rhode Island, arrested on the July Fourth weekend on a Massachusetts roadside, described themselves as a militia en route to Maine to engage in training exercises. They call themselves "Rise of the Moors" and are a Black variant of the "sovereign citizen" movement, which claims to be not subject to federal or state laws.
This incident should alert the public and media to the threats such individuals and groups pose.
According to the FBI some 300,000 people, often loosely organized, see themselves as "sovereign citizens." They hold themselves separate from the United States though living in it. Claiming to be "self-sovereign," they answer to no government authority: most of all, any taxing entity.
Since they reject the authority of law enforcement, the FBI classifies the 100,000 or so hard-core believers as domestic terrorists. Their acts of violence are largely individual responses to regulation, from resisting a traffic ticket to assault and murder.
The potential for violence from sovereign paramilitary groups is similar to that posed by the non-sovereign Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and other militias that during 2020 stormed state capitols and spearheaded the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Yet private paramilitary entities operating outside state authority are illegal in all 50 states and are also banned from assuming police duties that Oath Keepers and others provided at Trump rallies, Black Lives Matter protests and white supremacist rallies.
All 50 states also ban "unorganized militias" from holding training sessions and using firearms in military-style exercises and operating outside of state power. Yet during 2020 and after, unauthorized private militias and armed individuals in military-style garb have enjoyed free rein.
The relevant laws and constitutional provisions are often not known to authorities responsible for keeping order. Unfortunately, many local authorities share the politics of armed groups. Sheriffs in rural counties in Western states cultivate friendly relationships with private militias and invite them sometimes to join search and rescue parties.
The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which asserts that federal and state governments are subordinate to local authority, is ardently recruiting sheriffs. Its founder, former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, barnstorms the country supported by the National Rifle Association and gun-owners' groups denouncing the federal government as the "biggest enemy" of the Constitution and keeping the peace.
Mack's claims that his "Army to Set Our Nation Free" has enlisted several hundred sheriffs are likely inflated, but dozens have participated in his rallies and lobbying. Mack has recently allied with AriseUSA, a fusion of anti-Semitic QAnon conspiracy theories and Posse Comitatus devoted to fighting the "deep state."
States and the federal government have tools to limit and ultimately marginalize unauthorized militias - if they will use them.
The Moors, like other paramilitary groups and gun rights extremists, erroneously believe they are protected by the Second Amendment. But a conservative Supreme Court majority has said otherwise. The court in 2008's D.C. v. Heller predictably struck down a District of Columbia ban on owning guns in the home and affirmed individuals' rights to bear arms.
But the court also described the Second Amendment right as "not unlimited." Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, stated that "nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions ... forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings .... ."
Scalia added that the right is "not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever." Given that the amendment referred to weapons "in common use at the time," he stated, another important limitation consists of "the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of 'dangerous and unusual weapons.' "
All of which makes for potentially explosive confrontations between paramilitaries and federal and state law enforcement. The Biden administration's new focus on home-grown terrorism as "the most lethal and persistent" threat to the homeland is just the beginning.

Texto completo: The smaller space means computer usage requires a reservation, and a majority of the library's collection is stored offsite but can be retrieved and made available at the new 242 State St. location.

A condensed edition of the Maine State Library reopened this past week, in temporary quarters on State Street in Augusta.
The library’s much smaller spot at 242 State St. is in a state building that over the years has been home to offices of the state Department of Health and Human Services, Public Utilities Commission, and Department of Motor Vehicles. The new location is expected to be its home for about two years, while work continues to remove asbestos and perform mechanical upgrades at its longtime regular home at the state Cultural Building, which is undergoing about $15 million in renovations.
With only about 5,500 square feet of space for the public, versus the permanent library’s 22,000 square feet of availability, space is tight, and the collection of books and other materials is limited to about 25% of what was once on hand. But nearly the full complement of materials is in storage fairly nearby in a Winthrop warehouse, and can be made available to borrowers within one to three days or so, if requested.
“Essentially all our services we had in the other space, we’re doing here, albeit in a limited footprint,” said Alison Maxell, director of public and outreach services, research and innovation. “A very limited part of our collection is here onsite. But anybody can come in and, if they want something from the collection (that is not at the site), they can request it. We’re telling people it may take one to three days, but we strive for 24 hours. We go out there every day.”
With less space for computers, the library now requires people wishing to use its computers or microfilm research services to make a reservation and, if someone else is waiting to use a device, limit their time to hour-long sessions. Maxell said requiring reservations to use the fewer number of computers is an effort to still offer them to the public, in the most equitable way.
The library’s usual building had a dozen computers for general public use, while the temporary home only has four.
The library had a “soft opening” Monday and this past week only had a few library users there. The facility has a News Nook where every print newspaper published in the state is available, a coffee machine, and desks and nooks where readers can sit and read.
“It’s different but certainly we’ve made it as cozy as possible,” said Jamie Ritter, state librarian, noting employees are happy to have reopened to the public after closing in May 2020. “We want happy customers.”
The public entrances to the building are all on the first floor, with the second floor reserved for office space. The library will be open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and is reachable by phone at 207-287-5600.
Maxell said while people can just stop in for services not requiring a computer, it is helpful to call first if you’re planning to come to the library, including to find out in advance if a book or other material is actually at the library, or would need to be retrieved from storage.
For collections storage the state’s Bureau of General Services has leased 13,000 square feet of warehouse space at 1705 Route 202 in Winthrop, the former Carleton Woolen Mill. That space is not open to the public. Maxell said that facility has shelving that is estimated, if it were run end to end, to be some 7 miles long.
Items on hand at the new State Street spot include books from the library’s most popular collections, with an emphasis on Maine themes and authors, and genealogy and other research materials.
Three separate meeting spaces, which are equipped to allow for online conferencing, will provide space for the return of programming at the library.
Members of the public who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 are not required to wear masks to enter the library.
Moving out of the library’s permanent home was a monumental task that required choreography, and Ritter complemented Adam Fisher, collections and digital initiatives director, for coordinating the action. The state hired Vallee Movers to transfer the collection. Ritter said the move cost $223,000.
Library officials plan to host a public reopening celebration sometime in mid-August, once they are established and have the kinks worked out at the new repurposed facility.
“We’re excited to be back and looking forward to our new normal,” Ritter said.

Reimagined vintage motels offer a retro road-trip option

Texto completo: Who says roadside pit stops have to be boring? This summer, road-trippers looking for stylish accommodations that won't break the bank, something between upscale luxury and side-of-the-highway corporate chains, are discovering a new trend: neglected mid-century motels that have been transformed into affordable, hip places to stay.
Goodbye, beige palettes and vending machines; hello, disco balls and lounge bars with craft cocktails!
Motels, also referred to as motor lodges, evoke an era of optimism when gas was cheap and families piled into cars and hit the open road. Indeed, nostalgia and wanderlust seem to be - ahem - driving the trend to develop these properties.
"Nostalgia evokes a simpler time, a time of Polaroid cameras and memories of what it's like to be a kid," said Krista Stokes, the creative art director who spearheaded the project to transform the Lodge on the Cove in Kennebunkport, Maine.

The 30-room renovated motel is outfitted with mid-century furniture whose clean sculptural lines complement new bold colors and energetic whimsy. The main building is an airy glass-encased octagon reminiscent of old Howard Johnson rest stops. A swimming pool with poolside light fare and a cocktail bar keeps parents happy, while kids can enjoy a clubhouse, bonfires, yard games and ping-pong.
"When you drive up to a motor lodge, you can't help but feel like you're in a different era. It's a place to daydream," Stokes said.
Daydreaming was a vital pandemic activity for Rob Blood, founder and president of Lark Hotels, who - while isolating at home - experienced a compelling urge to get out on the road. Blood's memories of summer vacations in his parents' Grand Wagoneer led him to create a sister brand, Bluebird by Lark, a midpriced collection of motels, surf shacks and ski lodges inspired by road trips of bygone days.
"Driven by social isolation after the past year, people are looking for spots to go to spend quality time together. Places that are family-friendly, friend-group friendly," Blood said.

Bluebird's first offering, Spa City Motor Lodge, transformed an iconic 1950s roadside motel into a stylish destination in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Inspired by old-school Americana, the 42 guest rooms and suites offer flashes of color and eclectic artwork within the streamlined architectural style of the two-story original motel. Rooms face an interior courtyard outfitted with chairs, lounges and a communal coffee bar.
Two more Bluebird properties will debut this summer (Parker Beach Lodge on Cape Cod and Tälta Lodge in Stowe, Vt.), with more to follow.
"Providing beautiful spaces to use as waypoints makes the journey as important as the destination," said Blood, adding, "It feels of this moment."
Jayson H. Seidman, founder and managing partner of the Drifter Hotel in New Orleans, also remembers staying in motor lodges on family road trips. Even as a kid, he loved the social aspect of seeing people coming and going. After spending most of his adult life "traveling all over the world," he confesses, "motels are my passion."

The Drifter is the second of three motel conversions that Seidman has undertaken within a larger hotel development portfolio. (The other motels include the Thunderbird in Marfa, Tex., and the Ranch Motel, in development in San Antonio.) Located in a rapidly growing mid-city neighborhood, the Drifter sits at the end point of the old Highway 61, known as "the Blues Highway."
"Everyone in town thought I was crazy to open on the outskirts of town," Seidman said.
Nevertheless, he was drawn to develop the property, a continuously operating hotel since the '50s, and named it as an homage to the Beat Generation of postwar America.
During the year-long project, Seidman ripped out carpeting, put in tile floors, retiled bathrooms, beautified finishes and added new bedding in all 20 rooms. In the former lobby, a stunning terrazzo floor underneath a 1980s renovation "revealed itself."
"I'm into preservation more than renovation. There are so many great stories in those walls," Seidman said.
To "shake things up a bit," Seidman removed concrete and converted parking areas into a tropical landscape. He excavated the dirt-filled swimming pool and brought it back to life, creating a Swim Club where locals and hotel guests can mingle while enjoying specialty coffee, Japanese beers and sakes, cocktails, and international cuisine from local food trucks. The result is an atypical New Orleans experience, designed to "remind people of other places they have traveled."
During South Florida's period of rapid growth in the 1950s, Biscayne Boulevard was described as "The Motel Capital of Miami." A drive today from 50th Street to 77th Street in the designated Miami Modern Historic District - known locally as MiMo - still offers glimpses of the flamboyant and optimistic postwar architecture.

In addition to the renovated 1953 Vagabond Motel, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the strip is home to the sprawling Selina Miami Gold Dust. Retro signage, tropical neon and playful decor capture the spirit of the original 1957 Gold Dust Motel, a location poised for popularity when Hugh Hefner opened his first satellite Playboy Club directly across the street in 1961.
"We wanted to stay true to its origins as historical landmark on Biscayne Boulevard, combining iconic retro vibes from the past with today's cultural diversity that looks to the future," said Victoria Winter, the "experience director" for Selina hotels in the United States.
Utilizing the existing space and structure, Selina (a company that operates more than 70 hotels around the globe) did a full property rehab, including changing the layout of the pool. Room types, from shared community spaces to private suites, are designed to accommodate many varieties of travelers.
"It's a place where CEOs can meet backpackers from South America while sitting at the pool," Winter said.
A revitalized dining space with a river view, helmed by Miami chef Matt Kush, retains a funky vibe while serving diverse bistro dishes such as croque-monsieurs, Kush classic burgers, chicken and waffles, and key lime pie. Signature cocktails, international wines and local brews can be had below the cafe at Don's 5 Star Dive Bar.
In Nashville, a 1956 motor inn collides with 1970s disco and romantic nostalgia in the Dive Motel, a 23-room eye-popping wonder where each uniquely designed accommodation might contain any of the following: '70s wallpaper, vintage furniture, shag carpets, wood paneling and soaking tubs in a variety of bright Pantone hues.

The one thing all rooms have in common is a custom-made disco ball - crafted by Yolanda "Yo Yo" Baker, famous for her work for Studio 54 - that spins to the tunes of "Dive Radio," offering four channels: sex, drugs, rock-and-roll and sleep.
"The design is anything goes, with decor from all eras. It doesn't have to make sense as long as it's fun," said Lyon Porter, owner and designer of the property.
Porter, who also founded and operates the Urban Cowboy portfolio (with hotels in Nashville and the Catskills), discovered the run-down motel in an area of town undergoing transformation while looking for a place with a pool.
"A motel means different things to different people. Guests in their 80s say, 'Oh, I remember staying in motels.' In their 40s, it means something else. And people in their 20s may never have stayed at a motel," Porter said.
Because of the pandemic, it is the first full season that the pool and Swim Club are open for swimming, partying and dancing. The just-launched Dive Taqueria features meat and vegetarian tacos, quesadillas, tamales, pupusas, ceviche, and frozen and classic cocktails.
"Nashville is the capital of a good time in the U.S. After the pandemic, it's the Roaring Twenties again," said Porter, who expects a busy summer season. "Everyone is excited to be alive right now."

'Rise of the Moors' mystery: Separatist group stays quiet on Maine training plans

Texto completo: When a Massachusetts state trooper saw two cars with their hazard lights flashing in the emergency lane of Interstate 95 at 2 a.m., the natural response was to go and offer help.
What should have been a routine incident proved to be anything but.
The motorists in distress were wearing military fatigues and carrying an array of unregistered firearms, including three AR-15 rifles.
MASSACHUSETTS POLICE ARREST GROUP OF ARMED MEN WHO 'DO NOT RECOGNIZE OUR LAWS' AFTER HOURSLONG STANDOFF
Even their vehicles, a 2018 Ford Transit and 2006 Honda Ridgeline pickup truck, were unregistered.
What followed was a surreal nine-hour standoff 15 miles north of Boston between police and the group of 10 men and one teenager, who were all members of an organization called the Rise of the Moors. Law enforcement revealed earlier this week that they incapacitated the group using a high-pitched sonic weapon.
They told the police that they were from Rhode Island and were en-route to an undisclosed destination in Maine for what they described as military training.
Exactly where they were going remains a mystery. But a Facebook posting does at least give a hint of what they were doing, if not why.
It shows three people trudging through woodland at an undisclosed location, two of whom appear to be in army fatigues. One is clutching what appears to be an assault rifle and another a handgun.
The group's refusal to license either their weapons or vehicles was “justified” by the group’s philosophy: a complicated mish-mash of libertarianism and religious separatism.
“They essentially have taken ideas from two separate ideologies,” Rachel Goldwasser of the Southern Poverty Law Center said.
“There is the Moorish religion and the Sovereign Citizen movement. They have combined elements of both of them.
“Sovereign Citizens are a complicated beast. What is foundationally true for all Sovereign Citizenships is they have renounced the citizenship where they were born and or naturalized.”
In its most benign manifestation, Sovereign Citizen groups refuse to cooperate with the authorities.
Some even issue driving licenses and number plates. But there have been outbreaks of violence by Sovereign Citizens who feel that direct action is needed to protect their “rights."

The I-95 group's take on the philosophy rests on two planks. The first is that they are indigenous to a patch of land in Rhode Island.
The second is an assertion that their rights as Moors are protected by the Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship that was signed in January 1787.
"There are catalysts which will make a Sovereign Citizen violent,” Goldwasser added.
“It is a good sign they did not react violently. It can be something as minor as a traffic stop which sets them off," she said.
A study by the University of North Carolina a few years ago had scathing words about the Sovereign Citizen movement.
“At their most harmless, sovereign citizens are cranks who talk what seems like gibberish to cops and magistrates and judges and then become law-abiding when they face real legal trouble,” it read. “At a different level, they may severely burden the courts and other government offices with the filing of hundreds and hundreds of pages of nonsensical documents.”
That seems to have been the template followed by the Rise of the Moors in Massachusetts when they appeared before Malden District Court. Many were wearing Moroccan-style fezzes.
They refused to cooperate with court-appointed lawyers, with two of the group even refusing to give their names.
Quinn Cumberlander, 40, of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, insisted that he was a foreign national and therefore could not face criminal charges.
Nevertheless, he invoked his right to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Then, there were the actions of Lesley Malave, who preferred to be known by his Moorish name of Moreeno Bey.
Malave, who was not involved in the Wakefield standoff, tied the court up in knots when he filed a complaint after his partner was pulled over for speeding in November 2019.
Citing the 1787 treaty, he accused the police of surrounding the car like “a pack of hyenas."
He presented his Moorish identification cards and signed and dated legal documents using the Moorish calendar — as well as the Gregorian one.
Leonard Kesten, the lawyer representing the police, remembers his encounter with the Rise of the Moors well.
“I had never heard of them. If you represent towns, cities, and police, you get some interesting cases,” he said.
“They were relying on the Constitution while saying they are not subject to our laws, which seems to be problematic.
“Then, there was the problem about the document filing fee.”
Instead of meeting the $400 demanded by the court, Malave offered a silver coin that he said was worth $913.
“He offered the coin, and the judge didn't want any part of it. He just went away, and it never went any further,” he recalled.

“I am a child of the '70s. I can recognize people have a different view, and I find them interesting.
“He was not armed, and it’s one thing to have a different view.
“It’s another having AR-15s. It gives you food for thought," Kesten said.

They face several charges including unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. (Suzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool)

Child abuse prevention training available

Texto completo: WATERVILLE — Child abuse prevention councils across the state are working together to provide training.
Kennebec Valley Community Action Program’s Family Enrichment Councils are joining other councils to provide the Front Porch Project of Maine.
The Maine Children’s Trust has collaborated with the network of prevention councils in every county to deliver the Front Porch Project Training directly to their communities.
Maine has had four child deaths of children younger than 4 in the past several months, according to a news release. Often after the death of a child because of child abuse and neglect, neighbors and community members wonder if there was anything they could have done to help. It is important for communities to know how they can help support families and children.
The prevention councils encourage community members to learn more about the Front Porch Project.
The project is funded in part by the donations to the Maine Children’s Trust on behalf of Marissa Kennedy, a child tragically lost to child abuse in 2018.
The project is based on the belief that everyone can — and should — become more aware of how to help protect children and support families in their own community. It provides community members with the knowledge, skills, and encouragement they need to take an active role in preventing abuse and neglect before it occurs. The training helps create a community that works together to prevent child abuse and neglect and inspires a caring, supportive and compassionate community.
“Parenting is one of the hardest jobs we have. Many parents do not have extended families that can provide additional support,” said Lanelle Freeman, director of Social Services at KVCAP, according to a news release from KVCAP. “The pandemic has added stressors to families that can than put children at higher risk. It is important for everyone to understand that most child abuse can be prevented.”
The Front Porch Project is flexible, free, available in person or through online platforms, and can be adapted to meet the needs of a specific community.
To schedule a training or get more information, call KVCAP’s Family Enrichment Council — in Kennebec County, Becky Lambert at 207-859-1588; and in Somerset County, Kristen Plummer at 207-859-2520.

MAINE'S IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS A Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center program helps a community that's a key driver of the economy, but one that can face obstacles like racial discrimination or lack of credit history.

Texto completo: Deborah Bafongo started her South Portland business, Angels of Love Event Design, in 2019 without any outside loans or grants.
Bafongo specializes in providing decorations for formal events, especially weddings, and had hoped she would be able to work on enough weddings in 2020 to be able to earn back the money she spent on equipment. However, when the pandemic hit and weddings were canceled en masse, Bafongo found herself in need of some extra help to keep her business afloat.
Through a mutual friend, she heard about a program being offered through the Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center that would provide interest-free loans to business owners like her. Bafongo, who immigrated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014 and lives in South Portland, received a loan of $2,500 with a repayment term of 21 months. She plans to use the funding to purchase a bigger storage unit to use as a showroom for her designs, as well as more equipment.
"I really needed the funds," she said. "As an immigrant, I'm really grateful that this platform is there to help us succeed in the career that we're doing. ... At that point (because of the pandemic), I really needed something coming from somewhere to assist me."
INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP
The funding for Bafongo's business is the result of a partnership between DreamxAmerica, or DxA - a national initiative combining storytelling and impact to support immigrant communities founded by Andrew Leon Hanna in 2018 - and Kiva, a nonprofit that allows people to lend money online.
DxA released the storytelling component of its project, a documentary featuring three immigrant entrepreneurs in North Carolina, in November 2020. When it came time to launch the impact side of DxA's project, Hanna approached Rohit Agarwal - the head of Kiva's U.S. program and a connection from the time that both spent working at global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company - to form a partnership that could provide funding for immigrant business owners.
Immigrant entrepreneurs can face challenges accessing traditional bank loans - sometimes because they lack established U.S. credit histories and sometimes because of racial or cultural discrimination.
"A lot of times, the banking system does not treat low-income minority immigrant folks as well as they should," Hanna said. "Sometimes, there's a lot of distrust and sometimes there are rates that are unfair. ... Why we appreciate Kiva is that (the loan) is very pure, it's very straightforward. There's not any rate to research or other hidden fees. It's zero interest, zero fees."
DxA partners with four local organizations nationally - including the Welcome Center - that advertise the loan opportunity and support business owners throughout the application process. Staff at DxA edit applications to tell their stories more concisely in an effort to attract as many lenders as possible, and a team at Kiva reads the official applications and determines the loan amount the business qualifies for. Then, DxA promotes the business owner's borrower profile until the loan is fully funded.
Agarwal said the local organizations DxA partners with are critical to building trust in Kiva's loan program.
"The main way for us to build trust - and within a lot of these communities there is rightfully a decent amount of distrust in traditional financial institutions - is through trusted partners on the ground," Agarwal said. "And there enters DreamxAmerica, which I think has done a fantastic job building trust through immigrant welcoming centers (and) through different other intermediaries to say, 'Hey, here's a good source of capital, zero-fee, zero-interest.'"
These local organizations often already have close partnerships with immigrant business owners and can serve as a trusted intermediary.
"Most small-business immigrant entrepreneurs aren't going to just wander onto the Kiva site and say, 'Oh, this looks good,'" Hanna said. "You need somebody to vouch for it."
Seven business owners
The Welcome Center's business hub, which was started in 2017, plays that role in Maine by connecting immigrant business owners with various sources of capital.
"Research shows that immigrants, nationally, are more likely to start businesses and small businesses than native-born Americans," said Reza Jalali, the center's executive director. "By doing so, (business owners) create jobs not only for themselves but for others in the community. Part of what we do at (the) business hub is help immigrants to access funding and then help match them with lenders."
So far, seven Maine business owners have had their loans fully funded through the DxA-Kiva Special Initiative, with two others still in the process of being funded.
Navid Ahadzadeh, the founder and owner of Scratch Master Mobile, a mobile auto repair service based in Casco, knew Jalali through the local Iranian immigrant community and successfully applied for an $8,500 loan to expand his business. He used part of the loan to buy a new van.
"Because my business is a mobile business and (because of) my old van, the options I have were kind of limited," Ahadzadeh said. "So when I get a bigger van, it (will be) more reliable, more professional. It will look professional."
Ahadzadeh moved to the U.S. in 2009 from Sari, Iran, because of persecution in his home country that limited his career options.
"I'm a Baha'i, and the Baha'i is a highly persecuted religious minority in Iran," Ahadzadeh said. "Baha'is in Iran are not allowed to pursue higher education, and many businesses owned by Baha'is are shut down by the government. So knowing that people out there are helping you for the loan and everything else in another country just makes me very happy."
welcomed by MUSLIMS
In addition to helping with immigrant business owners' limited access to capital, interest-free loans have a religious significance for many, as well. Traditionally, Islamic law forbids paying interest on loans, leading many Muslim immigrant business owners to seek loans from sources other than traditional banks. This was the case for Humza Khan, the founder of Inclusion Maine, a diversity, equity and inclusion consulting firm based in Westbrook. He received a loan of $6,500.
"One thing that interested me about this program was the interest-free component of it," said Khan, who was born in Pakistan but grew up mostly in Maine. "I could obviously go to - anybody can go to a bank, or they can go to venture capital, they can go and raise the money ... but for me, really for religious reasons, I wanted to avoid interest."
"(With the loan), I can invest in the things that I'm working on and pay it off over a period of time and still be in compliance with (my) religious beliefs," Khan added. "That's what attracted me to this program versus a more traditional option."
Khan used some of the funding to pay for more advertising, but his main goal is to host a conference.
"One of the things that I'm hoping to focus on is a conference for diversity and inclusion," Khan said. "So it's a focus on bringing folks together that are interested in this work and learning about what the local challenges are and how we can address them and what is working. ... I'm hoping that (the conference) won't be too costly for folks, so this loan will certainly help with getting me started in making that possible. It has helped already."
For Jalali, the program also is valuable as an indication of the opportunities available to immigrants in Maine.
"Bringing some money into the state is always good news, and supporting our new neighbors who have been displaced by wars and famine and persecution," Jalali said. "So, it is good for Maine in a state where we're dealing with an aging workforce. We need more immigrants, and can (this program) become one way of attracting new immigrants?
"Can this be a way that some immigrants in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, will look at Maine and say, 'Well, that's a great state to go and start a business?' This will be really good for us in the long run to attract more businesses (and) more young persons (who are) skilled, educated and motivated to come and add to the richness of our community."

Texto completo: Donald Barnett, a resident at the Maine Veterans’ Homes — Augusta, has been named veteran of the month for June.
Always a New Yorker, no matter where he happened to live throughout his life, Barnett grew up in Washington Heights, on the north end of the Big Apple. His father, Benjamin, was an electrician, and his mother, Frieda, took care of the house and tended to her only child.
In 1933, when Barnett was 6, his parents took him to Boston, hoping for better work for the Barnett patriarch. A parade was held in the Blue Hill Avenue neighborhood of Boston to celebrate the country’s new president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the Barnetts were there watching.
“I got excited and ran across the street to (Roosevelt’s) car,” said Barnett, according to a news release from the veterans’ home. “This got his secret service agents all excited, and they moved in, but Roosevelt said to the agents, ‘He’s only a boy, what’s wrong with you?’”
Roosevelt stopped the parade, and as Barnett stood on the running board of the limousine, Roosevelt lifted him through the open window and into the car.
“He asked me where I was from and whatnot,” he recalled. “He says to me, ‘You don’t sound like you’re from Boston.’ I told him I came from New York and that there was no work there; that’s why I was here in Boston living at my grandmother’s house. We talked a few more minutes; he lifted me back out the window onto the running board of the limo and told me to go back to my family.”
The parade continued, and Barnett was left with a story he’ll never forget.
The family eventually moved back to New York, where he attended George Washington High School and New York University. While still in college, America’s role in World War II inspired him to join the military. He intended to enlist in the Navy. Other branches were present in the recruitment office, and the Marine Corps proved to be very persuasive. They needed to recruit 10 men that day, and Barnett ended up being No. 10. Almost immediately, he was off to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Parris Island, South Carolina.
After basic training, he and a group of men traveled to San Diego, California, by train. A lieutenant called the men out of the train upon their arrival for a message from the general.
“The general said, ‘You are the luckiest men on the face of the earth today. You were supposed to be in the first wave invading Tokyo,’” Barnett said, adding that three days before, the U.S. had dropped the atom bomb, eliminating the need for the men to be part of an invasion.
The men felt fortunate and were sent back to their base.
Barnett’s travels while in the military were vast, but his favorite place was Puerto Rico. He fell in love with it: the people, buildings and the culture.
Part of his military service included training West Point cadets and Annapolis midshipmen in landing operations. He and five other men instructed the trainees on huge maneuver ships in the Atlantic and Caribbean. He taught them to jump down in barges and come up the side of the vessel. During one training session, Barnett’s feet were hanging over the side of the ship, and the waves got too high — they slammed into his feet, injuring him and forcing him into a military hospital for treatment. After the hospital, Corp. Barnett went home to New York.
After a year of service to the Marine Corps, he came home and worked as an electrician. In 1947, he and his best friend from the service, Dave Diamond, and four other men with whom he was in the service went into business together and joined the local electrician’s union.
Also that year, Barnett married his wife, Lynn. They had met when they were just 13 at a Jewish Temple in front of the Washington Bridge. Six months after their wedding, he took her to Puerto Rico for their honeymoon. She, too, fell in love with the Caribbean island, and they vacationed there every February throughout their 35-year marriage. They have two sons, Mark and Kenneth. Barnett later remarried to his second love, Harriet, and they were together for 25 years before she passed away.
His father helped him get into the electrician’s union in New York. It turned out to be an excellent move for him and his friend Dave, as they had plenty of work to keep them busy.
One day, while Barnett was doing electrical work in an apartment building on 58th Street, he got a call from the union’s business manager. He asked him to let his assistant finish the job — he had something much more prominent in mind for him.
“He told me to go over to the Empire State Building, so I did just that,” he said. “I go up to the top, meet my new boss, and ask what I’m supposed to be doing.”
It turns out that Barnett would install all the lighting atop the iconic landmark.
“People would say to me, ‘Aren’t you afraid to be up there, looking down?’ ‘What was there to be afraid about?,’” he would quip.
He worked for the union for 45 years until he retired to Maine.

Texto completo: The seven-day average of daily new cases rose to 34.7 on Friday, up from 20.7 one week ago.

Maine reported an additional 45 cases of COVID-19 on Friday, adding to the increase in the seven-day average of daily new cases.
The new cases bring Maine’s total since the start of the pandemic to 69,418. There have been 878 deaths, including one — a man 80 or older from Kennebec County — reported Friday.
Around the country, public health officials have attributed a recent rise in cases to the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant, increases in gatherings and lagging vaccination numbers. Maine’s new case numbers are still far below the daily case counts the state was seeing at peaks in January and April, but the seven-day average has increased over recent weeks.
On Friday the seven-day average of daily new cases was at 34.7, up from 20.7 one week ago and 22.1 two weeks ago. The seven-day positivity rate for PCR tests was 1.08. That’s more than double the .45% rate nine days ago.
Androscoggin County reported the highest rate of new cases over the last two weeks with 45 total cases, or just over four new cases per 10,000 residents. Washington County, which saw just three new cases over the last two weeks, reported the lowest new case rate at 0.96 cases per 10,000 residents, according to new county-by-county CDC data.
Hospitalizations around the state have remained fairly steady in recent weeks. On Friday there were 31 people hospitalized, including 16 in critical care and six on ventilators.
Vaccinations, meanwhile, have dropped off, though Maine continues to have one of the best vaccination rates in the country. As of Thursday, 59.5% of Maine’s 1.3 million people had received their final dose of the vaccine. That figure rises to 67.6% among residents 12 or older who are eligible for vaccination.
The Maine CDC has tracked 560 “breakthrough” cases of fully vaccinated people who have contracted the virus, which is 0.07% of the more than 800,000 vaccinated individuals in the state.
Around the U.S., daily case numbers are climbing as the delta variant, a highly transmissible form of the disease first detected in India, spreads mostly among unvaccinated people. According to the New York Times, daily case counts are up more than 100% over two weeks ago with Arkansas and Missouri — two states with low vaccination rates — leading the country in new case rates.
On Friday there were 35,561 new cases of COVID-19 reported nationwide, bringing the nation’s seven-day daily average of new cases to 28,315. The seven-day average two weeks ago was 12,799, the Times reported.

Texto completo: Supporters and opponents of a 145-mile power line expansion through northern and western Maine have spent more than $15 million so far this year in their efforts to sway voters ahead of a statewide ballot question in November.
The 2021 campaign finance filings updated Thursday also showed that Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, had raised just over $586,000 for her re-election campaign, while spending about $127,000. Mills hasn't officially declared that she is running for re-election.
The power line expansion referendum will ask voters if they want to ban the New England Clean Energy Connect project and require the Legislature to approve similar projects by a two-thirds vote going forward.
The ballot question will read: "Do you want to ban the construction of high-impact electric transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region and to require the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine, both retroactively to 2020, and to require the Legislature, retroactively to 2014, to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public land?"
The top spender so far in 2021 is Clean Energy Matters, a PAC bankrolled by the power line company itself, which is a collaboration between Central Maine Power Co. and Hydro-Quebec. Both power companies also have independently donated to the PAC, which has shelled out nearly $10.4 million in its effort to sway voters to support the corridor.
In addition, another PAC, the Hydro-Quebec Maine Partnership, has spent another $2.9 million promoting the corridor this year, while a PAC formed to oppose the corridor, Mainers for Local Power, has spent just over $2.1 million, according to campaign finance reports filed this week with the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices.
Since forming in 2019 to support the corridor, Clean Energy Matters has spent $25.2 million, much of it on broadcast advertising in an attempt to gain voter support for the power line, which is being built to deliver energy from hydropower facilities in Quebec to the New England Power grid. Much of that electricity is going to satisfy renewable energy portfolio requirements in Massachusetts.
Combined spending from proponents and opponents of the corridor has exceeded $42 million, campaign finance records show. An earlier ballot question effort, aimed at overturning a Public Utilities Commission decision to approve the expansion, was ended by a Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruling that the question was unconstitutional.
Reports filed with the ethics commission Thursday show that spending on the effort has gone on unabated in 2021 - as the Legislature has debated bills related not only to electricity transmission but also to whether foreign governments should be allowed to spend money to influence ballot measures.
Hydro-Quebec is owned by the provincial government in Quebec, and CMP's parent company is owned by the Spanish energy giant, Iberdrola.
On Monday, the Legislature is expected to vote on Mills' veto of a bill that would ask voters if they want to create a consumer-owned utility that would buy out CMP and Versant Power. Versant serves much of northern and eastern Maine and is owned by the city of Calgary in Canada.
Mills also successfully vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature that would have banned foreign governments from contributing to election and ballot question campaigns in Maine.
Other details in the campaign finance reports issued Thursday showed Mills' top Republican challenger, former Gov. Paul LePage, had not reported any funds, although LePage only entered the race officially last week.
One other Republican in the race, Michael Heath, the former director of the Christian Civic League, reported raising $2,718 and spending $2,126. A third Republican who has registered with the commission as a candidate, Martin Vachon, also showed no fund-raising or expenditures in 2021. The same was the case for the Green Party candidate in the race, Michael Barden.
The reports also showed a Virginia-based ballot question committee, the Liberty Initiative Fund, had spent $567,000 in 2021. Most of that money went to a failed voter signature drive for a ballot question that would have banned non-citizens from voting under state law. Non-U.S. citizens are already banned from voting under federal law.
That committee has been largely funded by Richard Uihlein, a Midwestern shipping industry billionaire who has bankrolled conservative causes across the country. Since the committee formed in Maine in 2020 it has spent $835,000 and currently has about $9,600 in cash on hand.

Texto completo: GARDINER -- A funny thing happened when the Gardiner Public Library suspended fines during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Library card holders brought back their borrowed books in a more timely fashion. And in lieu of fines they might have otherwise paid, they dropped their coins in a donation jar, bringing in more money than late fees would have.
This month, the Gardiner City Council agreed to suspend library late fees indefinitely at the request of Anne Davis, director of the Gardiner Public Library.
In suspending its fines, the Gardiner Public library is joining a growing number of libraries across Maine and the country that are halting the practice that can for many people represent a barrier to access of library materials and services.
"It's now a pretty much researched issue," Davis said.
There is now an understanding that fines discriminate against the people that librarians most want to use their facilities - people who can't afford to buy books or may have literacy issues, and owing fines can disenfranchise them.
"I am not saying people aren't going to have to take responsibility for their items (not returned)," Davis told the City Council. "Eventually we will have to invoice them for the cost of the item. We just take away the silliness of the fines."
It's an issue that the American Library Association has taken up, via a resolution passed at the end of 2019. In it, the council of the organization that promotes library service and librarianship urges libraries to eliminate monetary fees, which can be a barrier to accessing the library and its services.
Melanie Huggins, president of the Public Libraries Association, said the pandemic accelerated the trend of suspending fees at public libraries, and the resolution has helped librarians across the country make the case for suspending late fees.
"Libraries ultimately don't want to create barriers to information or access to resources," she said. "The reason we exist is exactly the opposite of that. It's to make sure that everybody who needs information, who wants to make their lives better, has access to the resources and tools that help with that. Us eliminating fines makes a lot of sense. "
Libraries across Maine employ a variety of policies. In many cases, they will waive fines in exchange for food pantry donations, as the Lithgow Library in Augusta and others have done. Or they will have a Fine Forgiveness Day, as the Waterville Public Library has done.
The Skowhegan Public Library went fine-free in 2010. Library Director Angie Herrick, who started at the library at about that same time, said fines were a barrier to getting books back.
"We would rather lend it out for six months than just not get the book back at all," Herrick said.
But if books are not returned after six months, she said, library card holders aren't able to borrow more books, but they still have access to other library services, and they are free to read books while in the library.
"It's simply about getting the books back into the library to continue circulating them," she said.
The Oakland Public Library continues to impose fines on late books, at a cost of 5 cents a day.
"We do accept late fees," said Sarah Roy, Oakland Library's head librarian, "only because some of the books don't come back. We keep the fees on record, but the people don't come back, either."
For the most part, Roy said, people don't mind paying the fee. Patrons are generally granted a day of grace before the fine is imposed, and she will waive fines if they are less than $1, and particularly if the borrower is a child. If the fines reach $1, she said, cardholders are not allowed to take out any more books until the fine is paid and the books are returned.
In the event a book is not returned, it's marked as lost and the penalty is the price of the book and the late fee.
"Usually, if they bring the book back, I'm so happy I forgive them the fine," Roy said.
In the larger discussion of fines, some worry that ending fees translates to lost revenue.
In Gardiner, Davis said fines add up to about $6,000 annually, but she anticipates donations will surpass that.
"The intent of fines and fees was not necessarily in most of our libraries to generate revenue," said Huggins, who is the executive director of the Richland Library in Columbia, South Carolina. "It was to ensure our materials came back. It was to incentivize, with negative consequences, certain behaviors."
Davis said Gardiner has ordinances and laws to protect the library and its possessions. In extreme cases, such as when people borrow a large amount of material and fail to return any of it, Davis said she can call the police to retrieve the items.
"It doesn't end well," she said. "The stuff comes back damaged because of the frustration, or CDs or DVDs come back all broken. It's my last-ditch effort. I've done it maybe twice in my 30 years. It was because someone had maybe 25 items and a lot of them were out of print."
In making her pitch to the Gardiner City Council, Davis said the fine policy would not apply to other items that the library lends out, including passes to Maine state parks and computers. After a certain amount of time, the library would send out a bill for the delinquent item that would hinder access until the bill is paid.

Texto completo: However, officials here say the disease – which has afflicted blue jays, grackles and some songbirds – is not a cause for concern in Maine at this time.

Officials in Maine are monitoring the spread of a mysterious disease that has caused blindness and death in songbirds throughout the mid-Atlantic states and Ohio Valley in recent months. But Maine biologists are not going as far as officials in Connecticut and Massachusetts, who have asked the public to take in feeders and bird baths.
As of Friday, the disease has not been found in birds north of Pennsylvania, said Adrienne Leppold, songbird biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife. Leppold said the illness is not a cause for concern in Maine at this time.
“To be honest, I find the amount of outdoor cats and window strikes way more alarming for birds and bird populations than this disease,” Leppold said.
Scientists don’t yet know what is causing the disease — or even if taking down bird feeders helps stop the spread of it, she said.
“They’ve been able to rule out what it is not — it’s not a few of the common diseases, such as West Nile,” Leppold said. “And there is no evidence that it’s zoonotic — that it transmits to other animals. It is not any of the identified kinds of fungus or … viruses out there.”
The unknown bird disease has been reported in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Washington, D.C., the National Audubon Society said. It has affected mostly young blue jays, common grackles, European starlings and American robins, and some songbird species. The symptoms include eye swelling and crusty discharge, but also apparent neurological problems with birds seeming disoriented.
Leppold is not concerned at this time that the disease will spread to Maine because the spring migration has ended and any bird migrations now will occur north to south. And, she added, there is some speculation the that disease is caused by emerging cicadas hatching this year in the mid-Atlantic and South.
Leppold said the disease would first show up in New York or Connecticut before Maine. She called the chance of it occurring here first “infinitesimally small.”
Maine Audubon Naturalist Doug Hitchcox said public interest in the disease — and steps being taken elsewhere in New England to stem the spread — is surprising given there are greater, more obvious threats to bird populations in the United States.
“Outdoor cats contribute to bird mortality at an alarming rate,” Hitchcox said. “Over 2 billion birds in the United States are killed by outdoor cats. That is almost hard to wrap your head around.”
Hitchcox first started getting questions from the public about it around July 4. Last week, emails about the disease filled his inbox. One woman in Augusta was distraught — because she took up backyard birding with feeders during the pandemic and didn’t want to give up her newfound passion, Hitchcox said.
But Maine Audubon will follow IFW and not recommend any action by the public other than the normal cleaning of feeders.
Hitchcox said people should clean seed feeders at least four times a year to stop the spread of fungus and disease, and every three days for hummingbird feeders.
“I thought it would be premature for us to jump on board, just because everyone else was,” Hitchcox said. “I don’t want to sound critical of Massachusetts’ decision, but it seems way too much of a step for not having enough information. I have a theory that if we were not coming out of a pandemic, this would not be as big a story.”

Maine adds 3K jobs in June; jobless rate holds at 4.8%

Texto completo: The unemployment rate, adjusted seasonally, has been unchanged in Maine for five consecutive months.

Nonfarm payroll jobs in Maine increased by 3,000 to 614,900 in June, according to a report issued Friday by the Maine Department of Labor. Despite this increase, the state’s unemployment rate held steady at 4.8% for the fifth consecutive month.
Most of the jobs added in June were in public and private education. According to Glenn Mills, labor economist at the Maine Center for Workforce Research and Information, there is always a decline in education jobs in June, but because the data is seasonally adjusted, a smaller decline than usual is reflected as an increase in the June report.
The number of payroll jobs was up 47,000 from June of last year — mostly in leisure and hospitality, retail trade, professional and business services and manufacturing sectors — but there remained 25,100 fewer jobs in the state than in February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the market.
“June was a continuation of the gradual trend we’ve seen of improvement in the labor market after the significant hit that was taken in the spring of 2020,” Mills said. “In March and April last year, with the closure of the economy, we lost 95,000 jobs. We gained quite a few back very quickly in May and August last year and since then it’s been more of a modest gradual trend. There was a flat period in the fall into the winter when the COVID spike happened, and now that that’s over and vaccination rates are up, we’re continuing to gain jobs and get closer to being back to the normal state of things.”
The unemployment rate of 4.8% is kept artificially low by continued low labor force participation rates compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Mills said. The rate remained unchanged from the previous month at 60.2%, 2.4 points lower than in February 2020.
If the June labor force participation rate were the same as this pre-pandemic level, the unemployment rate would be 8.4%, the report states.
Mills explained that this low labor force participation rate likely is related to people choosing to retire earlier than initially planned, as well as the continued disruption of K-12 education. Because many students only attended school two or three days a week throughout the past year, parents may have stayed out of the labor force to address child care needs.
“Assuming that the pandemic continues to get further and further into our rearview mirrors going forward, hopefully in September school will be normal and parents who have been held out of the labor force will be able to be back fully,” Mills said.
Overall, the report reflects a hopeful path to a full recovery for the state’s labor market, he said.
“We’re doing about the same and perhaps a little better than the nation in terms of our recovery,” Mills said. “We have 3.9% fewer jobs than we had before the pandemic, and the nation has 4.4% fewer. So we’re not that far off from being all the way back.”
The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.9% in June, up slightly from 5.8% in May.

“We’re doing about the same and perhaps a little better than the nation in terms of our recovery,” Mills said. “We have 3.9% fewer jobs than we had before the pandemic, and the nation has 4.4% fewer. So we’re not that far off from being all the way back.”
The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.9% in June, up slightly from 5.8% in May.

Texto completo: A ballot question in November will ask voters if they want to prohibit the project. Proponents and opponents of the power line have spent more than $42 million since 2019.

Supporters and opponents of a 145-mile power line expansion through northern and western Maine have spent more than $15 million so far this year in their efforts to sway voters ahead of a statewide ballot question in November.
The 2021 campaign finance filings updated Thursday also showed that Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, had raised just over $586,000 for her reelection campaign, while spending about $127,000. Mills hasn’t officially declared that she is running for reelection.
The power line expansion referendum will ask voters if they want to ban the New England Clean Energy Connect project and require the Legislature to approve similar projects by a two-thirds vote going forward.
The ballot question will read: “Do you want to ban the construction of high-impact electric transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region and to require the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine, both retroactively to 2020, and to require the Legislature, retroactively to 2014, to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public land?”
The top spender so far in 2021 is Clean Energy Matters, a political action committee bankrolled by the power line company itself, which is a collaboration between Central Maine Power Co. and Hydro-Quebec. Both power companies also have independently donated to the PAC, which has shelled out nearly $10.4 million in its effort to sway voters to support the corridor.
In addition, another PAC, the Hydro-Quebec Maine Partnership, has spent another $2.9 million promoting the corridor this year, while a PAC formed to oppose the corridor, Mainers for Local Power, has spent just over $2.1 million, according to campaign finance reports filed this week with the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices.
Since forming in 2019 to support the corridor, Clean Energy Matters has spent $25.2 million, much of it on broadcast advertising in an attempt to gain voter support for the power line, which is being built to deliver energy from hydropower facilities in Quebec to the New England Power grid. Much of that electricity is going to satisfy renewable energy portfolio requirements in Massachusetts.
Combined spending from proponents and opponents of the corridor has exceeded $42 million, campaign finance records show. An earlier ballot question effort, aimed at overturning a Public Utilities Commission decision to approve the expansion, was ended by a Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruling that the question was unconstitutional.
Reports filed with the ethics commission Thursday show that spending on the effort has gone on unabated in 2021 — as the Legislature has debated bills related not only to electricity transmission but also to whether foreign governments should be allowed to spend money to influence ballot measures.
Hydro-Quebec is owned by the provincial government in Quebec, and CMP’s parent company is owned by the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola.
On Monday, the Legislature is expected to vote on Mills’ veto of a bill that would ask voters if they want to create a consumer-owned utility that would buy out CMP and Versant Power. Versant serves much of northern and eastern Maine and is owned by the city of Calgary in Canada.
Mills also vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature that would have banned foreign governments from contributing to election and ballot question campaigns in Maine.
Other details in the campaign finance reports issued Thursday showed Mills’ top Republican challenger, former Gov. Paul LePage, had not reported any funds, although Le-Page only entered the race officially last week.
One other Republican in the race, Michael Heath, the former director of the Christian Civic League, reported raising $2,718 and spending $2,126. A third Republican who has registered with the commission as a candidate, Martin Vachon, also showed no fund-raising or expenditures in 2021. The same was the case for the Green Party candidate in the race, Michael Barden.
The reports also showed a Virginia-based ballot question committee, the Liberty Initiative Fund, had spent $567,000 in 2021. Most of that money went to a failed voter signature drive for a ballot question that would have banned noncitizens from voting under state law. Non-U.S. citizens are already banned from voting under federal law.
That committee has been largely funded by Richard Uihlein, a Midwestern billionaire who has bankrolled conservative causes across the country. Since the committee formed in Maine in 2020, it has spent $835,000, and currently has about $9,600 in cash on hand.

Texto completo: Officials in Maine are monitoring the spread of a mysterious disease that has caused blindness and death in songbirds throughout the mid-Atlantic states and Ohio Valley in recent months. But Maine biologists are not going as far as officials in Connecticut and Massachusetts, who have asked the public to take in feeders and bird baths.
As of Friday, the disease has not been found in birds north of Pennsylvania, said Adrienne Leppold, songbird biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Leppold said the illness is not a cause for concern in Maine at this time.
"To be honest, I find the amount of outdoor cats and window strikes way more alarming for birds and bird populations than this disease," Leppold said.
Scientists don't yet know what is causing the disease - or even if taking down bird feeders helps stop the spread of it, she said.
"They've been able to rule out what it is not - it's not a few of the common diseases, such as West Nile," Leppold said. "And there is no evidence that it's zoonotic - that it transmits to other animals. It is not any of the commonly identified kinds of fungus or bacteria viruses out there."
The unknown bird disease has been reported in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Washington D.C., the National Audubon Society said. It has affected mostly young blue jays, common grackles, European starlings and American robins, as well as other songbird species. The symptoms include eye swelling and crusty discharge, but also apparent neurological problems with birds seeming disoriented.
Leppold is not concerned at this time that the disease will spread to Maine because the spring migration has ended and any bird migrations now will occur north to south. And, she added, there is some speculation the that disease is caused by emerging cicadas hatching this year in the mid-Atlantic and South.
Leppold said the disease would first show up in New York or Connecticut before Maine. She called the chance of it occurring here first "infinitesimally small."
Maine Audubon Naturalist Doug Hitchcox said public interest in the disease - and steps being taken elsewhere in New England to stem the spread - is surprising given there are greater, more obvious threats to bird populations in the United States.
"Outdoor cats contribute to bird mortality at an alarming rate," Hitchcox said. "Over 2 billion birds in the United States are killed by outdoor cats. That is almost hard to wrap your head around."
Hitchcox first started getting questions from the public about it around July 4. Last week, emails about the disease filled his inbox. One woman in Augusta was distraught - because she took up backyard birding with feeders during the pandemic and didn't want to give up her newfound passion, Hitchcox said.
But Maine Audubon will follow IFW and not recommend any action by the public other than the normal cleaning of feeders. Hitchcox said people should clean seed feeders at least four times a year to stop the spread of fungus and disease, and every three days for hummingbird feeders.
"I thought it would be premature for us to jump on board, just because everyone else was," Hitchcox said. "I don't want to sound critical of Massachusetts' decision, but it seems way too much of a step for not having enough information. I have a theory that if we were not coming out of a pandemic, this would not be as big a story."

Texto completo: Wellness Connection of Maine sued the state in December to overturn a requirement that all medical marijuana dispensaries be owned by Mainers.

The state’s largest cannabis company is continuing its efforts to eliminate Maine’s marijuana residency requirements for sellers, now with a federal lawsuit against the state’s medical program.
And despite agreeing not to enforce the requirement in the recreational cannabis program, the state is pushing back.
U.S. District Judge Nancy Torresen heard oral arguments on the case Friday in U.S. District Court in Portland, a case she said was unusual given the “elephant in the room,” that marijuana sales violate federal law.
Wellness Connection of Maine and its parent company, High Street Capital Partners of Delaware, sued the state in December to overturn a requirement that all medical marijuana dispensaries be owned by Mainers, making the same constitutional argument it used earlier in 2020 to open the state’s recreational market to out-of-state investors.
The state’s medical marijuana market can be lucrative, the lawsuit notes, bringing in more than $100 million in 2019. Medical marijuana became the state’s most valuable cash crop in 2020, bringing in over $260 million.
The plaintiffs say that not only does the state’s residency requirement devalue Wellness Connection by limiting its universe of potential investors, it also harms all of Maine’s dispensaries.
“The self-evident purpose of the residency requirement is to discriminate against nonresidents such as plaintiff High Street, a prospective out-of-state investor, and to exclude them from the economic opportunities available to medical marijuana dispensaries in Maine,” they argued, thereby restricting the flow of investment into the state and stifling the dispensaries’ ability to operate within the program.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs said, the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s so-called “dormant Commerce Clause,” which prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce, “by explicitly and purposefully favoring Maine residents over nonresidents.”
But state officials argue that the clause is irrelevant. The “ultimate test of whether state laws violate the dormant Commerce Clause asks whether a state has done something to restrict interstate commerce in a manner more severe than where Congress has left the market,” the Maine Attorney General’s Office wrote in court documents.
The clause does not apply to Maine’s intrastate market for medical marijuana, nor do the laws “burden interstate commerce more severely than Congress, since Congress has eliminated that market entirely,” they said.
The state also argued that it should be protected under the 11th Amendment, which prohibits citizens from suing a state or state agency in federal court unless the state has consented to being sued or Congress has repealed the state’s immunity from such.
The United Cannabis Coalition, a nonprofit trade group and an intervenor in the case, also wants to see the residency requirement stand.
Coalition members, primarily medical marijuana providers known in the market as caregivers, say they have a legal and economic interest in the statute because if the residency requirement is struck down, they risk economic harm from the “shifting market forces throughout Maine’s medical-use marijuana industry caused by spikes in out-of-state funding or competition.”
Torresen did not issue a decision on Friday and did not set a timeline to do so.
This is the third lawsuit in just over a year arguing that Maine’s marijuana laws discriminate against residents of other states.
As written, Maine law requires every officer, director and manager of an adult-use cannabis business — and most of its ownership — to live and file taxes in Maine for at least four years.
In March 2020, Wellness Connection’s sister company, NPG LLC, sued the state over the residency requirement in the adult-use marijuana statute — the first time a marijuana company had challenged such a requirement.
The requirement would have given locals a leg up when the adult-use market launched in October, but Wellness Connection argued that it was unconstitutional. The company is controlled by multinational corporation Acreage Holdings, whose investors reside outside of Maine.
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey agreed with the challenge and found that the requirement “is subject to significant constitutional challenges” and would likely not hold up in court.
Accordingly, state officials announced in May 2020 that they would abandon the in-state residency requirement, resolving the lawsuit.
State officials could not be reached for comment Friday about why they did not make the same concession for the medical program, choosing instead to continue litigation.
Using the same argument of unconstitutionality, NPG LLC sued the city of Portland over its ordinance that gave preference to Maine residents when awarding retail marijuana licenses. In response, the City Council voted to give licenses to all qualified first-round applicants, though in November, voters decided to eliminate the retail license cap altogether.
The plaintiffs in Friday’s case said the residency requirement for dispensaries is “cut from the same cloth” as the residency requirement in the adult-use marijuana law and is worse than Portland’s ordinance because it bans nonresidents altogether.
Local licensing preference has been at the heart of Maine’s marijuana laws since the medical dispensary system was created in 2011 and recreational marijuana was approved by voters in 2016. Marijuana advocates used the residents-only language to gain political support for legalization, characterizing it as a jobs generator.

Coast Guard rescues trio clinging to hull
Three people clinging to the hull of an overturned sailboat were rescued 20 miles off the coast of Portsmouth Friday evening.
Coast Guard crews using a Jayhawk helicopter rescued the people from the 42-foot sailing vessel Triad. They were taken to Pease Air National Guard Base in Portsmouth, the Coast Guard said in a tweet.
The Coast Guard was notified of the situation after receiving an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon alert at 4:21 p.m.
Petty Officer Amanda Wyrick told the Portsmouth Herald that no one was injured. The Coast Guard has not released the names of the people who were rescued.
"The reason they were so easily located is they stuck with their boat," Wyrick told the Portsmouth Herald. "That's exactly what we tell people to do in that situation."
RICHMOND
Official says arrest won't affect his position
The selectboard chairman charged this week with drunken driving said Friday that the incident is "embarrassing" but will not impact his elected position.
Robert "Bucky" Bodge was arrested Wednesday night on charges of operating a vehicle under the influence and for failing to stop for law enforcement. The Richmond Police said Bodge was driving erratically when they made the traffic stop.
Bodge said in an interview Friday he can "still make responsible decisions."
"It's just that one thing there and I'm not guilty until I go through the process; it's just embarrassing more than anything," he said.
Other members of Richmond's five-member selectboard, which includes Bodge's brother, Randy, could not be reached for comment Friday.
In addition, the Town Office was closed Friday and Town Manager Laurisa Loon could not be reached for comment on any municipal policies that would apply to Bodge's situation.
"I am caught in a situation and it is what it is unfortunately," he said. "It's embarrassing and I realize how things go and I'll own it."
VASSALBORO
Criminal justice academy graduates largest class
The largest class in history graduated from the Maine Criminal Justice Academy's Basic Law Enforcement Training Program on Friday.
The class included 16 women, the highest number to graduate from the program at one time. The class of 67 police cadets came from 35 agencies from South Berwick to Fort Kent.
For the first time, Maine Forest Service rangers attended the 18-week residential training program in Vassalboro.
The ceremony was held outside on the parade deck and included law enforcement officers, friends and family of the graduates, and the Maine Pipe & Drum Crops.
AUGUSTA
Plane lands safely without landing gear
A plane with malfunctioning landing gear landed Thursday at the Augusta State Airport, with no injuries reported to either of the plane's two occupants.
John Guimond, airport manager, said Friday that the disabled aircraft forced the airport to close its main runway for a couple hours in order to remove the plane after its landing gear collapsed. Federal Aviation Administration officials identified the plane as a single-engine Beechcraft C24R.
Guimond described it as a minor incident and said neither the pilot nor passenger were injured. He said the plane occupants, whom he did not name, were a flight instructor for Maine Instrument Flight and a student pilot who were landing when the plane's landing gear malfunctioned and collapsed, forcing the plane to land on its belly and come skidding to a stop.
Officials of Maine Instrument Flight, the Augusta State Airport's fixed base operator which describes itself as Maine's only full-service aviation company, declined to comment on the incident, the extent of damage to the plane, or reveal the identities of those aboard the plane. FAA records indicate the Maine Instrument Flight-owned plane was manufactured in 1979.
FAA officials, in an emailed statement, said the plane, which has retractable landing gear, landed with its gear up around 3:30 p.m. Thursday with two people aboard. The official said the agency would investigate the incident.

Texto completo: The seven-day average of daily new cases rose to 34.7 on Friday, up from 20.7 one week ago.

Maine reported an additional 45 cases of COVID-19 on Friday, adding to the increase in the seven-day average of daily new cases.
The new cases bring Maine’s total since the start of the pandemic to 69,418. There have been 878 deaths, including one — a man 80 or older from Kennebec County — reported Friday.
Around the country, public health officials have attributed a recent rise in cases to the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant, increases in gatherings and lagging vaccination numbers. Maine’s new case numbers are still far below the daily case counts the state was seeing at peaks in January and April, but the seven-day average has increased over recent weeks.
On Friday the seven-day average of daily new cases was at 34.7, up from 20.7 one week ago and 22.1 two weeks ago. The seven-day positivity rate for PCR tests was 1.08. That’s more than double the .45% rate nine days ago.
Androscoggin County reported the highest rate of new cases over the last two weeks with 45 total cases, or just over four new cases per 10,000 residents. Washington County, which saw just three new cases over the last two weeks, reported the lowest new case rate at 0.96 cases per 10,000 residents, according to new county-by-county CDC data.
Hospitalizations around the state have remained fairly steady in recent weeks. On Friday there were 31 people hospitalized, including 16 in critical care and six on ventilators.
Vaccinations, meanwhile, have dropped off, though Maine continues to have one of the best vaccination rates in the country. As of Thursday, 59.5% of Maine’s 1.3 million people had received their final dose of the vaccine. That figure rises to 67.6% among residents 12 or older who are eligible for vaccination.
The Maine CDC has tracked 560 “breakthrough” cases of fully vaccinated people who have contracted the virus, which is 0.07% of the more than 800,000 vaccinated individuals in the state.
Around the U.S., daily case numbers are climbing as the delta variant, a highly transmissible form of the disease first detected in India, spreads mostly among unvaccinated people. According to the New York Times, daily case counts are up more than 100% over two weeks ago with Arkansas and Missouri — two states with low vaccination rates — leading the country in new case rates.
On Friday there were 35,561 new cases of COVID-19 reported nationwide, bringing the nation’s seven-day daily average of new cases to 28,315. The seven-day average two weeks ago was 12,799, the Times reported.

Texto completo: The move comes as more public libraries across central Maine and the country recognize that imposing late fees is an equity issue.

GARDINER — A funny thing happened when the Gardiner Public Library suspended fines during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Library card holders brought back their borrowed books in a more timely fashion. And in lieu of fines they might have otherwise paid, they dropped their coins in a donation jar, bringing in more money than the late fees would have.
Earlier this month, the Gardiner City Council agreed to suspend library late fees indefinitely at the request of Anne Davis, director of the Gardiner Public Library.
In suspending its fines, the Gardiner Public library is joining a growing number of libraries across Maine and across the country that are halting the practice that can for many people represent a barrier to access of library materials and services.
“It’s now a pretty much researched issue,” Davis said.
There is now a a thought process that fines are discriminating against the people that librarians most want to use their facilities — people who can’t afford to buy books or may have literacy issues, and owing fines can disenfranchise them.
“I am not saying people aren’t going to have to take responsibility for their items (not returned),” Davis told the City Council. “Eventually we will have to invoice them for the cost of the item. We just take away the silliness of the fines.”
It’s an issue that the American Library Association has taken up via a resolution passed at the end of 2019. In it, the council of the organization that promotes library service and librarianship urges libraries to eliminate monetary fees, which can be a barrier to accessing the library and its services.
Melanie Huggins, president of the Public Libraries Association, said the pandemic accelerated the trend of suspending fees at public libraries, and the resolution has helped librarians across the country make the case for suspending late fees.
It is, Huggins said, an equity issue.
“Libraries ultimately don’t want to create barriers to information or access to resources,” she said. “The reason we exist is exactly the opposite of that. It’s to make sure that everybody who needs information, who wants to make their lives better, has access to the resources and tools that help with that. Us eliminating fines makes a lot of sense. If we want kids to read, if we want them to have books in their hands, why are we the ones creating barriers to that?”
Libraries across central Maine employ a variety of policies. In many cases, they will waive fines in exchange for food pantry donations, as the Lithgow Library in Augusta and others have done. Or they will have a Fine Forgiveness Day, as the Waterville Public Library has done.
The Skowhegan Public Library went fine-free in 2010. Library Director Angie Herrick, who started at the library at about that same time, said fines were a barrier to getting books back.
“We would rather lend it out for six months than just not get the book back at all,” Herrick said.
But if books are not returned after six months, she said, library card holders aren’t able to borrow more books, but they still have access to other library services, and they are free to read books while in the library.
“It’s simply about getting the books back into the library to continue circulating them,” she said.
The Oakland Public Library continues to impose fines on late books, at a cost of 5 cents a day.
“We do accept late fees,” said Sarah Roy, Oakland Library’s head librarian, “only because some of the books don’t come back. We keep the fees on record, but the people don’t come back, either.”
For the most part, Roy said, people don’t mind paying the fee. Patrons are generally granted a day of grace before the fine is imposed, and she will waive fines if they are less than $1, and particularly if the borrower is a child. If the fines reach $1, she said, cardholders are not allowed to take out any more books until the fine is paid and the books are returned.
In the event a book is not returned, it’s marked as lost and the penalty is the price of the book and the late fee.
“Usually, if they bring the book back, I’m so happy I forgive them the fine,” Roy said.
In the larger discussion of fines, some consider that ending fees translates to lost revenue.
In Gardiner, Davis said fines add up to about $6,000 annually, but she anticipates donations will surpass that.
“The intent of fines and fees was not necessarily in most of our libraries to generate revenue,” said Huggins, who is the executive director of the Richland Library in Columbia, South Carolina. “It was to ensure our materials came back. It was to incentivize, with negative consequences, certain behaviors.”
Davis said Gardiner has ordinances and laws to protect the library and its possessions. In extreme cases, as when people borrow a large amount of materials and fail to return any of it, Davis said she can call the police to retrieve the items.
“It doesn’t end well,” she said. “The stuff comes back damaged because of the frustration, or CDs or DVDs come back all broken. It’s my last ditch effort. I’ve done it maybe twice in my 30 years. It was because someone had maybe 25 items and a lot of them were out of print.”
In making her pitch to the Gardiner City Council, Davis said the fine policy would not apply to other items that the library lends out, including passes to Maine state parks and computers. After a certain amount of time, the library would send out a bill for the delinquent item that would hinder access until the bill is paid.

Tax revaluations put focus on aid programs Officials are promoting a range of relief programs to help taxpayers cope with the recent reassessment of property values in Portland and South Portland - a shock for many.

Texto completo: More than 1,000 Portland residents have so far appealed new property tax assessments ahead of a July 21 deadline, a reaction to sharp increases that have some residents wondering if they can afford to stay.
Many South Portland residents are experiencing the same sticker shock because of a similar citywide revaluation in the midst of the red-hot real estate market.
While there is still time to challenge assessments, many residents also are looking at other avenues for tax relief.
Both Portland and South Portland, as well as the state, offer a range of resources aimed at protecting homeowners and preventing vulnerable populations, such as seniors and economically disadvantaged residents, from being forced out of their homes by rising costs.
Portland Tax Assessor Christopher Huff said understanding these programs and tax exceptions are an essential part of the property value reassessment process.
"Anything that reduces that tax burden is ... a welcome program to those that are eligible for them," Huff said.
The most popular relief program, Huff said, is the Maine Homestead Exemption Program. If you have lived in your property for at least a year and it is your primary residence you qualify for this exemption. The amount of a property assessment that is exempt is set by the state Legislature. This year, legislators have set it at $25,000 of just value. A $25,000 exemption is expected to reduce a tax bill in Portland by about $330 next year.
"What this means is that, if you qualify, your taxable assessment is reduced by $25,000," Huff said. "Last year we had over 8,800 properties in the city eligible for that program. For this coming year, it will be close to $3 million in tax relief."
Both Portland and South Portland also have local tax relief programs aimed at senior citizens.
The Portland Senior Tax Equity Program, or 'P-Step,' is a local program passed by the city in 2017 for residents over 62 years old. In order to qualify, residents also must have qualified for the Property Tax Fairness Credit, a statewide tax credit for those who meet certain income and property tax requirements or qualifications. This credit can be claimed while filing the 1040 Maine income tax form.
"If the state gave you a credit for the Property Tax Fairness credit (and you are over 62 years old), the city will match it dollar for dollar up to $900," Huff said. "Not only could you get $900 through the state property tax fairness credit, but then the city will match that up to $900."
In South Portland, the program is available to seniors 68 or older and who have also qualified for the state' property tax fairness credit. In 2020, the maximum benefit a single household would receive was $300 and the maximum benefit for a couple household was $400.
There are also exemptions to specifically vulnerable segments of the population such as a blind exemption, for the visually impaired, as well as an exemption for veterans. Widows of veterans also are eligible for the veteran exemption.
South Portland City Councilor Susan Henderson, who has highlighted these relief programs in the past, stressed the importance of getting ahead of issues like this early on. With the way many of the relief programs are structured, it is easier to take advantage of them before debt has started to accumulate.
"If people are getting into trouble with their rent or their mortgage, they really should seek out help early on," Henderson said.
"People tend to be proud ... and they wait and wait, and when they finally seek help, they are so far that their landlord is talking about eviction, or the bank is talking about eviction. It is much harder to help someone when they're in that state; for example some of the city programs can help with rent, but not with back rent.
For Henderson, who believes housing is a human right, the reassessment has been frustrating, especially after a trying year of economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The goal is to help people stay in their homes ... help people not lose the roof over their heads," Henderson said. The reassessment is "really going to hurt some people, and I think that's tragic because all the effort with the pandemic and the recession was to try and avoid hurting people."
Huff hoped to remind residents that these relief programs were designed to help them and that they should be utilized to their fullest extent.
"People should take advantage of everything available to them," he said. "Whether that's a tax relief program, whether that's challenging of a newly assessed value ... these programs aren't the end-all-be-all for everyone, but their intention certainly is is to help relieve the burden to whatever extent possible."
A full list of exemptions and programs are available on the Portland and South Portland city websites.

Texto completo: The system also announced plans for unvaccinated students and staff to participate in required COVID testing and quarantine upon arriving on campuses this fall.

The University of Maine System will require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students when the federal government gives final approval to the vaccines and they are no longer in emergency use authorization.
The system has said for months it would consider a vaccine requirement pending final approval and made the announcement Friday as it also unveiled other COVID-19 protocols for the fall semester, which starts Aug. 30.
“We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy said. “It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don’t wait and have to scramble.”
The UMaine System already has announced plans for a more traditional fall semester with the bulk of classes and activities being held in person, as they were before the pandemic. But Friday’s announcement outlined that some coronavirus safety protocols and rules will remain in place for unvaccinated staff and students.
Unvaccinated staff and students who plan to attend classes and work in-person will be required to participate in COVID-19 testing upon arriving on campuses and will have to quarantine while they await test results.
The university system is following state guidance and will drop masking requirements for vaccinated people indoors July 26, though unvaccinated people still will be asked to wear face coverings in university buildings going forward.
Students and staff are being asked to verify their vaccination status through an online portal. So far over, 5,000 of the system’s 35,000 staff and students have verified they are vaccinated, the system said Friday. Those who register as vaccinated before Aug. 20 will be exempt from the testing and quarantine arrival protocols.
During the semester, unvaccinated staff and students who are in-person can expect to participate in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing as often as once per week. “It will in all likelihood be once or twice per week, depending on the circumstances and what happens with the delta variant,” Malloy said. “The CDC may very well recommend more frequent testing as that variant becomes more common in Maine and elsewhere.”
The system is already conducting weekly asymptomatic testing of in-person students and staff who are unvaccinated during the summer in a carry-over from the testing regime last spring. In the last 14 days there have been 476 tests conducted and no positive results.
Hundreds of colleges and universities around the country, including several in Maine, have announced plans to require students, staff or both to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the fall. Malloy said the system envisions requiring the vaccine for both students and staff when full approval is granted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the system has noted that whatever policy is approved will “recognize and respect” that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated.
All three vaccines available in the United States are currently in emergency use authorization. On Friday CNN reported that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been granted priority review for its application for a full license. An FDA official told CNN a decision on full approval could come within two months.
In the meantime, the University of Maine System is continuing to encourage all students and employees who are able to get vaccinated to do so. On-campus vaccination clinics are currently being planned for the start of the fall semester.
The system also is launching a $1,000 Shot Clock Scholarship and will be awarding $1,000 scholarships on a weekly basis between now and Aug. 20 to students who verify their status as fully vaccinated online.

Texto completo: A ballot question in November will ask voters if they want to prohibit the project. Proponents and opponents of the power line have spent more than $42 million since 2019.

Supporters and opponents of a 145-mile power line expansion through northern and western Maine have spent more than $15 million so far this year in their efforts to sway voters ahead of a statewide ballot question in November.
The 2021 campaign finance filings updated Thursday also showed that Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, had raised just over $586,000 for her reelection campaign, while spending about $127,000. Mills hasn’t officially declared that she is running for reelection.
The power line expansion referendum will ask voters if they want to ban the New England Clean Energy Connect project and require the Legislature to approve similar projects by a two-thirds vote going forward.
The ballot question will read: “Do you want to ban the construction of high-impact electric transmission lines in the Upper Kennebec Region and to require the Legislature to approve all other such projects anywhere in Maine, both retroactively to 2020, and to require the Legislature, retroactively to 2014, to approve by a two-thirds vote such projects using public land?”
The top spender so far in 2021 is Clean Energy Matters, a political action committee bankrolled by the power line company itself, which is a collaboration between Central Maine Power Co. and Hydro-Quebec. Both power companies also have independently donated to the PAC, which has shelled out nearly $10.4 million in its effort to sway voters to support the corridor.
In addition, another PAC, the Hydro-Quebec Maine Partnership, has spent another $2.9 million promoting the corridor this year, while a PAC formed to oppose the corridor, Mainers for Local Power, has spent just over $2.1 million, according to campaign finance reports filed this week with the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices.
Since forming in 2019 to support the corridor, Clean Energy Matters has spent $25.2 million, much of it on broadcast advertising in an attempt to gain voter support for the power line, which is being built to deliver energy from hydropower facilities in Quebec to the New England Power grid. Much of that electricity is going to satisfy renewable energy portfolio requirements in Massachusetts.
Combined spending from proponents and opponents of the corridor has exceeded $42 million, campaign finance records show. An earlier ballot question effort, aimed at overturning a Public Utilities Commission decision to approve the expansion, was ended by a Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruling that the question was unconstitutional.
Reports filed with the ethics commission Thursday show that spending on the effort has gone on unabated in 2021 — as the Legislature has debated bills related not only to electricity transmission but also to whether foreign governments should be allowed to spend money to influence ballot measures.
Hydro-Quebec is owned by the provincial government in Quebec, and CMP’s parent company is owned by the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola.
On Monday, the Legislature is expected to vote on Mills’ veto of a bill that would ask voters if they want to create a consumer-owned utility that would buy out CMP and Versant Power. Versant serves much of northern and eastern Maine and is owned by the city of Calgary in Canada.
Mills also vetoed a bill passed by the Legislature that would have banned foreign governments from contributing to election and ballot question campaigns in Maine.
Other details in the campaign finance reports issued Thursday showed Mills’ top Republican challenger, former Gov. Paul LePage, had not reported any funds, although Le-Page only entered the race officially last week.
One other Republican in the race, Michael Heath, the former director of the Christian Civic League, reported raising $2,718 and spending $2,126. A third Republican who has registered with the commission as a candidate, Martin Vachon, also showed no fund-raising or expenditures in 2021. The same was the case for the Green Party candidate in the race, Michael Barden.
The reports also showed a Virginia-based ballot question committee, the Liberty Initiative Fund, had spent $567,000 in 2021. Most of that money went to a failed voter signature drive for a ballot question that would have banned noncitizens from voting under state law. Non-U.S. citizens are already banned from voting under federal law.
That committee has been largely funded by Richard Uihlein, a Midwestern billionaire who has bankrolled conservative causes across the country. Since the committee formed in Maine in 2020, it has spent $835,000, and currently has about $9,600 in cash on hand.

On Friday the University of Vermont was among the latest schools to announce a vaccine requirement for students.
Students at the University of Connecticut and in the University of Massachusetts System also will be required to get vaccinated. Rhode Island, in a rare step this week, announced that state will be the first in the nation where all institutions of higher learning both public and private will require COVID-19 vaccinations for students this fall.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Hampshire have passed a bill that would prohibit public colleges and universities from mandating vaccines and sent the bill to the governor for his signature last week. The University System of New Hampshire is still strongly encouraging students, faculty and staff to get vaccinated, Lisa Thorne, the system's director of communications, said in an email Friday.
In Maine, Malloy said the system envisions requiring the vaccine for both students and staff when full approval is granted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the system has noted that whatever policy is approved will "recognize and respect" that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated.

The system also is launching a $1,000 Shot Clock Scholarship and will be awarding $1,000 scholarships on a weekly basis between now and Aug. 20 to students who verify their status as fully vaccinated online.

Maine added 3,000 jobs in June But the state's unemployment rate, adjusted seasonally, held steady at 4.8% - unchanged for five consecutive months.

Texto completo: Nonfarm payroll jobs in Maine increased by 3,000 to 614,900 in June, according to a report issued Friday by the Maine Department of Labor. Despite this increase, the state's unemployment rate held steady at 4.8 percent for the fifth consecutive month.
Most of the jobs added in June were in public and private education. According to Glenn Mills, labor economist at the Maine Center for Workforce Research and Information, there is always a decline in education jobs in June, but because the data is seasonally adjusted, a smaller decline than usual is reflected as an increase in the June report.
The number of payroll jobs was up 47,000 from June of last year - mostly in leisure and hospitality, retail trade, professional and business services and manufacturing sectors - but there remained 25,100 fewer jobs in the state than in February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the market.
"June was a continuation of the gradual trend we've seen of improvement in the labor market after the significant hit that was taken in the spring of 2020," Mills said. "In March and April last year, with the closure of the economy, we lost 95,000 jobs. We gained quite a few back very quickly in May and August last year and since then it's been more of a modest gradual trend. There was a flat period in the fall into the winter when the COVID spike happened, and now that that's over and vaccination rates are up, we're continuing to gain jobs and get closer to being back to the normal state of things."
The unemployment rate of 4.8 percent is kept artificially low by continued low labor force participation rates compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Mills said. The rate remained unchanged from the previous month at 60.2 percent, 2.4 points lower than in February 2020.
If the June labor force participation rate were the same as this pre-pandemic level, the unemployment rate would be 8.4 percent, the report states.
Mills explained that this low labor force participation rate likely is related to people choosing to retire earlier than initially planned, as well as the continued disruption of K-12 education. Because many students only attended school two or three days a week throughout the past year, parents may have stayed out of the labor force to address childcare needs.
"Assuming that the pandemic continues to get further and further into our rearview mirrors going forward, hopefully in September school will be normal and parents who have been held out of the labor force will be able to be back fully," Mills said.
Overall, the report reflects a hopeful path to a full recovery for the state's labor market, he said.
"We're doing about the same and perhaps a little better than the nation in terms of our recovery," Mills said. "We have 3.9 percent fewer jobs than we had before the pandemic, and the nation has 4.4 percent fewer. So we're not that far off from being all the way back."
The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.9 percent in June, up slightly from 5.8 percent in May.

Texto completo: Gov. Mills' veto of the Pine Tree Power legislation, despite its bipartisan passage in the House and the Senate, shows her disregard for the energy future of the people of Maine. She should have read the recent audit report on Central Maine Power, which does not suggest a better future for CMP customers. It expresses great concern whether anecdotal recent improvements in customer service will be continued, based on the primary focus of CMP's parent, Avangrid, on profits at the expense of customer service and reliability.
The report suggests it took the threat of Pine Tree Power, plus the desire to get its transmission line to Canada built for the benefit of Massachusetts and Avangrid, to spark some temporary improvements in CMP's operations. But if CMP can defeat the Pine Tree Power referendum next year, and get the line to Canada built, all focus will return to profits at the expense of Maine customers.
The report clearly shows chaotic management of CMP by Avangrid, with constant turmoil in a management structure with little experience in utility operations. CMP is a microscopic 2 percent of the Avangrid-Iberdrola empire, and efforts are underway to acquire a New Mexico utility, further distracting Avangrid's focus away from Maine.
Makes me feel sorry for poor CMP staff, trying to run a utility under these conditions without local control. And, it makes me feel sorry for us Mainers, stuck with failed utilities that have left Maine with the least reliable grid and worst customer service in the nation, and high prices, too.

Questions need answers before Cape acts on plan
As a resident of Cape Elizabeth who supports affordable housing, I was persuaded by the July 1 Press Herald editorial to support the proposed Town Center apartment development ("Our View: Every Maine community has to pitch in on affordable housing"). However, after reading several letters in our local Cape Courier, I realized it's not so simple. Several concerns and issues need to be worked out before this project goes ahead:
n
The complex will bring more traffic to our busiest intersection, which will require a new traffic light. The estimated cost in 2005 was $1.2 million. Who will pay for this?
n
The town is forgoing $515,000 in local taxes through Tax Increment Financing, while the complex will benefit from town services. What will the net cost to the town be?
n
The town will relinquish parking spaces from Town Hall to the complex. Will we be compensated for them?
n
Forty-one of the 49 units are one-bedroom units. Will this appeal to the families with kids we want to attract?
n
Four ordinances in the 2019 Comprehensive Plan would have to be amended. What are the implications for the consistency and integrity of the plan?
I still support affordable housing, but first I want answers to these questions.
Just as this issue is more complicated than it originally appeared to be, your characterization of Cape Elizabeth residents as snobs and NIMBYs in your editorial and Greg Kearney's editorial cartoon (July 11, Page D3) are simplistic and uninformed.

Ex-legislator fails to back up criticism of law
In her July 15 letter to the editor, Amy Volk seems awfully confused.
After boldly stating "the so-called 'For the People' Act is not what they (Democrats) claim," she offers no proof.
She cites an inequity in Delaware law that would be addressed in the legislation. Apparently, Volk thinks President Biden has some control over state election laws. Strange.
Volk quotes Sen. Chuck Schumer's opinion on a totally different issue.
Volk then states that Democrats "ignored" advice on the legislation, without providing evidence.
All in all, the tone of this letter evokes Volk's (thankfully) short tenure in the Legislature: lots of ideology with little logic or process.

Sen. Collins was wise to oppose misguided S.1
I have been dismayed by a number of recent letters criticizing Sen. Susan Collins' vote against S.1, a bill that would have resulted in a federal takeover of the entire election system. Although it was branded a "voting rights bill," it was actually a Trojan horse concealing a host of bad policies.
One of the bill's misguided proposals called for injecting billions of our taxpayer dollars into federal campaigns to subsidize politicians. Does anyone honestly think that the problem with elections is that there is not enough money? I doubt many Americans support giving even more of their hard-earned dollars to already-bloated campaigns rather than paving our roads and funding our schools.
Just last year, the race between Sen. Collins and Sara Gideon was the second-most-expensive Senate campaign in the country. Out-of-state groups spent more than $100 million to persuade Maine voters, on top of record spending by both campaigns in an election that seemed to drag on for an eternity. If S.1 were law, it would only push the levels of spending even higher, funding (likely) negative ads and mailers targeting the voters at our own expense.
That is just plain wrong.
In addition, S.1 would have overruled the election laws of every single state - even Maine - although we have one of the highest turnout rates in the country and some of the most liberal election laws in the country.
Simply put, S.1 was a bad bill, and Sen. Collins was right to oppose it.

Texto completo: If anything needed repair around our home, my father fixed it. I remember when he replaced the two-holer in the shed with a glossy white flush model. It required a huge pit in the backyard, so he picked up a shovel and dug one. Then he rocked up the sides, making a wide, shallow well. Curious neighbors who stopped by were told that he was building a basilica. I seem to recall "Brother" Cline telling me that his father, Ralph, dug by hand the cellar that housed the electric motors beneath his sawmill.
It was the way people did things. Lack of cash, or no desire to part with it, were usually the motivating factors. So, outside of moving a house or barn onto a new foundation, it never occurred to me to hire a man to help with household chores I could handle myself.
As I grew older, my habit of self-sufficiency was reinforced when I'd hear of pretty wives who ran off with a handyman who had only been paid to build new cupboards or lay a carpet.
There is a disadvantage to always doing things yourself - when the day finally comes when it is no longer fun to repair your gutters, you have no idea who will do it for you. And if you have not established a long, pleasant relationship with your local handyman, it might be weeks before you'll see him. Some, who are inundated with work, conveniently forget you. If you don't call and whine every four days, he likes to believe that you've changed your mind.
Long after you no longer run up ladders, nimble as a mosquito, it is still possible to replace parts in your washing machine or dryer. I've taken our dryer apart so many times that I have written in black Magic Marker, beside each hex-drive sheet metal screw, the socket sizes: "5/16." If you're lucky there is a three-minute clip on YouTube - with no background music - that will show you how to put brake shoes on your '99 RAV4 or a suction pump on your washing machine.
Years ago, when I was handy with a movie camera, I considered putting up some how-to-fix-it videos of my washer and dryer. But I never got past doing a parody of a bullfight with the cows.
If you enjoy doing things on your own, there are also the how-to-do-it books. Because Maine winters are long and cold, isolated cabins in the backwoods are conducive to sharing one's expertise, so I would not be surprised if you know even more of the folks who write fix-it books than I do.
David published a guide on mushrooms, which is just what you might expect of a member of the Maine Mycological Association. It was just today that my Facebook friend Joyce posted a picture and asked, "Anyone know what kind of fungi this is?"
Most of my friends have spent more time in the library than out in the woods, so no one was surprised when Hal very quickly wrote "Fungi is plural. This is a fungus." This didn't help Joyce who simply wanted to know if she should eat the thing or feed it to the cat.
Ben jumped in with "That is a hemlock varnish shelf, Ganoderma tsugae." When David, the expert, quickly agreed, I teared up a bit and got a lump in my throat. If someone can make a true statement on Facebook that someone else agrees with, there is hope for the country.
Duane sells online a dozen or more books on brushless motors. I read that a brushless motor system can be a switched reluctance motor, and decided right there that when it comes to direct current, some things are better left to the experts.
After a lifetime of teaching old-window repair, John put together an excellent set of books on the topic. He is constantly in demand by small museums and the folks in charge of maintaining valuable historical buildings.
And then there is Charlie, who has written over a dozen books on how to fix everything in the home but a marriage gone sour. I'm impressed by the colorful and very clear diagrams in one book that explain electrical and plumbing systems, how to lay floor tile and more.
Charlie said that he was once cementing down tile just inside the door of his house when a man who didn't know him showed up for a reason I've forgotten. This man, however, had a great deal of experience in cementing down tile, and he hadn't watched Charlie too long before he had to compliment his work.
"How long you been laying tile?"
"This is the first time I've done it."
"I can't believe that. How do you do it?"
"Look here. See this book?"

Texto completo: Wellness Connection of Maine sued the state in December to overturn a requirement that all medical marijuana dispensaries be owned by Mainers.

The state’s largest cannabis company is continuing its efforts to eliminate Maine’s marijuana residency requirements for sellers, now with a federal lawsuit against the state’s medical program.
And despite agreeing not to enforce the requirement in the recreational cannabis program, the state is pushing back.
U.S. District Judge Nancy Torresen heard oral arguments on the case Friday in U.S. District Court in Portland, a case she said was unusual given the “elephant in the room,” that marijuana sales violate federal law.
Wellness Connection of Maine and its parent company, High Street Capital Partners of Delaware, sued the state in December to overturn a requirement that all medical marijuana dispensaries be owned by Mainers, making the same constitutional argument it used earlier in 2020 to open the state’s recreational market to out-of-state investors.
The state’s medical marijuana market can be lucrative, the lawsuit notes, bringing in more than $100 million in 2019. Medical marijuana became the state’s most valuable cash crop in 2020, bringing in over $260 million.
The plaintiffs say that not only does the state’s residency requirement devalue Wellness Connection by limiting its universe of potential investors, it also harms all of Maine’s dispensaries.
“The self-evident purpose of the residency requirement is to discriminate against nonresidents such as plaintiff High Street, a prospective out-of-state investor, and to exclude them from the economic opportunities available to medical marijuana dispensaries in Maine,” they argued, thereby restricting the flow of investment into the state and stifling the dispensaries’ ability to operate within the program.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs said, the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s so-called “dormant Commerce Clause,” which prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce, “by explicitly and purposefully favoring Maine residents over nonresidents.”
But state officials argue that the clause is irrelevant. The “ultimate test of whether state laws violate the dormant Commerce Clause asks whether a state has done something to restrict interstate commerce in a manner more severe than where Congress has left the market,” the Maine Attorney General’s Office wrote in court documents.
The clause does not apply to Maine’s intrastate market for medical marijuana, nor do the laws “burden interstate commerce more severely than Congress, since Congress has eliminated that market entirely,” they said.
The state also argued that it should be protected under the 11th Amendment, which prohibits citizens from suing a state or state agency in federal court unless the state has consented to being sued or Congress has repealed the state’s immunity from such.
The United Cannabis Coalition, a nonprofit trade group and an intervenor in the case, also wants to see the residency requirement stand.
Coalition members, primarily medical marijuana providers known in the market as caregivers, say they have a legal and economic interest in the statute because if the residency requirement is struck down, they risk economic harm from the “shifting market forces throughout Maine’s medical-use marijuana industry caused by spikes in out-of-state funding or competition.”
Torresen did not issue a decision on Friday and did not set a timeline to do so.
This is the third lawsuit in just over a year arguing that Maine’s marijuana laws discriminate against residents of other states.
As written, Maine law requires every officer, director and manager of an adult-use cannabis business — and most of its ownership — to live and file taxes in Maine for at least four years.
In March 2020, Wellness Connection’s sister company, NPG LLC, sued the state over the residency requirement in the adult-use marijuana statute — the first time a marijuana company had challenged such a requirement.
The requirement would have given locals a leg up when the adult-use market launched in October, but Wellness Connection argued that it was unconstitutional. The company is controlled by multinational corporation Acreage Holdings, whose investors reside outside of Maine.
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey agreed with the challenge and found that the requirement “is subject to significant constitutional challenges” and would likely not hold up in court.
Accordingly, state officials announced in May 2020 that they would abandon the in-state residency requirement, resolving the lawsuit.
State officials could not be reached for comment Friday about why they did not make the same concession for the medical program, choosing instead to continue litigation.
Using the same argument of unconstitutionality, NPG LLC sued the city of Portland over its ordinance that gave preference to Maine residents when awarding retail marijuana licenses. In response, the City Council voted to give licenses to all qualified first-round applicants, though in November, voters decided to eliminate the retail license cap altogether.
The plaintiffs in Friday’s case said the residency requirement for dispensaries is “cut from the same cloth” as the residency requirement in the adult-use marijuana law and is worse than Portland’s ordinance because it bans nonresidents altogether.
Local licensing preference has been at the heart of Maine’s marijuana laws since the medical dispensary system was created in 2011 and recreational marijuana was approved by voters in 2016. Marijuana advocates used the residents-only language to gain political support for legalization, characterizing it as a jobs generator.

Texto completo: Federal Aviation Administration officials are investigating incident, in which no injuries were reported.

AUGUSTA — A Maine Instrument Flight plane with malfunctioning landing gear landed Thursday at the Augusta State Airport, with no injuries reported to either of the plane’s two occupants.
John Guimond, airport manager, said Friday that the disabled aircraft forced the airport to close its main runway for a couple hours in order to remove the plane after its landing gear collapsed. Federal Aviation Administration officials identified the plane as a single-engine Beechcraft C24R.
Guimond described it as a minor incident and said neither the pilot nor passenger were injured. He said the plane occupants, whom he did not name, were a flight instructor for Maine Instrument Flight and a student pilot who were landing when the plane’s landing gear malfunctioned and collapsed, forcing the plane to land on its belly and come skidding to a stop.
Officials of Maine Instrument Flight, the Augusta State Airport’s fixed base operator which describes itself as Maine’s only full-service aviation company, declined to comment on the incident, the extent of damage to the plane, or reveal the identities of those aboard the plane. FAA records indicate the Maine Instrument Flight-owned plane was manufactured in 1979.
FAA officials, in an emailed statement, said the plane, which has retractable landing gear, landed with its gear up around 3:30 p.m. Thursday with two people aboard. The official said the agency would investigate the incident.
Steve Leach, deputy fire chief in Augusta, said firefighters and an ambulance responded to the airport but the ambulance wasn’t needed as there were no injuries.
Guimond said the pilot and passenger were able to get out of the plane and call for help. The smaller of the airport’s two runways remained open while its main runway was closed while the plane was removed.

Texto completo: Maine reported an additional 45 cases of COVID-19 on Friday, adding to the increase in the seven-day average of daily new cases.
The new cases bring Maine's total since the start of the pandemic to 69,418. There have been 878 deaths, including one - a man 80 or older from Kennebec County - reported Friday.
Around the country, public health officials have attributed a recent rise in cases to the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant, increases in gatherings and lagging vaccination numbers. Maine's new case numbers are still far below the daily case counts the state was seeing at peaks in January and April, but the seven-day average has increased over recent weeks.
On Friday the seven-day average of daily new cases was at 34.7, up from 20.7 one week ago and 22.1 two weeks ago. The seven-day positivity rate for PCR tests was 1.08. That's more than double the .45 percent rate nine days ago.
Androscoggin County reported the highest rate of new cases over the last two weeks with 45 total cases, or just over four new cases per 10,000 residents. Washington County, which saw just three new cases over the last two weeks, reported the lowest new case rate at 0.96 cases per 10,000 residents, according to new county-by-county CDC data.
Hospitalizations around the state have remained fairly steady in recent weeks. On Friday there were 31 people hospitalized, including 16 in critical care and six on ventilators.
Vaccinations, meanwhile, have dropped off, though Maine continues to have one of the best vaccination rates in the country. As of Thursday, 59.5 percent of Maine's 1.3 million people had received their final dose of the vaccine. That figure rises to 67.6 percent among residents 12 or older who are eligible for vaccination.
The Maine CDC has tracked 560 "breakthrough" cases of fully vaccinated people who have contracted the virus, which is 0.07 percent of the more than 800,000 vaccinated individuals in the state.
Around the U.S., daily case numbers are climbing as the delta variant, a highly transmissible form of the disease first detected in India, spreads mostly among unvaccinated people. According to the New York Times, daily case counts are up more than 100 percent over two weeks ago with Arkansas and Missouri - two states with low vaccination rates - leading the country in new case rates.
On Friday there were 35,561 new cases of COVID-19 reported nationwide, bringing the nation's seven-day daily average of new cases to 28,315. The seven-day average two weeks ago was 12,799, the Times reported.

Texto completo: The state's largest cannabis company is continuing its efforts to eliminate Maine's marijuana residency requirements for sellers, now with a federal lawsuit against the state's medical program.
And despite agreeing not to enforce the requirement in the recreational cannabis program, the state is pushing back.
U.S. District Judge Nancy Torresen heard oral arguments on the case in U.S. District Court on Friday, a case she said was unusual given the "elephant in the room," that marijuana sales violate federal law.
Wellness Connection of Maine and its parent company, High Street Capital Partners, of Delaware, sued the state in December to overturn a requirement that all medical marijuana dispensaries be owned by Mainers, making the same constitutional argument it used earlier in 2020 to open the state's recreational market to out-of-state investors.
The state's medical marijuana market can be lucrative, the lawsuit notes, bringing in more than $100 million in 2019. Medical marijuana became the state's most valuable cash crop in 2020, bringing in over $260 million.
The plaintiffs say that not only does the state's residency requirement devalue Wellness Connection by limiting its universe of potential investors, it also harms all of Maine's dispensaries.
"The self-evident purpose of the residency requirement is to discriminate against nonresidents such as plaintiff High Street, a prospective out-of-state investor, and to exclude them from the economic opportunities available to medical marijuana dispensaries in Maine," they argued, thereby restricting the flow of investment into the state and stifling the dispensaries' ability to operate within the program.
Furthermore, the plaintiffs said, the law violates the U.S. Constitution's so-called "dormant Commerce Clause," which prohibits states from passing legislation that discriminates against or excessively burdens interstate commerce, "by explicitly and purposefully favoring Maine residents over nonresidents."
But state officials argue that the clause is irrelevant. The "ultimate test of whether state laws violate the dormant Commerce Clause asks whether a state has done something to restrict interstate commerce in a manner more severe than where Congress has left the market," the Maine Attorney General's Office wrote in court documents.
The clause does not apply to Maine's intrastate market for medical marijuana, nor do the laws "burden interstate commerce more severely than Congress, since Congress has eliminated that market entirely," they said.
The state also argued that it should be protected under the 11th Amendment, which prohibits citizens from suing a state or state agency in federal court unless the state has consented to being sued or Congress has repealed the state's immunity from such.
The United Cannabis Coalition, a nonprofit trade group and an intervenor in the case, also wants to see the residency requirement stand.
Coalition members, primarily medical marijuana providers known in the market as caregivers, say they have a legal and economic interest in the statute because if the residency requirement is struck down, they risk economic harm from the "shifting market forces throughout Maine's medical-use marijuana industry caused by spikes in out-of-state funding or competition."
Torresen did not issue a decision on Friday and did not set a timeline to do so.
This is the third lawsuit in just over a year arguing that Maine's marijuana laws discriminate against residents of other states.
As written, Maine law requires every officer, director and manager of an adult-use cannabis business - and most of its ownership - to live and file taxes in Maine for at least four years.
In March 2020, Wellness Connection's sister company, NPG LLC, sued the state over the residency requirement in the adult-use marijuana statute - the first time a marijuana company had challenged such a requirement.
The requirement would have given locals a leg up when the adult-use market launched in October, but Wellness Connection argued that it was unconstitutional. The company is controlled by multinational corporation Acreage Holdings, whose investors reside outside of Maine.
Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey agreed with the challenge and found that the requirement "is subject to significant constitutional challenges" and would likely not hold up in court.
Accordingly, state officials announced in May 2020 that they would abandon the in-state residency requirement, resolving the lawsuit.
State officials could not be reached for comment Friday about why they did not make the same concession for the medical program, choosing instead to continue litigation.
Using the same argument of unconstitutionality, NPG LLC sued the city of Portland over its ordinance that gave preference to Maine residents when awarding retail marijuana licenses. In response, the City Council voted to give licenses to all qualified first-round applicants, though in November, voters decided to eliminate the retail license cap altogether.
The plaintiffs in Friday's case said the residency requirement for dispensaries is "cut from the same cloth" as the residency requirement in the adult-use marijuana law and is worse than Portland's ordinance because it bans nonresidents altogether.
Local licensing preference has been at the heart of Maine's marijuana laws since the medical dispensary system was created in 2011 and recreational marijuana was approved by voters in 2016. Marijuana advocates used the residents-only language to gain political support for legalization, characterizing it as a jobs generator.

Texto completo: The system also announced plans for unvaccinated students and staff to participate in required COVID testing and quarantine upon arriving on campuses this fall.

The University of Maine System will require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students when the federal government gives final approval to the vaccines and they are no longer in emergency use authorization.
The system has said for months it would consider a vaccine requirement pending final approval and made the announcement Friday as it also unveiled other COVID-19 protocols for the fall semester, which starts Aug. 30.
“We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy said. “It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don’t wait and have to scramble.”
The UMaine System already has announced plans for a more traditional fall semester with the bulk of classes and activities being held in person, as they were before the pandemic. But Friday’s announcement outlined that some coronavirus safety protocols and rules will remain in place for unvaccinated staff and students.
Unvaccinated staff and students who plan to attend classes and work in-person will be required to participate in COVID-19 testing upon arriving on campuses and will have to quarantine while they await test results.
The university system is following state guidance and will drop masking requirements for vaccinated people indoors July 26, though unvaccinated people still will be asked to wear face coverings in university buildings going forward.
Students and staff are being asked to verify their vaccination status through an online portal. So far over, 5,000 of the system’s 35,000 staff and students have verified they are vaccinated, the system said Friday. Those who register as vaccinated before Aug. 20 will be exempt from the testing and quarantine arrival protocols.
During the semester, unvaccinated staff and students who are in-person can expect to participate in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing as often as once per week. “It will in all likelihood be once or twice per week, depending on the circumstances and what happens with the delta variant,” Malloy said. “CDC may very well recommend more frequent testing as that variant becomes more common in Maine and elsewhere.”
The system is already conducting weekly asymptomatic testing of in-person students and staff who are unvaccinated during the summer in a carry-over from the testing regime last spring. In the last 14 days there have been 476 tests conducted and no positive results.
Hundreds of colleges and universities around the country, including several in Maine, have announced plans to require students, staff or both to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the fall. On Friday the University of Vermont was among the latest schools to announce a vaccine requirement for students.
In Maine, Malloy said the system envisions requiring the vaccine for both students and staff when full approval is granted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the system has noted that whatever policy is approved will “recognize and respect” that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated.
On Friday CNN reported that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been granted priority review for its application for a full license.
An FDA official told CNN a decision on full approval could come within two months.
In the meantime, the University of Maine System is continuing to encourage all students and employees who are able to get vaccinated to do so. On-campus vaccination clinics are being planned for the start of the fall semester, including a weekly series of clinics at the University of Maine during August and September.
The system also is launching a $1,000 Shot Clock Scholarship and will be awarding $1,000 scholarships on a weekly basis between now and Aug. 20 to students who verify their status as fully vaccinated online.

Texto completo: A judge has dismissed a federal lawsuit seeking immediate public access to civil cases in Maine's electronic court records system.
Courthouse News Service, a national outlet that reports on civil court proceedings, filed a lawsuit in February to challenge a rule that originally would have allowed civil cases in Maine's electronic court records system to be kept from public eye for weeks or even months after they are filed. The companies that own the Press Herald, Kennebec Journal, Morning Sentinel and Sun Journal also were plaintiffs in the lawsuit, as was the Bangor Daily News.
The news organizations argued that delaying access to new cases violates the First Amendment, which guarantees the media and the public the right to review and copy such records, including civil complaints.
Maine is in a years-long process of shifting court records from paper files to digital ones. In November, Bangor courts became the first to start using the electronic system for filing and viewing cases.
The Judicial Branch finalized the rules for electronic filing last summer. That document said no civil case would be accessible to the public until three business days after the clerk's office receives proof of service. Plaintiffs typically have 90 days to serve a defendant, so a case could be hidden from the public eye for that entire time.
Less than three weeks after the complaint was filed, a spokeswoman for the Maine Judicial Branch announced that new civil cases would be accessible online after they have been processed by the clerks.
The state then filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying the issue had been addressed. That motion said any delay between filing and access should be "no more than four business hours except in extraordinary circumstances," although they cannot know for sure until the system has been fully implemented.
On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Torresen granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint and denied as moot the plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction.
In her order, Torresen said that there is a First Amendment right of public access to civil complaints, but she said "the Plaintiffs' challenge concerns the timing, not the denial, of public access. This distinction makes a difference."
Torresen found that electronic court systems are generally tailored in the interest of orderly administration of justice.
"The Plaintiffs' position is that anything short of immediate, on-receipt access violates their First Amendment rights. I disagree and so do most courts," Torresen wrote.
Torresen concluded that "although there is a First Amendment qualified right of timely access to newly filed civil complaints, there is no right of instantaneous access upon the court's receipt of new civil complaints."
Amy Quinlan, spokeswoman for the Maine Judicial Branch, could not be reached after business hours on Friday to discuss the ruling.
"This ruling involves fundamental First Amendment issues. We disagree with this outcome," said attorney Jeffrey Pyle, who argued on behalf of the Press Herald, the Kennebec Journal, the Morning Sentinel and the Sun Journal.
In a release announcing the new rule in February, a spokeswoman for the Maine Judicial Branch said the court system was trying to provide "maximum reasonable public access to court records and minimizing the risk of harm to individuals and entities involved in court proceedings." The documents are now available three business days after clerks have checked that the filing had all the information required, such as the Maine Bar registration number of the lawyer filing it and the payment of various fees.
During a court hearing in June, Pyle said that the delay for processing could still prevent the public and the media from accessing a new filing until the next day or even over the weekend. He said that of the 26 new complaints filed in the Bangor court since the rule took effect, nearly one-quarter were not available until the next business day.

Windham truck dealer accused by EPA of emissions tampering The agency is seeking a $168,700 fine for APlus Truck Sales Inc., alleging over 50 instances of Clean Air Act violations.

Texto completo: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seeking a $168,700 penalty from a Windham dealership and service shop for allegedly tampering with emissions controls on diesel vehicles in violation of the federal Clean Air Act.
The government is accusing APlus Truck Sales Inc. of selling and installing aftermarket parts known as "defeat devices" more than 50 times between 2017 and 2019. The EPA announced the complaint in a news release Friday.
"This action sends a strong message that tampering with emission controls on vehicles will not be tolerated," said Deb Szaro, the agency's acting regional administrator. "Emission control systems on vehicles are designed to protect public health by reducing pollution. To ensure that we all have access to clean air, it is critical that vehicle repair facilities comply with the Clean Air Act."
Attorney Leonard Sharon, who said he is representing the business owners, said they are working to negotiate a fair settlement with the government but were blindsided by the complaint.
"First, the complained-of violations were a very small part of APlus's business," Sharon wrote in an email. "The owners of APlus have passionately made sure and continue to make sure that they are now in compliance. The offer made by the EPA would financially cripple APlus. We are exceedingly interested in reaching a fair settlement but believe the offer is disproportionate to other settlements in similar cases."
He added that the business remains open and APlus Trucks has been in compliance with all EPA regulations since the last violation in 2019.
More than half of the airborne pollutants in the United States come from motor vehicles and other mobile sources, according to the EPA. The emissions include smog-forming volatile organic compounds, toxic air pollutants that can cause cancer, asthma or heart disease and gases that contribute to climate change.
Clean Air Act provisions
The Clean Air Act requires engines to meet emissions standards, and it prohibits manufacturing, selling or installing devices that disable, bypass or reduce the effectiveness of emissions control systems.
Tampering with or overriding the systems can increase a vehicle's power or fuel economy and may reduce maintenance costs and vehicle downtime.
While not common in Maine, the EPA has taken action around the country against dealerships and service centers accused of tampering with emissions controls. More than 30 vehicle and engine enforcement cases were resolved in 2020 nationwide, according to the EPA's website.
Violators are subject to civil penalties up to $45,268 for each noncompliant vehicle or engine and $4,527 for each tampering event or sale of defeat device.
The complaint against APlus Trucks says the EPA requested and received a warrant for records at the business in 2019.
In an affidavit filed in the U.S. District Court of Maine that year, an environmental engineer for the agency said that he had reason to believe APlus Trucks was violating the Clean Air Act after he reviewed social media posts and a Maine State Police sergeant had met with the business's owners.
"Those postings indicate that APlus Trucks is an entity that sells or installs devices that illegally modify or replace motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine emission control devices, including exhaust systems that remove emission after treatment devices and electronic devices that replace computerized engine control and diagnostic systems," the affidavit says.
Court documents show two inspections took place that year after the judge granted the request for a search warrant. The complaint says the EPA then issued a notice of violation to APlus Trucks in 2020.
The company's website says APlus Trucks was established in 2011 as a small garage specializing in autobody repair.
"Since then we have grown and evolved into a shop where we offer anything you need or want done to your truck, or check out our sales department where we can help you with your next vehicle purchase with our clean late model inventory of diesel trucks," the website says.

Texto completo: Samsung weighs adding second plant in Texas
Samsung Electronics is considering a second location in Texas for its envisioned $17 billion U.S. semiconductor plant, a signature project that could address U.S. concerns about chip security while expanding its own capabilities. The Korean company is exploring another 6 million-square-foot site apart from a previously disclosed expansion of its Austin base, according to documents filed with local government.
WhatsApp blocks 2 million Indian accounts in 1 month
WhatsApp blocked 2 million accounts of Indian users in a month to prevent harmful behavior, the company said in its first ever compliance report published under the country's strict new information technology rules. Social media companies have to publish a compliance report every month detailing how many complaints they received from Indian users and what action they took. The Facebook-owned messaging app said that more than 95% of the 2 million accounts blocked were banned "due to the unauthorized use of automated or bulk messaging."
Maine shifts recycling costs to companies
Maine became the first state in the nation to require companies that create consumer packaging to pay for the costs of recycling it when Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed a bill Tuesday establishing an "extended producer responsibility" program. The legislation will charge large packaging producers for collecting and recycling cardboard boxes, plastic containers and other packaging materials, as well as for disposing of nonrecyclable packaging. The income generated will be used to support recycling efforts in local communities that have long relied on taxpayer dollars.
GM introduces new EV charging system
General Motors wants to make electric vehicle ownership easier for commercial fleet customers with a new charging system. On Thursday, GM and its startup commercial van business, BrightDrop, announced the Ultium Charge 360 fleet charging service. The system will work similar to the Ultium Charge 360 offered on GM's retail vehicles, only this new system allows fleet customers to connect with services, features and resources to make using EVs easier.

Texto completo: Maine could see more electric vehicles on its roads under a law signed by Gov. Janet Mills that seeks to expand the number of charging stations.
The new law calls for accelerating Maine's transition to electric vehicles by encouraging the installation of more electric charging stations and reducing the costs that consumers pay for charging vehicles. It requires the state Public Utilities Commission to work with utilities to develop a range of rates for electric charging.
The measure's primary sponsor, state Rep. Nicole Grohoski, D-Ellsworth, said the "takes a meaningful step to address emissions from Maine’s most significant remaining source of greenhouse gas emissions – and it does so not by a directive, but by reducing a barrier to voluntary action."
"Now that electric cars are as affordable as conventional cars over their lifespans, it is important that we have more charging infrastructure in Maine so that residents and visitors can travel around freely," Grohoski posted on social media.
Maine's climate change plans call for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030. Tailpipe pollution accounts for more than half of the state's emissions.
Currently, electric vehicles account for only about 1% of the registered cars and trucks on the roads, according to the Maine Registry of Motor Vehicles.
Mills recently signed an executive order calling for a "clean transportation roadmap" to achieve the state’s climate plan goal to put another 200,000 EVs on the road within the next decade.
The order requires the state to come up with a series of recommendations by the end of the year to boost the EV market. The plans will include expanding charging infrastructure, evaluating the impact on electric utilities and the grid, and ensuring an equitable and affordable transition to clean transportation
On a federal level, the Biden administration is also hoping to encourage more people to trade in their fossil-fuel burning cars, trucks and SUVs for electric vehicles.
President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure and jobs plan, which is pending before Congress, includes more than $15 billion for electric vehicle infrastructure.
The funding would be used to expand electric charging stations, upgrades to factories to build EVs, as well as grants and tax incentives to encourage buyers.
Biden has also pledged to replace the federal government’s 650,000 vehicle motor fleet with EVs. Currently, federal agencies only have about 3,000 EVs in their motor pools.
Nationwide, cars and light trucks account for about 60% of vehicle emissions that scientists say are contributing to climate change, according to the White House.

Maine is right to stop celebrating Christopher Columbus

Rev. J. Mark Worth was a history teacher before becoming a pastor. He is Minister Emeritus of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Ellsworth.
Christopher Columbus didn't know where he was going when he left Spain in 1492. He thought he was going to the East Indies, which is modern Indonesia, or to other islands in that part of the world. Because he was lost, he incorrectly called the people he encountered "Indians."
Columbus didn't know where he was when he found land. He didn't know where he had been when he got back to Spain. Although he made three more trips to the Caribbean islands, he died without ever knowing where he had been. On one of his journeys he landed on Cuba, and confidently declared that he had found Japan.
When I was a child, I was taught that Columbus, although he never saw North America, discovered the lands of the Western Hemisphere. Of course, the people who were already living here had discovered the Americas thousands of years before Columbus. Columbus's "discovery" was important, however, because many more Europeans followed him in the years and centuries to come.
On his first voyage in 1492, Columbus and his men sailed on three small boats, the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria. Recently a replica of the type of ship Columbus sailed, the Nao Santa Maria, visited Bucksport and was scheduled to visit Bangor as well, as part of the Maine Bicentennial celebration.
The ship never went to Bangor, and its visit in Bucksport was met with protests. Why? The answer lies in our growing understanding of Columbus and the impact of his four visits to this hemisphere.
Columbus was the first to establish a European colony in the Americas. In his search for gold, he and his men enslaved, raped, tortured, and killed the Arawak people of the islands. It was an uneven contest: the Arawaks had spears made of cane. The Spaniards had armor, swords, horses, and muskets. When the Arawaks were unable to defend themselves, they ran off to hide in the hills, where the Spaniards hunted them and killed them.
The King of Spain appointed Columbus governor of the "Indies," but later removed him because, even by Spanish standards, Columbus had been excessively cruel. In his popular biography "Christopher Columbus, Mariner," historian Samuel Eliot Morrison said, "The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide."
More and more Europeans followed after Columbus. The Europeans brought diseases with them, mostly by accident. These diseases -- measles, smallpox, cholera and others -- were previously unknown in the Americas. The Indigenous peoples had no natural immunity, and were wiped out in great numbers.
What Columbus did to the Arawaks on the Caribbean Islands, Hernan Cortes did to the Aztecs of Mexico. Francisco Pizarro did the same to the Incas in Peru. The English did it to the Native Americans of Virginia, and then the rest of North America. Indigenous nations, cultures and languages were destroyed, and their homelands were confiscated.
Maine no longer celebrates Columbus Day. In its place we have Indigenous Peoples' Day. I welcome the change.
We should not be celebrating the arrival of Columbus because, although he was a courageous and skillful mariner, his arrival in this hemisphere was a disaster for the people living here. His ship, the Santa Maria, was not to blame. It was merely a tool. But frankly, Columbus and his men were essentially criminals.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- Classes are now underway for students in the Mechanized Logging Operations Program, which began its fifth year of classes June 28 in the woods northeast of Old Town.
         Students enrolled in the program at Northern Maine Community College in Presque Isle will spend weeks harvesting timber using modern machines like those they will encounter in the logging industry. The hands-on experience students gain operating equipment is something unavailable anywhere else in Maine and neighboring states.
         "There is no better, more affordable, more efficient way to gain the experience and knowledge you need to begin a successful career as an equipment operator in the logging industry than this program," Dana Doran, executive director of the Professional Logging Contractors of Maine, said. "The Mechanized Logging Operations Program achieves results and as demand for operators continues to grow it is vital to meeting that need."
         "This project is a great example of how collaboration and cooperation between business, industry and higher education can address workforce concerns," stated Timothy Crowley, NMCC president.
         Launched in 2017, the program was jointly developed by the PLC and NMCC, Eastern Maine Community College (EMCC), and Washington County Community College (WCCC) with industry support. Students gain knowledge of the most common timber harvesting systems, and an understanding of the variables of timber growth, tree species and markets. The course also includes a strong emphasis on safety.
Graduation will be in September.
         Supported by the Maine Community College System's Maine Quality Centers, students pay no tuition or fees and the program provides all required personal protective equipment. Maine Quality Centers develops and supports skilled in-demand and high wage occupations in Maine through a variety of training opportunities.
 "These students will soon join the graduates from the program of past years who are now some of the best equipment operators in the state. The quality of the graduates and the valuable skills they have after only 12 weeks with us is recognized by logging contractors who have supported the development of this program from the beginning," Leah Buck, NMCC assistant dean of continuing education and program administrator, said.
"We are helping this latest group realize their dreams of becoming Maine loggers; they are learning how to do work safely and will soon join other graduates as a new generation of loggers," Buck said.
Demand for skilled operators of the feller bunchers, harvesters, grapple skidders, forwarders, delimbers, and other mechanized logging equipment that now harvests more than 95 percent of all timber in Maine is strong. Many current operators are reaching retirement age and the steep costs of training new operators is driving up demand and wages.
Mechanized logging operators are among the highest paid members of the logging workforce.
         The mechanized logging class has drawn students from within the logging industry as well as from Maine's high school vocational logging programs.
"NMCC is pleased to provide the training opportunities for these twelve individuals to lead a more productive life, while taking steps toward supporting Maine's logging industry," Crowley said.
Maine's forest products sector is worth an estimated $7.7 billion annually. The logging industry contributed an estimated $619 million to the Maine economy in 2017, supported more than 9,000 jobs directly or indirectly, generated $342 million in labor income, and paid an estimated $25 million in state and local tax.

Texto completo: FORT KENT, Maine -- Two time-honored northern Maine traditions, catching giant fish and cooking up giant ployes, will be reunited when the Greater Fort Kent Area Chamber of Commerce Ploye Festival returns in conjunction with the Fort Kent International Muskie Derby in August.
Organizers canceled the Ploye Festival last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although the Muskie Derby was held.
"Step by step, we are coming back to some semblance of normal again which is really encouraging," Chamber executive director Dona Saucier said. "This is the first large St. John Valley Community event we will be hosting since the COVID restrictions started lifting, so we are looking forward to communities and families and friends gathering and bringing more positive energy and increased momentum back into this area."
The most popular Ploye Festival event, the cooking of the giant ploye by Bouchard Family Farm, is a go, although it will take place at Lonesome Pine Trails this year rather than at Riverside Park.
Also planned for the Ploye Festival are a ploye eating contest, craft fair and live street music.
"There's a couple little things up in the air still, but in the next week we should have a solidified schedule," Saucier said.
"It's just a wonderful time of regrouping and getting together as a community," Saucier added. "We've all been so detached in our own little bubbles for the past year or so. Having this opportunity to reconnect with one another is just what we need."
With just the St. John River and an International Bridge separating the communities of Fort Kent and Clair, New Brunswick, the Ploye Festival and Muskie Derby is often a draw for Canadian residents.
"We hope that we can also be able to share this camaraderie with our friends across the border as well -- fingers crossed," Saucier said.
Border crossing regulations between the United States and Canada remain uncertain.
The United States and Canada restricted non-essential travel across the U.S.-Canada land borders at the height of the pandemic in March 2020.
On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that vaccinated U.S. Citizens will be allowed into Canada for non-essential travel around mid-August if current vaccination and public health rates continue.
The Muskie Derby will begin at 9 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 13, and the scales will be open until Sunday, Aug. 15, at 5 p.m., with an awards ceremony to follow at UP North Outdoors on Main Street in Fort Kent.
The St. John River and all tributaries of the river are open to fishing during the derby.
Sean Cabaniss of Pittsfield reeled in the  2020 tournament's winning muskie, a 46-inch fish weighing 22.31 pounds.
"It's so nice to see we are resuming our events and activities in our community," Fort Kent town manager Suzie Paradis said. "The Muskie Derby attracts people from thousands of miles away to compete and enjoy all that Fort Kent has to offer."
Register for the Muskie Derby online or in person at S.W. Collins Outdoors/Building Supply.

Texto completo: HOULTON, Maine -- Aroostook County is undergoing a small uptick in COVID-19 cases, with seven new cases reported by the Maine Center for Disease Control, bringing the total number of active cases in The County to 18.
Shawn Anderson, the CEO of Houlton Regional Hospital, said that there had been an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases over the past 10 days, although case increases remained in the single digits. Two of the most recent patients had to be hospitalized due to worsening conditions, but were eventually discharged.
"By and large, the numbers still remain small, but the seriousness of the illnesses are certainly of concern," Anderson said. "Along with that, there have been a small number of positive cases that have resulted in at-home recuperation."
The rise is in keeping with nationwide trends, with around 35,000 cases reported in the United States on Friday, about 10 times the number that had been reported on July 4. Concerns have been raised about the spread of the new delta variant of COVID-19, though vaccines have been shown to be effective against the new variant, according to Anderson.
"There's data to show that all three vaccines are effective against the delta variant," said Anderson. "The best way to avoid it is to be vaccinated." He also said it was unknown whether the newer cases consisted of the new variant, as testing for it is done at the CDC level.
Houlton Regional Hospital is allowing anyone who enters the hospital to get a vaccine dose. Anderson estimated that the hospital regularly administers between 20 and 30 doses of vaccines a week.
Currently about 60 percent of residents in the Houlton area had received at least one dose of the Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson vaccine, although more than 2,000 residents were not vaccinated, according to the Maine CDC. Aroostook County as a total had 52 percent of its population fully vaccinated, ranking it in the middle among Maine counties for total vaccination rates.

Texto completo: To the editor: 
I am excited to see Congress seeking to invest in Maine's future through a bold investment package supporting the upgrade and growth of our state's infrastructure.
Improvements within the infrastructure of the education system are required to keep current with the 21st-century demands of educational and business collaborations. In order for career and technical education centers to be able to provide students with equitably sized educational spaces that can accommodate effective and sustainable learning in today's business world, crucial infrastructure commitments need to be made by Congress. Technical education is critical to the continued growth of both heritage industries and the expanding clean energy sector. Without investment, career and technical education centers such as the one I direct, will not be able to sustain the required industry growth  and provide the quality educational experiences required by our students and business stakeholders.
I urge Maine's Congressional delegation to commit and support a fully funded infrastructure package as it would provide much needed resources required by small career and technical education centers throughout Maine.

An unmet national responsibility
Thank you, BDN, for last weekend's editorial, "U.S. shares in horrors of indigenous schools."
The Trail of Tears on this side of the border did not end with the forced relocation of our indigenous people to reservations far from their ancestral homes. For thousands of children, it led to U.S. government boarding schools where they often were physically abused in a futile effort to "Americanize" them by stripping them of their culture and language.
Capt. Richard Pratt., who founded the first U.S. residential school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, in 1879, described his personal view of the intent of U.S. policy in a paper he read at an 1892 convention. It begins:
"A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one, and that high sanction of his destruction has been an enormous factor in promoting Indian massacres. In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man."
For an unknown number of children, who succumbed to mistreatment, disease or in a desperate attempt to escape, their trail ended in a grave, a resting place for "tiny bones," as they are called by First Nation people in Canada.
The graves of hundreds of children have been located in that country, and the Canadian government has apologized publicly for the inhumane policy that led to their deaths. In the U.S. there has been no similar public apology. Legislative language was quietly stuffed in a defense bill more than 10 years ago, passed by Congress, and then signed by President Barack Obama.
Meanwhile, the "tiny bones" remain buried here, along with our humanity and an unmet national responsibility to acknowledge this indefensible act against America's indigenous people.

We can't pretend it didn't happen
I am sad and disgusted that Maine has chosen to cancel some of the  tall ships events.
This is part of our history and heritage. There is not a single scrap of land on this planet that hasn't been taken, conquered, fought for, won and lost. There is not a single race or group of people that haven't taken part in this. It's the history of humanity. We can not ignore it and pretend it didn't happen. Also there is not one person alive today that took part.
Stop trying to rewrite history. Accept it for what it is, and learn from it.

Correcting historic wrong on gaming
I believe Gov. Janet Mills correctly vetoed the gaming bill because it would probably lose in the courts, saving the state time and money.
However, Native Americans have experienced systemic racism from the start. In my opinion, the state of Maine has practiced this by voters only giving white, out-of-state corporations approval to run casinos. It is time for the Maine Legislature to correct this abuse.

Maine adds 3,000 jobs in June, but jobless rate holds steady at 4.8%

Texto completo: Nonfarm payroll jobs in Maine increased by 3,000 to 614,900 in June, according to a report issued Friday by the Maine Department of Labor. Despite this increase, the state’s unemployment rate held steady at 4.8 percent for the fifth consecutive month.
Most of the jobs added in June were in public and private education. According to Glenn Mills, labor economist at the Maine Center for Workforce Research and Information, there is always a decline in education jobs in June, but because the data is seasonally adjusted, a smaller decline than usual is reflected as an increase in the June report.
The number of payroll jobs was up 47,000 from June of last year – mostly in leisure and hospitality, retail trade, professional and business services and manufacturing sectors – but there remained 25,100 fewer jobs in the state than in February 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the market.
“June was a continuation of the gradual trend we’ve seen of improvement in the labor market after the significant hit that was taken in the spring of 2020,” Mills said. “In March and April last year, with the closure of the economy, we lost 95,000 jobs. We gained quite a few back very quickly in May and August last year and since then it’s been more of a modest gradual trend. There was a flat period in the fall into the winter when the COVID spike happened, and now that that’s over and vaccination rates are up, we’re continuing to gain jobs and get closer to being back to the normal state of things.”
The unemployment rate of 4.8 percent is kept artificially low by continued low labor force participation rates compared to pre-pandemic numbers, Mills said. The rate remained unchanged from the previous month at 60.2 percent, 2.4 points lower than in February 2020.
If the June labor force participation rate were the same as this pre-pandemic level, the unemployment rate would be 8.4 percent, the report states.
Mills explained that this low labor force participation rate likely is related to people choosing to retire earlier than initially planned, as well as the continued disruption of K-12 education. Because many students only attended school two or three days a week throughout the past year, parents may have stayed out of the labor force to address childcare needs.
“Assuming that the pandemic continues to get further and further into our rearview mirrors going forward, hopefully in September school will be normal and parents who have been held out of the labor force will be able to be back fully,” Mills said.
Overall, the report reflects a hopeful path to a full recovery for the state’s labor market, he said.
“We’re doing about the same and perhaps a little better than the nation in terms of our recovery,” Mills said. “We have 3.9 percent fewer jobs than we had before the pandemic, and the nation has 4.4 percent fewer. So we’re not that far off from being all the way back.”
The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.9 percent in June, up slightly from 5.8 percent in May.

WISCASSET — Response to the Maine Art Gallery’s call for artists to participate in this year’s plein air “Paint the Town” event has been overwhelming, the gallery reports.
It has had to turn away last-minute applicants for lack of exhibit space in the historic Academy building on Warren Street. Normally, fewer than 12 participants joined in the event, but this year the cut-off was made at 22.
Artists are to begin creating paintings throughout the village on Wednesday, July 21, and the “wet paint” works will be exhibited for sale at the gallery on Saturday, July 24, at 15 Warren St.
The artists have been invited to provide a limited number of completed paintings to be on exhibit and for sale at the gallery during normal hours beginning Wednesday.
Gallery hours are from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, and from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday, July 24, when a reception for artists and the public will be held beginning at 4 p.m.
The public is invited to observe the artists as they interpret the local landscape.
The Maine Art Gallery is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement and preservation of painting, sculpture and graphic arts through exhibitions, lectures, demonstrations, and educational programs for children and adults.
More information can be found at maineartgallerywiscasset.org and on Facebook at Maine Art Gallery Wiscasset.

How would you feel if the mask mandate was reinstated?
The nation’s largest nurses’ union recently called the federal government to reinstate the mask mandate. The ask comes as COVID-19 cases are on the rise nationally (with Maine’s declining case rate as an exception) and the delta variant posing new risk for vulnerable populations. What’s your take on a potential reinstatement of the mask mandate? Let us know in the comments below.

FARMINGTON — United Way of the Tri-Valley Area is excited to offer our fifth annual Color Me United 5K Run/Walk this year. The event is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 28, with a huge color explosion at the Narrow Gauge Movie Theater parking lot, right off Front Street. The race will end there as well. This year will be even more colorful and fun, come dressed as cool or funky as you can, with your team or as an individual.
Interested walkers, runners, teams, or individuals, etc. can register online at uwtva.org for $30, teams of five or more for $25 per person. The first 25 people to register will receive a mystery gift. Runners will head out right at 9 a.m. Walkers to follow around 9:05 a.m. Route is well-marked, will have crossing volunteers, and will travel Front Street, Main Street, Prescott Street, Maple Avenue, High Street and Anson Street.
The registration fee includes a white T-shirt, sunglasses, bandana, water from Poland Spring, color pack, and other goodies so participants are fully prepared for the color run experience. Proceeds from this race will be invested back into the community through efforts like the Hope Fund, Packs for Progress, community partners/programs like Meals on Wheels, food and fuel assistance and so much more. There will be prizes for largest team (LEAP and Team Strong hold the honor for the past year or two), and for the top three finishers in each age category. A photo backdrop will be provided to take before/after pictures if you like.
Volunteers also are needed to assist on the day of the race. Volunteer activities include spraying water, throwing color/paint, crossing guards/assistants, route guides, set up/clean up, and handing out drinking water.

Texto completo: PORTLAND — Two Lewiston men who came to that city as Somali refugees were sentenced in federal court Friday for their respective roles as interpreters in a health care fraud scheme that bilked MaineCare out of more than $1.8 million through a Lewiston office providing mental health and substance abuse counseling services.
At a daylong hearing in U.S. District Court, Chief Judge Jon D. Levy sentenced Abdirashid Ahmed, 41, to two years in prison, plus three years of supervised release.
Defense attorney Daniel Dube said after the hearing his client planned to appeal his sentence.
Co-conspirator Garat Osman, 35, was sentenced to three years of probation.
Ahmed, who was considered by Levy to be one of the leaders of the conspiracy, was ordered to pay $1,863,264.83 in restitution to Maine’s Medicaid program in whole or in part with other co-defendants. Levy said Ahmed received the largest share of the ill-gotten proceeds.
Osman was ordered to repay MaineCare $544,097.78 in restitution in whole or part.
Both men pleaded guilty in May 2019 to a single count of multiple charges in a grand jury superseding indictment: Ahmed to health care fraud; Osman, to conspiracy to commit health care fraud.
The remaining charges were dismissed Friday by prosecutors.
In deciding on the two sentences, Levy considered the fact that both men were born in Somalia and suffered severe trauma before reaching this country.
Ahmed witnessed the fatal shooting of his father, brother and sister before he was shot six times, he said.
“They left me for dead,” he told Levy on Friday in a courtroom, which was packed with more than 50 men, women and children from the Lewiston Somali community.
The gunshots broke his shoulder and three of the bullets remained in his back for two years until they were removed, he said.
He apologized for his wrongdoing, expressing regret for his conduct.
Ahmed urged Levy to allow him to stay home with his wife and seven children, including a 15-year-old boy who has the most severe form of autism, as well as digestive issues that require round-the-clock supervision that only Ahmed and others said he could provide.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Perry told the judge that Ahmed’s son would qualify for therapeutic residential placement by MaineCare and that agency also could provide transportation to doctors’ appointments to which Ahmed has been shuttling his son.
Defense attorney Peter Rodway argued that the much of the money Ahmed earned was legitimate for professional services provided to authentic clients of Facing Change, the Lewiston office that offered mental health counseling.
But Levy rejected that argument.
Ahmed’s wife, Fartun, said tearfully that her husband was the only person who could calm her son when he is agitated and who is larger and stronger than she is.
Although federal sentencing guidelines set Ahmed sentence closer to four years, Levy considered many factors favorable to Ahmed, including his many children who rely on him as a household provider, his traumatic time in Somalia and his history of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders for which he takes eight medications daily.
Osman’s attorney, Julia Pitney, told Levy her client faces a high probability of deportation after his sentencing.
Unlike Ahmed, who is a U.S. citizen, Osman is not.
He has a wife and two young children who is likely to never see again if he is forced to leave the country, Pitney said.
She told Levy Osman was orphaned in Somalia by age 5. He was found in a ditch crowded with dead bodies and adopted by a family that took him to several Kenyan refugee camps, where he spent his teens years.
Unlike the other four codefendants in the case, who worked as counselors, Ahmed and Osman were arrested and jailed; they were later bailed and fitted with electronic monitors.
Shortly before imposing sentence on each of the two men, Levy told them they performed a disservice to the members of the Somali community by their actions and treated them as “pawns” in their scheme.
Levy said many of them likely had suffered similar trauma in Somalia, but never received the treatment they should have gotten because of the conspiracy that was perpetrated on them.
In deciding the two men’s sentences, Levy said he considered their more than three years on pretrial confinement by electronic monitoring.
Levy said he also took into account the fact that Osman will awake each morning wondering whether he’ll be sent back to Somalia where his attorney said he has no known biological family.
Co-defendant Nancy Ludwig, who owned Facing Change, was convicted at trial and was sentenced to 42 months in prison.
She was released early due to health reasons, but remains in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.
Prosecutors said that from about November 2015 until May 2018, Ludwig and Ahmed led a conspiracy to commit health care fraud by submitting claims to MaineCare for services that were not rendered as billed.
Beginning in February 2015, Ludwig agreed to pay Ahmed kickbacks in return for Ahmed bringing MaineCare beneficiaries to Facing Change. Ludwig, Ahmed and other employees at Facing Change then caused false and fraudulent claims to be submitted to MaineCare for both counseling and interpreter services. The false claims included claims for visits that never occurred and claims that inflated the level of service provided, according to prosecutors.
In 2016, in response to a MaineCare regulatory change, Ludwig and Ahmed conspired to change the diagnosis of many of Ahmed’s clients to schizophrenia so they could remain eligible to receive MaineCare reimbursement for the services at Facing Change, according to prosecutors.
In the fall of 2016, auditors with the MaineCare Program Integrity Unit audited Facing Change. Ludwig and many of her employees conspired to manufacture false and fraudulent records in an attempt to deceive the auditor, according to prosecutors.
Osman joined the scheme in December 2016 and established an interpreter company that received all the fraudulent payments from that time until early May 2019.
That’s when agents with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, the FBI and the Maine Attorney General’s Office executed search warrants at Facing Change and Ahmed’s business.
Investigators eventually determined that MaineCare was defrauded a total of $1,863,264.83 in this fraud scheme.

Texto completo: UMaine
REGION — The University of Maine recognized 3,670 students for achieving Dean’s List honors in the spring 2021 semester. Of the students who made the Dean’s List, 2,392 are from Maine, 1,195 are from 39 other states and 83 are from 35 countries other than the U.S.
Due to the unusual and challenging circumstances faced this semester amid the global pandemic, the university has modified its Dean’s List policy for the spring 2021 term. The requirement that students earn 12 calculable credits to be eligible for Dean’s List has been waived. Instead, students will be eligible if they earned a minimum of nine letter-graded (A–F on the transcript) credits for full-time students in addition to the criteria in the catalog. For part-time students to be eligible, they must have earned at least six letter-graded credits across the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, in addition to the criteria in the catalog for Part-time Dean’s List. Courses with P/F grades selected by the student will not count toward the total of nine (for full-time) or six (for part-time).

Two of the more successful football coaches in the state will match wits — and game plans — to help kick off Saturday’s Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl 7-on-7 tournament at Lewiston High School.
Leavitt coach Mike Hathaway and Marshwood coach Alex Rotsko will lead their respective rosters against each other in one of the first four games of the tournament’s pool play, which are scheduled to start at 2 p.m. Hathaway’s Team Green and Rotsko’s Team Purple are both in Pool A, along with Oxford Hills coach Mark Soehren’s Team Gold and Mountain Valley coach Devin Roberts’ Team Grey. Those two teams will face off in the other Pool A opening matchup.
Pool B will initially pit Lisbon coach Chris Kates’ Team Red against Gardiner coach Pat Munzing’s Team Orange, and new Oak Hill coach Chad Stowell’s Team Blue against Leavitt assistant Bill County’s Team Yellow. Stowell assisted County on the West squad in the 2019 Lobster Bowl, as did both Kates and Munzing.
The second wave of pool-play games features Gold vs. Purple, Green vs. Grey, Red vs. Yellow and Blue vs. Orange. The final set of pool-play matchups will see Hathaway and Soehren face off, with their respective sons, Wyatt and Atticus, at quarterback. Also, Purple will play Grey, Orange matches up with Yellow and Blue takes on Red.
After pool play is completed, the eight teams will be re-seeded for playoff rounds, which will culminate with a championship matchup in the evening.
The formula for re-seeding, according to Lobster Bowl president Joe Hersom, is “pool play record (and) total points for the tie-breaker. Flip a coin after that.”
The playoff rounds are the only chance for Hathaway and his Leavitt assistant County to match up, and if that comes to fruition, Hathaway earlier this month said of the possibility, “It will be fun to coach against each other.” The two have worked together in previous Lobster Bowls, Hathaway noted.
Soehren said County’s roster, which Soehren’s Team Gold wouldn’t see until a possible playoff matchup, has “some very good players” that he remembers from previous fall seasons.
“Should be a fun day,” Hathaway said. “Definitely some talent on the field.”

Turner teens capture local impact of COVID-19 in new student-made documentary

TURNER — Students taking a summer course in filmmaking found that a “dark and difficult time” can bring out the positives in a community.
The project offered by Leavitt Area High School involved interviewing and videotaping businesspeople, farmers and health care professionals about how the COVID-19 pandemic affected them. The finished documentary will be available to view on The Buzz, the school’s online newspaper.
The students will earn one-quarter of a credit for participating in the weeklong course, which was funded by the Leavitt Summer Institute.
Sophomore Lindsay Bates of Turner called it a “passion project.”
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25430880 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/07/25353126_SJ.CITleavittFilm2P.071521-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />
She was among a group of students who interviewed the owner of Martin Stream Campground on Tuesday.
He told the students that the business on Route 117 in Turner has been booked solid since last summer, 24 weeks of camping season.
“People are focusing on outdoor recreation,” junior Iris Petrin of Leeds said. “So far, we’re hearing a lot of positives about how COVID helped outdoor businesses.”
Students also visited grocery stores and farms and interviewed Dr. Nirav Shah, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and a local emergency room doctor.
Shah talked about how the virus might affect people going forward, teacher Jamie Juntura said.
“Shah said the delta variant will probably have some impact (in Maine), but he was very optimistic about the vaccination rate here,” Juntura said. “He was very optimistic about everything.”
Another group of students Tuesday went to Food City in Turner, an employee-owned business.
The store had a “banner year,” junior Elliott Shields of Turner said. Employees struggled to keep shelves filled and to enforce certain rules, such as the amount of toilet paper one person could buy, he said.
Senior Molly Sirois of Greene said employees were willing to step up and meet the demands of customers. “Some were working 50 hours a week,” she said.
Abby Lavoie graduated from Leavitt this year, but she wanted to take the course (without credit) because she’ll be majoring in media studies when she begins college in the fall.
She said she was impressed by how store employees were overworked but loyal. “Their dedication made it work,” she said.
<img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-25430895 size-medium" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/07/25353126_SJ.CITleavittFilm3P.071521-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />
The students — from Turner, Leeds and Greene, the three towns comprising School Administrative District 52 — said the course wasn’t like school at all. It was real-world, “super cool” to get out in the community and talk to people, to learn about videography and how to set up shoots, interview people and hear their stories.
Lindsay Bates of the outdoor recreation team said she took the course “for something to do” during the summer.
But by the second day, she had a new take: “It’s nice to showcase stuff in our community, local places to go. It’s a good way to give something back.”
She said it was good to see the positive in light of the pandemic, which she described as a “dark and difficult time.”
“I have a new appreciation for learning in school,” she said.
Sophomore Abby Marston of Greene said she took the course because she has always liked watching documentaries and wanted to see what it was like to make one.
“It’s been a lot of fun seeing new places,” she said.
Students who visited Farmers’ Gate Market on Leeds Junction Road in Wales on Tuesday were not available for interviews at the school.
Bri DeGone, the teacher who accompanied them, said farmers in the SAD 52 towns sell meat at the market, which offers locally raised grass-fed beef, pastured pork and lamb, and free-range poultry.
“It was really nice talking about how the community came together” to support local farmers during the pandemic, DeGone said. “They had a lot more business because people were avoiding supermarkets.”
The market had to adapt by offering curbside pickup and finding ways to market the odds and ends of the meat they butchered on site, she said.
“They had to roll with the punches, just like we did,” DeGone said. There was no stopping to adjust to the sudden upending of daily life.
“It’s cool now to take a minute and reflect on it,” she said.

Resumen: The expanded child tax credit passed by Democrats speaks to conservative values too: supporting families and countering a declining birthrate.

Texto completo: Rebecca Woitkowski, a mother of two in Bedford, New Hampshire, says she imagined having four children until she realized how much child care costs. Her kids, ages 7 and 3, were spaced apart for this reason. “Paying for infant and toddler care for two children was out of reach for us.” 
For Ms. Woitkowski, a nonprofit policy advocate, the extra money she’s getting from the child tax credit passed by Congress in March will help pay for summer camps.
That’s likely true for others as well. More than 35 million families with children began receiving their first monthly child credit payments this week. Democrats have hailed the program, part of a pandemic relief bill, as a landmark $100 billion effort to reduce child poverty. 
As it stands, the credit, worth up to $300 a month per child for all but the highest earners, expires next year. President Joe Biden has vowed to extend it, and Senate Democrats included it in their $3.5 trillion budget proposal. As with other social spending plans, Democrats aren’t counting on votes from across the aisle, given the antipathy among Republicans toward welfare programs. 
But the child tax credit has a conservative lineage. Its original form – capped initially at $1,000 and later raised to $2,000 – was introduced by a Republican-run Congress in 1995 and passed in 1997 with the support of social and religious conservatives.
Now, some “pro-natal” conservatives have an additional reason to support child credits: cash transfers can help to promote family formation and child rearing at a time of falling birthrates. Other wealthy countries have tried this approach, with varying degrees of success, to reverse their own baby busts. 
These concerns, which predate the pandemic’s impact on birthrates, aren’t yet driving the mainstream conservative agenda. Some Republicans recoil at the idea that a government should play any role in personal decisions about childbearing. But families’ needs are coming into sharper focus as the debate over tax credits and child poverty raises questions about what it means to invest in parents and children as part of an effective pro-natal policy. 
“Parents bear costs that nonparents don’t and they’re advancing the next generation. That’s the way to think about it,” says Patrick Brown, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative advocacy group. “The question is whether there’s a political constituency for this.” 
Baby bust sharpens focus on families Democrats hope to extend the current child credit through the budget process, but Republicans have also promoted more financial aid for families. In February, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah proposed a near-universal monthly child credit. His bill won support from many conservative groups, including religious organizations and taxpayer groups, which applauded his plan for being deficit neutral. By not imposing work requirements or other conditions on eligible parents, the proposal broke with Reagan-era orthodoxy on welfare. 
The fact that a Republican lawmaker was going toe-to-toe with Democrats in crafting social policy that would help hard-up parents is significant, says Samuel Hammond, director of poverty and welfare policy at the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank. “There’s a shift towards an openness to social spending on families, and that’s been driven in part by a realignment around working-class constituencies” who vote Republican, he says. 
Mr. Hammond, who helped draft Senator Romney’s plan, says there is another factor: the baby bust. “There is on the right a growing recognition that declining fertility is a problem.” 
Last year, the birthrate fell to a 41-year low in the U.S., one of several countries that recorded fewer births. The U.S. rate began falling after 2008 when economic uncertainty and job losses led couples to delay childbearing. But while the economy recovered, the birthrate didn’t. 
Senator Romney has framed his plan, which would initiate cash transfers to parents four months before a child’s due date, as a pro-natal policy. He has said it could convince some women not to have an abortion and nudge other couples to have children despite the cost of doing so. 
In an interview with the Deseret News, he expressed concern over the declining U.S. birthrate, noting that had it stayed the same since 2008, there would be nearly 6 million more children alive today. “For a civilization to survive and thrive, it must maintain its population,” he said.  
This rhetoric plays well with conservatives who see the family as the bedrock of society and fret over its fracturing. W. Bradford Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, says he would like to see Congress enact a child allowance. 
“I think making the child tax credit permanent would give Americans greater confidence when it comes to having and raising kids,” he says via email. 
What’s the impact of pro-natal policies? Studies show that pro-natal policies can reverse declining birthrates, particularly when cash is coupled with other benefits, such as child care subsidies and paid parental leave, though such packages can be costly for taxpayers and may yield only a short-term boost. 
In 1988, Quebec began awarding first-time baby bonuses that scaled up significantly for additional children. Multichild families were also eligible for generous maternity leave and subsidized home loans. Quebec’s fertility rate initially rose, then tapered off in the 1990s, though it remains above Canada’s national average. 
In recent years, Poland’s conservative government has taken a similar approach in response to falling birthrates and mass emigration. Its monthly cash transfers, which are more generous for multichild families, are credited with a bump in the birthrate and have been copied by other governments in Eastern Europe trying to reverse falling fertility rates.  
By itself, making a $300 a month child credit permanent may not move the needle in the U.S., says Mr. Brown, a former staffer on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. “The money that we’re talking about is helpful on the margins, but it’s not going to have a big bang for your buck,” he says. 
Some Americans question the need to move that needle, arguing that a baby bust is good for the planet and its finite resources and that slower U.S. population growth – the last decade (2010-19) was the slowest since the Great Depression – is an opportunity not a crisis. 
Supporters of pro-natal policy point to surveys of parents and would-be parents who say they want to have more kids than the current average of 1.6 per woman. In a 2018 Gallup survey, 4 in 10 adults said the ideal number of children in a family was three or more, suggesting a gap between aspiration and reality. 
“It’s harder than ever to support a family, and that’s why people report they’re not able to have the kids they say they want to have,” says Oren Cass, executive director of American Compass, a conservative think tank. 
President Biden also wants Congress to legislate other forms of support for families, including pre-kindergarten for all 3- and 4-year-olds and paid parental leave. But while social conservatives agree that families with children need more support, they look askance at Democrat plans to build out a federally funded child care system. Critics say this could penalize stay-at-home parents and those who arrange care for kids in their community.
The effects of a declining birthrate  Until 2008, the U.S. fertility rate trended higher than in other rich countries, in part because of immigrants who skewed younger. But demographers warn that without immigration, the U.S. population of 330 million would flatline in the coming decades and start to resemble rapidly graying societies like Italy and Japan with low ratios of workers to retirees and sluggish economic growth. 
Mr. Hammond, of the Niskanen Center, says the U.S. fertility rate today is roughly where Japan’s was 30 years ago. “It may not seem like a problem now,” he concedes.
While Mr. Cass shares the worries over declining U.S. birthrates, he says Congress should first relieve the financial stress on existing families. 
Pushing a pro-natal agenda to support a permanent child allowance could backfire, he warns. “It’s a mistake to frame the policy in those terms, that the primary motivation is that people aren’t having enough kids and if we pay them they will have more kids,” he says. 
But changing demographics are already reshaping states like New Hampshire, which has the second oldest population after Maine. Last year, New Hampshire recorded more deaths than birth, as did half the states in the union. Fewer annual births mean smaller school-age cohorts: In the last 20 years, 1 in 7 public schools have closed in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. 
At a Democratic campaign event Thursday in a park in Manchester, New Hampshire, Ms. Woitkowski, the policy advocate from Bedford, spoke in support of extending the child credit, noting that working parents in New Hampshire struggle to find affordable child care and that many are also still paying off student debt. 
Also at the event was Stacy Brown, a high school teacher in Hampton, New Hampshire. She teaches a unit about population growth and why birthrates are falling in countries like Japan. She’s also a mom, with two children, ages 10 and 7, who were eating ice cream on the sidelines. Like other parents, Ms. Brown cited the high cost of child care as a deterrent to having large families.  
“It seems so simple to me: Make it easier for families, and people will have more children,” she says. “It’s not a mystery. But we can’t seem to prioritize or value that.”

Texto completo: Terry Rolin, like his Depression-era parents, shunned banks and kept his life savings of more than $82,000 hidden at his suburban Pittsburgh home. What Rolin didn’t realize was that he had more to fear from law enforcement than from banks.
When Rolin, a retired railroad worker, moved to an apartment, he decided to entrust the money to his daughter, Rebecca Brown, to open a joint bank account in Boston, near her home.
But as she was set to fly home from Pittsburgh International Airport, the Transportation Security Administration spotted the cash in her carry-on and called authorities. A Drug Enforcement Administration agent questioned her, didn’t believe her answers and seized the money under a program that was created to target illegal proceeds from crimes.
No swindlers and drug dealers
The agent had no reason to suspect Brown of any crime, and neither she nor her father were ever charged with one. Yet it took these innocent citizens more than six months, with help from pro bono lawyers and a class action lawsuit against the government, to get their money back last year.
At least their nightmare ended happily – far better than for tens of thousands of innocent people whose cash, cars or even homes are seized and permanently kept by local, state or federal law enforcement under “civil asset forfeiture.”
USA TODAY's opinion newsletter: Get the best insights and analysis delivered to your inbox
Forfeiture is meant to battle crime by taking profits from swindlers and drug dealers, and at times it does. But the way it has been used for decades, it too often ensnares law-abiding citizens.
Why?
Cash-strapped agencies
One reason is that federal, state and local authorities get to keep all or part of the forfeitures they take in. Since 2000, they’ve taken in nearly $69 billion, according to a report by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal group that has sued the government in forfeiture cases. That’s 69 billion reasons for cash-strapped agencies to grab money, whether or not it’s justified.
And it’s so easy.
Police need only to suspect your property is somehow involved in a crime. They don’t have to charge you, let alone convict you of anything. And once they seize something, it’s up to you to prove in a complex and expensive system that it is not derived from a crime. Basically, you’re guilty until proven innocent.
Like so much else in today’s criminal justice system, the brunt of forfeiture falls on those who can least afford to fight back. The majority of seizures are cash. Across 21 states with available data 2015-19, the average forfeiture was $1,276 – not exactly drug lord fortunes.
Because many low-income and minority people don’t have bank accounts, they use cash and become easy prey for law enforcement. Once their cash is confiscated, they often have no money to hire a lawyer and are forced to let the money go.
Legitimate reasons people carry cash
Civil asset forfeiture turns authorities into bounty hunters who somehow can’t imagine the many legitimate reasons people carry cash. They’ve snatched large amounts of cash from people carrying it to buy a used car, to close a business deal or simply because it’s the proceeds of their legitimate cash business.
A deputy in rural Muskogee, Oklahoma, stopped a driver on the highway for a broken taillight and seized $53,000 in donations collected from charity concerts for a Christian college in Myanmar and a Thai orphanage. Only after horrendous national publicity and intervention by an Institute for Justice lawyer did the government return the money.
Reform in New Mexico, Maine
Three dozen states have passed laws since 2014 to rein in the system’s abuses. But a huge loophole often remains: To get around state law, local police can partner with federal law enforcement in a forfeiture case and get up to 80% back as a kind of finder’s fee.
New Mexico, in a 2015 law, found a way to get around this problem. The state not only requires a conviction before taking money or property permanently, it also mandates that all proceeds go into the state’s general treasury rather than directly to police. And it has cut into the ability of police to partner with the feds.
In Maine, a new measure that abolished civil asset forfeiture became law this week.
Other states should take note. And if Congress is serious about police reform, it should eliminate federal agencies’ outrageous use of civil forfeiture and end the program that allows sharing with states.
Forfeiture is one more reason many law-abiding citizens fear and distrust law enforcement. In America, no one like Terry Rolin or his daughter should have to battle the government to get back their hard-earned property.
In the wake of a police officer’s conviction for murder in the killing of George Floyd, USA TODAY Opinion is producing a series of editorials examining ways to reform police departments across the USA.

Texto completo: Best Beaches  ð️
Greater Boston ↘ Maine Rhode Island Cape Cod Now that summer is in full swing, we're rounding up some of the best beach picks from Globe staffers to help readers explore New England's coveted coastlines.
The water may be colder, the coastline rockier, and in some spots you might as well be in Canada — but Maine's beaches draw visitors from all over the country. From long stretches of rugged shoreline to sprawling white sand flats that go for miles, beachgoers will find no shortage of quintessential New England charm. Southern Maine beaches are known for their smoother, sandy landscape, while the further north you go, beaches become more secluded, scenic, and windswept. Maine's coveted coastline is enjoyed by all who make the trip, and we've rounded up a few we think readers would like.
Here's a look at some of the best beaches in Maine:
Old Orchard Beach This beach lays claim to seven miles of sand that seem to go on forever. At the center is the famed Old Orchard Pier, which features an amusement park that is considered one of the last remaining oceanfront amusement parks in the country. Kids and families can enjoy the excitement of the pier, and beachgoers looking for a quieter day can head to either the northern or southern ends of the beach. Consistently voted Maine's number one beach by the Portland Press Herald — the state's largest newspaper — this vibrant beachside destination is well worth a visit. There are several public parking areas that span the beach: Some are metered, and there are several $20 all-day lots. If you don't mind a walk, you can find free parking, too, according to TripAdvisor.com.
How to get here: 2 Old Orchard St., Old Orchard Beach, Maine, 04064. Click here to see a map .
Sand Beach Nestled between mountains and rocky shores on the east side of Acadia National Park, this small but breathtaking stretch offers spectacular scenery. The beach is largely comprised of unique sand and shell fragments caused by the pounding surf, and the waterline varies significantly between high and low tide. If you're looking to swim, be ready for frigid temperatures: The ocean rarely exceeds 55 degrees — even in July and August, according to acadiamagic.com. If you're not in the mood for a bone-chilling swim, there are plenty of hikes nearby to get even better views of this striking landscape. This secluded destination located within the national park was recently ranked among the five best New England beaches by AAA. Access to the park is $30 for vehicles and $15 per person, according to NPS.gov.
How to get here: This beach is accessible via Park Loop Road in Acadia National Park just south of the entrance fee station in Bar Harbor, Maine. The Sand Beach parking GPS coordinates are 44.330185 º N 68.183989 º W. Click here to see a map .


Ogunquit Beach This wide open beach on Maine's southern coast lies between the Atlantic Ocean and the Ogunquit River on a long, sandy peninsula with grass dunes. The water is cool and clear, and sand is fine, soft, and expands for miles at low tide. There are shade tents open to the public if sun becomes too much. Walkable from downtown and the Marginal Way cliff walk, this beach boasts plenty of nearby attractions to further explore the area. Ranked among TripAdvisor's top 25 beaches in the country, it's been called “one of the most beautiful, walkable beaches.” While there are a number of parking lots in the area, the Main Beach lot is located at the eastern end of Beach Street, and parking is $30 on weekdays and $35 on weekends.
How to get here: 115 Beach St., Ogunquit, Maine, 03907. Click here to see a map .
Crescent Beach Located about eight miles south of Portland in picturesque Cape Elizabeth, this dune-backed beach is favored by many. Relatively warm waters and light surf make this location ideal for swimming. With hiking trails along the water's edge, and optimal spots for fishing, bird watching, and sunbathing, it's no wonder this beach is a memorable destination for locals and visitors — ranked by both The Guardian and The Maine Magazine as a favorite spot. There are bathrooms, showers, and parking on site — and the occasional food truck. Located within a state park, admission per person is $8 for nonresidents, $2 for seniors, $1 for children ages 5 to 11, and free for children under 5, according to maine.gov.
How to get here: 109 Bowery Beach Road, Cape Elizabeth, Maine, 04107. Click here to see a map.

Texto completo: Topsham native enjoys bogey-free round to edge Will Kannegieser by one shot to take home the title.
BAR HARBOR — Wayne Dorr remembers the day Caleb Manuel was born. A former colleague of Caleb’s father, Patrick, in the Wiscasset school department, Dorr also remembers Caleb’s first driving practice. Caleb was 4, hitting 50 balls into the ocean at his grandfather’s cottage.
“We’d talk about hitting the same spot every time into the ripple of the last one,” Dorr said.
Thursday afternoon, those ripples extended 15 years. With Dorr as his caddie, 19-year old Caleb Manuel played a bogey-free round at Kebo Valley Golf Course to win the 102nd Maine Amateur Championship.
“This tournament always has been something special to play in. I was pretty nervous this morning, and I wasn’t hitting it as well as I wanted to going into today, but today I played my normal game,” said Manuel, who recently completed an all-Big East season as a freshman on the University of Connecticut golf team, said. “We play a lot of golf together and (Dorr) knows my game. He’s (caddied) in years past, so I just thought it was fitting I finally got it done. I couldn’t have done it without him.”
Manuel finished at 1-over 211 for the three-day tournament to edge Will Kannegieser by one stroke. Joe Alvarez, who entered the final round in a three-way tie with Manuel and Kannegieser for the lead, tied for third with Alex McGonagle at 6-over.
Manuel was 2-under 68 on Thursday, matching the score he posted in the first round Tuesday. It was a rebound from Wednesday’s 75, played in wind and mist. The sun came out at Kebo Valley on Thursday, and scores came down with it.
Seven players broke par on Thursday after no one did on Wednesday.
Manuel said he was nervous when he woke up Thursday morning, but it didn’t show in a round defined by its consistency. Manuel had just two birdies — on the par-4 seven and again on the par-5 14th — but he avoided the trouble he encountered in his first two rounds.
“That’s kind of the plan when you’re in the lead, but I wasn’t really in the lead the whole day. A clean card is always good. It’s a lot less stress when you’re out there making a lot of pars and dropping a birdie here and there,” Manuel said.
The birdie on seven pulled Manuel even with Alvarez for the lead. Manuel took the lead for good on the par-3 ninth hole. Alvarez’s tee shot pulled left, landing on the edge of the stream flowing by the green. Alvarez was forced to go barefoot and stand with his right foot in the water on his shot, and his chip still didn’t reach the green. While Alvarez took a double bogey, Manuel made par to take a two-stroke lead over Alvarez and Kannegieser.
Knowing he had the lead, Manuel said he continued to play aggressively, trying to make birdies, through 14. When he and Kannegieser birdied the 535-yard 14, Manuel reined himself in.
“Coast my way in from there,” he said.
Kannegieser birdied 10 to pull within a shot of Manuel, but was still a shot down when they reached 16. Kannegieser’s tee shot went right of the fairway, hitting the nearby road and bouncing back into heavy rough. While he was able to make par there, a bogey on 17 set Kannegieser two shots off the lead.
“I hadn’t gone for it all week. I actually miscounted the score. I thought we were even (on 16) and I wanted to put a little pressure on him knowing I was going first,” Kannegieser said. “Turns out, I was one behind him, but I think it was the right decision. I hit a poor shot. I wasn’t really committed to it and got a huge break. I should’ve been out.”
Manuel’s approach shot on 17 landed a few feet from the pin. As Kannegieser’s approach sailed the green and his chip rolled to the fringe at the far end, Manuel knew he could two putt and add a stroke to his lead.
“I’ve seen that pin there before, and I know you can’t be above it. I was above it, but just enough so it wasn’t unfair. Once (Kannegieser) made bogey there, I knew I just had to get it down there. I misread it a little bit but had good speed on it and it was an easy four,” Manuel said.
Kannegieser birdied 18, but with Manuel playing it safe, that just got the final margin of victory to a stoke.
“(Manuel) hit so many good shots. Even on the first two days, when he would make mistakes he would recover so well. I just knew he was going to be hard to beat and hard to catch. I did everything I could to keep with him, and I think I did a good job of that,” Kannegieser said.
A retired educator, Dorr knew his job was less to offer Manuel advice from hole to hole, and more to be a listener. It’s exactly what the former state junior golf champion needed.
“He’s pretty unflappable,” Dorr said. He doesn’t get rattled. He takes what the game gives him. He knows how to manage. Something awry happens, he knows in this game it does happen and it doesn’t get him wound up or emotional. He’s one of the calmest people I’ve ever golfed with. He’s a great kid to be with because he’s so unpretentious.”
“We talked about random stuff. The Maine Am’s not on the line; it’s just another round of gold,” Manuel added.
A round of golf that ended with a championship.

Lobster Bowl has different look

Texto completo: Instead of the traditional tackle football all-star game, the state's top high school skill players from the Class of 2021 will take part in a 7-on-7 tournament Saturday at Lewiston High.
The game will be different — touch instead of tackle football — but playing in the Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl Classic on Saturday will still matter, players say.
“It’s a pretty big honor to be recognized and to be asked to play in the Lobster Bowl,” said Jacob Humphrey, a receiver and defensive back from Bonny Eagle. “It’s a great cause. I’ve had family who have been Shriners and family who have been in and out of their hospitals. So it’s an honor to represent the state of Maine, help a good cause, and to help give back to what they gave to my family.”
Maine was one of four states that did not have a high school tackle football season during the pandemic-plagued 2020-21 school year. Initially Lobster Bowl organizers felt that would mean a second straight summer without the all-star charity game, which was played 30 straight summers from 1990-2019. Last summer’s game was canceled because of the pandemic.
Instead, organizers announced two weeks ago that they would hold a day-long event at Lewiston High featuring a series of afternoon and evening 7-on-7 touch football games. Maine high school teams were allowed to play 7-on-7 last fall.
“It was important for us to give these young men the opportunity to have something to play for and make memories on the football field one last time,” said Joe Hersom, the president of the Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl Classic. “We think this will bring a lot of people together. The football community as a whole from across the state, as well as the Lobster Bowl community.”
Approximately 120 of the states’s top skill players from the Class of 2021 have been divided into eight teams, each with one primary quarterback. They’ll spend the morning getting to know each other and learning the plays they’ll be running, with games in the afternoon and evening. Pool play begins at 2 p.m., with quarterfinals starting at 4 p.m., semifinals at 5:30, and a championship game at 7:30.
“Of course I want to go out and win a lot of games but at the same time it’s more to have fun one last time to throw the football around one last time,” said Gavin Rawstron, a quarterback/defensive back from Oak Hill.
Prior to the final game, all players will be recognized, including the 45 interior linemen who were nominated for the Lobster Bowl but will not be participating Saturday because of the 7-on-7 format.
As it is most years, the Lobster Bowl will represent the final chapter as a football player for the majority of the participants. Humphrey (UMass-Lowell) and Rawstron (University of Southern Maine) will be playing baseball in college.
Typically the ticket price for the Lobster Bowl is $10 and players are asked to commit to raising a minimum of $500 in contributions for the Shrine Hospitals in a three-month period leading up to the game.
This year, admission is free, though donations are encouraged. Because the rosters were set only a few weeks ago, players were asked to raise what they could without a mandatory fund-raising goal.
“I actually have tried to do quite a bit of fund-raising, talking to a lot of local businesses,” Rawstron said. “My grandfather was a big part of the Kora Shrine for almost his whole life. For us seniors it’s great to have a game but it’s more than that.”
Humphrey agreed, saying, “It’s definitely nice to finish off my football career to support a good cause that’s meaningful.”

Texto completo: AUGUSTA — After a long period of closure because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant facility relocation, the Maine State Library reopened its doors to the public July 12 at 242 State St.
The library’s permanent location at the Cultural Building on the State Capitol Complex was closed in May 2020 after it was determined that significant repairs and upgrades were needed to the facility. Since that time, the library has worked to identify temporary library space.
The majority of the library’s collections are located at the Carleton Mill in Winthrop. Library staff will shuttle materials between the two locations as patrons request items.
The library will require reservations to use the public computers and microfilm research services.
All policies relating to staff and the public as it relates to wearing masks will be determined by official policies for state employees and facilities. Curbside lending and direct lending will be offered, and the library’s iconic News Nook, which features every newspaper published in Maine, has been recreated.
A public reopening celebration is planned in early to mid-August.
Library hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the State Street location. For more information, call the library at 207-287-5600.

Texto completo: At Maine's third Opioid Response Summit, Gov. Janet Mills says isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mental health challenges have contributed to more substance use.
Mills cites isolation from pandemic resulting in mental health challenges
Maine is battling a persistent opioid crisis by trying to find and provide treatment and services to those most in danger — typically, those who have just survived an overdose.
Finding new ways to stem the crisis was one of the themes Thursday of Maine’s third Opioid Response Summit.
Gov. Janet Mills addressed the summit, which was held virtually for most participants, and said that the isolation and resulting mental health challenges caused by the pandemic shutting down much of society last year contributed to an increase in substance use.
“The rise in overdose deaths during the coronavirus pandemic is concrete evidence we have to do more,” Mills said. “There is no simple solution to ending the opioid epidemic.”
Maine has expanded substance use disorder services and launched new programs during the pandemic.
Gordon Smith, Maine’s opioid response director, said in an interview Thursday the widespread availability of naloxone, an opioid overdose reversing drug, is saving thousands of lives.
The state delivered about 800 doses of naloxone statewide in July 2019, while in recent months the monthly distribution typically has topped 5,000. Naloxone can be easily found in drugstores and public safety departments, and syringe exchange sites and hospitals also have supplies on hand.
Although drug overdose deaths increased by 33% in Maine in 2020, from 380 in 2019 to 504 last year, Smith said the wave of overdose deaths would have been even more devastating if not for the accessibility of naloxone.
“For every person we lose, 10 are saved,” Smith said. “Things would be much worse if we didn’t have naloxone.”
A similar one-third increase in overdose deaths has occurred nationally, with more than 90,000 fatalities last year, according to federal statistics.
Maine has recently begun tracking non-fatal overdoses. Of the 3,222 overdoses from January through May 2021, 247 were fatal.
Naloxone is routinely used by first responders at the scene of overdoses, and there were 625 known cases of the antidote being used by a community member to revive someone who had overdosed from January through May.
Smith said a new initiative, called OPTIONS, places a liaison in every Maine county who reaches out to people who survived an overdose. The $1 million program is funded mostly by federal grants.
“The people most at risk of dying from a drug overdose are those who just survived an overdose,” Smith said. “The liaison connects with people who survived and attempts to get them into harm reduction programs (such as syringe exchanges) and tries to hopefully get them into treatment.”
Smith said the OPTIONS program started in December and has expanded into all 16 counties, with a goal of expanding further this year.
Another recently launched program, the Maine MOM initiative, connects pregnant women and new parents, along with their infants, to substance use disorder treatment. The program, funded with a five-year, $5.3 million federal grant, brings the program to 17 health care locations in Maine.
Maine MOM offers, among other supportive services, medication-assisted treatment to pregnant women. About 7% of all births in Maine involve an infant who was exposed to substances during pregnancy.
Dr. Alane O’Connor, clinical lead for the Maine Maternal Opioid Misuse Initiative, said in a presentation at the summit that medication-assisted treatment such as Suboxone and methadone remains the best treatment for those with opioid use disorder during pregnancy, despite the stigma that may be attached.
O’Connor said one reason MAT is best is because the risk of relapse is high for those trying to quit “cold turkey” during pregnancy.

Texto completo: The new cases come as states around the country are seeing a rise in infections and as officials in Maine have braced for a greater impact of the delta variant.

Maine reported another 49 cases of COVID-19 and 10 deaths linked to the virus Thursday as infections continue to rise across the country and vaccines level off.
The numbers remain far below what Maine was seeing during peak infection periods in April and January, but indicate the more contagious delta variant could be on the rise, especially among unvaccinated people. The seven-day average of daily new cases is now at 31, up from 25 cases per day two weeks ago.
There have been 69,373 cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. There have been 877 deaths, including the 10 reported Thursday, all of which were identified during a review of vital records from March 2020 to the present.
The newly reported deaths occurred between May 17, 2020, and Dec. 2, 2020, and include three residents of Cumberland County, one resident of Hancock County, two residents of Kennebec County, one resident of Oxford County, one resident of Somerset County and two residents of York County.
Five were women and five were men. One was in their 50’s, one in their 70’s and eight were 80 or older.
Vaccinations have significantly leveled off, with 59.4% of Maine’s roughly 1.3 million residents having received their final dose of vaccine as of Wednesday. That figure rises to 67.4% among the 12-and-over population that is eligible for vaccination.
Just 571 doses of vaccine were administered statewide Wednesday. During the peak of vaccination efforts in April, Maine was administering more than 15,000 doses per day. Nationally, 48.3% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, including 56.5% of those 12 or older. Only five states and Washington, D.C., have administered more doses per 100,000 eligible residents than Maine, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention data.
The majority of new cases being reported are among people who are not fully vaccinated, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention. They appear to be spread out around the state with the exception of some coastal counties that have seen very low numbers of new cases in recent weeks, according to the most recent county-by-county data. Rural Franklin County had the highest rate of new cases for the four weeks ending July 8 at 13.25 cases per 10,000, followed by Piscataquis County with 11.32 cases per 10,000. The counties have the third and second worst vaccination rates at 56.9% and 54.6% respectively.
Cumberland County, the state’s most populous and highly vaccinated county, reported 4.10 cases per 10,000 for the four weeks ending July 8 while Sagadahoc County on the midcoast reported the best case rate with just four new cases reported over the same period. The case rate there was 1.12 per 10,000.
The U.S. CDC no longer monitors all “breakthrough” cases in which vaccinated people have contracted the virus, and is focusing on identifying and investigating hospitalizations and deaths. The Maine CDC, however, is continuing to look at all breakthrough cases and reports them to the U.S. CDC.
State data on breakthrough cases is updated weekly and was last reported July 9, at which point there had been 514 cases among fully vaccinated people. The CDC notes, however, that while vaccines are highly effective and safe, the number is likely an undercount as not all cases are investigated to determine vaccine status and it takes time to validate vaccine status, delaying cases being included in the count.
Hospitalizations have remained relatively consistent in recent weeks. On Thursday there were 29 people hospitalized, including 15 in critical care and six on a ventilator. The seven-day positivity rate for PCR tests is also similar to what it was on Wednesday at around 0.90.
Nationally, the U.S. has seen a more than a 100% increase in the seven-day average of daily new cases being reported from two weeks ago. On Thursday there were 38,236 new cases reported, bringing the seven-day daily average of new cases to 26,513. Two weeks ago the seven-day daily average was at 12,540, according to data from The New York Times. Every state in the nation has seen an increase, with Tennessee and Florida leading the country. Maine boasts the smallest increase in the case rate from two weeks ago.
Health officials have attributed the rise in infections to lagging vaccination rates, increased gatherings and the spread of the delta variant, a highly transmissible form of the disease first detected in India that has led to recent lockdowns in other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom.
As of July 9, the official count of delta variant cases in Maine is five with an additional five cases under investigation. MaineHealth, the state’s largest hospital network, had reported as many as 18 cases of the variant as of last week and has forwarded the hospital network’s samples to the Maine CDC for full genetic sequencing.
MaineHealth doesn’t have new data on the variant and is no longer doing extensive testing now that the variant’s presence in Maine has been confirmed, John Porter, a spokesman for the system, said on Thursday.
“There are good public health reasons to understand the variant and to know if it’s spreading, but ultimately when you have a patient in front of you — whether they need to be on a ventilator or not, those are things that are not variant dependent,” Porter said.

Legislature moves forward with Mills’ plan for using COVID-19 relief funds

Texto completo: The Legislature's budget-writing committee approved a plan late Wednesday for spending close to $1 billion in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds.

A plan for spending close to $1 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funds on a broad swath of infrastructure, child care, job training and business recovery programs was approved late Wednesday by the Legislature’s budget-writing committee.
The 8-4 vote by the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee leaves largely intact a proposal for using federal American Rescue Plan Act funds that Gov. Janet Mills laid out earlier this year.
Mills applauded the committee’s work Thursday morning but urged the panel to negotiate a compromise bill that could gain bipartisan support by at least two-thirds of the Legislature when it convenes Monday.
If the bill passes by a two-thirds margin, the funds could be distributed immediately. Passage by a smaller margin would mean the bill wouldn’t take effect until 90 days after the legislative session ends.
“If we allow three more months to pass simply because we couldn’t find consensus, then that could mean the difference between a business surviving or failing, between a parent being able to afford child care so they can go back to work or not, between expanding broadband to rural communities or not,” Mills said. “The stakes are high. The implications are real.”
The legislation would send large amounts of funding to a range of programs, government agencies, public colleges and businesses. It includes large boosts for student loan repayment grants for health care professionals, while also focusing on infrastructure improvements, especially broadband internet expansion for rural and other under-served communities in Maine.
Democratic legislative leaders heralded the funding and the plan as a “once-in-a-lifetime investment in working Maine families, businesses and communities.”
In May, Mills, a Democrat, unveiled her plan for Maine’s share of the ARPA funding, the uses of which are constrained by the federal law, at an event in Madison.
Sen. Cathy Breen, D-Falmouth, Senate chair of the budget committee, said the bill, L.D. 1733, will not only help Maine recover from the pandemic but will also position the state to thrive in the years ahead.
“Investments in people, workforce development, child care, health care and infrastructure for new and legacy home-grown industries offer enormous opportunities for growth,” Breen said. “And those opportunities will be shared in a more equitable and sustainable way than ever before.”
The House chair of the committee, Rep. Teresa Pierce, D-Falmouth, described the bill as a transformational investment in the state’s economy, as well as a response to the devastation wrought by the pandemic.
“Through this bill, Maine will build hundreds of units of affordable housing, address homelessness, support and champion our community colleges and public universities, and make sure our workforce has the tools they need to succeed through Maine’s economic recovery and beyond,” she said.
Highlights of the measure include grants for child care and education; economic recovery and job training programs for businesses; investments in broadband, affordable housing and energy efficiency; and allocations to the state park system and land conservation.
While minority Republicans on the budget-writing committee Tuesday voted in opposition to the bill, their version of the spending plan, advanced in a minority report, mostly keeps intact Mills’ initial recommendations for the funding.
Rep. Sawin Millett, R-Waterford, the leading House Republican committee member, said his caucus did not necessarily disagree on the priorities of the bill but were hesitant to use the one-time federal funds to create ongoing state government spending.
Millett, who has served as the state’s finance commissioner under three different governors, also described some of the new spending as having “long tails,” meaning future Legislatures could struggle to find funding for the programs.
In their plan, Republicans also earmark more money for the businesses sector, putting about $5 million more toward economic recovery grants for businesses hardest hit by the pandemic.
Republicans also would direct a $5.5 million grant to Efficiency Maine Trust for an energy upgrade at the Duvaltex mill in Guilford. Sen. Paul Davis, R-Sangerville, said he had been working with the Mills administration on the issue.
Republicans and Democrats are at odds over about $20 million in funding that’s part of $50 million earmarked for affordable housing. The bill, as passed by the committee, would require the use of union labor on projects that account for $20 million of the funds. Republicans have opposed that.
During a news conference Thursday, Breen said the committee vote on the bill was final and any changes would have to be done by amendments from the floors of the House and Senate on Monday.
Breen emphasized that the bill also included an $80 million replenishment to the state’s unemployment trust fund, which is used to pay unemployment benefits. That funding was being put in place, she said, to hold businesses harmless from the enhanced unemployment benefits paid to laid off workers during COVID-19. Otherwise they could see rate increases.
“It’s remarkable to me that Republicans would be voting against that,” Breen said. She also said passing the bill on a simple majority was still an option for Democrats.
If the bill passes with less than a two-thirds margin, the governor would have several options. Mills could veto the bill and force an override vote and a possible renegotiation of the measure. She could allow the bill to become law without her signature. She could sign the bill into law, or she could line-item veto parts of the bill she disagrees with.
Pierce, the Falmouth lawmaker, urged her colleagues to focus on the vast majority of the $983 million spending plan that Republicans and Democrats agree on.
“I hope that we will get to a point where we can really highlight the many, many other things that are going on in this bill that are really going to directly help our businesses that are still trying to recover from the pandemic, catapult us forward for economic growth of our workforce and rebuild our infrastructure,” Pierce said.
Congress is providing $350 billion in emergency funding nationwide for eligible state, local, territorial and tribal governments to respond to COVID-19. Approximately $4.5 billion flowed to Maine, with $3.2 billion directed to various recovery efforts, including support for COVID-19 testing and vaccinations, enhanced unemployment benefits, stimulus payments to families, and funds for businesses, county government, municipalities, education, behavioral health, child care, and more.
The remaining $983 million in Maine was allocated to the state government for pandemic response and economic recovery programs.

Texto completo: At Maine's third Opioid Response Summit, Gov. Janet Mills says isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting mental health challenges have contributed to more substance use.
Mills cites isolation from pandemic resulting in mental health challenges
Maine is battling a persistent opioid crisis by trying to find and provide treatment and services to those most in danger — typically, those who have just survived an overdose.
Finding new ways to stem the crisis was one of the themes Thursday of Maine’s third Opioid Response Summit.
Gov. Janet Mills addressed the summit, which was held virtually for most participants, and said that the isolation and resulting mental health challenges caused by the pandemic shutting down much of society last year contributed to an increase in substance use.
“The rise in overdose deaths during the coronavirus pandemic is concrete evidence we have to do more,” Mills said. “There is no simple solution to ending the opioid epidemic.”
Maine has expanded substance use disorder services and launched new programs during the pandemic.
Gordon Smith, Maine’s opioid response director, said in an interview Thursday the widespread availability of naloxone, an opioid overdose reversing drug, is saving thousands of lives.
The state delivered about 800 doses of naloxone statewide in July 2019, while in recent months the monthly distribution typically has topped 5,000. Naloxone can be easily found in drugstores and public safety departments, and syringe exchange sites and hospitals also have supplies on hand.
Although drug overdose deaths increased by 33% in Maine in 2020, from 380 in 2019 to 504 last year, Smith said the wave of overdose deaths would have been even more devastating if not for the accessibility of naloxone.
“For every person we lose, 10 are saved,” Smith said. “Things would be much worse if we didn’t have naloxone.”
A similar one-third increase in overdose deaths has occurred nationally, with more than 90,000 fatalities last year, according to federal statistics.
Maine has recently begun tracking non-fatal overdoses. Of the 3,222 overdoses from January through May 2021, 247 were fatal.
Naloxone is routinely used by first responders at the scene of overdoses, and there were 625 known cases of the antidote being used by a community member to revive someone who had overdosed from January through May.
Smith said a new initiative, called OPTIONS, places a liaison in every Maine county who reaches out to people who survived an overdose. The $1 million program is funded mostly by federal grants.
“The people most at risk of dying from a drug overdose are those who just survived an overdose,” Smith said. “The liaison connects with people who survived and attempts to get them into harm reduction programs (such as syringe exchanges) and tries to hopefully get them into treatment.”
Smith said the OPTIONS program started in December and has expanded into all 16 counties, with a goal of expanding further this year.
Another recently launched program, the Maine MOM initiative, connects pregnant women and new parents, along with their infants, to substance use disorder treatment. The program, funded with a five-year, $5.3 million federal grant, brings the program to 17 health care locations in Maine.
Maine MOM offers, among other supportive services, medication-assisted treatment to pregnant women. About 7% of all births in Maine involve an infant who was exposed to substances during pregnancy.
Dr. Alane O’Connor, clinical lead for the Maine Maternal Opioid Misuse Initiative, said in a presentation at the summit that medication-assisted treatment such as Suboxone and methadone remains the best treatment for those with opioid use disorder during pregnancy, despite the stigma that may be attached.
O’Connor said one reason MAT is best is because the risk of relapse is high for those trying to quit “cold turkey” during pregnancy.

Lobster Bowl has different look

Texto completo: Instead of the traditional tackle football all-star game, the state's top high school skill players from the Class of 2021 will take part in a 7-on-7 tournament Saturday at Lewiston High.
The game will be different — touch instead of tackle football — but playing in the Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl Classic on Saturday will still matter, players say.
“It’s a pretty big honor to be recognized and to be asked to play in the Lobster Bowl,” said Jacob Humphrey, a receiver and defensive back from Bonny Eagle. “It’s a great cause. I’ve had family who have been Shriners and family who have been in and out of their hospitals. So it’s an honor to represent the state of Maine, help a good cause, and to help give back to what they gave to my family.”
Maine was one of four states that did not have a high school tackle football season during the pandemic-plagued 2020-21 school year. Initially Lobster Bowl organizers felt that would mean a second straight summer without the all-star charity game, which was played 30 straight summers from 1990-2019. Last summer’s game was canceled because of the pandemic.
Instead, organizers announced two weeks ago that they would hold a day-long event at Lewiston High featuring a series of afternoon and evening 7-on-7 touch football games. Maine high school teams were allowed to play 7-on-7 last fall.
“It was important for us to give these young men the opportunity to have something to play for and make memories on the football field one last time,” said Joe Hersom, the president of the Maine Shrine Lobster Bowl Classic. “We think this will bring a lot of people together. The football community as a whole from across the state, as well as the Lobster Bowl community.”
Approximately 120 of the states’s top skill players from the Class of 2021 have been divided into eight teams, each with one primary quarterback. They’ll spend the morning getting to know each other and learning the plays they’ll be running, with games in the afternoon and evening. Pool play begins at 2 p.m., with quarterfinals starting at 4 p.m., semifinals at 5:30, and a championship game at 7:30.
“Of course I want to go out and win a lot of games but at the same time it’s more to have fun one last time to throw the football around one last time,” said Gavin Rawstron, a quarterback/defensive back from Oak Hill.
Prior to the final game, all players will be recognized, including the 45 interior linemen who were nominated for the Lobster Bowl but will not be participating Saturday because of the 7-on-7 format.
As it is most years, the Lobster Bowl will represent the final chapter as a football player for the majority of the participants. Humphrey (UMass-Lowell) and Rawstron (University of Southern Maine) will be playing baseball in college.
Typically the ticket price for the Lobster Bowl is $10 and players are asked to commit to raising a minimum of $500 in contributions for the Shrine Hospitals in a three-month period leading up to the game.
This year, admission is free, though donations are encouraged. Because the rosters were set only a few weeks ago, players were asked to raise what they could without a mandatory fund-raising goal.
“I actually have tried to do quite a bit of fund-raising, talking to a lot of local businesses,” Rawstron said. “My grandfather was a big part of the Kora Shrine for almost his whole life. For us seniors it’s great to have a game but it’s more than that.”
Humphrey agreed, saying, “It’s definitely nice to finish off my football career to support a good cause that’s meaningful.”

Texto completo: AUGUSTA — After a long period of closure because of the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant facility relocation, the Maine State Library reopened its doors to the public July 12 at 242 State St.
The library’s permanent location at the Cultural Building on the State Capitol Complex was closed in May 2020 after it was determined that significant repairs and upgrades were needed to the facility. Since that time, the library has worked to identify temporary library space.
The majority of the library’s collections are located at the Carleton Mill in Winthrop. Library staff will shuttle materials between the two locations as patrons request items.
The library will require reservations to use the public computers and microfilm research services.
All policies relating to staff and the public as it relates to wearing masks will be determined by official policies for state employees and facilities. Curbside lending and direct lending will be offered, and the library’s iconic News Nook, which features every newspaper published in Maine, has been recreated.
A public reopening celebration is planned in early to mid-August.
Library hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the State Street location. For more information, call the library at 207-287-5600.

Texto completo: MOUNT ABRAM TOWNSHIP -- Maine game wardens teamed up with about 35 first responders and volunteers on a nearly 10-hour rescue effort after a 65-year-old North Carolina man fell and injured an ankle while hiking the Appalachian Trail on Spaulding Mountain Wednesday.
Rescuers carried Richard Sullivan of Archdale, North Carolina, in a litter from the top of Spaulding Mountain to the summit of Sugarloaf Mountain in Carrabasset Valley, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said in a statement.
"Without the assistance from all of the first responders and volunteers, getting Mr. Sullivan off of the trail would have taken much longer," Warden Sgt. Scott Thrasher said in the statement. "Trail conditions were wet, rocky and steep. It was a great coordinated effort by all involved to get rescuers to the top of Sugarloaf and carrying Mr. Sullivan off the mountain. We have a great group of people in Franklin County to make rescue operations like this one run smooth."
Sullivan and his son, Daniel Sullivan, 36, were attempting to hike the entire Appalachian Trail from Springer Mountain, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin in Maine. The pair were on a remote section of the trail atop 4,009-foot Spaulding Mountain when the elder Sullivan slipped and fell, "likely breaking his ankle," Inland Fisheries and Wildlife spokesman Mark Latti said.
Sullivan was unable to walk and called 911 at about 1 p.m. on Wednesday. Rescuers reached Sullivan by first traveling to the top of 4,237-foot Sugarloaf Mountain in Carrabassett Valley by vehicle on a maintenance road, and then hiking about 3½ miles down the back side of Sugarloaf Mountain, reaching Sullivan around 5 p.m.
They put Sullivan in a rescue litter equipped with a mountain bike wheel on the bottom and formed a human chain to pass the litter up a trail to the top of Sugarloaf, reaching the summit around 10:40 p.m., Latti said. Carrabassett Valley Deputy Fire Chief Bob Carlton's truck was waiting there to take Sullivan down Sugarloaf to the Carrabassett Valley Fire Department's station on the Access Road, said Fire Chief Courtney Knapp, the incident commander on the trail.
From there, a NorthStar EMS ambulance took Sullivan to Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington.
Sugarloaf ski resort provided 14-16 employees for the rescue effort, Knapp said.
"Sugarloaf is highly supportive" with material and people when there is incident of this nature, he said. "Kudos to them."
Responders included Carrabassett Valley, Eustis, Kingfield, Phillips, Strong and Salem Township fire departments. Members of the Franklin Search and Rescue, Maine Warden Service, NorthStar EMS and Franklin County Emergency Management Agency also were involved.
The Rack, a restaurant on the Access Road, provided pizza to rescuers and volunteers when they came off the mountain, Knapp said.

Texto completo: The Freeport Town Council on Tuesday could decide to allow some marijuana businesses in town.
While marijuana is legal in Maine, municipalities must opt in to participate and individually set rules regulating cannabis, which Freeport has not yet done.
According to Town Council Chairman John Egan, councilors will discuss whether to allow marijuana cultivation and manufacturing in town, at the recommendation of the ordinance committee. The committee is not recommending the town allow retail sales.
Egan said that while the language does not specify between recreational and medicinal, the potential policies would effectively allow both.
In December, the Portland Press Herald reported that marijuana is Maine's most valuable crop, with 2020 sales totaling $266.2 million, up from $109.2 million in 2019.
For comparison, in 2019 total sales for potatoes - a crop often associated with Maine - came in at $184.1 million.
If councilors decide to opt in, there would be an official vote on Aug. 3 to send the rules to the planning board, which would come back to the council for final approval.
There will be "at least one if not several public hearings later this fall on the issue," Egan said. "This isn't going to take effect real soon, but it is, you know, moving forward."
The conversation about establishing rules for marijuana in Freeport was reintroduced to the council in March by the owners of the two medical marijuana growing facilities in the town. The council also discussed recreational cultivation in January 2020, but decided to wait unit the state adopted rules and to see how municipalities handle the businesses.
According to a Freeport council document from March, one owner is David Stephenson, who has had a cultivation facility in Freeport since 2017. The facility employs 25 Maine residents, the same document noted.
"I hope to keep my business here; however, I will likely need to relocate to another town ... if Freeport does not develop an ordinance to allow licensed adult-use cultivation," Stephenson said at the March meeting.
Stephenson could not be reached for further comment on Thursday. Neither of the two facilities in town has drawn any official complaints, Egan said.
"We're trying to be responsive to our business community as well," Egan added.
Other midcoast communities that have opted in and adopted various regulations relating to marijuana include Brunswick and Bath. On Tuesday, Lisbon officials also took a step toward legalizing recreational pot sales and cultivation.
According to the Maine Office of Marijuana Policy website, there are around 80 municipalities in Maine that have opted in for some form for recreational marijuana. The website points out, however, that municipalities are not required to notify the office, so the number could vary.
Last month there was $6.4 million in retail marijuana sales in Maine, which translates to $647,138 in sales tax through around 86,000 transactions.

Selectman arrested on drunken-driving charge
A Richmond selectman was arrested Wednesday night on charges of operating a vehicle under the influence and failing to stop for law enforcement.
The Richmond Police Department said Robert Bodge was arrested around 11:30 p.m.
Police said Bodge, 66, was spotted driving erratically on Alexander Reed Road in Richmond. He stopped on Stable Road, near his residence.
He was released on personal recognizance bail and will appear in court to answer the charges in September. Richmond Police Chief James Donnell said he did not know an exact court date for Bodge.
Bodge did not respond to attempts to reach him for comment.
He was reelected to Richmond's Selectboard in September 2020 after serving one full term and one half term. At the time, he said he divided his time between farming, cutting firewood and Port City Auto Auction. For nearly 40 years, he owned Bucky's Auto Repair, which he sold.

Girl, 4, injures leg when hit by car on Knox Street
A 4-year-old girl suffered a leg injury late Thursday afternoon when she was reportedly struck by a car on Knox Street.
Police were sent to the area of 62 Knox St. about 5:20 p.m. for a report of a child hit by a car near the corner of Maple Street.
The girl was taken by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center, where she was being examined later Thursday.
In the aftermath of the crash, police interviewed several witnesses at the scene. They were also reviewing footage from video surveillance cameras in the area.
One woman parked in the area was being questioned, but it was not immediately clear if she was the driver who struck the girl.
The crash remained under investigation Thursday night.

Woodstock man killed in single-vehicle crash
A single-vehicle crash on Route 26 early Wednesday morning resulted in the death of a Woodstock man.
According to a preliminary investigation, Casey Ryerson, 35, was driving a 2006 Hyundai Elantra southbound when it drifted right, went off the road and into a ditch, Oxford County Sheriff Chief Deputy James Urquhart said.
The vehicle continued and struck two culverts. After hitting the second one, it went airborne and landed nose-down, rolling at least once. Ryerson, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the vehicle. He suffered multiple injuries and died at the scene, Urquhart said.
The Oxford County Sheriff's Office was dispatched at 5:31 a.m. Providing assistance were the Paris Police Department, West Paris and Woodstock fire departments and PACE Ambulance.
The cause of the crash is under investigation. The road was reduced to a single lane for several hours while investigators worked at the scene.

Police get new tool to fight child sex trafficking
Maine is increasing the ability of law enforcement officers to fight child sex trafficking.
Democratic Rep. Genevieve McDonald proposed the change to the Maine Criminal Code to make clear that people who attempt to patronize a minor for prostitution have committed a crime even if they unwittingly patronize a law enforcement officer posing as a minor. The law also changes the crime of patronizing underage prostitution from a Class D to a Class C crime.
Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, signed the bill into law last week. McDonald said the state shouldn't "leave loopholes open or tie law enforcement's hands as they work to protect our youth from predatory behavior and disrupt child trafficking networks anywhere they exist."
The Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault testified in favor of the law change. It's set to take effect three months after the Maine Legislature adjourns.
Text message scam targets driver's licenses
Maine officials are warning residents of a text message phishing scam that targets people regarding their driver's licenses.
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Wednesday the text messages come from someone claiming to be the "Secretary of State Drivers License Facility," and the texter asks the recipient to click a link to "complete this verification." She said the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles never contacts residents via text messages about their driver's licenses.
Bellows said phishing scams such as this one seek to trick people into exposing personal information. They can also expose phones and computers to malware. She said anyone who suspects being targeted by a phishing scam can report the scam to her office.

Installation now part of the Space Force
The switch of a satellite tracking station from the Air Force to the new Space Force is complete with a new sign.
The U.S. Space Force sign was installed Monday outside the installation in New Boston, completing a transfer that was announced late last year, the Concord Monitor reported.
The base was originally farmland in New Boston and two adjoining towns. In World War II, the land was used as a practice bombing range by Army Air Force pilots flying out of the Manchester airport.
In 1959, the site began transforming into a tracking station with the installation of the first of a number of radar units.
In 2009, the name changed from the New Boston Satellite Tracking Station to the New Boston Air Force Station.
Boston
Man who used kids in drug dealing sentenced
A Massachusetts man who used two children in his fentanyl selling operation has been sentenced to two years in prison, federal prosecutors said.
Snolbert Ramirez-Sandoval, 24, a Dominican national living in Boston, was also sentenced Wednesday in U.S. District Court to three years of probation, according to a release from the U.S. attorney's office in Boston.
Ramirez-Sandoval told a drug buyer in July 2018 to go to an apartment in the city's Roslindale neighborhood, prosecutors said.
The buyer, who was working undercover for law enforcement, was greeted by a boy between 10 and 14 years of age. He and another boy between 2 and 6 years of age were the only occupants of the apartment at the time, authorities said.
The older boy led the buyer to a room where some fentanyl had been left, and took payment, prosecutors said.
The buyer arranged for another purchase a few days later and was met by the same two boys. This time, Ramirez-Sandoval showed up about 20 minutes later and made the sale, prosecutors said.
He pleaded guilty in March to distribution of fentanyl and employment or use of persons under 18 years of age in drug operations.
CHESTERFIELD, N.H.
Stone stairs of forest 'castle' crumble
Since the 1960s, visitors along a New Hampshire forest trail could see stone stairs and archways, remnants of a country house that was referred to as a "castle."
That's now giving way to gravity.
The top section of stairs collapsed over the weekend in Madame Sherri Forest in West Chesterfield, named after a Ziegfeld Follies costume designer who lived in the house and threw parties for New York's theatrical elite in the 1930s, the Brattleboro Reformer reported. The house was lost in a fire in 1962.
The land is owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Jack Savage, society president, said with all the rain the area has had recently, it wouldn't surprise him to hear the ground under the steps was saturated and something just gave way.
The society recently hosted a work party at the castle, cleaning up graffiti and weeding.
"I know it's a very popular place," Savage said. "People will likely want to go see what's there no more, but we ask that they stay away from the rubble so they don't get hurt."
Madame Sherri, who was born Antoinette Bramare in 1878 in Paris, built her castle in 1929. She eventually abandoned the home and died in 1965 in Brattleboro, Vermont, at age 87.
Hingham, Mass.
Driver crashes into house built in 1650
A driver who swerved to avoid a squirrel in the road crashed into a Massachusetts home that was built in 1650 by an ancestor of Abraham Lincoln, police said Thursday.
Neither the driver nor the occupants of the Hingham home known as the Samuel Lincoln House were injured in the crash that occurred at about 6:30 a.m., police said on Facebook.
The SUV was headed east when the 19-year-old driver swerved and drove off the right side of the road, over the sidewalk, and into the living room, police said. Approximately half of the vehicle entered the home.
According to broadcast reports, the homeowners were asleep at the time.

Texto completo: SANFORD -- State animal welfare officials have seized 20 horses, along with several dogs, cats and other animals, from a small farm on Deering Neighborhood Road in Sanford.
Officials began rounding up the animals on Wednesday from the property, which is in the Springvale section of the city. The animals were being cared for Thursday by various animal rescue agencies, and state officials were evaluating their welfare as part of the investigation into their care.
"All the animals are safe and have been placed in rescue shelters where they are receiving the care and attention they need," said Jim Britt, spokesman for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry.
Authorities seized 20 horses, 11 chickens, two pigs, six dogs, six cats, two geckos, three rats and one bearded dragon (a lizard), according to Britt.
"The animals were not abused," he said. "They just weren't getting the care they needed."
Britt said the woman who rescued the animals was unable to keep up with their care.
"She was trying to do a good thing. It's kind of sad," Britt added.
No charges have been filed. No one was home at the property Thursday afternoon.
Liam Hughes, director of the Maine Animal Welfare Program, visited the farm on Wednesday.
"They (the animals) haven't been handled a lot in the past, so they are being difficult and they're kind of scared. So we're trying to take it slow, ease them on to the trailers and get them out into a safe location," Hughes told WMTW-TV.
Dennis Chagnon, a civil deputy with the York County Sheriff's Office who is involved with the investigation at the Springvale farm, could not be reached Thursday.
Sanford officials discussed the welfare of the horses during a July 6 City Council meeting after Deputy Mayor Maura Herlihy mentioned a conversation she had with a resident regarding conditions at the farm.
"I was talking to someone... about a property... where the number of horses on the property has increased pretty heavily, and there are some not-so-great maintenance of said horses, and concern about said horses," said Herlihy. She pointed out that the person who was caring for the animals rents the property and is not the property's owner.
Mayor Anne-Marie Mastraccio said she believed that the person caring for the animals had taken in rescue horses. She also said questions about their care have been raised before.
"We've have had numerous complaints," she said.
A nearby resident, Steve St. Pierre, said Thursday he hadn't seen any obvious problems and didn't know about all the animals being cared for.
"Evidently there have been some issues with the care of the horses," St. Pierre said. "We never saw the pigs or dogs or cats, just the horses."
He said he and a neighbor sometimes wondered if there were enough stalls for all the horses, but they spoke Thursday and agreed that everything seemed normal.
Staff Writer Dennis Hoey contributed to this report.

Texto completo: The recent tropical rain has improved drought conditions in parts of Maine, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor report issued Thursday, bringing a measure of relief to local farms.
According to the report, most areas in southern coastal and midcoast Maine have been upgraded from moderate drought to abnormally dry, the lowest of the five drought categories.
The report classifies 88.23 percent of the state as abnormally dry, a decrease from the previous month, when the state was classified as 100 percent abnormally dry.
Meanwhile, Androscoggin County's drought status has also improved.
"The midcoast region did certainly benefit from the recent rains. Androscoggin County saw an improvement from a moderate drought category last week to an abnormally dry classification this week," said Nicholas Stasulis, a water scientist from the United States Geological Survey. "The streamflow conditions in the region are above normal and groundwater conditions are in the normal range. However, any further improvement in the drought condition will depend on forecasted rain."
According to the drought update from the Androsoggin County Emergency Management Agency released earlier this month, for the drought condition to improve, the county should receive 14 to 16 inches of rainfall over a three-month period.
"The areas with hand-dug wells are most affected as these wells go dry quickly during the periods of drought when compared to the areas with drilled wells," said Angela Molino, director of Androscoggin County EMA. "Residents can adopt some water conservation habits easily by running the dishwasher and washing machine with full loads only, turning off the tap when not in use, and by checking water system leaks."
As many as 107,702 people in Androscoggin County are affected by drought, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website.
However, Stasulis said that though the recent rains have temporarily improved dry conditions in many parts of the state, rainfall deficits are still substantial and drought is expected to persist.
"The rainfall from the tropical storm was concentrated along with the coastal counties, limiting recharge in the headwaters of Maine's primary watersheds. The northern and mountain regions did observe near to below normal rainfall during this period; therefore rainfall deficits remain unchanged in those areas," added Stasulis.
Tom Gordon, a conservation specialist from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said the recent rains will lessen the need for farmers to intensively irrigate their crops.
For Kate Del Vecchio, owner of Tender Soles Farm in Richmond who grows mixed vegetables, the recent rain has brought some respite to the farm.
"We've had a good bit of rain, but it's hard to tell whether after this week if it's going to rain or should we wait for a few more months," said Del Vecchio. "Currently, our only source of irrigation is our house well, because of which we aren't able to grow anything in a field further away from our house. That field is completely dependent on rainfall."
Meanwhile, the Maine CDC's Drinking Water Program is receiving requests for assistance from public water systems statewide on drought preparedness and response.
Many public water systems "are preparing for continued drought conditions by tracking source water levels, updating their emergency response plans, and communicating with response partners," said Susan Breau, a hydrogeologist for the program. "Most of the reported water quantity issues are from southern and coastal areas."
