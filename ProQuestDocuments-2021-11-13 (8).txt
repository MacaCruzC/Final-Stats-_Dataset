Halima Aden, a model, is taking a step back from the fashion industry to focus on herself and her faith.
“If my hijab can’t be this visible — I’m not showing up,” Aden, 23, wrote on Instagram.
Aden, who was the first model to wear a hijab for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition and walk the runway for labels like Yeezy, shared on her Instagram story this past week that she felt like she had compromised her religious values and beliefs in order to fit in to the fashion industry.
She alluded to being too scared to speak up when she was influenced to change the way she dressed, including how she wore her head scarf.
“Looking back now I did what I said I would never do. Which is compromise who I am in order to fit in,” Aden wrote on the social media platform. “Just remember they call it a ‘hijab journey’ for a reason and it is never too late to reinstate your boundaries.”
The Somali American model was born in a Kenyan refugee camp and first rose to fame in 2016 after competing in her hijab in the Miss Minnesota USA pageant. Since then, she’s been on the covers of American Vogue, Vogue Arabia, Elle and Allure.
There was, she said, struggle and discomfort that went into making many of those images a possibility. She also highlighted moments in which brands had instead covered her hair with pairs of jeans or other ornamental objects rather than her hijab and used heavy makeup on her when she would have preferred a more restrained look that aligned with her modest principles.
She cited confusion, a sense of rebellion and a lack of fellow Muslim representation in the industry as leading factors in her internal battle.
“The pressure was getting unbearable, and I’m sad to say I went through a period of resenting the hijab,” Aden wrote on Instagram.
She went on to write that the pandemic and a break from the industry had led her to realize where she felt she went wrong in her own hijab journey.
Muslim women who choose to don a head scarf often have deeply personal and dynamic relationships with their hijabs, and Aden was met with a wave of support from many who had similar experiences on Instagram and Twitter.
“Halima’s decision to step away from the modeling scene has just reinforced my beliefs,” Aminah Bakhtair, 19, who wrote on social media about her admiration for Aden, wrote in a direct message. “I feel proud of her for taking a stance that many would hesitate to take, and to take back what the Hijab truly means and stand up for the religion of Islam.”
The act of simply wearing a hijab has often been met with discrimination on both a social and bureaucratic level, particularly in Europe. France has banned the hijab in public schools and the public workforce. German chancellor Angela Merkel said in 2016 that full-face veils, sometimes worn by Muslim women as part of their hijab, should be banned.
In the United States, Muslim women have long reported instances of feeling as if they had been discriminated against for wearing their hijabs, and President Donald Trump’s ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries is still in effect.
Asmaa Ali, 23, an observant hijab wearer for much of her life, has experienced Islamophobia both in person and online but said she felt inspired by Aden’s message and tweeted that she found the model’s story “beautiful.”
“The decision to take her hijab more seriously really inspired me to hold on to my faith and be unapologetic about my identity as a Black, Muslim woman,” Ali said. “I think the essence of what Halima was talking about is not necessarily that there’s a right way to wear a hijab or a wrong way to wear a hijab. I think the message is to stay true to yourself.”
Fellow hijabi models like Ikram Abdi Omar also weighed in on how Aden’s public revelation had impacted them.
“Honestly, Halima Aden’s insta story posts brought me to tears and I started looking back on my old pictures on Instagram and I miss that Ikram more than anything,” Abdi Omar shared on her Instagram story.
Rihanna, Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid also reposted Aden’s story on their own Instagrams. Gigi Hadid wrote, “It is so important, as a hijabi or not, to self reflect and get back on track with what feels genuine to us — it’s the only way to feel truly fulfilled.”
Aden and her longtime agency, IMG Models, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. According to her stories on the platform, the model plans to stop doing runway shows and traveling for fashion season.
“I owe no one but Allah SWT,” she wrote — the letters stand for the Arabic phrase “Subhanahu wa ta’ala,” meant to glorify God when mentioning his name. “And y’all can literally kick rocks.”

AA to Zoom, Substance Abuse Treatment Goes Online

Until the coronavirus pandemic, their meetings took place quietly, every day, discreet gatherings in the basements of churches, a spare room at the YMCA, the back of a cafe. But members of Alcoholics Anonymous and other groups of recovering substance abusers found the doors quickly shut this spring, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
What happened next is one of those creative cascades the virus has indirectly set off. Rehabilitation moved online, almost overnight, with zeal. Not only are thousands of AA meetings taking place on Zoom and other digital hangouts, but other major players in the rehabilitation industry have leapt in, transforming a daily ritual that many credit with saving their lives.
“AA members I speak to are well beyond the initial fascination with the idea that they are looking at a screen of Hollywood Squares,” said Dr. Lynn Hankes, 84, who has been in recovery for 43 years and is a retired physician in Florida with three decades of experience treating addiction. “They thank Zoom for their very survival.”
Although online rehab rose as an emergency stopgap measure, people in the field say it is likely to become a permanent part of the way substance abuse is treated. Being able to find a meeting to log into 24/7 has welcome advantages for people who lack transportation, are ill, juggling parenting or work challenges that make an in-person meeting tough on a given day and may help keep them more seamlessly connected to a support network. Online meetings can also be a good steppingstone for people just starting rehab.
“There are so many positives — people don’t need to travel. It saves time,” said Dr. Andrew Saxon, an addiction expert and professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “The potential for people who wouldn’t have access to treatment easily to get it is a big bonus.”
Todd Holland lives in northern Utah, and he marvels at the availability of virtual meetings of Narcotics Anonymous around the clock. He recently checked out one in Pakistan that he heard had a good speaker but had trouble with some delay in the video and in understanding the speaker’s accent.
Some participants say the online experience can have a surprisingly intimate feel to it.
“You get more a feel for total strangers, like when a cat jumps on their lap or a kid might run around in the background,” said a 58-year-old AA member in early recovery in Portland, Oregon, who declined to give his name, citing the organization’s recommendations not to seek personal publicity.
Plus, he added, there are no physical logistics to attending online.
“You don’t go into a stinky basement and walk past smokers and don’t have to drive," he said.
At the same time, he and others say they crave the raw intensity of physical presence.
“I really miss hugging people,” he said. “The first time I can go back to the church on the corner for a meeting, I will, but I’ll still do meetings online.”
Holland, who for decades abused drugs until Narcotics Anonymous helped him stay sober for eight years, said the online meetings can “lack the feeling of emotion and the way the spirits and principles get expressed.”
It is too early for data on the effectiveness of online rehabilitation compared to in-person sessions. There has been some recent research validating the use of the technology for related areas of treatment, like PTSD and depression that suggests hope for the approach, some experts in the field said.
Even those people who say in-person therapy will remain superior also said the development has proved a huge benefit for many who would have otherwise faced one of the biggest threats to recovery: isolation.
The implications extend well beyond the pandemic. That’s because the entire system of rehabilitation has been grappling for years with practices some see as both dogmatic and insufficiently effective given high rates of relapse.
“It’s both challenging our preconceived concerns about what is necessary for treatment and recovery but also validating the need for connection with a peer group and the need for immediate access,” said Samantha Pauley, national director of virtual services for the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, an addiction treatment and advocacy organization, with clinics around the country.
In 2019, Hazelden Betty Ford first tried online group therapy with patients in San Diego attending intensive outpatient sessions (three to four hours a day, three to four hours a week). When the pandemic hit, the organization rolled out the concept in California, Washington, Minnesota, Florida, New York, Illinois and Oregon — where Pauley works — and has since expanded to New Jersey, Missouri, Colorado and Wisconsin.
Pauley said 4,300 people have participated in such intensive therapy — which entails logging into group or individual sessions using a platform called Mend that is like Zoom. Preliminary results, she said, show the treatment is as effective as in-person meetings at reducing cravings and other symptoms. An additional 2,500 people have participated in support groups for family members.
If not for COVID, Pauley said, the “creative exploration” of online meetings would still have happened but much more slowly.
One hurdle to intensive online rehab involves drug testing of patients, who would ordinarily give saliva or urine samples under in-person supervision. A handful of alternatives have emerged, including one in which people spit into a testing cup while being observed onscreen by a provider who verifies the person’s identity. The sample then gets dropped at a clinic or mailed in, although the risk of trickery always remains. In other cases, patients can visit a lab for a drug test.
Additionally, some clinical signs of duress can’t be as easily diagnosed over a screen.
“You can’t see the perspiration that might indicate the person suffering mild withdrawal. There are limitations,” said Dr. Christopher Bundy, president of the Federation of State Physician Health Programs, a group representing 48 state physician health programs that serve doctors in recovery.
He said that hundreds of physicians in these programs are attending regular virtual professionally monitoring meetings in which they meet with a handful of specialists for peer support and to assess their progress.
“This sort of thing has challenged our assumptions,” he said of the pandemic and the use of the internet for these therapies. “There’s a sense it’s not the same, but it’s close enough.”
Other participants in drug rehab and leaders in the field say that while online has been a good stopgap measure, they also hope that in-person meetings will return soon.
“It’s been a mixed blessing,” said David Teater, who wears two hats: He’s in recovery himself since the 1980s, and he’s executive director of Ottagan Addictions Recovery, a residential and outpatient treatment center serving low-income patients in western Michigan whose therapy typical gets paid through Medicaid.
In that capacity, he said online tools have been a godsend because, simply, they allowed service to continue. Through $25,000 in grants, the center got new computers and other technology that allowed it to do telemedicine, and set up a “Zoom room.” It includes a 55-inch monitor so that people who are Zooming in can see the counselor as well as the people who feel comfortable enough to come in-person and sit at a social distance wearing masks.
“We think it works equally well; we really do,” Teater said.

Discovering Vintage Madrid

One could easily amass a collection of ice buckets in Madrid. Vintage cubiteras, as they are called in Spanish, are everywhere. Many are midcentury models combining materials like Lucite, chrome, brass, Bakelite, leather or cork — stylish objects one could readily imagine resting on a bar within arm’s reach of Ava Gardner during her hard-partying years in Spain in the late ’50s.
Such enthusiasms are easy to indulge in the Spanish capital, and not because people drink more (though they might) or have vast apartments with extra cupboards (they don’t). Rather, it’s because El Rastro, the sprawling flea market that winds through a sizable part of the city center, is always so well stocked with chic barware and other collectibles: books, furniture, china and ceramics, paintings and prints, vintage fashion and many other things you never knew you wanted to collect — often at bargain prices relative to other European capitals.
Located just south of Plaza Mayor, between Calle de Toledo and Calle de la Ribera de Curtidores, the Rastro dates back centuries to when the neighborhood was full of tanneries (curtidores). The name, which applies to the market and the neighborhood, refers to the “trail” (rastro) of blood that once stained the streets as animal carcasses were moved about. The area remained a prime clearinghouse for the city’s castoffs, with shops evolving in the last decade from unheated warrens of old furniture piled to the ceiling to gallerylike spaces with curated vignettes of beautiful, covetable objects.
On pre-pandemic Sundays, a sprawling outdoor market attracted thousands of locals and tourists looking for antiques and perusing hundreds of stalls set along the main streets and plazas selling items that included T-shirts, off-brand underwear, flamenco CDs, plumbing fixtures and handicrafts. The Sunday market was closed in March and is just now being phased back to life, but in the meantime the surrounding shops, which reopened by early June, have been given a chance to shine on their own (with dealers and customers taking necessary safety precautions).
Despite the drop in foot traffic, many dealers said business had been stable. Several have converted old storerooms into display space, and most open daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and receive clients by appointment as well. Online shopping is also an option, either through their websites or Instagram feeds.
Rastro regulars have their own preferred routes through the dozen or so streets, but unless you prefer walking uphill, start at the neighborhood’s north end, perhaps at Casa Josephine on Calle de Santa Ana, where furniture, ceramics and, lately, some groovy 1960s textile art walk the line between rustic and chic. Nearby Olofane is a well-known source for lamps (from 80 euros, about $97), sconces and other decorative fixtures that are restored in-house. At La Recova, there’s midcentury furniture, ceramics and glass from Germany, the Netherlands and Britain.
One block south, Calle del Carnero offers a particularly diverse mix of vendors. Virtually everything at Almoneda Txomin has gracious, country-house proportions and Art Nouveau flourishes. A few doors away, the dealer Andrés Serrano is a major source for vintage china and glassware.
Before the pandemic, strolling Ribera de Curtidores on a Sunday morning was something of a contact sport, and crowds may soon be back. But Monday through Saturday, the tree-lined boulevard is delightfully tranquil, especially as the two biggest shopping destinations are pretty interior courtyards lined with multiple shops. Standouts at Nuevas Galerias include Pilar Ilusion, selling glamorous vintage fashion and accessories like a ’50s-era Balenciaga cocktail dress (650 euros, $780), among other Spanish and international labels; and Verde Gaban, a Rastro newcomer with a wide selection of sophisticated housewares.
Across the street, Galerias Piquer is a destination for local interior designers with about 20 shops. There are sleek Art Deco sculptures at Gorgona; Pan-European furniture from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; and lacquered Asian chests (starting at around 400 euros, $480) at Isabel Martinez. You might also find those vintage ice buckets (50 to 80 euros, $60 to $96) at Lagur and other elegant bar and tableware at Juan Carlos Sancho.
Even if you’re in the market only for inspiration, a morning of window-shopping in one of Madrid’s oldest neighborhoods, with its beautiful tile-encrusted tavern facades, intricate iron balconies and old-school workshops, provides a glimpse into the authentic soul of the city.

Fact check: Fairness Doctrine only applied to broadcast licenses, not cable TV like Fox News

Texto completo: The claim: The Fairness Doctrine ended under Ronald Reagan and spawned Fox News.
Recently, a post on Facebook described former President Ronald Reagan as the "The Father of Fake News" and argued to "Reinstate the Fairness Doctrine."
"Ronald Reagan's FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine which, since 1949, required media to present both sides' opinions in the rare event they weren't just reporting straight news," the post explained.
"A Democrat-controlled Congress passed a bill to re-instate the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. Reagan vetoed the bill," it continued. "Fox News followed in the 1990s. America is now more polarized and misinformed than ever."
Another post on Facebook — shared over 700 times — also linked the end of the Fairness Doctrine to the birth of Fox News.
"Let's reinstate the Fairness Doctrine ended by Reagan & make lying in the media WRONG AGAIN. That move spawned Fox," the post read.
The users behind the posts have not responded to requests for comment from USA TODAY.
What is the Fairness Doctrine, and why was it abolished?
For the most part, the posts on Facebook have their history correct.
The Federal Communications Commission has long been charged with issuing broadcast licenses to radio and television stations that operate in the "public interest, convenience and necessity," per its website.
In 1949, the FCC issued a report that established the duty of broadcast licensees to cover controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner. That obligation was termed the Fairness Doctrine.
Its basic requirements were that broadcasters "devote a reasonable portion of broadcast time to the discussion and consideration of controversial issues of public importance" and "affirmatively endeavor to make ... facilities available for the expression of contrasting viewpoints held by responsible elements with respect to the controversial issues," per a report by the Congressional Research Service.
"In practice, it required broadcasters to identify issues of public importance, decide to cover those issues, and then to afford the best representatives of the opposing views on the issue the opportunity to present their case to the community," the report explains.
It also required broadcasters to allow individuals who were the subject of editorials or personal attacks to be granted an opportunity to respond, and established that candidates for public office are entitled to equal airtime, according to the Encyclopedia Brittanica.
(The mandate of equal airtime for office seekers became federal law in 1959, when Congress amended the Communications Act.)
Most broadcasters complained that the Fairness Doctrine was overly burdensome and an inhibition to their coverage and free speech. They also argued that growth in the media industry rendered it obsolete.
The debate over the requirement peaked in the mid-1980s.
In June 1987, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and Senate passed legislation to preemptively codify the doctrine into federal law. Reagan vetoed it, per the Los Angeles Times.
It wasn't until afterward, in August 1987, that the FCC voted to abolish the doctrine on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment and stifled the sort of democratic debate it was intended to promote, according to the New York Times.
(The decision had no impact on the rule that candidates for public office be offered equal airtime, since that had become law. It also left the editorial and personal-attack provisions, which were in effect until 2000.)
Though it had not been enforced since 1987, the Fairness Doctrine was not technically scratched from the books until 2011, per to the Washington Post.
Is there a connection between the Fairness Doctrine and Fox News?
Apart from the history, the posts on Facebook claim that there is a connection between the Fairness Doctrine and Fox News. That's where they miss the mark.
The Fairness Doctrine only applied to broadcast licenses.
The report by the Congressional Research Service notes that broadcast is "distinct from cable, satellite, and the Internet, which are all services for which consumers must pay.
"It does not appear that the Fairness Doctrine may be applied constitutionally to cable or satellite service providers," it continues.
Therefore, it's unlikely that the Fairness Doctrine would have impacted Fox News, even if it were in effect in 1996, when Roger Ailes launched the channel.
"The FCC would, in all likelihood, have been restricted to regulating the content of public broadcasters, leaving Fox News to its own devices, like hundreds of other cable and satellite channels," Snopes wrote last time this claim surfaced online.
Although its impact on cable and satellite television may have been null, it's true that some credit the demise of the Fairness Doctrine with "the creation of modern-day talk-radio, including conservative talk radio shows hosted by Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity, according to Politico.
Our rating: Partly false
Based on our research, the claim that the Fairness Doctrine ended under Ronald Reagan and that later spawned Fox News is PARTLY FALSE. It's true that Reagan's FCC abolished the Fairness Doctrine and Reagan vetoed a preemptive attempt to codify it into legislation. But it's not true that that move is directly connected to Fox News. The Fairness Doctrine only applied to broadcast licenses. Fox News is a cable network, and therefore wouldn't have been bound by its rules.

Texto completo: As states across the country face a surge in COVID-19 cases, a number of studies show Kansas stands out as a hotspot for the virus’s spread.
That comes as the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported 5,224 cases since Wednesday, as well as 26 deaths and 97 hospitalizations reported in that time frame.
That is fewer new cases than the state was seeing last week but still far more than earlier in the pandemic.
The number of cases continues to strain hospitals, with 22% of intensive care beds staffed and open as of Monday. Capacity in some regions is even tighter — only 9% of intensive care beds in southwest Kansas were free,
A range of studies also underscore these challenges facing Kansas. Here is how the state is doing, according to those reports.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force
The state remains firmly in the red zone for many new metrics, according to the weekly report compiled by the White House Coronavirus Task Force.
The state reported the 12th highest rate in the nation for cases per 100,000 residents, checking in at almost twice the national average. It is fourth in the country for the percentage of tests coming back positive.
Of the state’s 105 counties, 96 are deemed to have serious or moderate levels of community spread, the report said.
One bit of good news: New cases reported this week were less than in weeks prior, though the report was clear that the state wasn’t yet out of the woods.
“All states and all counties must flatten the curve to sustain the health system for
both COVID and non-COVID emergencies,” the report said.
Johns Hopkins University
Kansas is still struggling with testing, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The state is running the 10th lowest number of tests per capita, according to the JHU data.
There is a bit of good news, according to the data: The state’s seven-day average test positivity rate has decreased from 40% to 37% in recent weeks, signaling more tests are potentially being run.
But Kansas is still lagging — its test positivity rate is the fifth highest in the nation.
The Washington Post
Reporting from the Washington Post found other signs that things may be improving, albeit slightly. The paper’s COVID-19 tracker found that Kansas has seen declines in the per capita number of deaths and total cases since last week.
But Kansas has seen a 9% uptick in hospitalizations per capita since last week, the paper found, as the data showed 39 residents per 100,000 are hospitalized with COVID-19.
The New York Times
COVID-19 spread in at least one Kansas city is among the worst in the country, according to data from the New York Times.
Hutchinson is seeing the sixth worst outbreak in the country based on the size of its population, the Times’ data showed, with 171 cases per 100,000 residents.

Texto completo: The claim: Obama 'pleaded' with Biden not to run for president in 2016'
In the runup to the 2020 presidential race, supporters of President Donald Trump attempted to undercut support for candidate Joe Biden by suggesting that he had only lukewarm support from former President Barack Obama.
One Oct. 28 Facebook post by Students for Trump features a photo of the former president with his arms around Biden and the headline "Obama believes so strongly in Joe Biden that he pleaded with him not to run in 2016. ..." It includes this statement in the caption: "Not even Obama wants Joe Biden to be president!"
The comments, laced with sarcasm, were clearly intended to convey Obama's lack of support for his former vice president. The meme has over 1,300 shares and more than 4,300 reactions.
A similar claim — sometimes with the exact wording and more — was made in other memes and posts, including one from White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.
But the situation is more nuanced.

Biden weighed a 2016 run
In the 2016 Democratic primary, Biden waited until deep into the political season to decide whether to enter the contest. He finally announced in mid-October 2015, that he would not be a candidate.
A key factor, according to Biden, was the death that May of his son Beau, from brain cancer. Biden had made no decision as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton jumped into the fray and began winning support.
"As the family and I have worked through the grieving process, I have said all along and time again what I have said to others; that the process by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president," Biden said in a statement in the White House Rose Garden. "That it might close. I have concluded it has closed."
At the time, a New Hampshire poll by WBUR showed Biden with only 9% support, behind Clinton with 38% and Sen. Bernie Sanders with 34%.
"Biden would have had to begin with no money (and no love for raising it), no staff, and no organization in the states," Evan Osnos wrote in The New Yorker at the time. "He would have been equipped with little more than a fervent belief that he could be President and an appetite for politics that is inexhaustible even by Washington standards."

Obama and the 2016 Democratic primary
Against this backdrop, which had been building for several months as Biden vacillated, Obama was concerned that a Biden entry would be too late, in the face of Clinton's lead, and would be difficult for the grief-stricken candidate to overcome, New York Times correspondent Peter Baker reported.
"By the time that Mr. Biden began weighing a campaign, the president had long since concluded that Hillary Clinton had the best chance of winning in 2016," Baker wrote in April 2019. "Beyond that, Mr. Biden was awash in grief over the death of his son, hardly the state of mind for a grueling presidential marathon."
Baker said Obama was looking for ways "to nudge" Biden out of the race, but not force him. He wrote that Obama "did not want to push and sought to give his vice president room to come to the decision himself. Over the course of weekly lunches, he gently pressed Mr. Biden on his thinking."

Denis McDonough, who served as White House chief of staff under Obama, told the newspaper that the president, regarding the 2020 race, clearly thought Biden was prepared to be president or he would not have picked him for vice president. “But the president has also said there are a lot of good candidates in the race, and he thinks it’s important for the party to make this choice about moving forward," McDonough added. "A full primary contest is good for the party.”
At the same time, there is strong evidence that Obama and Clinton were more in sync in style and work habits — more the disciplined intellectual than the backslapping pol, and this played into the president's thinking in 2015.
“There was a feeling of inevitability about Hillary Clinton in every aspect,” Jen Psaki, the former White House communications director, told Politico. “So it never felt to me like it was Obama choosing Hillary Clinton over Joe Biden. It was a feeling like it’s inevitable after Hillary Clinton left the State Department that she will be the Democratic nominee, and she will become the next president. So Obama ... was trying to play a part in being helpful.”
Biden, in his 2017 book "Promise Me, Dad," recalled that he and Obama privately discussed a White House run at their weekly lunch in January 2015, and that Obama “had been subtly weighing in against."
“I also believe he had concluded that Hillary Clinton was almost certain to be the nominee, which was good by him,” Biden wrote.
The topic came up again, Biden says, days after his son died.
"'What are you going to do,' (Obama) asked, 'about running.' I explained that I had not entirely set aside the idea of running. ... And then I found myself saying, 'Look, Mr. President, I understand if you've made an explicit commitment to Hillary and to Bill Clinton,' but I assured Barack that if I decide to run I would engage Hillary on our policy differences only and not on questions of character or personality that might weaken her if she won the nomination. 'I promise you,' I said. And we left it at that."
Regarding Biden's performance in the White House, a key indicator of Obama's views of his vice president is that he gave him such high-profile assignments as overseeing the stimulus program, managing the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, and drafting a gun control package.
Biden also played a key role in the passage of Obamacare. “Nobody in the administration was more helpful in trying to move this through the process once the president was moving forward, using his instincts about what would and wouldn’t fly,” Pete Rouse, former senior adviser to Obama, told the HuffPost.
In January 2017, shortly before leaving office, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him "the best vice president America's ever had" and a "lion of American history,"
USA TODAY asked Students for Trump for a response. Andrew Kolvet directed us to a Politico article that we linked to in this report. He specifically cited a comment from an unidentified Democrat in that article who, according to Politico, quoted Obama as allegedly saying, "Don’t underestimate Joe’s ability to (expletive) things up.”
Our ruling: Missing context
We rate this claim as MISSING CONTEXT. Our research shows that President Barack Obama worked to persuade Joe Biden not to enter the 2016 race for a number of factors, including his admiration for Hillary Clinton's intellect; that Biden had waited so long in the election cycle; and that Biden would have a difficult time against Clinton, who had built up a formidable lead. Obama also felt Biden was still working through his grief over the death of his son. There is no evidence, however, that Obama "pleaded" with Biden not to run.

Thomas L. Friedman: Happy Thanksgiving to all those who told the truth in this election

Texto completo: With so many families gathering, in person or virtually, for this most unusual Thanksgiving after this most unusual election, if you’re looking for a special way to say grace this year, I recommend the West Point Cadet Prayer. It calls upon each of these future military leaders to always choose “the harder right instead of the easier wrong” and to know “no fear when truth and right are in jeopardy.”
Because we should be truly thankful this Thanksgiving that — after Donald Trump spent the last three weeks refusing to acknowledge that he’d lost reelection and enlisted much of his party in a naked power play to ignore the vote counts and reinstall him in office — we had a critical mass of civil servants, elected officials and judges who did their jobs, always opting for the “harder right” that justice demanded, not the “easier wrong” that Trump and his allies were pressing for.
It was their collective integrity, their willingness to stand with “Team America,” not either party, that protected our democracy when it was facing one of its greatest threats — from within. History will remember them fondly.
Who am I talking about? I am talking about FBI Director Christopher Wray, a Trump appointee, who in September openly contradicted the president and declared that historically we have not seen “any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election” involving mail-in voting.
I am talking about Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — a conservative Republican — who oversaw the Georgia count and recount and insisted that Joe Biden had won fair and square and that his state’s two GOP senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, did not garner enough votes to avoid election runoffs. Perdue and Loeffler dishonorably opted for the easier wrong and brazenly demanded Raffensperger resign for not declaring them winners.
I am talking about Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who not only refused to back up Trump’s claims of election fraud, but whose agency issued a statement calling the 2020 election “the most secure in American history,” adding in bold type, “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised.”
Krebs did the hard right thing, and Trump fired him by tweet for it. Mitch McConnell, doing the easy wrong thing, did not utter a peep of protest.
I am talking about the Republican-led Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County, Arizona, which, according to The Washington Post, “voted unanimously Friday to certify the county’s election results, with the board chairman declaring there was no evidence of fraud or misconduct ‘and that is with a big zero.’”
I am talking about Mitt Romney, the first (and still virtually only) Republican senator to truly call out Trump’s postelection actions for what they really were: “overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election.”
I am talking about U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann, a registered Republican, who dismissed Trump’s allegations that Republican voters in Pennsylvania had been illegally disadvantaged because some counties permitted voters to cure administrative errors on their mail ballots.
As The Washington Post reported, Brann scathingly wrote on Saturday “that Trump’s attorneys had haphazardly stitched this allegation together ‘like Frankenstein’s Monster’ in an attempt to avoid unfavorable legal precedent.”
And I am talking about all the other election verification commissioners who did the hard right things in tossing out Trump’s fraudulent claims of fraud.
Asking for recounts in close elections was perfectly legitimate. But when that failed to produce any significant change in the results, Trump took us to a new dark depth. He pushed utterly bogus claims of voting irregularities and then tried to get Republican state legislatures to simply ignore the popular vote totals and appoint their own pro-Trump electors before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14.
That shifted this postelection struggle from Trump versus Biden — and who had the most votes — to Trump versus the Constitution — and who had the raw power and will to defend it or ignore it.
To all of these people who chose to do the hard right thing and defend the Constitution and the rule of law over their party’s interest or personal gain, may you have a blessed Thanksgiving.
You stand in stark contrast to Bill Barr, Mike Pompeo (who apparently never attended chapel at West Point), Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Nikki Haley, Kayleigh McEnany and all the other GOP senators and House members, who put their party and self-interest before their country and opted for the easy wrongs. History will remember them, too.
Though Trump is now grudgingly letting the presidential transition proceed, we must never, ever, forget the damage he and his allies inflicted on American democracy by attacking its very core — our ability to hold free and fair elections and transfer power peacefully. Tens of millions of Americans now believe something that is untrue — that our system is rigged. Who knows what that will mean in the long run?
The depths to which Trump and his legal team sank was manifested last Thursday when Giuliani and Sidney Powell held a news conference alleging, among other things, that software used to disadvantage Trump voters was created at the direction of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. It was insane.
As Jonah Goldberg, a conservative critic of Trumpism, wrote in thedispatch.com: “The GOP’s social media account spewed sound bites from Powell and Giuliani out into the country like a fire hose attached to a sewage tank.” Fox carried the whole news conference live — uninterrupted — for virtually its entire 90 minutes.
Shame on all these people.
Sure, now Trump and many of his enablers are finally bowing to reality — but it is not because they’ve developed integrity. It is because they WERE STOPPED by all those people who had integrity and did the hard right things.
And “shame” is the right word for these people, because a sense of shame was lost these past four years and it needs to be reestablished. Otherwise, what Trump and all his sycophants did gets normalized and permanently erodes confidence in our elections. That is how democracies die.
You can only hope that once they are out of power, Barr, Pompeo, Giuliani and all their compatriots will be stopped on the streets, in restaurants or at conferences and politely but firmly asked by everyday Americans: “How could you have stayed all-in when Trump was violating the deepest norms that bind us as a democracy?”
And if they are deaf to the message being sent from their fellow citizens, then let’s hope some will have to face an interrogation from their own children at the Thanksgiving table this year:
“Mom, Dad — did you really side with Trump when it was Trump versus the Constitution?”

Copenhagen Offers Ceramics That Are as Appealing as Its Cuisine

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Copenhagen, Denmark, remains one of the world’s most exciting food destinations, where innovative restaurants demand tableware as impressive as the cuisine. So, naturally, the Danish capital is now also one of the best places to shop for handmade ceramics.
In keeping with the guiding tenets of Danish design — functionalism and high-quality craftsmanship — today’s ceramists are producing pieces as useful as they are attractive, employing creative glazes, unusual shapes and playful color combinations. Shoppers today will find pieces suited to every purpose and style, whether it’s a sculptural statement vase or an everyday coffee mug to brighten dark winter mornings.
A great first stop for one-of-a-kind pieces is MK Studio, the airy workshop of ceramist Magdalena Kaluzna-Wlodarek, which doubles as a shop stocked with a dazzling array of cups and serving dishes. Depending on what Kaluzna-Wlodarek has recently made in the adjoining studio, you might find small pitchers splashed in emerald green hues (350 Danish kroner, about $57), dinner plates with bubbly blue patterns (from 400 kroner), or cheerful cups with wavy swirls of turquoise and orange (260 kroner).
Kaluzna-Wlodarek got her start making coffee cups for a barista friend who was competing in the 2016 World Brewers Cup.
The simple cup design from that experience remains a bestseller, to which she now applies various creative treatments (180-270 kroner). One small mug, with a swirling blend of honeydew and robin’s-egg-blue porcelain, glossy on the inside and matte on the outside, is as pleasing to look at as it is to hold. Kaluzna-Wlodarek considers it all functional art.
“Texture on the outside is very important for me,” she said. “It’s the whole feeling of drinking coffee in the morning and enjoying the cup you’re drinking from.”
MK Studio also supplies some of the city’s top restaurants. A few years ago, chef Kristian Baumann asked Kaluzna-Wlodarek to make plates for 108, the first sister restaurant of Noma, René Redzepi’s influential fine-dining establishment. (108 has since closed permanently because of the pandemic.)
“After that, a lot of other places asked me about ceramics,” Kaluzna-Wlodarek said, rattling off a client list that included Michelin-starred Relae, Manfreds and the Coffee Collective. (Relae will also close for good next month.) When Lisa Lov, a former sous-chef at Relae, opened her own restaurant, Tigermom, in 2018, she, too, went directly to MK Studio.
“The type of food that we do here is quite rustic in form,” Lov said of her lively, Asian-inspired restaurant. “So I knew that the plates had to look amazing.”
One of the many dishes Kaluzna-Wlodarek custom-designed for Tigermom was a special family-style rice bowl. Like everything on the table, “it needed to be bright and bold and colorful,” Lov said. Now that striking black-and-orange lidded bowl is a Tigermom signature.
Shopping for more elegant pieces? Head to the studio Keramiker Inge Vincents in the Norrebro district. In this small shop, the delicate white vases and bowls are made of porcelain so thin that they’re nearly transparent. Often twisted or crinkled, many of ceramist Inge Vincents’ pieces resemble rumpled paper bags (350 to 4,200 kroner).
Shoppers looking for more colorful design pieces may find their ideal souvenir at Wauw Design, ceramist Sussi Krull’s Osterbro studio and workshop, which is full of brightly hued oblong vases (from 400 kroner), flower pots (from 250 kroner) and serving bowls (from 230 kroner).
Those who prefer a more subdued aesthetic might want to try Tina Marie, a studio and shop in central Copenhagen, where you’ll find a variety of hand-thrown stoneware in neutral, earthy tones, from teapots and vases to lidded boxes and large bowls (most around 900 kroner).
If you’re looking for a breadth of styles in one place, add Yonobi to your list. The store specializes in handmade ceramics from independent artists around the world, but local ceramists are also well represented. Among the varied offerings, which range from 90 kroner to around 3,000 kroner, seek out quirky sculptures from Anne Lind Sorth and Katrine Bidstrup, hefty serving platters from Karin Blach Nielsen, unique vases from Annika Semler and Robynn Storgaard and adorable candy-colored ceramic straws from Frida Ceramics.
Given the current travel restrictions in place around the world, it’s worth noting that many of Copenhagen’s ceramists are selling on the internet as well. Certainly, the online experience can’t compare with shopping in a studio, where you can feel the texture of a bowl and chat with the artist who made it. But you can still look forward to the pleasure of placing fresh flowers in a new vase, pouring tea from a hand-thrown pot, or sipping coffee from a perfectly shaped cup.

Denmark introduced the world to hygge, the national pursuit of all things cozy and enjoyable. Something of a survival mechanism for Danes during the winter months, hygge (pronounced HOO-gah) often involves an abundance of candles, crackling fireplaces, comforting foods and the company of close friends.
In Sweden, where the winters are even longer, darker and drearier, the concept is called mys (pronounced mees) — or the adjectival mysigt. And although the terms are very similar, Swedish mys refers more pointedly to an ultra-cozy atmosphere.
“Hygge is much broader than mys,” said Malin Lindqvist, a Swedish fabric designer who moved to Denmark 7 1/2 years ago. The essence of mys is the feeling of warmth, like being wrapped in a woolen blanket amid lighted candles while sipping a steaming mug of tea with a purring cat on your lap.
The best city to stock up on mys-making supplies is Stockholm, and the highest density of small, aptly cozy, independent shops and boutiques can be found on the streets near Nytorget, a square on the southern island of Sodermalm, far from the city’s bustling central shopping district.
A good starting point is Tambur, a boutique filled with things to make every home homier. Inside the two-room shop, the front room is styled like a kitchen and dining area, where woven baskets are strung from the ceiling above a rustic wooden table set with ceramic bowls and platters perfect for serving hearty pasta meals. The backroom is filled with piles of fluffy linen pillows, a soft beige couch, subdued lighting and plaid orange-and-gray blankets made with wool from sheep on the Swedish island of Gotland. It has the vibe of a very plush living room.
“The feeling I want people to get is that they’re coming home to me,” said the owner, Anders Widegren, while seated in the backroom. Among the many covetable items on display, two particularly mysigt picks were a copper oil lamp from the Swedish brand Klong (2,749 Swedish kronor, about $324) and a special cast-iron pan for making plattar, thin Swedish pancakes the size of a coaster often served as a cold-weather dinner in short stacks with butter and jam (529 kronor).
On a corner three blocks away, Esterior is an interior design studio and shop with a more eclectic, playful style. The spacious store is filled with a mix of midcentury vintage furnishings and lighting, fuzzy Moroccan rugs and piles of striped velvet cushions for cozying up a couch. For low-fi entertainment by candlelight on a wintry night, maybe pick up an elegant chess set or a classic backgammon board (450 kronor each).
Younger shoppers will find mys in their size at Beton, a serene children’s shop a 1 1/2 blocks away. This is the place to stock up on corduroy bonnets (170 kronor) and knee socks (65 kronor) in neutral earth tones. Instead of bright colors and plastic toys, the shelves are filled with wooden rattles, woolen overalls and soft leggings in muted hues from small, hard-to-find brands.
“To be unique in Stockholm is important,” said the owner, Petra Gardefjord, who earned a following selling hand-sewn leather moccasins that she taught herself to make for her own children.
Today, the shop, which in October moved to a larger location on the same block, stocks a variety of tiny moccasins (now produced in Estonia; 460 kronor per pair), as well as woven baby baskets, picture books, pacifiers and a unisex clothing line, called Façade, founded by Gardefjord and Ulrika Nihlén.
Right next door to Beton, confectionary shop Parlans Konfektyr feels like a tiny 1950s tearoom, with its vintage love seat, teak side tables and dark wood-paneled walls. Watch as workers, often adorably dressed in retro outfits, make candies in the adjacent workshop. Then stock up on sweets, especially buttery caramels in seasonal flavors like saffron, cardamom and cinnamon-apple (120 kronor for 15).
A short walk away, a nondescript doorway leads into the modest showroom of Carina Seth Andersson, one of Sweden’s leading designers of ceramics and glass objects. This is the place to nab hand-thrown teapots and rare exhibition pieces (most between 500 kronor and 4,000 kronor). In addition to Andersson’s popular Urna, Ming and Pallo vases in sizes small to extra-large, you may also find collectible works from other notable Swedish designers, like Signe Persson-Melin’s cork-handled glass teapot.
Around the corner is another showroom, Manos, which doubles as the workshop of ceramist Karin Eriksson. Here you’ll find ceramic oil burners and essential oils, porcelain candleholders for tea lights, handmade bowls and glazed mugs for coffee or tea (from around 250 kronor).
But if you buy only one thing to up the mys-factor at home, it must be a candle. Ask Swedes what they associate with mys, and the first thing that comes up is candlelight. As the daylight hours dwindle, it becomes a necessity to find new sources of warmth and light. And sure, basic votives from Ikea will do fine. But there’s a case to be made for splurging on hand-dipped candles from Sthlm Ljusstoperi, where slender tapers come in various colors, shapes and sizes (four-packs from 95 kronor).
On the edge of the neighborhood, a short walk east, the large workshop has an on-site shop where crates are filled with colorful candles — in pale pink, lilac, rich reds and greens. The shop also stocks hand-dipped three-armed candles, a typical Swedish style often used on special occasions and during Advent.
Those looking for a spot to rest — and one last dose of mys — should make a final stop at Vina, a wine bar a block from Nytorget with one of the coziest atmospheres in the neighborhood.
Step inside from the cold to the homey space, where tables are topped with flickering candles, and the mismatched vintage décor encourages lingering over a glass of wine or two, perhaps a small plate of charcuterie and cheese, or a warming bowl of saffron-scented fish stew. Outside, it might be dark and drizzling, or clear and cold, but inside, it’s nothing but mys.

SAN FRANCISCO — One by one, they left. Some quit. Others were fired. All were Black.
The 15 people worked at Coinbase, the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency startup, where they represented roughly three-quarters of the Black employees at the 600-person company. Before leaving in late 2018 and early 2019, at least 11 of them informed the human resources department or their managers about what they said was racist or discriminatory treatment, five people with knowledge of the situation said.
One of the employees was Alysa Butler, 25, who worked in recruiting. During her time at Coinbase, she said, she told her manager several times about how he and others excluded her from meetings and conversations, making her feel invisible. “Most people of color working in tech know that there’s a diversity problem,” said Butler, who resigned in April 2019. “But I’ve never experienced anything like Coinbase.”
In Silicon Valley, where entrepreneurs and investors often preach high-minded missions and style themselves as management gurus, Coinbase has held itself up as a model. Since the startup was founded in 2012, Brian Armstrong, the chief executive, has assembled memos and blog posts about how he built the $8 billion company’s culture with distinct hiring and training practices. That has won him acclaim among influential venture capitalists and executives.
But according to 23 current and former Coinbase employees, five of whom spoke on the record, as well as internal documents and recordings of conversations, the startup has long struggled with its management of Black employees.
One Black employee said her manager suggested in front of colleagues that she was dealing drugs and carrying a gun, trading on racist stereotypes. Another said a co-worker at a recruiting meeting broadly described Black employees as less capable. Still another said that managers spoke down to her and her Black colleagues, adding that they were passed over for promotions in favor of less experienced white employees. The accumulation of incidents, they said, led to the wave of departures.
“It was the first time I realized what racism felt like in the modern world,” said Layllen Sawyerr, a compliance analyst who is Black. “I felt like I was being bullied every day at work.” She said she filed a discrimination complaint with Coinbase’s legal department before quitting in 2018.
Kim Milosevich, a Coinbase spokeswoman, said the company “does not tolerate racial, gender or any other forms of discrimination.” She added, “All claims of discrimination are treated very seriously, investigated by both internal and third parties, and the appropriate action is taken.”
Milosevich said Coinbase had a record of only three official complaints from the 2018-19 period and none from Butler. Milosevich said the three complaints, including Sawyerr’s, were investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. Butler said she was not told how to make an official complaint; Sawyerr said she never spoke to an investigator and was not informed of the findings.
On Wednesday, before publication of this article, Emilie Choi, Coinbase’s chief operating officer, wrote an email to employees to preemptively question the article’s accuracy and said, “We know the story will recount episodes that will be difficult for employees to read.” The company posted the email to its public blog.
Tech companies have long struggled to hire and support Black employees and entrepreneurs. Just 1% of venture-backed companies were led by Black entrepreneurs from 2013 to 2018, according to a study by RateMyInvestor, which analyzes tech investors. Large tech companies like Intel, Google and Facebook have publicly said that they need to do better on diversity and have committed to improvements, although progress has been uneven.
But even in this environment, Coinbase stands out, said the current and former employees, some of whom requested anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements or feared retaliation. Three percent of the company’s employees are Black, which is less than half the average in most of the tech industry, as reported last year by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Coinbase’s percentage has also stayed flat in recent years while companies such as Square, PayPal and Twitter have modestly increased their share of Black employees.
“If the numbers haven’t changed, it’s definitely because there wasn’t a real intention to do so,” Cleve Mesidor, founder of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, said of Coinbase. She’s worked with it to hold events in the Black engineering community. “We know now that Brian Armstrong was never committed to this.”
The tensions at Coinbase came to a head in June after the police killing of George Floyd. As many tech leaders publicly voiced support for Black Lives Matter protests, Black employees at Coinbase said on the Slack messaging platform that they were hurt by the silence of Armstrong and other executives about the matter. They organized a meeting where several of them told executives, often through tears, about their difficult experiences at the company, eight people who attended said.
The next day, Armstrong, 37, summarized the tone of what he had heard. “There was just this outpouring of, like, Why does the company not have my back?” he said at a staff meeting, according to a recording of the session shared with The New York Times. In a company email he sent later, which was also shared with The Times, he agreed to revamp the diversity-and-inclusion plan and increase mentoring.
But in September, Armstrong published a public blog post telling employees to leave concerns for issues like racial justice at the door. He said that while the company embraced diversity, the staff needed to focus on Coinbase’s mission of profit and advancing cryptocurrencies. They should resign if they disagreed, he said. “We don’t engage here when issues are unrelated to our core mission,” Armstrong wrote.
The post drew immediate blowback from employees. “Why stay and put effort into this work if it’s just tokenized into recruiting points and not actually improving the sense of belonging and psychological safety,” Lauren Lee, who was responsible for diversity and inclusion, wrote in a Slack message that was viewed by The Times.
Lee, who did not respond to requests for comment, resigned last month. So have at least 60 others.
The ‘Right Brain’
Armstrong, a former Airbnb engineer, and Fred Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs trader, founded Coinbase eight years ago to provide a place to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. They built the startup into a cryptocurrency leader, making money by taking fees on trades placed by its customers. (Ehrsam left day-to-day operations in 2017.)
Today, Coinbase is riding a new wave of interest in cryptocurrencies, with the value of virtual currency Bitcoin approaching a new high as investors increasingly treat it like an alternative to gold.
Much of Coinbase’s culture stems from the one around Bitcoin, current and former employees said. Bitcoin, which embodies a libertarian philosophy that snubs its nose at the pieties of mainstream institutions, has attracted a generation of fans known as “crypto bros.” Many have propagated a brash male-dominated way of life, facing criticism for sowing racism and sexism.
At Coinbase, Armstrong, who eschewed some of Bitcoin’s most renegade elements, began building what he called an “all star” culture, with mostly young white and Asian men. In one 2018 post on “36 Ways to Hire, Develop and Retain Great People,” he wrote about the importance of creating a “consistent culture” and the value of acting like an “all-star team” instead of a “family.”
“Players who don’t contribute or work as a team get cut,” he wrote.
Ruby Bhattacharya, a recruiter at Coinbase in 2017, said the search for employees for this “consistent culture” often meant looking for people who resembled the other staff members. Bhattacharya, who is gay and was born in Britain to Indian parents, said her colleagues made it clear she did not belong.
“I was told I don’t have the right brain for this,” she said. “It was constant condescension.”
As Coinbase grew, several female executives lobbied for more diversity, three former employees said. The company had brought on about a dozen Black employees by the beginning of 2018, when it had a staff of around 300.
One of those hires was Katherine Johnson, who led the compliance department. She helped recruit seven more people of color, said Sawyerr, who was among those who joined.
But Sawyerr and others said they soon felt as though they were being treated differently. On days when reporters or photographers came in, they said, they were told to be present so they could be in the photos to display the company’s diversity. But in meetings, they were talked down to and ignored. By mid-2018, some said they had started talking to human resources and their managers about the behavior.
When Coinbase announced it would be opening an office in Portland, Oregon, several Black employees in the compliance department who worked remotely were told to move there or reapply for new jobs, four former employees said. The company said it wanted the whole team in one place, but current and former employees said the one white employee in the department was allowed to continue working remotely.
Milosevich said the white employee lived in Philadelphia and was allowed to commute to and work from the company’s New York office. She said that all of the workers were offered relocation packages and that some who declined to move received severance.
All of the Black workers in the compliance division ended up among the group of 15 who left. Johnson, who was described as a supportive manager, declined to comment. She left Coinbase last year.
In mid-2018, Coinbase hired Tariq Meyers, who had worked on inclusion efforts at ride-hailing company Lyft, to lead a diversity push. Ciceli Johnson-Porter, who worked on Coinbase’s legal team, said she had approached Meyers several times to discuss the way her managers repeatedly diminished her and favored her white colleagues. She said he tried to help but was not empowered to change anything.
“He knew he was there to put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” she said. Meyers, who left Coinbase in June, declined to comment.
Johnson-Porter, who resigned last year, said Coinbase often turned its scrutiny on the person who complained. After she spoke up, she said, her boss started taking issue with her work. “Those of us who were vocal about the unfair treatment — they either pushed you out or created an issue that wasn’t an issue to force you out,” she said.
Milosevich said the company investigated Johnson-Porter’s claims and found “no evidence of unfairness or wrongdoing.”
Early last year, some workers brought the exodus of Black employees to the attention of Armstrong and asked him to step in, three people briefed on the situation said. He listened and said he would think about it but took no action, they said.
Armstrong rarely spoke or made decisions in meetings, the current and former employees said, leaving them uncertain about his opinions. In a staff meeting this summer, he said he knew his style made many employees uncomfortable and attributed it to being “on the spectrum,” according to a recording of the event.
Sawyerr said she had talked with four other Black employees about bringing a discrimination lawsuit against Coinbase, but the others backed out after being offered hefty severance payments in exchange for confidentiality agreements.
By the end of 2019, 31 of Coinbase’s 1,000 employees were Black. That proportion has remained unchanged.
‘Hasn’t Learned Anything’
When Armstrong wrote his blog post in September asking employees to leave their outside interests at the door, he was celebrated and praised by several tech investors.
Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures, and one of the nine members of Coinbase’s board, said that many tech chief executives “would like to have done what Brian did” to reduce the distractions that come from employee activism. David Sacks, a PayPal founder, said Armstrong’s post was “how you build a movement and change the world.”
But internally, Armstrong’s post led to another exodus. Besides Lee, another employee who left in October was John Russ, the head of marketing and the company’s highest-ranking Black employee, who had been hired three months earlier. In a brief phone interview, Russ said only that he disagreed with Armstrong’s new position and left as a result.
On Oct. 8, Armstrong wrote in a letter to employees that 60 people had left Coinbase. He said he took solace in how many Black employees had chosen to stay.
In response, one Black employee wrote on Slack that her continued employment should not be “reassuring.” She said that she and many other Black employees were in low-ranking support positions and that it was hard to leave at a moment of high unemployment during the pandemic, according to a copy of the message seen by The Times. The post received a black heart emoji from 153 other employees.
Milosevich said Coinbase hired a consultant over the summer who did interviews, looked at the company’s history and found “no evidence of structural bias.”
“Employees reported a strong culture, fair employee treatment, high employee satisfaction and high energy for belonging, inclusion and diversity,” she said.
Managers in the customer support team, where many of the Black employees work, wrote their own report last month. It concluded that Coinbase’s executive team “hasn’t learned anything from the amount of time and labor put into listening sessions or the vulnerability expressed by Black employees,” according to a copy reviewed by The Times.
The report was presented to executives, two people with knowledge of the situation said. The executives, they said, have not acted on its recommendations.

Could you name the postmaster general before this year? I couldn’t.
It’s a position that, like Emily W. Murphy’s role at the General Services Administration, enjoyed relative obscurity — until our democracy suddenly seemed to depend on it. Which is why Louis DeJoy, a Trump campaign megadonor who took up the postmaster general job in June, became a household name when his changes to the Postal Service threatened to endanger the unprecedented demand for mail-in ballots this election season.
The post’s integral role in the election was fitting this year, when mail has been unusually indispensable. Homebound by the pandemic, so many of us have turned to deliveries to get by. Strangers exchanged old-fashioned letters through writer Rachel Syme’s PenPalooza program; restaurants repurposed themselves as meal kit suppliers; the package room in my apartment building has been filled with shipments as surprising as a greenhouse, a room-spanning rug and a pallet of paper towels.
If you can mail all those, why not opera?
It turns out all you need is an envelope. Three of them, sharing a slim box, arrived at my door recently. Together they were On Site Opera’s first production by mail, “The Beauty That Still Remains: Diaries in Song.”
Each of the three actually encloses a song cycle: Janacek’s “The Diary of One Who Disappeared” (1921), Dominick Argento’s “From the Diary of Virginia Woolf” (1974) and Juliana Hall’s “A World Turned Upside Down” (2016). But their packaging elevates them to something more like a real opera. The envelopes unfold to reveal, in side flaps, the standard program notes and artist biographies. In the center, though, are diary facsimiles with ephemera like family photos and dried flowers. The books and the music, experienced together, play off each other for an immersive and tactile drama.
These performances move at whatever pace you’d like. The Janacek is available now, and the Argento and Hall are coming, respectively, at the end of November and in mid-December. Each envelope contains a QR code and URL to the audio, which was recorded at Merkin Concert Hall in October and is streaming until March 1. (Another online component is a series of virtual panel discussions, starting Tuesday.)
Sitting on the floor of my living room with the packages open around me, I took them in all at once, following the order of their release. So I reached first for “The Diary of One Who Disappeared,” which had been made to look like a leather-bound journal tied shut with laces. Inside, a vellum sheet with a typed note was clipped to the first page; it said that in a Moravian village, a young man, Janicku, had vanished mysteriously and that this diary was found several days later.
The reason for his disappearance — the subject of Janacek’s burning song cycle about Janicku’s forbidden, obsessive love for a Romani woman named Zefka — is recounted in the pages that follow, the text rendered as diary entries accompanied by doodles primed for psychoanalysis. His handwriting is sometimes lowercased and sometimes capitalized, but always anguished.
As Janicku, tenor Bernard Holcomb sings Janacek’s lines — which resonate like natural speech patterns, punctuated by operatic outbursts — with near-constant pleading, a contrast to the lush and alluring command of Zefka, here mezzo-soprano Vanessa Cariddi. (An ethereal trio of sopranos, Chantal Freeman, Temple Hammen and Stephanie Perez, haunt the piece; the piano part, as in the other two song cycles, is nimbly played by Howard Watkins, an assistant conductor with the Metropolitan Opera.)
While listening to Janicku’s tale, in a poetic English translation by Bernard Keefe, you can pore over his diary — created by the director, Eric Einhorn, and graphic designer Stephanie Reyer — and study it, as if you’re investigating his disappearance. You can obsess over the small photo of a woman with an intense, avian stare. And, in the blank final pages, you can contribute as well; there are prompts, such as “What did falling in love for the first time feel like?” and “Describe the craziest thing you ever did for love.”
The beginning of the next song cycle, “From the Diary of Virginia Woolf,” contains a similar prompt, a question from Woolf to herself: “What sort of diary should I like mine to be?”
As if to answer, the eight movements explore a variety of options, their versatility matched by the singing of Cariddi, again. (The text in the book mimics Woolf’s journals, with dense cursive on the right pages, and the left ones kept for miscellany like math and verb conjugations.) In the unexpectedly touching and lyrical “Fancy,” she reflects on the possibilities of style. Accompanied by shimmering piano, she paints a prose portrait in “Rome, May 1935.” And in “Last Entry, March 1944,” she perhaps arrives at an answer to her initial question: “I mark Henry James’s sentence: Observe perpetually.” The word “observe” is repeated, considered from different angles, internalized. By the end, the production is asking us to do the same, instructing, “Catch it all.”
Hall’s “A World Turned Upside Down” takes its title from the diary of Anne Frank, its patterned-fabric cover and scrapbook spirit replicated here, with the libretto’s English text interspersed throughout. These seven songs, for soprano (Cristina María Castro) and piano, are deferential to the surface emotions and ideas of Frank’s writing, to the point of literal-mindedness. Effervescent music accompanies notes on her birthday; dissonance, jittery trills and suspenseful pauses are an obvious analogue for an entry about footsteps in the night.
After the final section, I closed the diary and grabbed its envelope. A portrait of Anne Frank fell out from between the pages. I held it in my hands, giving another look at her hopeful smile and thinking about the lilting song in which she shares her greatest wish: to be a writer. The words held their own power; so did the music. With this small photo, both took flight.

TOKYO — Walking on an autumn Saturday through Ueno Park, one of this city’s most popular attractions, novelist Yu Miri was stunned by how beautified the grounds seemed since her last visit several years earlier.
Pointing to a grove of trees where people were picnicking at a social distance, she recalled how the homeless used to congregate on the lawn in cardboard shelters covered in blue tarps.
That was the setting she re-created in her novel “Tokyo Ueno Station,” which won the National Book Award for translated literature last week. Its narrator is a dead construction worker whose spirit loiters around these camps, where he and others who had fallen down the socioeconomic ladder spent their final living years.
“Japan is so clean, and there is also this clean image,” Yu said. “But there is also this feeling of not letting people see dirty or ‘unacceptable’ things.” As a society, she added, Japan “pushes out the things that they don’t want others to see into hiding.”
In “Tokyo Ueno Station,” which Riverhead published in the United States in June, she uncovers that hidden world. Drawing on interviews with people she met in the park, she captures details like the man who sleeps with a “large translucent bag of scavenged aluminum cans tucked between his legs” or the cardboard shanty where the garments hanging on a “bamboo broomstick protruding from the hut were women’s underwear.”
In the delicate ecosystem of the homeless, the narrator, Kazu, explains how convenience stores leave expired food near dumpsters so that “if we went before the trash was collected, we could claim anything we wanted.” A friend uses his meager money to buy tuna and kibble for a cat he has adopted, even before he buys food for himself.
Bringing these often-veiled people to life is “the reason I am a writer,” Yu, 52, said. “I’m kind of like a parabola antenna, so that I can magnify the small voices of people who aren’t often heard.”
According to Japanese government data, the number of homeless people around the country has dropped from more than 25,000 in 2003 to about 4,500 now. But some private researchers suggest the current numbers are higher. Local media reported that the Tokyo government pushed many of them out of Ueno Park and other tourist attractions to prepare for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, now postponed until 2021, though officials deny they were displaced.
Yu based details in “Tokyo Ueno Station,” first published in Japan in 2014, on conversations with homeless people she met in the park starting more than a decade ago. Kazu, a migrant worker from Fukushima, where the 2011 earthquake and tsunami triggered a nuclear meltdown and subsequent mass evacuations, sprang from a series of 600 conversations that Yu conducted for a local radio program after the disaster.
Laura Perciasepe, a senior editor at Riverhead, said she appreciated how Yu wove together social criticism with a harrowing individual portrait. “The book is an indictment of capitalism, and an elegy to those it leaves behind,” Perciasepe wrote in an email. “But the novel is also quite personal and intimate, about a family and this man.”
Yu’s own connection to Fukushima, where she moved in 2015, runs deep. Her mother, a refugee from the Korean War who fled to Japan from South Korea in a small boat, landed in a village in Fukushima that was eventually flooded by a dam that served as a source of hydropower for Tokyo.
Morgan Giles, who translated “Tokyo Ueno Station” into English, said she was initially drawn to the novel because she had been reading other works about the Fukushima disaster. But Yu’s story, she said, “resonated much more globally. So many people are living in regions stripped of their resources and people and forgotten for that sacrifice.”
Yu is the eldest of four children. Her father, also the son of Korean immigrants, worked at a pachinko gambling parlor and was often abusive, she said, spending most of his income betting on horses or playing poker. Her mother supported the family as a hostess at a cabaret club in Yokohama, Japan’s second-largest city. A younger brother was violent — he once took a baseball bat to the windows of the house, drawing the police — and her parents divorced when Yu was a child.
As an ethnic Korean — known in Japan as Zainichi — from a poor family, she was bullied in school. Classmates called her a “germ” and would refuse to eat lunch when it was her turn to serve the food. She recalls that a teacher, apparently offended by her shyness, demanded to know: “Can’t you speak Japanese?”
Literature became a refuge, particularly Edgar Allan Poe, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, William Faulkner and Truman Capote. “Books were the escape room for my soul,” Yu said, and she often used them to conceal her face from classmates.
Because of the discrimination and poverty she experienced, she identifies with the struggles of her fictional characters. “When I was a child, I didn’t belong anywhere,” she said. “So I feel like that’s what I am writing about when I write about homeless people or people on the edge of society.”
Deborah Smith, founder of Tilted Axis, a nonprofit publisher that translates Asian writers into English and originally published “Tokyo Ueno Station” in Britain, said Yu writes about those “who are not part of any kind of officially projected image” of Japan.
“She writes about their lives, not only with force and anger and realism, but also with great beauty and quite experimentally,” said Smith, herself a translator of Korean writers.
When Yu was 14, she ran away to Atami, a seaside town south of Tokyo, where she intended to drown herself. When that attempt failed, she started climbing a fence to get to the top of a building from which she planned to jump.
A janitor came to her aid and took her home to his wife, who served her dinner. She has never forgotten the couple’s kindness or the fresh lychee they served for dessert.
“That was the first time I had ever had that fruit, and it was so delicious and cold,” Yu recalled. The taste, she said, somehow jolted her into giving the couple her father’s phone number, so they could call him to come pick her up.
But her depression persisted, and she tried several more times to kill herself. She left home for good when she was 16, after waking up one night to find her mother hovering over her with a knife, and wound up in a theater group in Tokyo. (She said she and her mother have yet to mend their relationship.)
Yu moved in with one of the directors, who was then 39. They started a romantic relationship, an arrangement that she acknowledges, “under current law, was illegal.” But he encouraged her creative talent, and she started writing plays, one of which won a prize and attracted the attention of editors who urged her to write a novel.
When an excerpt from her autobiographical first novel appeared in a magazine, the woman who was the basis of a central character sued Yu for violation of privacy and defamation, and a court stopped that novel from ever being published in full. Her first published novel, “Full House,” however, won a prize for debut fiction when Yu was 26.
“Since then I have written every day,” she said. “It’s just how I live. Life itself is writing.”
Her only other novel translated into English, “Gold Rush,” depicts a nihilistic society in which a 14-year-old heir to a pachinko parlor resorts to violence. Yu based it in part on a real teenager who had killed several people and on the pachinko world in which she grew up. She is now working on a sequel to “Gold Rush” while Giles translates another of her autobiographical novels, “The End of August.”
In addition to writing, Yu has opened a bookstore in Minami Soma, one of the Fukushima villages that was evacuated after the nuclear disaster, where she now lives. She wanted to offer returning residents and students a safe place to connect with others in the community, although the pandemic currently curtails activity at the shop.
Accepting the National Book Award, she thanked the people of her new home. “I would like to share this joy with the people of Minami Soma, who are on a path of hardship after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster,” she said by video. “This is for you.”

EPA’s Final Deregulatory Rush Runs Into Open Staff Resistance

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency was rushing to complete one of its last regulatory priorities, aiming to obstruct the creation of air- and water-pollution controls far into the future, when a senior career scientist moved to hobble it.
Thomas Sinks directed the EPA’s science advisory office and later managed the agency’s rules and data around research that involved people. Before his retirement in September, he decided to issue a blistering official opinion that the pending rule — which would require the agency to ignore or downgrade any medical research that does not expose its raw data — will compromise American public health.
“If this rule were to be finalized it would create chaos,” Sinks said in an interview in which he acknowledged writing the opinion that had been obtained by The New York Times. “I thought this was going to lead to a train crash and that I needed to speak up.”
With two months left of the Trump administration, career EPA employees find themselves where they began, in a bureaucratic battle with the agency’s political leaders. But now, with the Biden administration on the horizon, they are emboldened to stymie Trump’s goals and to do so more openly.
The filing of a “dissenting scientific opinion” is an unusual move; it signals that Andrew Wheeler, the administrator of the EPA, and his politically appointed deputies did not listen to the objections of career scientists in developing the regulation. More critically, by entering the critique as part of the official Trump administration record on the new rule, Sinks' dissent will offer Joe Biden’s EPA administrator a powerful weapon to repeal the so-called “secret science” policy.
EPA career employees this month also quietly emailed out the results of a new study concluding that the owners of half a million diesel pickup trucks had illegally removed their emissions control technology, leading to huge increases in air pollution. And some senior EPA staff members have engaged in back-channel conversations with the president-elect’s transition team as they waited for Trump to formally approve the official start of the presidential transition, two agency employees acknowledged.
Current and former EPA staff and advisers close to the transition said Biden’s team has focused on preparing a rapid assault on the Trump administration’s deregulatory legacy and reestablishing air and water protections and methane emissions controls.
“They are focused like a laser on what I call the ‘Humpty Dumpty approach,’ which is putting the agency back together again,” said Judith Enck, a former EPA regional administrator who served in the Obama administration.
The transition team is particularly focused on renewing efforts to tackle climate change, which had been crushed by the Trump administration and mocked by Wheeler as little more than “virtue signaling" to foreign countries. There also are plans to revamp scientific advisory boards that Wheeler and his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, had stacked with allies of private industry and purged of many academic scientists.
“They seem hyper-focused on what it’s going to take to get things back on track,” said Chris Zarba, former director of the EPA’s science advisory board, adding, “I think they’re going to do a full reset.”
Racing against those efforts is Wheeler, who has a long list of priorities that aides and confidants said he is determined to complete before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. He has also maneuvered legally to erect time-consuming hurdles that Biden will have to clear to unwind some Trump administration policies.
At the top of Wheeler’s to-do list is finalizing the science rule, officially called “Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science.”
Under it, the agency would have to dismiss or give less weight to scientific studies that fail to release all their raw data to the public. Wheeler says the rule’s opponents prefer that regulatory decisions be made in “a back room, a proverbial smoke filled room.”
But thousands of medical and scientific organizations say the plan would cripple the EPA’s ability to create new air and water protections because people who participate in epidemiological or long-term health studies that examine exposure to toxins typically take part only if their personal health information is kept private.
The EPA under Wheeler has argued that it can create data protections to secure personal information like home addresses and medical records. But Sinks, who was the only agency scientist who worked to establish that data security, said the agency lacks the technical expertise and funding to succeed.
“Human subjects research is the most predictive data for establishing the human health impact from environmental exposures,” Sinks wrote, adding, “Any rule or guidance that diminishes or removes high quality research from consideration in rule making results in poorly developed rules.”
Thomas A. Burke, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who served as EPA science adviser in the Obama administration, expressed amazement at Sinks’ dissent.
“It speaks volumes about the failure of the process and the failure of the administration to listen not just to this one person but to the broader scientific leadership in the United States,” he said. Burke called the rule “a very thinly-veiled dream rule for polluters.”
James Hewitt, a spokesman for the EPA, said in a statement that Sinks’ objections were “irrelevant.” He accused Sinks, without presenting evidence, of failing to follow agency “protocol for raising concerns” and also said Sinks did not read the most recent draft of the rule before filing his dissent. Hewitt also did not explain why such a high-ranking career scientist was not provided the final draft of the rule.
“The purpose of the science transparency rule is to codify internal procedural requirements for how the EPA will consider the availability of data that it relies upon in developing its final significant regulatory actions and influential scientific information,” Hewitt said.
Wheeler in these final months also sidestepped a promise he made to the EPA inspector general to address accusations from more than 250 employees about political interference with science under the Trump administration.
Wheeler had agreed to determine the reasons for the concerns about a culture of disregard for scientific integrity and “tone at the top” of the agency by Sept. 30. He did not.
Instead he issued a memo in November affirming the agency’s support for its 2012 scientific integrity policy. But even that document was watered down. The final version eliminated language that assured science would occur “without political interference, coercion of scientists or regard to risk management implications,” according to a document of track changes reviewed by The New York Times.
Hewitt in a statement said that memo did not affect the underlying scientific integrity policy.
Of Wheeler’s broader agenda over the next two months, he said, “EPA continues to advance this administration’s commitment to meaningful environmental progress while moving forward with our regulatory reform agenda.”
The EPA also is expected to finalize in the coming weeks a rule on industrial soot pollution, which is linked to respiratory diseases, including those caused by the coronavirus. The rule is expected to leave in place a 2012 standard on fine soot from smokestacks and tailpipes, known as PM 2.5, ignoring the EPA’s own scientists, who wrote last year that the existing rule contributes to about 45,000 deaths per year from respiratory diseases, and that tightening it could save about 10,000 of those lives.
In April, a study published by researchers at Harvard linked long-term soot exposure and COVID-19 death rates. The study found that a person living for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate matter is 15% more likely to die from the coronavirus than someone in a region with one unit less of the fine particulate pollution.
And last month, the agency finalized a rule that creates a lengthy new legal process to overturn or withdraw certain policy directives known as “guidance documents,” which give federal agencies direction on the specifics of how to enforce laws.
Such guidance documents can give an administration some license to interpret laws in ways that advance their policy agenda. For example, the EPA during the Trump administration has published a guidance document that allows oil and gas companies to release flares from their wells for up to 15 minutes at a time before regulations apply — a process that releases methane, a powerful planet-warming greenhouse gas.
Another guidance document allows polluting entities with several adjacent polluting buildings on the same site, such as power plants and factories, to report the separate buildings as smaller individual pollution sources, rather than report the total pollution levels of the overall site. That could allow the polluters to avoid pollution control requirements that would be triggered by reporting the larger amount of pollution attributed to the larger site.
These types of documents are not legally binding, but they do stand as the official policy of a government agency until they are formally withdrawn or changed. Under the new guidance document rule, the EPA would have to formally issue a new regulation in order to withdraw the guidance — a lengthy legal process that can take months or even years, meaning that until it is complete, those Trump guidance documents will stand as the official policies of the Biden administration.
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard and a former adviser to the Obama administration, called the rule a “little IED,” referring to an improvised explosive device, or roadside bomb, aimed at slowing a Biden administration’s plans to overturn Trump’s rules.
“Shenanigans like these are what awaits the Biden team,” she said.

SEATTLE — Amazon has embarked on an extraordinary hiring binge this year, vacuuming up an average of 1,400 new workers a day and solidifying its power as online shopping becomes more entrenched in the coronavirus pandemic.
The hiring has taken place at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle, at its hundreds of warehouses in rural communities and suburbs, and in countries such as India and Italy. Amazon added 427,300 employees between January and October, pushing its workforce to more than 1.2 million people globally, up more than 50% from a year ago. Its number of workers now approaches the entire population of Dallas.
The spree has accelerated since the onset of the pandemic, which has turbocharged Amazon’s business and made it a winner of the crisis. Starting in July, the company brought on about 350,000 employees, or 2,800 a day. Most have been warehouse workers, but Amazon has also hired software engineers and hardware specialists to power enterprises such as cloud computing, streaming entertainment and devices, which have boomed in the pandemic.
The scale of hiring is even larger than it may seem because the numbers do not account for employee churn nor do they include the 100,000 temporary workers who have been recruited for the holiday shopping season. They also do not include what internal documents show as roughly 500,000 delivery drivers, who are contractors and not direct Amazon employees.
Such rapid growth is unrivaled in the history of corporate America. It far outstrips the 230,000 employees that Walmart, the largest private employer with more than 2.2 million workers, added in a single year two decades ago. The closest comparisons are the hiring that entire industries carried out in wartime, such as shipbuilding during the early years of World War II or homebuilding after soldiers returned, economists and corporate historians said.
“It’s hiring like mad,” Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said of Amazon. “No American company has hired so many workers so quickly.”
The pandemic is expected to further solidify Amazon’s dominance over holiday shopping, which got its formal start on Black Friday. The National Retail Federation is forecasting that overall online sales are expected to grow 30% over last year’s holiday season — a surge that will invariably benefit Amazon’s business.
Even for a company that regularly sets new superlatives, Amazon’s employee growth stands out as a stark illustration of its might. At this pace, it is on track to surpass Walmart within two years to become the world’s largest private employer.
Its expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe have sounded the alarm over tech power. This month, European Union regulators brought antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing it of unfairly using its size and access to data to harm smaller merchants in its marketplace. Amazon has said merchants are thriving on its site, with their share of sales growing in the pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining the company, with President-elect Joe Biden expected to continue scrutinizing the tech giants.
“We are turning into Amazon nation,” said Margaret O’Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington and a contributing New York Times opinion writer.
Having employees in nearly every state gives Amazon, which has warehouses around the country to be closer to customers, potentially outsize political leverage, O’Mara said. She added that history has shown there are risks when a region or country becomes too dependent on any one employer, although she said Amazon had not reached that point.
Amazon has portrayed its hiring as a boon for workers laid low by the pandemic-induced recession, as unemployment has soared and as restaurants, airlines and other businesses suffer.
“Offering jobs with industry-leading pay and great health care, including to entry-level and front-line employees, is even more meaningful in a time like this,” Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, said last month when the company reported blockbuster financial results.
Some government policies have helped Amazon’s recent growth. In March, a taxpayer-funded $2 trillion stimulus package allowed local governments to shut down traditional retail stores to reduce the spread of the virus. As the stores closed, demand for items through Amazon rose — and it hired.
Adding so many new workers so fast in a pandemic has been a herculean task. Many workers feared catching the coronavirus in warehouses, so Amazon rolled out a fleet of safety measures to address COVID-19. And it revved up its hiring machine, which relies on technology and traditional recruitment.
That includes promoting its training, benefits and pay. Of its 810,000 workers who are in the United States, about 85% are front-line employees in warehouses and operations who earn a minimum of $15 an hour. That is higher than traditional retail work, where an average sales worker makes $13.19 an hour, but lower than typical warehousing jobs. On Thursday, Amazon said it would pay bonuses of $300 for full-time employees and $150 for part-time employees.
To get the word out, Amazon used staffing agencies and advertised on television, billboards and in mailboxes by highlighting sign-on bonuses of up to $3,000 and its precautions against COVID-19. In one recent TV spot, an Amazon employee wearing a mask said, “Safety, safety, safety!”
In many places, the hiring has come easily because Amazon is one of the few employers with open jobs. In the week leading up to Sept. 16, which the company billed as “Career Day,” it received more than 384,000 job applications in the United States and Canada, or 38 a minute, Amazon said.
“It is happening in the context of an unprecedented loss of jobs elsewhere in the economy,” said Ellora Derenoncourt, an assistant professor at University of California, Berkeley, who has studied Amazon’s minimum wage.
Amazon is not the only beneficiary of how the pandemic has pushed people toward buying online instead of in stores. Walmart has added 180,000 employees in the United States since March, and its online sales rose 79% in the latest quarter. Target’s e-commerce sales soared 155%.
In that sense, this downturn has differed from past recessions, when usually all industries slowed, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. “This period has been partly about a recession but also about a pretty dramatic shift of economic activity from some sectors to others,” he said.
Just two years ago, Amazon’s workforce numbered fewer than 650,000 people. At the time, the company hit the brakes on hiring to focus more on profits. The hiring pace picked back up a year ago, after it introduced one-day shipping in the United States, an enormous effort that required more warehouses and more workers to pick, pack and sort packages.
When the coronavirus hit the United States in March, online shopping condensed years of expansion into a few months. From April to June, Amazon said, it sold 57% more items than a year earlier.
That spurred its first pandemic hiring wave of about 175,000 temporary workers. Many were hired to replace employees who had taken advantage of an unlimited unpaid time off policy at the outset of the pandemic. To attract new employees, Amazon offered workers an extra $2 an hour and increased overtime pay. It said the extra wages were not “hazard pay” but incentives.
Amazon had the hiring infrastructure in place to grow fast, said Ardine Williams, vice president for workforce development. As COVID-19 kept people like her elderly parents sheltering in place for safety, she said, consumers turned to e-commerce, accelerating the need to hire more.
“Some of that growth has clearly been planned,” she said. “I think that the head count ramp, though, has really been fueled by customer demand.”
Over the summer, Amazon converted most of the 175,000 temporary workers to permanent employees and ended the extra pay bumps for all workers. Since then, it has continued with waves of hiring.
The company has also almost tripled the number of U.S. warehouses used for last-mile deliveries this year, said Marc Wulfraat, founder of logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, who tracks Amazon’s operations. The delivery drivers are usually contractors, so Amazon does not disclose their numbers in regulatory filings.
“They have built their own UPS in the last several years,” Wulfraat said. “This pace of change has never been seen before.”
Williams said Amazon also built relationships with companies that were reducing staff, such as Uber, American Airlines and Marriott, to promote its hiring.
“We dedicated a group that did nothing but connect with organizations who were furloughing people, whether it was temporary or permanent,” she said. “That allowed us to take a skilled, quality workforce and very quickly and easily move them into opportunities that were appropriate at Amazon.”
The effort has been aided by 1,000 technology workers who create software for Amazon’s human resources teams, many building portals and algorithms that automate hiring, she said. Prospective employees can find jobs, apply and be hired entirely online, without talking to a single person.
To grow so much, Amazon also needs to think long term, Williams said. As a result, she said, the company was already working with preschools to establish the foundation of tech education so that “as our hiring demand unfolds over the next 10 years, that pipeline is there and ready.”

As a new season for college applications begins, the coronavirus has upended the process, forcing millions of students to learn remotely, canceling college tours and standardized testing dates, and preventing legions of students from participating in sports and other extracurricular activities.
High school seniors and those who guide them through the admissions process say the level of uncertainty and disruption is off the charts as the virus surges across the country, forcing many schools to shut down classrooms once again, putting more families in financial crisis and making weighty decisions about the future more fraught than ever.
“It’s all a balance, and I’m not really balanced right now,” said Lea Caldwell, 17, a Detroit student who is working part time as she wrestles with her senior year course load and her college applications.
Holly M. Markiecki-Bennetts, a guidance counselor at Caldwell’s school, Mercy High, in Farmington Hills, Michigan, said, “We’ve had to hold hands a lot more.”
It is unclear if all the tumult will make it easier or more challenging for students to get into the Class of 2025, especially at competitive universities. Will holdovers from this year, when freshman enrollment was down, increase competition for spots next fall? Or will fewer people ultimately apply, giving more students a shot at their dream schools?
Final application deadlines are still to come, but the data on early-decision applications this month showed a slightly smaller number of students applying to college, especially from low-income families, although those who did were trying their luck at more schools than usual.
That data comes from the Common Application, which is used by more than 900 U.S. colleges and universities to screen prospective students. This year, the application added an optional 250-word essay about the virus’s effect, to give students a chance to explain their circumstances without it having to take over the rest of their application.
“I think it’s going to help us provide context — how the crisis has impacted their schools and their families and their communities,” said Jeremiah Quinlan, Yale’s dean of undergraduate admissions.
The coronavirus has left Chad Hicks, 17, a senior at the Urban Assembly Maker Academy in New York, wishing he could get more in-person attention as he makes his college decisions and fills out applications.
“It would be so simple if my teacher could actually show me what to do,” he said.
His mother, a security guard, earned a high school equivalency diploma and took some community college classes, so she does not have the personal experience to give him the advice and guidance he needs, Hicks said. He visited Temple University while in middle school, and it is his top choice. He is still working on the application.
Although there is plenty of time — the regular application deadline at most colleges is Jan. 1 — admissions officers say they are hearing from many prospective students that they plan to wait as long as possible this year. The uncertainty concerns schools that hope a strong crop of applicants will help overcome falling undergraduate enrollment, down 4.4% this semester, and financial difficulties exacerbated by the pandemic.
“It is a severe disruption to our business.” said David Burge, vice president for enrollment management at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.
Low-income students and those who would be the first in their families to attend college appear to be particularly hesitant, experts said, reflecting the personal and economic effect of the virus. The number of high school seniors who have filled out a free application for federal student aid is down 16% from this time last year, and early applications from poor and first-generation students are down 10%.
Jenny Rickard, chief executive of the Common App, called the numbers, particularly for first-generation students, “bleak” and said the trend would be hard to reverse by January’s regular admissions deadline.
Other early indicators, though, showed that while some students might be slower than usual to apply, others are taking a chance with more schools — perhaps because they were unable to narrow their choices without campus visits and college fairs.
Through mid-November, the number of students who had submitted applications to colleges remained 4% below the same time last year, according to Common App data. But the overall number of applications had risen 3% over last year because the smaller pool of students applied to more schools.
Colleges that went test-optional — some 1,600, at last count — were, not surprisingly, the biggest beneficiaries of the higher volume.
Thousands of students who would usually take the SAT or ACT this year have been frustrated as local testing sites have closed because of virus outbreaks; 30% of the 312,000 students registered to take the SAT in November were unable to, a number that was similar to test dates earlier in the fall.
Cole Strachan, 18, a student at academically selective Boston Latin, studied to take the SAT this spring, only to have test dates canceled in March and April. He was finally able to take the exam in September but did not receive his scores by Nov. 1, the early-decision deadline. So he sent his application materials in without exam results — to seven colleges.
“I think if I were able to visit the schools, it might have changed my list,” he said.
Institutions that usually take test scores into account will have to find other ways to evaluate test-free applications like Strachan’s. At Yale, admissions officers will take a closer look at elements like teacher recommendations, high school transcripts and student writing, including the personal essay, said Quinlan, the admissions dean.
That aspect also gave Strachan difficulties: What to write about, and how to stand out? With his soccer and lacrosse seasons canceled, along with other extracurricular activities, he filled the time by starting a group called A Helping Elbow with friends and classmates to deliver groceries to older people or those with compromised immune systems.
As the organization grew, the students started sewing hundreds of face masks. The experience became a dominant part of his college application.
Just as students have struggled with this strange admissions season, so have colleges. The databases they buy from testing companies have fewer names, fewer test scores and less demographic information this year, adding to the challenge of recruiting. Virtual college tours and other forms of online outreach make it more difficult to form personal connections.
“Everything’s on Zoom, which is hard,” said Peter Hagan, head of admissions at Syracuse University.
But others said virtual outreach removed the logistical difficulties of reaching possible applicants.
“We’ve connected with an incredible number of students,” said Quinlan, the admissions dean at Yale. “The barriers to information sessions — not getting to Topeka, Kansas, or getting to New Haven — are gone.”
For Caldwell, who attends an all-girls Catholic school in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, the last few months have been rocky. Her father, an autoworker, got COVID-19 early on but has since recovered. Neither of her parents finished college.
Her SAT was canceled the week that school shut down in March, she said. Instead, she took the ACT, which she had hardly prepared for. She did not do as well as she had hoped.
Her 20-hour-a-week job in a clothing store, on top of school and her personal life, is “a lot to juggle,” she said. She has applied to three colleges close to home but until this week was procrastinating about applying to others that she really wants to attend.
“Because of the pandemic, I feel like I’m knocked off my square,” she said. “I can’t really ask anyone in my family, so I’m taking it one step at a time. I’m going to get there.”

Britain Set to Leap Ahead in Approving Vaccines

LONDON — Britain asked its drug regulator on Friday to consider AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency approval, forging ahead in the face of considerable uncertainty about the vaccine’s effectiveness as the government tries to corral a pandemic that has killed more than 66,000 people in the country.
The request was one of a series of steps that Britain has taken to put itself near the front of the pack of countries hurrying to assess coronavirus vaccine candidates. The country’s drug regulator said Monday that it intended to decide on an emergency approval for a vaccine made by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a German company, BioNTech, “in the shortest time possible.” That would potentially put it ahead of American regulators, who plan to make a ruling no sooner than Dec. 10.
In a letter last week, British health officials told hospital executives to be “ready to start vaccinating from the beginning of December." Hospital executives have already started holding vaccine information sessions with staff members and asking for data to help reassure them that the Pfizer vaccine — the apparent front-runner for approval — is safe.
Cambridge University Hospitals told staff members that it would begin vaccinating them “from next week using the Pfizer vaccine,” according to an internal email, outlining a plan for booking appointments.
Holding the keys to Britain’s vaccination timeline is its regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which has long played a leading role in evaluating drugs for the European Union and is now staking out a more independent role as Britain splits from the bloc.
“They’re pretty fast at the best of times, quite honestly,” Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said of the agency. “And in this situation, they’ve really been gearing up to do this as rapidly as possible.”
Still, the job of evaluating AstraZeneca’s vaccine for emergency use will place the agency in the middle of a thicket of difficult questions.
The vaccine was developed by the University of Oxford, making it Britain’s leading homegrown vaccine and the government’s foremost symbol of its scientific prowess during a pandemic that has laid bare many of the country’s weaknesses. (The prime minister’s office went so far as to explore printing the Union Jack flag on vaccine injection kits, HuffPost UK reported Friday.)
After AstraZeneca announced this week that the vaccine appeared to be up to 90% effective, Prime Minister Boris Johnson celebrated the results.
But since then, AstraZeneca has acknowledged a key dosing error. The study participants in whom the vaccine was 90% effective had mistakenly been given a half dose of the vaccine, followed a month later by a full dose. Among those who received two full doses, the effectiveness dropped to 62%.
And the people who received the smaller dosing regimen were 55 years old or younger, making it difficult to know if the more promising results would hold among older people, who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.
That has eroded the confidence of some scientists and created uncertainty about whether additional testing would bear out the apparently spectacular results. The company itself was unable to explain why the two dosing regimens performed so differently — a question that some scientists said needed answering before wide distribution of the vaccine.
“I can understand why they’ve taken it forward; it still works,” Stuart Neil, a professor of virology at King’s College London, said of the British regulators. “But we’ve still got no idea whether it works well enough.”
In the United States, which has ordered at least 300 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, the regulatory process is at a standstill. The company said it would seek guidance from the Food and Drug Administration on whether it should formally submit its findings to apply for emergency authorization.
But Britain, which has ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine, is speeding down the regulatory path much more quickly.
That reflects its drug regulators’ close observation of AstraZeneca’s trials in Britain. After Oxford scientists discovered the dosing error months ago, Britain’s medicines agency gave them the green light to continue, the university has said.
American and British regulators also conduct their vaccine reviews differently, Ward said. American regulators ask vaccine makers for raw data, which the FDA reanalyzes to validate company results. Regulators in Britain and elsewhere in Europe rely more heavily on the companies’ own reports, Ward said, though they reserve the right to verify their accuracy.
With hundreds of people still dying from the coronavirus each day in Britain and the country’s hospitals under enormous stress, Ward said that any vaccine at AstraZeneca’s level of effectiveness deserved strong consideration. It is inexpensive — only a few dollars per dose — and easy to mass-produce. Unlike vaccines made by Pfizer and another American company, Moderna, AstraZeneca’s can be stored for months in normal refrigerators.
And in using a viral vector to provoke an immune response to the coronavirus, the AstraZeneca vaccine relies on a technique with a longer track record than Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, both of which use a technology relying on sending genetic instructions through a molecule known as “messenger RNA.”
“A vaccine doesn’t need very, very, very high effectiveness in order to be useful in reducing the burden of disease, particularly more severe disease, and in relieving pressure on a backed-up health system,” Ward said, noting that seasonal flu vaccines are useful even though they vary widely in their effectiveness.
Now that Britain has decided to leave the EU, the bloc’s regulatory agency no longer relies on Britain to take the lead in assessing new medicines and vaccines, as it did for many years. But analysts said that Britain’s drug regulator remained a bellwether, making its rulings influential in Europe and elsewhere.
For Britain, the decisions are crucial in part because the government has hedged its bets by preordering a total of 355 million doses of seven different vaccine candidates, among the most ambitious hauls in the world.
“It’s like having an array of weapons in your armory,” said Gino Martini, chief scientist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.
It remains unclear when British regulators will decide on either Pfizer or AstraZeneca’s vaccine. (With Moderna’s vaccine unlikely to be available in Britain until at least the spring, the government has not formally requested an emergency assessment.) The agency said on Friday that it would “rigorously assess the latest data” and that “the safety of the public will always come first.”
And temporary approval of any vaccines in Britain will not limit their availability in the United States or other wealthy countries that have also ordered many millions of doses.
But scientists have stressed that it is essential for the public’s faith in coronavirus vaccines that British regulators thoroughly vet questions about all of the candidates, and especially AstraZeneca’s, before giving temporary approval.
“I’m sure they’re feeling the pressure like everybody else that if there’s a chance of this making a difference, then they need to make a decision as soon as they can,” Neil said. “But the trouble is it’s getting snarled up in a lot of financial competition and chest-beating about who’s got the best vaccine. And the error in dosing raises awkward questions that need to be fully investigated.”

NEW YORK — The must-have accessory for many businesses this winter is basic, but lately it has been hard to find: the humble space heater.
As coronavirus cases surge, and as people shun or are even barred from gathering in indoor spaces, restaurants, hotels and office buildings are installing outdoor heaters on sidewalks and terraces in a bid to retain customers and tenants.
The effort can seem like an existential quest. A rise in demand has left some products back-ordered for months, possibly jeopardizing prospects for some of businesses to get through the pandemic intact.
“Surviving this pandemic has become like jungle warfare,” said Mark Barak, chief executive of La Pecora Bianca, a restaurant that has decked out the outside areas of its three New York locations with about 70 heaters.
“I joke with my staff that I have become an outdoor-dining general contractor. That’s how I now spend so much of my time,” Barak said.
Distributors say they are having trouble keeping up with demand.
Gas-Fired Products, a North Carolina manufacturer of heating equipment, is selling three times as many heaters as it did in 2019, said Paul Horne, vice president of the company. Its products include $1,200 versions with enclosed flames that promise to stay lit in 40 mph winds.
“Any opportunity that people can find to go to a restaurant or hang out with friends outside, they’re going to take advantage,” Horne said.
The profile of customers is changing, vendors say. Heaters once mostly ended up on backyard patios, but they are quickly becoming fixtures of commercial buildings.
Just a year ago, businesses made up 10% of the clients of Radtec, a Texas-based distributor. Today, that share is 50%, said Adam Minton, sales director of the company, whose products include tabletop heaters and ones shaped like pyramids.
Interest has come from several northern cites grappling with falling temperatures, but New York in particular is a hive of activity, Minton said, adding that the city has gone from being “no market” last year to the company’s largest today.
“There is such a demand that people say, ‘I don’t care if it glows or doesn’t glow. I just need heat,’” Minton said. “They don’t even ask about cost or coverage area.”
For some businesses, like restaurants, the timing can be crucial. As states like California and Michigan move to impose business restrictions, including shutting down indoor dining, having a space outside can offer a chance to survive the pandemic.
“I think it’s going to be a very difficult winter, and a lot more restaurants will close,” said Andrew Moger, chief executive of BCD, a restaurant consulting group whose clients have included Westville, Dinosaur Bar-b-que and Benihana.
The surge in demand has caught some stores flat-footed. Major hardware retailers like Lowe’s and Home Depot are frequently out of stock, say shoppers who have combed through aisles.
“Like all retailers, we have seen high demand for many items, and our merchants and supply chain teams have been working to replenish what they can,” a Home Depot spokesperson said.
Many of the outdoor heaters sold in the United States are made in China, which is struggling to keep up with the heightened interest. Chinese factories used to take two months to fill Radtec’s orders, and they now take three, Minton said.
Yet prices for heaters, which come in propane, natural gas or electric versions, do not yet seem to be climbing, possibly because the huge volume of business allows manufacturers to keep their costs down, analysts say.
Despite skyrocketing use, the cost of propane is similarly stable, said Tucker Perkins, chief executive of the Propane Education and Research Council, an advocacy group based in Washington.
In 2019, U.S. consumers burned through 284 million gallons of propane in heaters, grills and other appliances, Perkins said. In 2020, that number is likely to nearly double to 500 million gallons.
Still, those small-scale uses are a drop in the bucket compared with consumption in the overall national market, which is about 10 billon gallons a year, he said.
New York, which mostly banned the gas for use in commercial heat lamps until reversing course in October to help struggling restaurants, “is now the epicenter of the growth,” Perkins said, with 60,000 gallons consumed a day.
Snapping up heaters this summer, well in advance of the winter season, appears to have been a smart move for business owners. Well-timed renovations also helped, said Barak of La Pecora, whose SoHo location was being remodeled when the pandemic hit.
During construction, workers upgraded gas lines and installed wiring, improvements that might have been difficult to pull off in a place that was already open, he said. The renovation included wall-mounted electric heaters as a backup and a transformer to power them.
To prepare for La Pecora’s opening late last month, Barak also added rows of mushroom-shaped free-standing heaters, powered by both natural gas and propane, along the sidewalk at his restaurant, which can accommodate 80 people outside and 40 inside. All told, the heat-related extras cost “a few hundred thousand dollars," he said, adding, “I don’t think anyone else has more heat per seat than we do.”
New York may have relaxed some heater rules, but fires remain a concern. Businesses are still not allowed to store full propane tanks on-site over fears of setting off an explosion. But heaters churn through about 4 gallons a day — the amount inside a 20-pound tank used for most grills — meaning restaurants with heaters burning day and night can face regular fuel shortages.
And existing propane services tended to punch out early, leaving businesses with late-night hours stranded. To meet that demand, Derek Kaye, who ran a fleet of food trucks before the pandemic stunted his business, switched gears this summer to start NYC Propane Delivery, a six-employee business that supplies tanks to restaurants daily from dawn to midnight.
“Hopefully, that will continue,” Kaye said.
Offices, too, are trying to make their outdoor spaces cozier. At Industry City, an office, retail and industrial complex on the Brooklyn waterfront, its owners Jamestown and Belvedere Capital Real Estate Partners have spent $1 million on heaters and tents, purchased this summer, to encourage tenants to socialize in the alleys between the development’s repurposed brick buildings. About 70 heaters are now installed, including an electric version in an existing yurt, said Kathe Chase, Industry City’s director of leasing.
Of the 8,500 employees who worked in the complex before the pandemic, 50% still regularly show up for work, Chase said. At the same time, 500,000 square feet, or 12% of the complex, have leased since March, she added.
“Nobody has a crystal ball about what will happen,” Chase said. “But this is not just a COVID fix. We think people will live differently after this.”
But not every business can heat outdoor spaces, and some are turning to rudimentary alternatives.
Tishman Speyer, a national office landlord, is not permitted to place heaters on some high-floor terraces of its Rockefeller Center, over concerns that wind could send them flying. Portable heaters also can’t be positioned too close to walls, said Thais Galli, a Tishman managing director.
But many of the employees who do come into the office — about 15% of pre-pandemic totals — prefer to hold meetings on the terraces, so wind-blocking options, like Plexiglass screens, rows of evergreens and plastic igloos, are now under consideration, Galli said.
At One Federal Street, a Tishman high-rise in Boston, the landlord hands out complimentary single-use fleece blankets and wool hats for those who want to grab a breath of fresh air on the lawn-lined ninth-floor terrace, where most heaters are also verboten.
“It’s a real work in progress,” Galli said.

Can Cannabis Farms Weather Wildfire Season?

In 2013, Joy Hollingsworth moved with her family from Seattle out to the country with a plan to build a cannabis business.
Washington state had recently legalized recreational marijuana, and Barack Obama had just been reelected. For Hollingsworth, a former basketball player, and her brother, Raft Hollingsworth III, a former University of Washington student who had been growing medical marijuana, it seemed like as good a time as any to buy a farm and turn a profit.
So began the Hollingsworth Cannabis Co., a Black-owned family business in what has become a very white and increasingly corporate-dominated industry.
“Here are some city Black folks moving out to the middle of nowhere, a predominantly white area,” Hollingsworth, 36, said, recalling the early days in Shelton, a small city near Olympic National Park where the family built their farm. “I thought they were going to have a problem with us growing cannabis. The reality is most of our neighbors love weed.”
What they were worried about was water.
The area is prone to drought and has dealt with escalating unpredictable weather patterns over the past several years. “We’re getting more rain in August and more snow in the winter,” Hollingsworth said — so much snow, in fact, that last year one of her greenhouses collapsed under its weight.
The excess precipitation means too much water and humidity for crops to flourish. And in recent months, Hollingsworth said, they’ve had to worry about fires.
The West Coast’s most destructive wildfire season on record raged this fall, in the midst of the country’s most pervasive drought since 2013. More than 5 million acres of land have burned, and many farms, cannabis and otherwise, have had to evacuate.
While most crop farms are covered by insurance in the event of environmental destruction, insurers (including big banks) remain wary of cannabis farms. As of May 2020, a mere six companies nationwide offered insurance to farms that grow cannabis that contains more than 0.3% THC, the main psychoactive compound of the plant.
Hemp, defined as cannabis that contains 0.3% THC or less, qualified for federal crop insurance only starting this planting year. Many marijuana crops are uninsured, which means in the wake of a fire, farmers can face financial ruin.
Jeff Nordahl, 47, runs Jade Nectar, a small family-run cannabis business in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Wildfires came within a mile of his farm this fall, and Nordahl and his employees had to evacuate for nearly a month. “Three weeks of not being able to water cannabis during the 90- to 100-degree days will kill cannabis within three to four days,” he said.
So Nordahl found some workarounds to get his crops the bare minimum of water they needed. “This sometimes required hiking 12 miles with the blessings of neighbors to cross their property, gaining access through some emergency workers who knew me,” he said. “I had helped their family out many years ago by providing free cannabis oil to a family member who beat cancer, so they helped me access our farm.”
Though none of his crops burned, he still felt the effects of the fires acutely. “Even when your farm is not on fire, just the impact from the smoke and the potential damage there, and the sun being blocked out and such, the plant suffers unquestionably,” he said.
Keala Peterson, 31, and her mother, Kila Peterson, 60, known as Mama Ki, founded Sweet Creek Farm in Greenville, California, in 2014, after three years of growing pot for personal use on their 5,000-square-foot homestead. The younger Peterson called the wildfires “just another layer” in the difficulties of being a small family pot farm.
“It’s really unfortunate because most of the people that are impacted by these fires are small because by nature of where we’re located, you can’t be a big farm,” she said. “There’s not expansive flat lands to do acres. It’s pretty steep. And mostly, it’s just people living on their property.” In August, fire destroyed 80% of Peterson’s marijuana crops, as well as her parents’ home.
Wildfires often happen at a time of the year when cannabis can be vulnerable. Planted cannabis can survive fire if the soil has not been tainted, but when flowering, the stickiness of the plants can make them susceptible to getting coated by falling ash, soot or fire retardants.
Often, marijuana is harvested in September before the first frost, but marijuana farms on the West Coast can have a longer growing season because of the typically temperate climate.
“Harvesting right in the middle of September is probably really risky with that being peak fire season these days,” Nordahl said. This year, Jade Nectar planted a strain to harvest in early August and another for around Thanksgiving. “We want to avoid late August and September cannabis varieties, as these are the highest fire-risk times,” Nordahl said.
Sweet Creek Farm was able to do a “late replant,” thanks to new crops donated to them by a local nursery. Members of the community came out to help the Petersons replant their crops.
“We were kind of like cockroaches,” Peterson said. “As soon as it was safe to enter, we were able to water the 20% of the plants that did survive. We pruned them a third of the way up because the bottom branches burned, but they survived and we harvested them. We’re able to salvage some sort of a season.”
Some cannabis farmers chose to stay on their farms, in some cases defying evacuation orders, to try to save crops from fire using methods like watering down the plants. One of those farmers was Peterson’s father, a retired firefighter.
After surviving previous wildfire seasons, other marijuana farms have diversified into additional crops, or focused on growing inside (as the majority of Colorado’s cannabis farms do). But even indoor grows are not immune to wildfire damage.
Hollingsworth doesn’t yet know the impact of the smoke on her crops, which are grown in climate-controlled greenhouses, but “they’re not perking up as much as they usually do,” she said. Right now, she is most worried about the sky. “Sun rays, they can’t filter through the smoke,” she said. “And we really rely on the greatest resource that the planet has ever known, which is the sun, for us to grow.”
Still, Hollingsworth has no plans of giving up on her family business. Last year, she and her brother were featured on the cover of Cannabis Business Times, and they appeared on an episode of Anthony Bourdain’s “Parts Unknown.” “I hope that we can continue on this pathway of growing sustainable cannabis and showing people that it can be done,” she said.
Peterson’s family plans to rebuild their house with wildfire considerations, including steel, solar panels and no windows facing the forest. “We’re going to keep going,” she said. “I want to raise my kids on my family property. That would be the dream, to continue the farmstead on to the next generation.”

A Job for Life, or Not? A Class Divide Deepens in Japan

TOKYO — For more than a decade, Setsuko Hikita spent her working days selling snacks and newspapers in the bowels of Tokyo’s bustling metro system.
Amid the chaos of morning commutes and the scramble to catch the last train home, she kept her employers’ tiny kiosks a haven of well-ordered commerce. Her company once awarded her a citation for her dedication and hard work.
What it did not give her was equal pay.
Over a 10-year period, Hikita earned about $90,000 less than many of her co-workers, and she was denied benefits like a retirement allowance. It wasn’t because they had more experience or were more competent. It was just that they had lifetime employment status and she did not.
So Hikita sued. Last month, after more than six years, the country’s Supreme Court rendered a verdict: Her employer was under no obligation to provide her with the same retirement allowance — a lump-sum payment on leaving the company — it gave colleagues who did identical work.
The ruling is one of two recent court decisions that threaten to further entrench the long-standing divide in Japan between so-called regular workers, who have lifetime employment and attendant benefits, and the growing ranks of nonregular workers, many of whom are women.
The effects of these divisions have been especially pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic. When Japan’s economy faced its worst months in late spring and early summer, companies cut loose tens of thousands of nonregular workers, with women bearing the brunt of the job losses. Many regular employees were put on furlough, retaining their positions.
Concerns about the precarious state of nonregular workers long predate the pandemic.
Employers have for years chipped away at the system of lifetime employment that evolved in Japan after World War II, arguing that increased flexibility to hire and fire employees will increase economic efficiency. Now, nearly 37% of the country’s labor force, or more than 20.6 million workers, are nonregular employees, according to the latest government statistics, up from around 16% in the early 1980s.
Among Japanese women in the workforce, more than half are nonregular employees — an example of the limits of Japan’s push in recent years to elevate women in the workplace, a program known as womenomics.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, addressing parliament this month, emphasized the need to fight rising unemployment among nonregular workers, and women in particular, pledging to “firmly take necessary measures.”
Promises like these sound all too familiar to labor activists. They fear that the Supreme Court’s decisions have “thrown cold water” on such vows to reform the system, said Shigeru Wakita, professor emeritus of labor law at Ryukoku University.
Japanese law mandates that companies avoid “unreasonable” differences in how they treat employees, but the meaning of the term is ill-defined. In the case of Hikita’s lawsuit and a separate suit brought by a female employee at a medical school in Osaka, judges ruled that the organizations had not violated that standard despite vast gaps in compensation and other benefits.
“If the courts don’t recognize this case as unreasonable, then what on earth is unreasonable?” asked Mitsuteru Suda, chairman of a labor union in Tokyo.
A tentative answer to that question came when the court issued a third ruling last month on conditions for nonregular workers. The judges ruled in favor of plaintiffs who had sued their employer, Japan Post, after it refused to pay them overtime to help with the spike in deliveries around New Year’s, Japan’s most important holiday.
But even that ruling is likely to further legitimize the prevailing employment system, Suda said. While the ruling will force the company to reassess its employment practices, it found fault only with the degree of discrimination, not the practice itself.
“The ruling stands on the side of the employers, giving a stamp of approval of discrimination,” he said. “That is unacceptable.”
In the Japanese employment system, the line between regular and nonregular workers is drawn early, and the result is a sharp class divide.
Each fall, companies across the country hold recruitment drives for high school and college students who will graduate in the spring. For many, the monthslong process is the most important period of their lives.
Those who find jobs will win employment for life. Those who do not are cast into the wilderness of irregular employment.
Regular workers, known as seishain, receive two annual bonuses, each typically worth at least one month’s salary and sometimes much more. They have benefits, which can include housing. They are nearly impossible to fire. And they get a generous pension plan.
By contrast, nonregular workers can be fired much more easily. They are paid less, and employers are not required to provide them with the same level of benefits that their regularly employed colleagues receive.
Midcareer hiring that brings nonregular workers into the regular workforce has increased in recent years, said Andrew Gordon, a professor at Harvard who specializes in the history of labor in Japan. But it remains rare.
Businesses employing regular workers right out of school like to argue, he said, that “we’re not hiring people with specialized knowledge and experience, but we’re hiring human capital that can be formed.”
“They fear that somebody from the outside won’t be able to adjust to their particular company’s way of doing things even though, functionally speaking, it might not be that different,” he added.
Lifetime employment is an artifact of the postwar era. As Japan tried to rebuild its devastated economy and demand for labor skyrocketed, the country’s companies made a pact with its workers: They would guarantee that their material needs would be met until the day they died. In exchange, employees would stay with their company for life and devote themselves entirely to its success.
The jobs went mostly to men. Their wives were expected to stay home and support their husbands’ grueling schedules.
Through the 1980s, Japan’s humming economy meant that most employees landed in lifetime employment. But the system began to change in the 1990s, after the country’s economic bubble popped and companies demanded more freedom in labor decisions.
In the following years, laws began changing to favor employers. By the end of the 2008 financial crisis, the number of nonregular workers had risen drastically.
A 2013 law attempted to address this disparity, mandating that employers convert nonregular workers to seishain after five years and that differences in their employment conditions should not be “unreasonable.”
But the law has had little impact because of loopholes and its loose definition of what constitutes “unreasonable” differences.
Those weak points became the basis for the lawsuit filed by Hikita and three others against their employer, Metro Commerce.
Several decades ago, the company routinely hired 20 to 30 lifetime employees annually. Now, it adds only two or three each year.
For Hikita, her life as a nonregular employee began at the age of 54, when she moved back to Tokyo after a divorce. Her starting wage at Metro Commerce was 1,000 yen an hour, or less than $10 an hour at current exchange rates. Ten years later, she was making only 1,050.
“When I started at the company, I thought everyone was equal,” she said. But she quickly discovered that “there was a difference between contract employees and lifetime employees.”
She decided to sue in 2014 after learning that her co-workers were getting annual bonuses four to five times as large as hers.
After she left the company the next year, she was working three jobs to cover the payments on her home, she said. She worked every day that year.
Since filing her suit, Hikita said, she has learned that “there are an incredible number of us across the country” facing employment discrimination. The message from the Supreme Court, she added, is clear: “We’re all disposable.”

Edith Bartley knew the day would come.
For almost 15 years she and her mother have traveled to Manhattan from the Washington, D.C., area to attend the trials of men charged in a conspiracy that included al-Qaida’s bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Her reason for making the trips was deeply personal: Her father and younger brother were among the 224 victims.
So it was with some trepidation that she read a recent email from federal authorities telling her that one of the defendants, an Egyptian named Adel Abdel-Meguid Abdel-Bary, 60, was about to be released after 21 years in prison.
Abdel-Bary, an operative in London who on behalf of al-Qaida publicized a claim of responsibility for the attacks, is the only one of the men convicted in the embassy bombings plot known to be let out of prison, outside of cooperating witnesses.
Some of the men charged in the conspiracy, including Osama bin Laden, were killed by the United States or its allies. Seven conspirators are serving life sentences.
But Abdel-Bary, now jailed in the custody of U.S. immigration authorities, has finished his sentence and is expected to be deported to Britain, his last place of residence, court papers show. It is unclear when he will be sent there or whether he will be subject to any kind of formal supervision there. His ideology today is unknown.
A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that for security reasons, the agency cannot share the departure dates for detainees being removed from the United States. The British Home Office said it does not comment on individual immigration cases.
To Bartley, the prospect that Abdel-Bary will be free, even in another country, is unsettling.
“Just serving a sentence doesn’t mean that a person has been rehabilitated, doesn’t mean that their core thinking has changed,” Bartley said. “This is a person who can still do harm in the world.”
Abdel-Bary did not respond to an interview request. R. Andrew Painter, his immigration lawyer, said only, “After all this time, all Mr. Bary wants is to enjoy a quiet life with his family.”
Not much is known about his family. He has a wife in London and several children. One son, Abdel-Majed Abdel-Bary, who was a child when Abdel-Bary was jailed, was arrested in April by Spanish authorities and accused of having joined Islamic State fighters in Syria, The Associated Press reported.
It has been years since a series of high-profile terrorism trials were held in Manhattan, growing out of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people; an aborted plot to blow up New York landmarks; and the 1998 attacks on the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
More than a dozen terrorists were convicted in those and related cases and sentenced to life imprisonment. But some others have completed their sentences.
In July, Victor Alvarez, who had helped to mix diesel fuel and fertilizer to make a bomb in the landmarks plot, was freed after 27 years in prison and sent to a Manhattan homeless shelter, according to court records.
He remains subject to supervision by probation officers and must wear a GPS monitoring device and participate in a “de-radicalization” program, the records show.
“Not everyone who is convicted of a terrible crime spends life in prison,” said Nicholas Lewin, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute Abdel-Bary and declined to comment on his case. “People are released upon finishing their sentence,” Lewin added. “It’s fundamental to our system of justice.”
Prosecutors say Abdel-Bary handled communications with the media for al-Qaida before and after the bombings. In 2015, he was sentenced to 25 years but received credit for the years he was jailed in Britain while fighting extradition, and also for good behavior in prison in the United States, one of his lawyers said.
Susan Hirsch, a George Mason University professor, lost her husband, Abdurahman Abdalla, in the Dar es Salaam bombing and wrote a book about what she has called “a victim’s quest for justice.”
Hirsch acknowledged Abdel-Bary’s 21 years in prison constituted a substantial sentence but said, “It’s on the lower end of just, as far as I’m concerned.”
The daughter of a third victim, who asked not to be identified, said she understood it made sense to grant some prisoners credit for the time they served before pleading guilty. “But for somebody who’s done something this egregious, where so many people were killed,” she said, for them “to have the possibility of going out and creating more havoc is actually terrifying.”
After the nearly simultaneous embassy attacks on Aug. 7, 1998, bin Laden and more than 20 other Qaida operatives were charged with participating in a global conspiracy to kill Americans, which included the bombings.
As recently as this Aug. 7, one of the masterminds, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, was killed in Iran by two Israeli operatives at the behest of the U.S., The New York Times reported.
Other operatives were sent to Manhattan for trials that were held in early 2001 and continued over the next decade and a half.
During those trials, Bartley and her mother, Sue, were fixtures in court. They lost two family members — Julian Bartley Sr., the consul general in the embassy in Nairobi, and Julian Bartley Jr., a college student working as an intern there.
“That was half of my family,” Sue Bartley testified at the 2001 trial, in which four Qaida operatives were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Abdel-Bary, who had been granted refugee status in Britain, was arrested there in 1999 and extradited in 2012.
Prosecutors said he had been a trusted senior member of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a group led by Ayman al-Zawahri that effectively merged with al-Qaida.
After the bombings, they said, Abdel-Bary sent faxes to the news media containing claims of responsibility and threats of future attacks.
In September 2014, Abdel-Bary pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill Americans and to charges related to conveying threats, carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years.
Judge Lewis Kaplan of U.S. District Court initially expressed concern that 25 years was too lenient. He eventually accepted the plea after prosecutors said they lacked evidence Abdel-Bary had helped to plan or carry out the bombings.
Abdel-Bary’s defense lawyer, Andrew Patel, also argued that a letter Abdel-Bary wrote before the attacks showed he had denounced the use of violence against Americans. Prosecutors, however, said even after the bombings, Abdel-Bary continued to act as a conduit for communications between the news media and his co-conspirators.
At Abdel-Bary’s 2015 sentencing, Edith Bartley told the court, “No family should have to go through our pain, but so many have to do it every day.”
Abdel-Bary said he felt remorse. “If I could just do something to bring the victims back, your honor, I would have done it, but unfortunately I can’t,” he said.
Kaplan said Abdel-Bary was the beneficiary of an “enormously generous plea bargain.”
“You, unlike victims of the embassy bombings, may look forward to rejoining your family and living out your natural life in freedom,” the judge said, adding that the victims “have no such prospect.”
Abdel-Bary’s release from prison had been scheduled for October. But at the request of his lawyer, Patel, Kaplan agreed to release Abdel-Bary about three weeks early because of his risk of contracting the coronavirus in prison. Abdel-Bary weighs 230 pounds and has asthma, records show.
Patel said his client’s release would begin the process of returning Abdel-Bary to his family in London. “He will never walk the streets of any town or city in the United States,” Patel wrote.
Edith Bartley, in the recent interview, said when terrorists receive life sentences, “the weight is not on our shoulders to worry about what happens when they are released.”
“What will Abdel-Bary do for the rest of his life?” she asked. “Who knows?”

India’s Economy Shrinks as COVID-19 Slams Small Businesses

NEW DELHI — China has come roaring back from the devastation of COVID-19, and the United States, Europe and Japan are finding their feet. But the hundreds of millions of laborers and shopkeepers who keep India’s economy running still cannot find relief.
India’s economy shrank 7.5% in the three months that ended in September compared with a year earlier, government figures showed Friday. The data reflects the deepening of India’s severest recession since at least 1996, when the country first began publishing its gross domestic product numbers.
The new figures firmly ensconced India’s position among the world’s worst-performing major economies, despite expansive government spending designed to rescue the thousands of small businesses severely battered by its long, hastily imposed lockdown.
Nikhil Das, 62, a manufacturer of silk ties and scarves in New Delhi, says his business is teetering on the edge of collapse. His sales, which depend on demand from luxury shops and airport retailers, have fallen by 80%. He needs payments from customers to make up for his manufacturing costs, but retailers who cannot move his wares still owe him more than $50,000.
He has idled six workers he once paid for each tie and scarf they made, and he has been treated for stomach pain that his doctor has attributed to stress.
“The money supply chain is broken,” Das said. “It is a constant source of tension to me.”
The Indian government has committed $50 billion, roughly 2% of India’s annual economic output, to help small businesses, as well as cash transfers to low-income workers as part of a $266 billion economic package.
For the average Indian worker and entrepreneur, it has not been enough.
An estimated 140 million people lost their jobs after India locked down its economy in March to stop the outbreak, while many others saw their salaries drastically reduced, the Mumbai-based Center for Monitoring Indian Economy said. As the lockdown was eased, many went back to work, but more than 6 million people who lost jobs have not found new employment.
In a June survey by the All India Manufacturers Organization, about one-third of small and medium-sized enterprises indicated that their businesses were beyond saving. The industry group said that such a “mass destruction of business” was unprecedented.
Businesses like Das’ form the backbone of India’s still-developing economy. Small and medium-size enterprises employ about 80% of the labor force.
India’s textile factories, leather tanneries, brick kilns, foundries and other small enterprises form “part of the country’s social fabric, bringing local wealth and local employment,” said Venkatachalam Anbumozhi, an economist who focuses on South and East Asia.
Just a few years ago, India, with a population of 1.3 billion people, was one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies. It regularly clocked growth of 8% or more.
Global businesses began to warm to the idea of India as a potential substitute to China, both as a place to make goods and to sell them. China’s costs are rising, and its trade war with the United States has complicated doing business there. The Chinese Communist Party is increasingly intruding into business matters, and local Chinese competitors have upped their game against international brands.
But India’s economy was facing headwinds well before the pandemic. Between April and December 2019, gross domestic product grew only 4.6%.
“India was expected to really step into China’s shoes and give that additional boost to globalization that was missing,” said Priyanka Kishore, head of South Asia at Oxford Economics. “And that’s where India didn’t really play out the role it was largely expected to play, and that role seems to be diminishing more and more.”
Since coming to power in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shaken the economy with policies meant to boost government revenues and help India’s transition to digital banking. Some of the efforts have been embraced by business, such as Modi’s pledges to slash the country’s vast and tangled web of red tape.
But other Modi initiatives meant to bring India’s informal, off-the-books economy into the open proved disruptive for many small businesses, which don’t have the resources that big companies can deploy to overhaul how they make payments and keep their books.
One of Modi’s policies, called demonetization, banned large currency notes overnight in an effort to crack down on tax avoidance and money laundering. Under another, India replaced its welter of national and state taxes with a single value-added tax, in part to cut down on corruption among tax collectors.
Modi also increasingly turned India’s industrial policy inward, which many economists say has hurt overall growth. The country has long nurtured some of the steepest trade barriers of any major economy, to help its domestic industries develop. Modi added to that in areas like electronics. His government has also tightened rules around e-commerce, to assist Indian businesses that compete with companies like Amazon and Walmart.
“The slowdown,” Kishore said, “is almost homegrown.”
That stumbling economy was dealt a sharp shock by the coronavirus.
The near-total nationwide lockdown in March brought the economy to a halt, instantly stripping many Indians who rely on daily wages of any prospect of earning money. Millions of workers who over the years had been drawn to India’s urban centers for jobs started returning home to rural areas.
The economic problems are by no means over. Officials desperate to stimulate business lifted some of the lockdown restrictions, allowing more movement — and further spreading the coronavirus. The country is recording a sharp decline in infections from a September high, but experts fear it is only a lull.
Even after the pandemic wanes, Kishore projects, India will be the worst-affected among the world’s major economies. Debt-laden companies will have to borrow even more. Growth could fall to 4.5% annually over the next five years, well below the 6.5% growth that had been projected before COVID-19.
“The worst,” said Anbumozhi, the economist, citing the potential impact to small business in particular, “is yet to come for India.”

MATAMOROS, Mexico — Griselda was 38 weeks pregnant when she sneaked across the Rio Grande into the United States late one night last year. She started having contractions in a Border Patrol facility in McAllen, Texas, and was taken to a hospital where the medical staff gave her an injection to calm her pain and stop her from going into early labor.
Two days later, she was on a crowded bus back to Mexico, moving into a tent camp with hundreds of other migrants who were waiting for permission to enter the United States. When she finally gave birth 10 days later, her tiny daughter joined her there until a local shelter made room for them.
The wide-ranging new controls on immigration put into place under the Trump administration have made it harder for migrants of all kinds to cross the southern border, but they have been particularly difficult for pregnant women, who often arrive at the border after arduous journeys, in a state of exhaustion.
Previously, many such women would be allowed to petition for asylum and give birth in safety in the United States while their cases were being considered. But most now, like Griselda, are sent swiftly back to Mexico to take their chances in crowded shelters and filthy tent camps. Some are held in U.S. detention facilities for months.
In a petition to the federal courts last year, the American Civil Liberties Union said it had interviewed 18 migrant women who had been detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and returned to Mexico. All were facing serious worries over how to give birth safely and keep their babies healthy.
One woman said she was told by a CBP agent that “Trump didn’t want there to be any more pregnant people here,” according to the ACLU’s court complaint.
When reports of what was happening with women on the border began to emerge, I traveled there to document it. In my work as a photojournalist, I had spent a decade investigating maternal health around the world. It was clear that a potential health crisis, of a kind I had seen in much less-developed countries, was unfolding directly at America’s door.
I was joined by Caitlin Dickerson, a national immigration writer for The New York Times. We met Griselda in a shelter in Matamoros, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, on one of several trips we would take to the region over the coming year.
Our work led to a report on the plight of women living illegally in the United States who are forgoing prenatal care and giving birth at home because of fears that they could be deported. But our reporting revealed a much wider range of problems faced by pregnant women on the border. Most of the women asked that their last names not be published to avoid jeopardizing their chances of winning legal residence in the United States. Their faces, though, spoke volumes.
Xiomara Quintanilla, 26, was seven months pregnant when she arrived at the border near McAllen, Texas, with her two small children: Brianna, 3; and Dylan, 1. The family had fled El Salvador, crossing the Rio Grande into the United States and asking for asylum. She had spent $9,000 on the 15-day journey, paying smugglers along the way.
Families were often being separated by U.S. immigration authorities at the border at that time, but Quintanilla decided to endure the risk of traveling while heavily pregnant and the possibility of being separated from her children. “I came because of the lack of security in El Salvador and the gangs,” she said. “There is no work there. I have to think about the future of my children.”
In Austin, Texas, I photographed Lisbeth, 29, who had fled the MS13 gang in El Salvador after her husband was targeted. She arrived in the United States near Tijuana, Mexico, and surrendered herself to the Border Patrol.
She had been held in a detention center in Otay Mesa, California, for two months — all while in her second trimester of pregnancy. She never received a prenatal exam. She recounted harrowing stories of other pregnant women who had serious health problems at the detention facility.
“I watched so many pregnant women having miscarriages, and I tried to be strong, because I didn’t want that to happen to me,” she said.
She eventually made her way to Austin, where she got an apartment and found a job at a pizza restaurant, earning $13 an hour.
At the tent camp in Matamoros where Griselda was initially staying, Gabriela Maria Hernandez Mendez, 25, was waiting along with her two children for permission to enter the United States as an asylum applicant. She was six months pregnant with a third child.
Gabriela had traveled from Choluteca, Honduras, and was waiting out her pregnancy in a state of purgatory. She had undergone a prenatal exam with a midwife in the customs building in Matamoros but had no idea what would happen to her growing family.
“I am worried for my kids,” she said. “What if they get sick? Where will we sleep? Eat?”
Among the hundreds of asylum-seekers waiting at the camp in Matamoros to present their cases in the United States, more than a dozen were, like Gabriela, expecting children. Many had been living there for months, with little possibility of returning home, either because their money had run out or because it was even more dangerous where they came from.
The conditions at the camp were dismal, sometimes freezing at night and sweltering in the day. There was an outbreak of COVID-19 over the summer.
Some of the expectant mothers, like Griselda, have been able to find a space in a shelter, with warm beds and protection from the elements.
But some of the women have grown tired of waiting and have tried to cross the river. A few of them are lucky enough to be picked up by Border Patrol agents and released to a migrant shelter in the United States.
But for many others, the verdict is quick and harsh: a bus ride back to Mexico.

Edith Bartley knew the day would come.
For almost 15 years she and her mother have traveled to Manhattan from the Washington, D.C., area to attend the trials of men charged in a conspiracy that included al-Qaida’s bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
Her reason for making the trips was deeply personal: Her father and younger brother were among the 224 victims.
So it was with some trepidation that she read a recent email from federal authorities telling her that one of the defendants, an Egyptian named Adel Abdel-Meguid Abdel-Bary, 60, was about to be released after 21 years in prison.
Abdel-Bary, an operative in London who on behalf of al-Qaida publicized a claim of responsibility for the attacks, is the only one of the men convicted in the embassy bombings plot known to be let out of prison, outside of cooperating witnesses.
Some of the men charged in the conspiracy, including Osama bin Laden, were killed by the United States or its allies. Seven conspirators are serving life sentences.
But Abdel-Bary, now jailed in the custody of U.S. immigration authorities, has finished his sentence and is expected to be deported to Britain, his last place of residence, court papers show. It is unclear when he will be sent there or whether he will be subject to any kind of formal supervision there. His ideology today is unknown.
A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that for security reasons, the agency cannot share the departure dates for detainees being removed from the United States. The British Home Office said it does not comment on individual immigration cases.
To Bartley, the prospect that Abdel-Bary will be free, even in another country, is unsettling.
“Just serving a sentence doesn’t mean that a person has been rehabilitated, doesn’t mean that their core thinking has changed,” Bartley said. “This is a person who can still do harm in the world.”
Abdel-Bary did not respond to an interview request. R. Andrew Painter, his immigration lawyer, said only, “After all this time, all Mr. Bary wants is to enjoy a quiet life with his family.”
It has been years since a series of high-profile terrorism trials were held in Manhattan, growing out of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six people; an aborted plot to blow up New York landmarks; and the 1998 attacks on the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
More than a dozen terrorists were convicted in those and related cases and sentenced to life imprisonment. But some others have completed their sentences.
In July, Victor Alvarez, who had helped to mix diesel fuel and fertilizer to make a bomb in the landmarks plot, was freed after 27 years in prison and sent to a Manhattan homeless shelter, according to court records.
He remains subject to supervision by probation officers and must wear a GPS monitoring device and participate in a “de-radicalization” program, the records show.
“Not everyone who is convicted of a terrible crime spends life in prison,” said Nicholas Lewin, a former assistant U.S. attorney who helped prosecute Abdel-Bary and declined to comment on his case. “People are released upon finishing their sentence,” Lewin added. “It’s fundamental to our system of justice.”
Prosecutors say Abdel-Bary handled communications with the media for al-Qaida before and after the bombings. In 2015, he was sentenced to 25 years but received credit for the years he was jailed in Britain while fighting extradition, and also for good behavior in prison in the United States, one of his lawyers said.
Susan Hirsch, a George Mason University professor, lost her husband, Abdurahman Abdalla, in the Dar es Salaam bombing and wrote a book about what she has called “a victim’s quest for justice.”
Hirsch acknowledged Abdel-Bary’s 21 years in prison constituted a substantial sentence but said, “It’s on the lower end of just, as far as I’m concerned.”
The daughter of a third victim, who asked not to be identified, said she understood it made sense to grant some prisoners credit for the time they served before pleading guilty. “But for somebody who’s done something this egregious, where so many people were killed,” she said, for them “to have the possibility of going out and creating more havoc is actually terrifying.”
After the nearly simultaneous embassy attacks on Aug. 7, 1998, bin Laden and more than 20 other Qaida operatives were charged with participating in a global conspiracy to kill Americans, which included the bombings.
As recently as this Aug. 7, one of the masterminds, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, was killed in Iran by two Israeli operatives at the behest of the U.S., The New York Times reported.
Other operatives were sent to Manhattan for trials that were held in early 2001 and continued over the next decade and a half.
During those trials, Bartley and her mother, Sue, were fixtures in court. They lost two family members — Julian Bartley Sr., the consul general in the embassy in Nairobi, and Julian Bartley Jr., a college student working as an intern there.
“That was half of my family,” Sue Bartley testified at the 2001 trial, in which four Qaida operatives were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Abdel-Bary, who had been granted refugee status in Britain, was arrested there in 1999 and extradited in 2012.
Prosecutors said he had been a trusted senior member of the London cell of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, a group led by Ayman al-Zawahri that effectively merged with al-Qaida.
After the bombings, they said, Abdel-Bary sent faxes to the news media containing claims of responsibility and threats of future attacks.
In September 2014, Abdel-Bary pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill Americans and to charges related to conveying threats, carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years.
Judge Lewis Kaplan of U.S. District Court initially expressed concern that 25 years was too lenient. He eventually accepted the plea after prosecutors said they lacked evidence Abdel-Bary had helped to plan or carry out the bombings.
Abdel-Bary’s defense lawyer, Andrew Patel, also argued that a letter Abdel-Bary wrote before the attacks showed he had denounced the use of violence against Americans. Prosecutors, however, said even after the bombings, Abdel-Bary continued to act as a conduit for communications between the news media and his co-conspirators.
At Abdel-Bary’s 2015 sentencing, Edith Bartley told the court, “No family should have to go through our pain, but so many have to do it every day.”
Abdel-Bary said he felt remorse. “If I could just do something to bring the victims back, your honor, I would have done it, but unfortunately I can’t,” he said.
Kaplan said Abdel-Bary was the beneficiary of an “enormously generous plea bargain.”
“You, unlike victims of the embassy bombings, may look forward to rejoining your family and living out your natural life in freedom,” the judge said, adding that the victims “have no such prospect.”
Abdel-Bary’s release from prison had been scheduled for October. But at the request of his lawyer, Patel, Kaplan agreed to release Abdel-Bary about three weeks early because of his risk of contracting the coronavirus in prison. Abdel-Bary weighs 230 pounds and has asthma, records show.
Patel said his client’s release would begin the process of returning Abdel-Bary to his family in London. “He will never walk the streets of any town or city in the United States,” Patel wrote.
Edith Bartley, in the recent interview, said when terrorists receive life sentences, “the weight is not on our shoulders to worry about what happens when they are released.”
“What will Abdel-Bary do for the rest of his life?” she asked. “Who knows?”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
GENEVA — In late May, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, Andrew Bremberg, went on a rescue mission to the World Health Organization headquarters. He told its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that despite weeks of threats that President Donald Trump would quit the health organization, the relationship could still be salvaged.
Bremberg hand-delivered a list of seven demands that U.S. officials saw as the beginning of discreet discussions.
Hours later, Trump took the lectern outside the White House and blew it all up, announcing that the United States would leave the WHO. The announcement blindsided his own diplomats and Tedros alike.
If Trump thought Tedros would relent under the pressure of a U.S. withdrawal, he was wrong. The WHO leader has refused to make concessions or counteroffers, according to American and Western officials. And Trump ultimately made good on his promise to abandon a health agency that the United States helped form a half-century ago.
With Trump’s election defeat, President-elect Joe Biden appears ready to rejoin the global health body. But he will inherit a fractured relationship and must quickly make decisions about how to overhaul an organization that even staunch supporters say is in dire need of change.
While the Trump administration’s demands are now moot, they offer a glimpse into both the growing U.S. frustration with the WHO and Trump’s personal grievances. And as Biden signals a return to multinational diplomacy, the Trump administration’s demands offer a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the deal-making of a president who favored aggressive, unpredictable moves over more conventional negotiations.
As has often been the case during Trump’s presidency, his administration was divided, current and former officials said.
Diplomats and veteran health officials said the list contained reasonable requests that might have been easily negotiated through normal channels. (The WHO has since made some changes anyway.) But it also contained politically sensitive, if not inappropriate, demands.
“It doesn’t seem to reveal a clear strategic vision,” said Gian Luca Burci, a former counsel to the health organization who reviewed the list for The New York Times.
Experts said it was easy to see why, in the face of Trump’s withdrawal and his efforts to deflect blame for the pandemic, Tedros chose not to negotiate.
“It was an enormous backfire, and it was bound to be,” added Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor and longtime WHO adviser who also reviewed the list. “It wasn’t a negotiation. It was blackmail.”
The State Department did not directly address its proposed terms but said it had acted in good faith in calling for needed changes.
“At a critical moment when the WHO leadership had the opportunity to rebuild trust among some of its critical member states, it chose a path that did the very opposite and demonstrated its lack of independence from the Chinese Communist Party,” Bremberg, the U.S. ambassador in Geneva, said in a statement.
The WHO did not comment. Several current and former Trump administration officials and Western diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose private conversations.
The U.S. list was the product of months of growing irritation with Tedros, whom senior administration officials saw as too quick to praise China or frame the outbreak in ways favorable to Beijing. Tedros, for example, announced in January that China would share biological samples with the world. But he declined to speak up when China never made good on that promise.
The WHO had also quietly acquiesced to Beijing’s conditions before an international mission in February and ceded control of an investigation into the virus’s origins.
Some European health officials and diplomats shared the Trump administration’s concerns, officials said. But they regarded these as minor issues in the midst of a pandemic.
Trump was particularly focused on the issue of travel. The WHO had a long-standing policy of unrestricted travel. As health experts began reconsidering that policy, Trump became preoccupied with getting credit for having halted some travel from China to the United States in February.
By April, as Trump toyed with withdrawing the United States from the WHO, two camps emerged in his administration, current and former officials said. The first group, which included Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, wanted to leave and rally support for a health agency built around Western allies.
Others — like Bremberg; Alex Azar, the health secretary; and Adam Boehler, head of the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. — argued that only the WHO was backed up by a global treaty. If the United States could get the health agency to make changes, they said, it made sense to stay.
That argument prevailed into May, and Trump wrote a letter — which he released on Twitter — with an ultimatum. He would leave the WHO if it did not “commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days.”
Exactly what changes Trump sought, however, remained unclear. The final list emerged from discussions between the White House, State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services. In Geneva, Bremberg consulted with European allies, who were eager to keep Trump from abandoning the health organization, Western diplomats said.
By late May, the list stood at seven items. The first called for investigations into the WHO’s handling of the outbreak and the source of the virus. U.S. officials said they saw this as an easy request; more than 140 countries had already endorsed these investigations.
In July, Tedros would do just that. He appointed Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia, to lead an investigation into the response to the pandemic. A separate investigation into the virus’s origins is slowly getting underway.
Second, the United States asked Tedros to call on China to provide live virus samples and stop censoring Chinese doctors and journalists. This would have been a significant break for the WHO, which rarely criticizes members. Tedros has told colleagues that he sees no benefit in such criticism, especially during a pandemic.
Conceding to the Trump administration’s demand would have meant allowing one country to dictate the organization’s posture toward another. But in Washington, one senior White House official recalled this as a key condition, a signal of Tedros’ independence.
The third item asked Tedros to say that countries were right to consider travel restrictions during the pandemic — a break from the long-standing advice that limiting travel would not slow the virus but would harm economies and delay medical treatment.
The WHO had already begun to soften that stance by the time Bremberg delivered the list. In April, the organization called for “appropriate and proportionate restrictions” on domestic and international travel.
But Tedros interpreted the request as demanding that he apologize to Trump and say the president was right to restrict travel from China, according to public health officials and diplomats who have talked to him. Tedros was wary of being drawn into the U.S. presidential campaign, where travel restrictions were a rallying cry for the Trump campaign.
Gostin, who agrees that the WHO should study and revisit its travel guidance, said it was inappropriate for the United States to try to strong-arm the change. He said the list smacked of politics, not good health policy.
“It was all about my country, my politics, my election,” he said.
The fourth item on the list called for the WHO to dispatch a team to Taiwan to study its successful pandemic response. Taiwan is not a member of the health organization, and Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its own, exerts tremendous pressure to keep the WHO from engaging with Taiwan’s government.
The U.S. requests also called for the WHO to prequalify coronavirus drugs and vaccines for use around the world once they were authorized by major regulators in the United States, Canada, Europe or Japan. That could help fast-track important treatments, but it could also have been seen as allowing the United States to influence the health organization’s drug-approval policy.
The Trump administration also asked Tedros to ensure that countries like the United States that contribute heavily to the WHO are proportionally represented on the organization’s staff. And it sought support for proposed changes put forward by the Group of 7 — the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Canada and Italy. That request is moot, as the G-7 proposal has been folded into larger overhaul efforts.
By the time Bremberg and Tedros met in Geneva, however, the political ground had shifted in Washington.
Meadows, the White House chief of staff, believed that negotiations with Tedros were a long shot. Even if they succeeded, he argued, they would take too long and yield too little, one senior administration official recalled.
Trump had already planned a news conference criticizing China. Shortly before the event, the president’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, joined Meadows, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Boehler in Meadows’ office in the West Wing, according to the official. From that meeting emerged a plan: Trump would withdraw the country from the WHO.
Trump agreed and added the announcement to the news conference. He had done something similar in 2018, announcing that he was quitting a United Nations postal pact, only to reverse himself after winning concessions.
Tedros showed no appetite for such deal-making. He told colleagues that he felt boxed in, stuck between China and the United States. Speaking to reporters soon after Trump’s announcement, Tedros said that U.S. partnership had served humanity for decades.
“It has made a great difference in public health all around the world,” he said. “It is WHO’s wish for this collaboration to continue.”

James D. Wolfensohn, Who Steered World Bank for 10 Years, Dies at 86

Texto completo: He was a force on Wall Street before taking the reins of the bank in 1995, then proceeded to shake it up. He did the same at both Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center.
James D. Wolfensohn, who escaped a financially pinched Australian childhood to become a top Wall Street deal maker and a two-term president of the World Bank, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
His daughter Naomi Wolfensohn confirmed the death.
Mr. Wolfensohn was a force on Wall Street for years, helping to rescue the Chrysler Corporation while working for Salomon Brothers and running his own thriving boutique firm, before President Bill Clinton nominated him to lead the World Bank, the world's largest economic development institution.
But he was more than a financier. He led fund-raising efforts as chairman of Carnegie Hall and headed a revival of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. An accomplished cellist under the tutelage of the renowned Jacqueline du Pré, he performed at Carnegie Hall on his milestone birthdays. And as a university fencing champion, he was part of Australia's 1956 Olympic team, competing in front of his fellow Australians in Melbourne.
But his main legacy was his stewardship of the World Bank, to which President Clinton nominated him in 1995 after he had given up his Australian citizenship 14 years earlier to qualify for the job, only to be passed over.
Arriving at the bank's Washington headquarters to begin his first five-year term, he found life there too comfortable and its staff members demoralized -- a professional malaise, he said, that had them denigrating the bank to their families and even to the news media.
He immediately attacked the bank's "complacency and insularity," as he put it. He found that the bank's emphasis on technocratic, market-based reforms was inhibiting its central mission: aiding the world's poorest countries.
"I was throwing a grenade into an entrenched culture," he wrote in his 2010 memoir, "A Global Life: My Journey Among Rich and Poor, From Sydney to Wall Street to the World Bank."
A priority for Mr. Wolfensohn was to make field visits to poor nations less ceremonial than his predecessors had, and to listen to poor people themselves describe their governance, history and culture. He mounted a campaign against corruption in World Bank projects, breaking what he called "a wall of silence" on the subject. His efforts led to stepped-up audits and put the issue higher on the agendas of developing countries.
"He made it acceptable to talk about corruption," said Hazel Denton, then a senior project economist for the bank. "Until his time in office, we tended to sweep the topic under the carpet in the interest of getting projects 'done' and getting loans disbursed."
Another Wolfensohn initiative was to shift the bank's policy on debt incurred by its mostly impoverished African and South American client countries. Instead of insisting on repayment, he sought to write off much of the debt.
"How, I reasoned, could you have a lending business to borrowers of low credit and then pretend that you would be repaid 100 percent on every loan?" he wrote. "I thought that any system that relied on this logic was doomed."
Catching something of a popular wave, including support from Pope John Paul II (who cited the absolving of debt in Leviticus), World Bank directors in 1996 approved $ 500 million for a relief trust fund; three years later, they relaxed eligibility for faster and deeper debt relief.
Mr. Wolfensohn said he was particularly proud of having installed a high-speed communications network linking affiliates in 80 countries, allowing interactive video conferencing and distance learning. "Modest, he wasn't," declared Fauzia S. Rashid, a staff member who worked with him.
A Family Scraping By
James David Wolfensohn was born on Dec. 1, 1933, and grew up in Sydney, Australia, where his parents, Hyman and Dora Wolfensohn, had moved from London in 1928. The family, which included an older sister, Betty, was always in financial stress even though his father had at one time moved in the upper echelons of British society: He had met James Armand de Rothschild in the British Army and then served as his private secretary, before having a falling-out that the elder Mr. Wolfensohn never explained.
The family's failure to establish itself in Australia weighed heavily on young James from about the age of 7, producing an obsession with monetary insecurity that carried long into his adult life.
As a child Mr. Wolfensohn"was always doing contingency planning in my head." he recounted in his memoir. "I remember thinking that if I could have just 10 pounds, my life would be safe. As I grew older I would do calculations on scraps of paper and work out how long I could live on 100 pounds if I only ate cheese and bread."
After early academic failures related to grade levels beyond his years -- he entered the University of Sydney at 16 -- Mr. Wolfensohn suddenly began to thrive under the intense mentorship of a renowned professor, Julius Stone, a friend of his father's. He graduated in 1954.
During law school Mr. Wolfensohn obtained a clerkship with a top Sydney firm, Allen Allen & Hemsley, where a colleague introduced him to fencing. Preferring the épée to the saber despite not being tall and lean, he did well against world-class Italian and British competitors in the Melbourne Olympics before, by his account, becoming distracted and losing.
"The most exciting moment in his life was when he made the Olympics" as a confidence-lacking "colonial kid," his wife, Elaine Wolfensohn, put it in an interview for this obituary in January. "It had an enormous impact on who he was, who he became."
With full legal credentials, Mr. Wolfensohn worked on a major antitrust case involving American companies and then decided to apply to Harvard Business School. He eventually flew to attend the school free of charge because of his service in the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve.
While studying there he met Elaine Botwinick, a Wellesley senior who had grown up in Manhattan and New Rochelle, N.Y. They married in 1961 and had three children, Sara, Naomi and Adam.
Ms. Wolfensohn died in August at 83. An advocate for education and the arts, she was an adviser to many boards of directors, including those of American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and Teachers College at Columbia University. Thursday would have been the Wolfensohns' 59th wedding anniversary.
Mr. Wolfensohn is survived by his children and by seven grandchildren.
After a brief stint with a Swiss cement company, Mr. Wolfensohn returned to Australia to work for a number of banks, including J. Henry Schroder, which sent him to its headquarters in London and then to run its New York office. But when passed over in London for the chairmanship of Schroder, a blue-blood bastion -- he said the rejection had "shattered" his fragile sense of security -- he sought out Salomon Brothers.
"I was being thrown into the deep end of the toughest business in New York," he recounted.
After his modest British salary, he said, the idea of earning $ 2 million to $ 3 million a year "was both scary and exhilarating," because this was his first job without what he called a financial safety net.
His Own Shop
Mr. Wolfensohn reorganized and built Salomon's corporate department and helped rescue the Chrysler Corporation through a huge government bailout in 1979 -- the largest in American history at the time. Some partners at the firm thought he had spent too much time on the Chrysler deal, however, and his relationship with Salomon soured.
He left the firm after Robert S. McNamara, the head of the World Bank, told him that he had put Mr. Wolfensohn's name on a list of people who might succeed him. To qualify for the post, Mr. Wolfenson quickly became an American citizen, only to see the job go to Alden W. Clausen. (Mr. Wolfensohn later regained his Australian citizenship.)
Seizing the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream of owning his own business, he opened James D. Wolfensohn Inc., a boutique Wall Street adviser that immediately thrived.
One prominent deal came after Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chief executive of IBM and a board member of The New York Times Company, called to ask if Mr. Wolfensohn would assist in The Times's purchase of The Boston Globe.
"I felt proud that he had picked us from among all the Wall Street firms, not because I had approached him but because of our reputation for skill and integrity," Mr. Wolfensohn wrote in his memoir. "With the help of our distinguished neighbor and friend, Arthur ('Punch') Sulzberger, the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, and his immensely competent team, we made a successful transaction."
Twenty years later, however, in a period of downsizing, The Times sold The Globe and other New England media properties for $ 70 million, far below the $ 1.1 billion it had paid.
Mr. Wolfensohn became chairman of Carnegie Hall in 1980 and helped raise about $ 60 million to renovate it after donating $ 1 million of his own. Ten years later he was invited to help rescue the financially ailing John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, also as chairman. As he wrote in his memoir, he found the Kennedy Center to be a "white elephant" badly in need of physical repairs and more energetic programming.
He also worked for decades on behalf of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.
Mr. Wolfensohn was made an honorary officer of the Order of Australia in 1987 and received an honorary knighthood of the Order of the British Empire in 1995.
A Carnegie Hall Debut
At a dinner party one evening, Mr. Wolfensohn, who was 42 at the time, impulsively said that he had always wanted to learn to play the cello. Ms. du Pré had one delivered the next day and agreed to give him lessons on the condition that he would play a concert on his 50th birthday.
Seven years later, Daniel Barenboim, the pianist and conductor (and Ms. du Pré's husband), reminded him of his pledge and told him that a private performance would not suffice. The concert would be chamber music at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Barenboim said, insisting that Mr. Wolfensohn, who had never played chamber music and never played in public, perform there. The hall was reserved; the date would be Dec. 1, 1983, his birthday.
A year of intense practice ensued, sometimes in hotel rooms around the world -- all leading to a Walter Mitty-like performance before an audience of hundreds. Onstage with him were the violinist Isaac Stern, the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy and other music royalty; the program consisted of works by Haydn and Schumann.
Similar concerts followed on Mr. Wolfensohn's 60th and 70th birthdays, at the Library of Congress as well as at Carnegie Hall.
On joining the World Bank in 1995, Mr. Wolfensohn divested his stake in his Wall Street firm, where he had recruited Paul A. Volcker to join after Mr. Volcker had retired as chairman of the Federal Reserve. When his partners sold the firm for $ 210 million to the Bankers Trust Company, Mr. Wolfensohn invoked a clause in his own sale agreement to pocket $ 45 million in the bank's stock, half of which he and his wife gave to a family foundation to support the arts, culture and health care.
Ten years later, when he stepped down from the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn formed Wolfensohn & Company, another boutique advisory.
His last major undertaking was in the mid-2000s as a special envoy for a diplomatic group known as the Quartet -- made up of the United Nations, the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union -- which was seeking an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal in which Israel would disengage from the Gaza Strip. If the deal were struck, he was to help coordinate revitalization efforts once the Palestinian authorities had taken over the area, the U.N. said at the time.
However, the negotiations failed.
"The Middle East," Mr. Wolfensohn grimly observed, "turned out to be my mission impossible."

Texto completo: Frontex is under fire for letting Greece illegally repel migrants as the agency expands to play a more central role at the bloc's external borders.
BRUSSELS -- Mounting evidence indicates that the European Union's border agency has been complicit in Greece's illegal practice of pushing back migrants to Turkey, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with officials.
In at least one case, Frontex, as the E.U. border agency is known, is accused of having helped cover up the violations, when a crew said it was discouraged by agency officials from reporting that they had seen the Greek authorities setting a boatload of migrants adrift in Turkish waters.
The case is currently being investigated by Frontex. But it has fueled suspicions that the agency, newly boosted in its role as upholder of the rule of law at E.U. borders, is not just sporadically aware of such abuses, but that it plays a role in concealing them.
"We are seeing an erosion of the rule of law at the E.U. borders which is willful," said Gerald Knaus, a migration expert. "This is deeply worrying because it is eroding the refugee convention on the continent on which it was created."
Throughout this year, The New York Times and others have reported on growing operations by the Greek Coast Guard to repel migrants from Greek waters back to Turkey, reports the Greek authorities deny amount to breaches of international laws.
But revelations that Frontex has witnessed pushbacks have thrown the agency into a governance crisis that threatens to further blight the European Union's liberal values, once again calling into question the bloc's commitment to upholding its own laws on refugees.
The cases have also highlighted a conundrum at the core of E.U. ambitions to tighten external borders by pooling resources and involving the bloc in the sensitive, zealously shielded work of sovereign border guards.
Frontex is the European Union's best-funded agency, with a budget of over $ 500 million, and will soon deploy the first uniformed officers in the bloc's history. It has been built up specifically to help in migrant-rescue operations as the burden of policing Europe's borders has fallen most heavily on its peripheral states, like Greece.
It was also intended as a deterrent to the kind of mass arrival of refugees that sowed political crises across Europe after 2015, and fanned nationalist and populist movements.
Yet Frontex is not empowered to stop national border guards from committing violations, and it is not clear how it can play a role as standard-bearer of E.U. laws when informing on national forces risks the working relationships on which its operations depend.
Refugee arrivals to the European Union peaked five years ago and have dropped drastically since, but thousands of asylum seekers, many fleeing the wars in Afghanistan and Syria, still attempt the crossing. Unlike in the past, Greeks and their government have turned hostile to the new arrivals, exhausted by years in which asylum seekers have been bottled up in overrun camps on Greek islands.
There is also a growing belief in the Greek and several other European governments that aggression at the borders and poor conditions at migrant camps will make the attempt to reach Europe less attractive for asylum seekers.
Earlier this year, an analysis by The Times showed that the Greek government had secretly expelled more than 1,000 asylum seekers, often by sailing them to the edge of Greek territorial waters and abandoning them in flimsy inflatable life rafts in violation of international laws.
The Greek Coast Guard has rescued thousands of asylum seekers over the years but has become much more aggressive this year, especially as Turkey used migrants to provoke Greece by encouraging them to cross the border.
The Greek government has denied it is doing anything illegal in repelling migrant boats from its national waters, characterizing the operations as robust border guarding. But Mr. Knaus said "the denials are not serious," and the practices are effectively happening in the open -- under the eyes of E.U. border patrols.
The documents obtained by The Times describe, in Coast Guard vernacular littered with acronyms, codes, time-stamps and coordinates, a seemingly incessant Ping-Pong of migrant dinghies between Greek and Turkish waters, with Frontex crews on vessels or aircraft in observer status.
Four officials with direct knowledge of Frontex operations said that agency officials have been discouraging crews from filing reports on pushback incidents, and, in some cases, have stopped initial alerts of violations from being filed as "serious incident reports," at times after consulting with the Greek authorities.
They all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were concerned about losing their jobs, or were not authorized to brief the press.
The Frontex spokesman, Chris Borowski, said the agency took the reporting of violations very seriously. "Pushbacks are illegal under international law," Mr. Borowski said.
In the latest case to come to light, a Swedish Coast Guard crew on deployment under Frontex witnessed a pushback to Turkish waters of a boat full of migrants by the Greek authorities on Oct. 30 off the Greek island of Chios.
The Swedish crew was later advised by a Frontex officer to not report it, documents reviewed by The Times show. The Swedish representative to the management board of Frontex described the incident, and the suppression of the attempt to report it, at a meeting on Nov. 10 -- the first known case of an E.U. member state reporting active interference by Frontex officials.
The Swedish government did not comment. A spokesman for Frontex said the agency wouldn't comment because of an "ongoing procedure."
Frontex has been working in Greece for more than a decade, providing sea, land and aerial surveillance and rescue capabilities and deploying crews from other member states under its command.
The details now emerging push the agency deeper into a governance crisis which began in October when a consortium of news organizations, including the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, reported a number of occasions when Frontex crews witnessed pushbacks in Greece.
The European Commission, which is part of the Frontex oversight system but does not control the agency, pushed for a special inquiry into these allegations and, at an emergency agency board meeting on Nov. 10, asked its leadership to answer detailed questions in writing.
The answers arrived with a four-day delay, just 15 hours before the start of another meeting to discuss the problems on Wednesday. Yet another emergency meeting has been called in December, mounting pressure on the agency.
Frontex has promised internal investigations but also quickly dismissed allegations, saying for example, in a letter seen by The Times, that it would look into the Swedish case, but that it had so far found no evidence that it happened.
How these investigations shake out will matter a great deal for the future of Frontex, which was once little more than a back-office operation in Warsaw but now finds itself on the front lines of the nettlesome issue of migration that has the potency to make or break governments.
Apart from helping member states with asylum-seeker arrivals, Frontex's role as an E.U. agency by law is to respect fundamental rights, and bring up human-rights standards across national E.U. border agencies, which often don't have a strong culture of upholding them.
But claims that Frontex does not take fundamental rights seriously enough are growing. This year, only one million euros in its budget of 460 million euros -- about $ 548 million -- was allocated to rights monitoring.
The agency was supposed to hire 40 fundamental-rights officers by Dec. 5 but the jobs have not yet been advertised. The agency is currently hiring for their boss, after years of staffing issues around that position. A Frontex spokesman said the delays stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic.
Documents seen by The Times laid out how in one episode the Greek authorities were consulted before a report was made, and were able to suppress it. On Aug. 10, a German crew deployed by Frontex reported that a Greek Coast Guard vessel "took up border control measures prohibiting the landing to Samos."
The expression refers to maneuvering and making waves around a dinghy to repel it. The event was not recorded as a "serious incident," because, the document said, the Greek Coast Guard argued the activities "do not provide any ground" to initiate such a report.
Another incident, which a Frontex aerial crew observed and reported in detail to its headquarters, took place on the evening of April 18 to 19 off the coast of Lesbos, and lasted more than five hours.
A dinghy was detected by the Greek authorities and approximately 20 migrants were rescued and put on board a Greek Coast Guard vessel shortly after midnight, their empty dinghy towed by the Coast Guard toward the island.
But instead of being taken to shore, at 2:45 a.m., the migrants were put back on their dinghy and tugged to Turkish waters by the Greek Coast Guard, the Frontex aerial crew reported.
As events unfolded, the Greek command center twice asked the Frontex aircraft to change its flight path, directing it away from the incident.
"At 03:21 Frontex Surveillance Aircraft communicates that the rubber boat has no engine and it is adrift. Greek assets are departing the area leaving the rubber boat adrift," the document said.
The internal Frontex report detailing this incident and categorizing it as a fundamental-rights violation was "dismissed," the document shows.

Texto completo: Warped by the pandemic like the rest of 2020, Thanksgiving arrived for a fatigued, grieving nation not as a day to gather, but a day when people were implored not to.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, alcohol was banned at Pennsylvania bars Wednesday night and Temple University's Saturday football game, its season finale, was canceled. New Jersey issued a blanket advisory against all interstate travel. Families were keeping their distance, not coming together.
And across the commonwealth, the pandemic's death toll - the number of people who will be missing from their families' Thanksgiving tables - surpassed 10,000 people. In New Jersey, it's 15,057.
"It's not too late to change your plans for tomorrow," Gov. Phil Murphy pleaded in a tweet Wednesday morning. Throughout the region and the country, public officials and health experts have asked people to celebrate only with the people they live with.
The uniquely American holiday comes as America's coronavirus pandemic worsens into an increasingly unique crisis: In the last two weeks alone, more than 2 million people contracted the virus, according to New York Times data. And Tuesday saw the highest number of COVID-19 deaths reported nationwide since early May, around 2,100.
Pennsylvania reported 6,759 newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 144 virus-related deaths Wednesday.
About 3,897 people were hospitalized with coronavirus complications in Pennsylvania as of Wednesday, officials said, 826 of them in intensive care units. More than four-fifths of the state's approximately 4,000 ICU beds were filled, according to state data.
Pennsylvania said it would start sending pandemic-related advisories to cell phones using the national alert system used for emergency messages. The Wolf administration planned to send the first message Wednesday, with a choice to opt into alerts about each region of the state.
New Jersey reported 4,073 new cases and 50 deaths Wednesday. The state also scrapped its long-running travel advisory that listed states from which travelers must quarantine, instead saying all nonessential interstate travel is discouraged because of the ongoing surge.
Residents or visitors who enter New Jersey from any state except Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, or Connecticut are asked to quarantine for 14 days.
In Philadelphia, city officials reported 1,246 new COVID-19 cases and eight deaths.
A City Council committee on Wednesday approved legislation to extend a requirement for landlords to participate in an eviction diversion program aimed at keeping Philadelphians in their homes during the coronavirus program. The bill now goes to the full council.
Meanwhile, a new study found that less than 10% of the U.S. population has evidence of infection-fighting antibodies to the coronavirus.
The study by researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine is the largest and broadest to estimate how many people have the protective antibodies in their blood.
The U.S. has seen nearly 13 million confirmed cases of the virus. Experts say 60% to 70% of the population would have to develop immunity, either through infection or vaccination, to make disease spread unlikely, or obtain "herd immunity."
And as the holiday season officially kicked off, a group of more than 400 Pennsylvania hospital doctors, nurses, and leaders on Wednesday asked residents to help them stop the spread of the virus.
"One person's actions make a small difference; many people together can make a huge impact," they wrote in a statement publicized by the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania. "Please help us protect each other, our families, neighbors, and communities."
Most Americans said they were staying home with their households for Thanksgiving, heeding health officials' warnings, according to a survey of 150,000 Americans commissioned by the New York Times. Only 27% said they planned to eat with people outside their household.
Addressing the nation Wednesday afternoon, President-elect Joe Biden called on Americans to celebrate Thanksgiving with just a few family members and to remain optimistic despite the tragedy, pain, and anxiety that has marked the past nine months.
He said his family has called off their usual large gathering and he and his wife will be celebrating only with their daughter, Ashley, and son-in-law, Howard Krein, at home in Wilmington.
Biden called reducing the size of turkey dinners and following public health guidelines "our patriotic duty as Americans." And he spoke to families who have lost loved ones, referencing the 2015 death of his son Beau.
"It's really hard to care. It's hard to give thanks. It's hard to even think of looking forward. It's hard to hope," Biden said. "I'm thinking of every one of you at your Thanksgiving table, because we've been there."

Texto completo: Donald Trump is exiting political life much the same way he entered it, pushing conspiracy theories for personal gain. Now, as then, these aren’t just any old conspiracy theories, but ones that hinge on the fundamental illegitimacy of a whole class of Americans.
Trump made his first serious foray into national politics with “birtherism,” the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the United States, making him an illegal president. It was a public expression of Trump’s belief that citizenship is tied to blood and ethnicity — that some Americans are Americans, some are less so and some just aren’t.
The voter fraud conspiracy to which Trump hitched his attempt to hold onto power falls under the same umbrella, an attempt to write millions of Americans out of the electorate on the basis of race and heritage, instead of just one person out of the office of the presidency.
The essence of the campaign’s legal and political argument, after all, is that Trump won the election, or would have, if not for mass electoral fraud, all in swing states and only then in those cities with sizable Black populations, specifically Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. To right the ship, his campaign asked various courts to toss out votes in these cities, invalidating hundreds of thousands of Black votes to hand the president a second term.
Rudy Giuliani said exactly that without shame or embarrassment at a news conference last week.
The margin in Michigan is 146,121 and these ballots were all cast basically in Detroit that Biden won 80-20. So you see it changes the result of the election in Michigan if you take out Wayne County. So it’s a very significant case.
The Trump movement has never been about “populism” or “nationalism” or the interests of working Americans. It has always and only been about the contours of our national community: who belongs and who doesn’t; who counts and who shouldn’t; who can wield power and who must be subject to it.
And the answers, no matter how much the president’s defenders and apologists pretend otherwise, have race at their core. Yes, Trump will take support from anyone who wants to give it to him, but the Americans that matter — whose votes must be counted, whose wishes must be heard, respected and fulfilled — are the white ones, and of them, only a subset.
I call this “Trumpism,” but none of this began with the president. Trump did not force the Republican Party in Michigan and Wisconsin to create districts so slanted as to make a mockery of representative government in their states; he did not tell the North Carolina Republican Party to devise and pass a voter identification bill targeting the state’s Black voters for disenfranchisement with “surgical precision”; he didn’t push Republican election officials in Georgia to indiscriminately purge their voter rolls or pressure Florida Republicans into practically nullifying a state constitutional amendment — passed by ballot measure — to give voting rights to former felons.
The Republican Party’s contempt for democracy and embrace of minoritarian rules and institutions predate Trump and will continue after he leaves the scene. It does not seem to matter that Republicans can clearly compete and win in high turnout elections since hostility to democratic participation has become as much a part of the party’s identity as its commitment to low taxes and so-called small government.
What does this mean for the future of our politics? In the near-term, the president’s haphazard attempt to nullify the election is probably the start of a new normal, in which it is standard procedure for Republican politicians to allege fraud and challenge the results, tying the outcome up in federal court until it’s either untenable — or somehow successful. And even if it doesn’t work, the attempt still stands as a ritual affirming the belief that some Americans count more than others, and that our democracy is legitimate only insofar as it empowers the people, narrowly defined, over the mere majority.
In “Talking to Strangers: Anxieties of Citizenship Since Brown v. Board of Education,” political theorist Danielle S. Allen observes that, “An honest account of collective democratic action must begin by acknowledging that communal decisions inevitably benefit some citizens at the expense of others, even when the whole community generally benefits.”
She continues: “The hard truth of democracy is that some citizens are always giving things up for others. Only vigorous forms of citizenship can give a polity the resources to deal with the inevitable problem of sacrifice.”
What if the thing we need some citizens to give up is a sense of superiority, a sense that they are — or ought to be — first among equals? And what if they refuse? What do we do about our democracy when one group of citizens, or at least its chosen representatives, rejects the egalitarian ideal at the heart of democratic practice?
These aren’t new questions in American history. But unless we plan to recapitulate the worst parts of our past, we will have to come up with new answers.

Texto completo: So, what do you think Donald Trump is giving thanks for this year?
A) Peace and good fellowship throughout the land.
B) His thrilling campaign to overturn the election.
C) Melania’s new blond look.
I know, you’re hoping it’s going to be C. But the man is obsessed with his reelection resurrection.
“One thing has become clear these last few days, I am the American People’s ALL-TIME favorite President,” he wrote to his mailing list, a very large group of citizens who’ve gotten hundreds of missives along these lines since Election Day.
The all-important bottom line of this correspondence is that everyone should send Donald Trump $5 right away. And, of course, more is OK.
In his real outside life — the one he’ll be returning to in just a few weeks — Trump is definitely in need of those fivers. He owed tons of money when he first ran for office. Now a $400 million bill is coming due. And his prize customer, the Republican faithful, is looking a bit shaky. Republicans spent more than $23 million at Trump-owned businesses since he started his campaign for president five years ago. That’s more than 100 times as much as in the five years prior. And not necessarily a sum that will continue through his Mar-a-Lago exile.
Something needs to be done! And you cannot help but notice that currently, Trump’s one absolute prize Guernsey of a cash cow seems to be his postelection reelection campaign, “Save America.”
“Friend,” he asks in another mass email, “Will you allow the CORRUPT Democrats to try to STEAL this Election and impart their RADICAL agenda on our Country? Or will you step UP and DEFEND your Country?” It’s both a plea for cash and a reminder that when the nation looks back on the Trump era it will see a time when capital letters ruled the earth.
But if an eager reader decided to send “Save America” a donation to “protect the integrity of this Election,” it’s hard to know where it’d go. According to an email sent under Eric’s name, the money is earmarked for “legal teams in each critical state.” Which is certainly possible. Although experts say the money could also pay consulting fees for the kids. Or even the kennel fees for the family pet, if only Trump didn’t hate dogs.
(This last bit of information has nothing to do with Save America. It’s just a sneaky way to work in another reminder that Joe Biden has two shepherds, Major, who came from a rescue center, and Champ.)
Back to the money.
Our president does have trouble hanging onto cash, whether it’s his or ours. The guy who vowed to eliminate the national debt if elected is leaving office in a fiscal year that recorded the biggest one-year debt figure ever, $3.1 trillion. And during the entire glorious four years, the national red ink went from $14.4 trillion to $21.1 trillion.
The return of Trump to his business empire is not going to solve its problems. First, because he seems very bad at handling money, and second, because he doesn’t really intend to go back to a civilian life. If he did, history suggests he’d only succeed in building another tower of overdue bills.
While the alleged Trump agenda right now is overturning the national election results, clearly the real plan is to gear up for a comeback in 2024. It’s a pretty dramatic goal. There has been only one president in U.S. history who lost reelection and then ran and won four years later. That would be Grover Cleveland.
If you’re ever talking about Trump’s political ambition, be sure to refer to it as “pulling a Grover.”
Almost everything Trump does to challenge the election returns or raise money for his next presidential campaign can trickle over to something more personal and short-term. For instance, is he going to try to collect cash for a presidential library? That’s normal for a person in his position. Even though the first noun you connect with Donald Trump is not “contemplation” or “scholarly research.”
Or even “book.”
It’s become expected for former presidents to raise money for a place to display their memorabilia, host gatherings and sponsor research. But if you get a request for a Donald Trump Library contribution, do not feel compelled to follow through. Even if they offer you a free copy of Ivanka’s “Women Who Work” or Donald Jr.’s magnum opus on “How the Left Thrives on Hate.”
Short-term, of course, it’s perfectly OK to blot this out. Spend the holidays on the easy stuff. Biden’s dogs. Don Jr.’s career options. And the inauguration — how do you think Trump will behave? Defeated presidents usually go to see their opponent get sworn in. Even Herbert Hoover, who really, really resented Franklin Roosevelt’s victory, rode with FDR from the White House to the Capitol. Didn’t talk much, just sort of sulked and stared. FDR found other ways to keep himself busy as he rode through the rapturous cheering crowd.
But Hoover-Trump is not a great comparison. Unless you can imagine Donald spending his post-presidential career working on famine relief projects.
Trump certainly regards himself now as a once and future candidate, and a recent Politico poll showed 53% of Republicans are ready to vote for him in the 2024 presidential primaries. Twelve percent prefer Mike Pence and 8% opt for Donald Jr.
I hope Pence is aware that only 4% of his party regards him as a better potential president than Junior. Really, if you want to invest in the future of any Trump minions, I’d go for a line of Rudy Giuliani hair products.

Trump, Still Claiming Victory, Says He Will Leave if Electors Choose Biden

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would leave the White House if the Electoral College formalized Joe Biden’s election as president, even as he reiterated baseless claims of fraud that he said would make it “very hard” to concede.
Taking questions from reporters for the first time since Election Day, Trump also threw himself into the battle for Senate control, saying he would soon travel to Georgia to support Republican candidates in two runoff elections scheduled there on Jan. 5.
When asked whether he would leave office in January after the Electoral College cast its votes for Biden on Dec. 14 as expected, Trump replied: “Certainly I will. Certainly I will.”
Speaking in the Diplomatic Room of the White House after a Thanksgiving video conference with members of the U.S. military, the president insisted that “shocking” new evidence about voting problems would surface before Inauguration Day. “It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” he said, “because we know that there was massive fraud.”
But even as he continued to deny the reality of his defeat, Trump also seemed to acknowledge that his days as president were numbered.
“Time is not on our side,” he said, in a rare admission of weakness. He also complained that what he referred to, prematurely, as “the Biden administration” had declared its intention to scrap his “America First” foreign policy vision.
The president was also strikingly testy at one point, lashing out at a reporter who interjected during one of his several rambling statements about the supposedly fraudulent election.
“You’re just a lightweight,” Trump snapped, raising his voice and pointing a finger in anger. “Don’t talk to me that — don’t talk — I’m the president of the United States. Don’t ever talk to the president that way.”
If Trump sees the end of his presidency as inevitable, he clearly still believes he can bolster his legacy — and badly undermine Biden, the man who is ending it — by helping to preserve a Republican Senate that could serve as a wall against the new Democratic agenda.
The election results left Democrats holding 48 seats in the Senate. If Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, the Democratic challengers in Georgia, can both pull off victories over Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, their party will gain de facto control of a Senate divided 50-50 because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would wield a tiebreaking vote.
In his remarks Thursday, Trump said he would visit Georgia on Saturday. Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, later clarified that the president meant Saturday, Dec. 5.
The president added that he could return to the state to back the Republicans a second time, “depending on how they’re doing.”
It is unclear how helpful Trump’s appearances would be for the two embattled Republican incumbents. After a hand recount of a close vote, Georgia declared Biden the winner there Nov. 19 by a margin of 12,284 votes. Biden is the first Democrat to carry the state in a presidential election since Bill Clinton in 1992.
Trump insisted Thursday that he had won the vote by a significant margin. “We were robbed. We were robbed,” he said. “I won that by hundreds of thousands of votes. Everybody knows it.”
Asked whether he would attend Biden’s inauguration, as is customary for a departing president, Trump was coy.
“I don’t want to say that yet,” the president said, adding, “I know the answer, but I just don’t want to say.”
At times, Trump shifted his explanation of his defeat from claims of fraud to complaints that the political battlefield had been slanted against him, casting the news media and technology companies as his enemies.
“If the media were honest and big tech was fair, it wouldn’t even be a contest,” he said. “And I would have won by a tremendous amount.”
After seeming to concede reality, Trump quickly caught himself and revised his conditional statement.
“And I did win by a tremendous amount,” he added.

This Year’s Black Friday Designer Fashion Sales May Not Be What You Think.

Fashion designers and luxury retailers have always had a complicated relationship with Black Friday.
The super sale extravaganza doesn’t always fit right (no pun intended) with companies that make $890 shoes and $3,700 dresses. The pandemic only focused the issue: It wreaked havoc on supply chains and delayed the delivery of many items, potentially telescoping the amount of time products would remain on shelves at full price before the holiday sales begin.
So back in May, designer Dries Van Noten and retailer Andrew Keith, now at Selfridge’s in London, convened a discussion over Zoom with other designers and chief executives to seize the moment to address long-needed change regarding when and how high-end clothes are delivered and discounted.
They came up with a series of suggestions and published an “Open Letter” to the industry calling on others to join their cause: to deliver clothes in season and keep them on sale at full price until after the holidays. More than 500 international retailers and designers signed on.
Yet here we are on Black Friday, and many of those signatories are conducting what look very much like sales as usual.
“Cyber Deals Up to 50% Off” blares a red banner on the Nordstrom site (Pete Nordstrom, co-president, signed the letter). There are also sales at Tory Burch, Bergdorf Goodman and the Webster, to name a few other brands whose executives were among the signatories.
So were the pledges of change a lot of style sound and fashion fury, signifying nothing? Is this corporate hypocrisy in a Santa costume?
Both Nordstrom and Bergdorf Goodman declined to comment on the question. However, independent boutiques and designers suggest it’s not quite discounts as usual this year. No brand or store wants to be the odd one out in a sea of slashed prices. But that does not mean these designer sales are exactly like the old designer sales.
Karen Murray, owner of New York boutique Fivestory, acknowledged that one of her colleagues did sign the Open Letter, because “the whole industry was hoping that things would slow down.” But, she said, she has to compete. And “as much as I wanted to hold off, in a world where others are extremely promotional, it is hard to stick to a nonpromotional schedule.”
However, she also pointed out that this year’s markdowns would be more limited in both depth and length than those in the more recent past. This time last year, for example, Black Friday was more like Black November, or Black November-Starting-in-October.
Now, “We try to follow the markdown cadence recommended by the brands and designers, but we watch the online sites like a hawk,” said Murray.
Van Noten, the designer, said he received no pushback when he asked his retail partners not to put his products on sale until after Christmas or New Year’s — though in all their bells and whistles around Black Friday, the stores didn’t exactly advertise it (or the other designers who would be exceptions to the markdown rule).
“Communication is one thing,” he said. “Reality is something else.”
Pierre-Yves Roussel, the chief executive of Tory Burch, said much the same, noting that while the company was nodding to Black Friday because of “tradition,” the price drops were limited and under tight controls, focusing primarily on clothing that was time-dependent, rather than accessories such as shoes and bags, which in theory are less tied to trend.
At the Webster, which has eight stores in locations including New York, Houston, Miami and Los Angeles, Laure Heriard Dubreuil, the founder and creative director, said she was still “committed” to the pledge, and so had contacted the designer brands she carried to discuss what items should be on sale, and for how much. Fall merchandise from lines owned by the big French luxury groups LVMH and Kering — such as Balenciaga, Fendi, Givenchy and Saint Laurent — will not be reduced at her stores, although plenty of other brands are. Van Noten said he felt optimistic: The industry working group was still in existence, and they had all just met the week before the Black Friday sales began to talk next steps. Things were moving in the right direction.
“We said from the beginning we didn’t want to be the fashion police, telling people what they can and can’t do,” he said, “but a year ago, we would never have even had this discussion. Business is very fragile right now, but I think the mentality has changed. There’s been an evolution.”

Senate Democrats Face Power Struggle for Top Judiciary Job

WASHINGTON — As soon as Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois learned officially Monday that there would be a Democratic opening at the top of the Judiciary Committee, he was on the phone to his colleagues trying to nail down their support for the position.
“Never take anything for granted,” Durbin said of his bid to replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who stepped aside as the senior Democrat on the panel under intense pressure from progressive activists who deemed her insufficiently aggressive for the job. “I have been through these contests before.”
One fellow Democrat whom Durbin did not talk to was Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who made clear by the next afternoon that he was also interested in the job. Some of the same progressive activists who pressed to shove Feinstein aside said they would be backing him.
The competition set up a rare internal power struggle that reflected broader disputes among Democrats over the direction and approach of their party in a new Congress. As they sort through the results of the election, which handed them control of the White House but left their hopes of taking the Senate hanging by a thread, some are pushing for a new, more combative style and generational change.
Depending on the results of two Senate runoffs in Georgia in January, whoever wins the battle for the post will be either the chairman of the panel or the senior Democrat, with a crucial role to play on a panel that Republicans have turned into a judicial confirmation assembly line.
Durbin is the next in line behind Feinstein on the committee, and Democrats generally adhere to seniority when awarding such posts. The tension in this case partly comes from the fact that Durbin is already the No. 2 leader and holds an important subcommittee chairmanship on the Appropriations panel, which controls federal spending. To some, he is trying to hoard power, potentially at the expense of his own effectiveness in either job.
“Ultimately, this is not going to come down to policy considerations,” said Brian Fallon, the executive director of the progressive advocacy group Demand Justice and a backer of Whitehouse. “It will be about whether the caucus thinks a leadership post and the top spot on a major committee are too much for one member to hold simultaneously.”
Durbin said it was common for Senate leaders to hold a top job on a committee, and his office noted that the whip, the second-ranking official, had routinely done so in the past. First elected to the Senate in 1996, Durbin, 76, who just won his fifth term, has never served as either the chairman or the senior minority member of a full committee. He said he saw this as his chance to influence the direction of a panel he has sat on for 22 years.
Members of both parties have viewed Durbin as an effective advocate for committee Democrats who have chafed at the way Republicans have jammed through nominees in recent years.
“Believe me, I wouldn’t take this on if I didn’t think I could do the job,” he said in an interview this week.
Supporters of Durbin, who has a decidedly liberal record of his own, noted his pursuit of progressive goals on a range of issues.
“Senator Durbin consistently has articulated progressive values at the heart of the Judiciary Committee’s ambit, ranging from checking corporate power through arbitration and bankruptcy reform to promoting fair elections to protecting whistleblowers and civil liberties,” said Daniel Schuman, the policy director at Demand Progress.
Under Republican control since 2015, the committee has been the focal point for that party’s drive to confirm more than 220 conservative federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices and 53 appeals court judges.
Against that backdrop, Whitehouse, 65, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has charted out how a network of advocacy groups has taken money from undisclosed donors to support the confirmation of conservative judges who are seen as potentially sympathetic to their interests.
During the confirmation hearing for Judge Amy Coney Barrett in October, Whitehouse devoted his first round of questioning to laying out his case and telling her that she needed to understand the “forces outside of this room who are pulling strings and pushing sticks and causing the puppet theater to react.”
His push has brought him support from those on the left who believe Democrats have not been aggressive enough in challenging Republicans over the judiciary. But they also see Whitehouse, who was just elected to his third term, as someone who would bring a new perspective at the top of the committee.
“I think it needs a little bit of fresh air, new energy,” said Faiz Shakir, a former top Senate aide and progressive activist who served as the presidential campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Shakir said that his backing of Whitehouse was not a personal complaint against Durbin but that the Rhode Island Democrat had “earned credibility” with his work.
“Giving him the opportunity to lead a committee, I think, would be a good changing of the guard for Senate Democrats to present,” Shakir said.
Durbin credited Whitehouse with doing “excellent work” on exposing the spending behind judicial nominations.
“It’s an important issue, and I’m glad he is raising it,” said Durbin, who has been highly critical of the Republican handling of confirmations and said he would pursue a reset should Democrats win the majority.
“There clearly has to be a balancing of the courts,” he said. “Most Americans are not looking for all Democrats or all Republicans.”
Durbin said that he believed the committee had drifted from its former role as a Senate powerhouse and that he wanted to reinvigorate it. If given the leadership spot, he said, he would try to refocus the committee on voting rights, executive branch oversight, antitrust efforts and opposing liability immunity that Republicans are pursuing in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
Durbin also pointed to his ability to work with Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, who will be either the top Republican or chairman of the panel, particularly on a criminal justice overhaul that became law in 2018. Durbin negotiated an agreement with Grassley on reducing sentences for nonviolent offenders despite the Iowan’s own reservations and pressure to drop the contentious provisions to advance the rest of the legislation.
“Very few people thought we could pass sentencing reform as part of First Step,” said Holly Harris, the president of Justice Action Network, a bipartisan criminal justice reform organization. She credited Durbin with keeping the sentencing aspects alive: “Because of him, criminal justice reform took a first step rather than a timid stumble.”
Internal leadership elections are notoriously difficult to handicap since lawmakers are reluctant to commit publicly to a decision that is made in secret. The election will take place in the coming weeks, before the convening of the new Congress early next year.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the party leader who has to navigate the divide in his caucus, is so far not saying anything about whether he has a preference.
But if there is one thing all Senate Democrats can agree on, it is that they would much prefer that either Durbin or Whitehouse chair the Judiciary Committee rather than serve as its senior Democrat, with the position dependent on the outcome in Georgia.
“We are all pitching in in every way imaginable to help the two candidates down there,” Durbin said.

LONDON — On a Saturday night in July 1986, a band of bureaucrats in raincoats — one contingent from Buckingham Palace, the other from 10 Downing St. — converged on a newsstand in a train station to snap up The Sunday Times, fresh off the presses with a bombshell headline: “Queen Dismayed by ‘Uncaring’ Thatcher.”
It’s a dramatic flourish from the latest season of the “The Crown” — except, according to Andrew Neil, the paper’s editor at the time, it never happened. “Nonsense,” he said. “All first editions are delivered to both” the palace and the prime minister’s residence, making a late-night dash to buy the paper superfluous.
Neil, who published the famous scoop about tensions between Queen Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher, said the invented scene had allowed Peter Morgan, creator of the hugely popular Netflix series about the British royal family, to depict 1980s London as a place of “squalor and vagabonds.”
Through four vivid seasons of “The Crown,” Morgan has never denied taking artistic license with the saga of the royals, playing out their private joys and sorrows against the pageant of 20th-century British history.
Yet “The Crown” is now colliding with the people who wrote the first draft of that history.
That has spun up a tempest in the British news media, even among those who ordinarily profess not to care much about the monarchy. Newspapers and television programs have been full of starchy commentary about how “The Crown” distorts history in its account of the turbulent decade in which Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer and Thatcher wrought a free-market revolution in British society.
The objections range from the personal (the queen’s brittle, coldhearted treatment of her emotionally fragile daughter-in-law, which the critics claim is unfair) to the political (the show’s portrait of Thatcher-era Britain as a right-wing dystopia in the grip of a zealous leader who dares to lecture her sovereign during their weekly audiences). Historians said that is utterly inconceivable.
“There has been such a reaction because Peter Morgan is now writing about events many of us lived through and some of us were at the center of,” said Neil, who edited The Sunday Times from 1983 to 1994.
Neil, who went on to be a broadcaster and publisher, is no reflexive defender of the royal family. Suspicious of Britain’s class system, he said he had sympathies for the republican movement in the 1980s. But he grew to admire how the queen modernized the monarchy after the upheaval of those years and has been critical of renegade royals like Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan.
The events involving Neil did happen: The queen became frustrated with Thatcher when she refused to join the 48 other members of the Commonwealth in backing sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. This highly unusual clash spilled into public when The Sunday Times published its front-page report, attributed to palace officials, which said the royal family viewed Thatcher as “uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive.”
But Neil disputed several elements of “The Crown’s” retelling, not least that Buckingham Palace made the queen’s press secretary, Michael Shea, the scapegoat for the incident. The show depicts his being fired for having leaked the story, even though it suggests that he did so at the queen’s behest. There is no evidence of this, Neil said, but it fits Morgan’s “left-wing agenda.”
“He gets to depict Thatcher as pretty much an ally of apartheid, while the queen is the sort of person who junks loyal flunkies when things go wrong, even when they are just doing her bidding,” Neil said.
The brickbats are not just from the right.
Simon Jenkins, a columnist for the left-leaning Guardian, regards members of the royal family as artifacts of celebrity culture irrelevant to a country grappling with real-world challenges like Brexit. “They are practically defunct,” he said. “They are like anthropomorphized figures of a head of state.”
Yet he, too, is angered by how “The Crown” portrayed the events of the 1980s, when, as political editor of The Economist, he wrote about how Charles had been drawn to the now-defunct Social Democratic Party. (He based the report on an off-the-record interview with the prince.) Jenkins said that because this season of the “The Crown” deals with contemporary history and people who are still alive, its liberties with the facts are less a case of artistic license than an example of “fake news.”
“I find it offensive when people dump standards of veracity in relating contemporary history,” Jenkins said. “If I did that as a journalist, I’d be hauled up before the press council, while these people get prizes.”
Like others, Jenkins pointed to an episode-by-episode analysis by Hugo Vickers, a royal historian, which found whoppers large and small in the series and has become Exhibit A for its prevarications.
Not everybody faults Morgan for filling in the missing pieces with conjured scenes, even if he jumbles the facts in the process. (Thatcher’s son, Mark, was not lost in the desert during the Paris-Dakar auto rally just as his mother was preparing to go to war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands; hostilities broke out a few months after he was found.)
Charles Moore, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph who wrote a three-volume biography of Thatcher, praised Gillian Anderson’s performance as the prime minister, putting it on a par with Meryl Streep’s Oscar-winning turn in the 2011 film “The Iron Lady.” Even a much-criticized episode in which a snobbish queen plays host to a fish-out-of-water prime minister and her husband, Denis, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, struck him as having “the ring of truth,” despite some embellishments.
“The Crown,” Moore said, is trying to have it both ways, selling itself to audiences as a true story while clearing out the extraneous debris of facts that would gum up its dramatic narrative. “There is this thing called the tyranny of fact,” he said. “But as we get to modern times, it gets harder to avoid.”
Morgan declined to respond to the criticisms, though he told The New York Times this month that he was mindful that this season would be held to closer scrutiny. The producers mined the copious news reports of the period as well as biographies of Charles and Diana, which contained firsthand accounts of their misbegotten union.
What is depicted in the family’s private moments, however, is “an act of creative imagination,” Morgan has said.
Behind the frustration with “The Crown” is a recognition that, right or wrong, its version of the royal family is likely to serve as the go-to narrative for a generation of viewers, particularly young ones, who do not remember the 1980s, let alone the more distant events covered in earlier seasons.
“They’ll watch it and think this is the way it was,” said Dickie Arbiter, who served as a press secretary to the queen from 1988 to 2000. He took issue with parts of the plot, including a scene in which aides to Charles question Diana about whether she is mentally stable enough to travel alone to New York City.
“I was actually at that meeting,” Arbiter said. “No courtier would ever say that in a million years.”
The biggest problem, said Penny Junor, who has written biographies of Charles, Diana and Thatcher, is that “The Crown” is a prodigiously effective piece of entertainment. That, she said, poses a particular threat to Charles, who arguably comes off worst in the series and who is likely to ascend the throne before memories of his grim, hunched portrayal have completely faded.
“It is wonderful television,” Junor said. “It is beautifully acted. The mannerisms are perfect. But it is fiction, and it is very destructive.”

England’s Lockdown Will Lift, but Many Pub Doors Will Stay Closed

LONDON — Under fire from critics over the economic and social cost of his coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will bring a grueling, second national lockdown in England to an end next week.
But under a new set of rules announced Thursday, which divide England into three tiers of restrictions, the access to bars and restaurants will differ drastically from place to place depending on the government’s assessment of the local threat posed by the virus.
That means the more than 23 million people who live in the most restricted tier still face a ban on one of the nation’s favored activities: a visit to the pub. This ban will not only disappoint patrons but also deprive the beleaguered hospitality sector of critical revenue in the run-up to Christmas, when pubs and restaurants are usually overflowing.
With the holiday season arriving, Johnson has a difficult balance to strike in trying to tweak the exit from the lockdown in a way that is neither so stringent that many fail to comply, nor so lax that it allows the virus to get out of control.
Opinion polls generally show that Britons support tough measures and prefer to prioritize health over the economy. And the risk to health remains real.
While the daily number of COVID-19 cases is falling and is now at around 17,500, almost 500 deaths were announced in the latest 24-hour period for which data is available.
But the political backlash against the new pub rules was swift, as Graham Brady, who chairs the influential 1922 committee of Conservative backbench lawmakers, told the BBC that he would vote against the three-tier plan when it goes to Parliament for approval next week. Previous government restrictions have been approved despite a rebellion of some Tory lawmakers.
“I have severe reservations on so many different levels,” Brady said. “I do think that the policies have been far too authoritarian. I think they have interfered in people’s private and personal lives in a way which is unacceptable.”
In Thursday’s closely watched announcement of post-lockdown rules, the government said it plans to allow areas in two of the three tiers, including London and Liverpool, to permit bars to serve alcohol to customers who order food. Even this relaxation, however, will restrict the ability of many pubs to operate profitably, their owners say.
But throughout huge swaths of the country, including most of its other big cities like Manchester and Birmingham, the government wants tougher restrictions to be in place, with pub and restaurant doors kept firmly shuttered when the national lockdown ends Dec. 2.
In these highest-risk areas, only takeout service will be permitted.
“With 99% of the country in tiers two or three, this remains lockdown in all but name for nearly all pubs during the most important trading month of the year,” said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of the pub chain Greene King.
“This puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk and places the future of British pubs in even greater doubt for the years ahead,” he said, adding that of the more than 2,300 pubs in his chain in England, just six will be in areas where they can operate relatively normally — in the so-called first tier.
Fewer than 1 million people in the south of England will live in areas under the lightest curbs where bars and restaurants can operate relatively normally, whereas more than 55 million live in the other two tiers.
But beyond the world of pubs and restaurants, the end of lockdown will make a difference because, even in the worst-hit parts of England, stores, gyms and hairdressers are being allowed to reopen and religious services, weddings and outdoor sports to restart. Retailers will have a chance to open up during the lucrative Christmas shopping season.
This week, Johnson also announced plans to relax rules on social mixing to allow up to three households to gather together from Dec. 22-27 to celebrate Christmas, but health experts warn this will likely cause a spike in infections.
But large parts of the country that went into the national lockdown this month with light restrictions will be moved into tiers with tougher restrictions after Dec. 2, raising questions as to whether the government’s lockdowns have worked.
Damian Green, a Conservative Party lawmaker, wrote on Twitter that he was “hugely disappointed” that the whole of Kent, a region some of which he represents, was placed in tier three.
“Before lockdown we were in tier one, so what has lockdown achieved?” he asked.
At a news conference, Johnson argued that tough restrictions were vital to control the spread of infections. “If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard-won gains and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown,” he said.
He added that if the government was to keep schools open, as it wants, its options for reducing social contact were limited.
Some critics think the tiers fail to take sufficient account of local variations within regions, while others worry that some of the poorest areas will be hit hardest.
On Thursday, Downing Street denied that London and the surrounding southeast had been saved from the toughest restrictions because of its economic importance.
But the announcement threatens to stoke accusations that the north of the country is suffering from restrictions more than the south — a damaging claim for a government that was elected with the support of many northern voters who had traditionally sided with the opposition Labour Party.
Other critics had more fundamental objections. Steve Baker, an influential backbench Conservative lawmaker, was blunt in his criticism, saying, “The authoritarianism at work today is truly appalling.”
As for the hospitality sector, it believes that many pubs might not now survive the winter.
A letter signed by 50 pub and brewing businesses and sent to Johnson argued that they were being “singled out for exceptionally harsh and unjustified treatment.”
Unless the government changed course, “huge portions of this most British of institutions will simply not be there come the spring,” it said.

Patients of a Vermont Hospital Are Left ‘in the Dark’ After Cyberattack

At lunchtime on Oct. 28, Colleen Cargill was in the cancer center at the University of Vermont Medical Center, preparing patients for their chemotherapy infusions. A new patient will sometimes be teary and frightened, but the nurses try to make it welcoming, offering trail mix and a warm blanket, a seat with a view of a garden.
Then they work with extreme precision: checking platelet and white blood cell counts, measuring each dosage to a milligram per square foot of body area, before settling the person into a port and hooking them up to an IV.
That day, though, Cargill did a double take. When she tried to log in to her workstation, it booted her out. Then it happened again. She turned to the system of pneumatic tubes used to transport lab work. What she saw there was a red caution symbol, a circle with a cross. She walked to the backup computer. It was down, too.
“I wasn’t panicky,” she said, “and then I noticed my cordless phone didn’t work.”
That was, she said, the beginning of the worst 10 days of her career.
Cyberattacks on America’s health systems have become their own kind of pandemic over the past year as Russian cybercriminals have shut down clinical trials and treatment studies for the coronavirus vaccine and cut off hospitals’ access to patient records, demanding multimillion-dollar ransoms for their return.
Complicating the response, President Donald Trump last week fired Christopher Krebs, director of CISA, the cybersecurity agency responsible for defending critical systems, including hospitals and elections, against cyberattacks, after Krebs disputed Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud.
The attacks have largely unfolded in private as hospitals scramble to restore their systems — or to quietly pay the ransom — without releasing information that could compromise an FBI investigation.
But they have had a devastating and long-lasting effect, particularly on cancer patients, said workers and patients from Vermont’s largest medical system. Its electronic medical record system was restored Sunday, nearly a month after the cyberattack.
In the interim, clinicians were forced to send away hundreds of cancer patients, said Olivia Thompson, a nurse at the cancer center.
The staff fell back on written notes and faxes, leafing through masses of paper to access vital information. They tried to reconstruct complex chemotherapy protocols from memory.
And while the hospital has taken pains to reassure patients that most care could proceed, some staff members worry that the full damage of the October attack is not well understood.
“To recover from something like this is going to take months and months and months,” Thompson said. “It feels like we are all alone, and no one understands how dire this is.”
Elise Legere, a nurse at the cancer center, said she could compare the past weeks to only one experience — working in a burn unit after the Boston Marathon bombing — and has often found herself wondering about the motivation behind the cyberattack.
“It’s like asking, what’s the point of putting a bomb in an elementary school? What is the point?” she said. “There is a lot of evil in the world. Whoever did orchestrate this attack knows a lot about how devastating it is.”
‘We Expect Panic’
The latest wave of attacks, which hit about a dozen U.S. hospitals, was believed to have been conducted by a particularly powerful group of Russian-speaking hackers that deployed ransomware via TrickBot, a vast network of infected computers used for cyberattacks, according to security researchers who are tracking the attacks.
The hackers typically work for profit. The FBI estimated that the cybercriminals, who use ransomware called “Ryuk,” took in more than $61 million in ransom over a period of 21 months in 2018 and 2019, a record.
The attacks slowed last spring, when cybercriminals agreed among themselves to avoid hacking hospitals amid the pandemic, security researchers said. But just before the presidential election, the groups resumed.
“In the past, they targeted organizations all over the world, but this time they were very specifically aiming for hospitals in the United States,” said Alex Holden, chief executive of Hold Security, a Milwaukee firm.
The FBI said it will not comment on the attacks, citing ongoing investigations.
Holden and other cybersecurity experts said that the targets and the timing — just weeks after the United States targeted TrickBot — suggest that one possible motivation could be retaliation.
In late September and October, fearing that cybercriminals could use ransomware to disrupt the election, the Pentagon’s Cyber Command started hacking TrickBot’s systems. Microsoft pursued the systems in federal court, successfully dismantling 94% of TrickBot’s servers.
The takedowns relegated TrickBot’s operators to “a wounded animal lashing out,” Holden said. His firm captured online messages sent among the group, including a list of 400 U.S. hospitals they planned to target, and informed law enforcement.
“We expect panic,” one hacker wrote, in Russian.
U.S. officials warned hospitals about a “credible threat” of attacks Oct. 23, and then an unusual cluster of attacks on hospitals took place. Several hospitals — including Vermont Medical Center and the St. Lawrence County health system in New York — have said they received no ransom note.
Others reported ransom demands “in eight figures, which is just not something that regional health care systems can do,” said Allan Liska, an analyst with Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm. These unusual demands, combined with the coordination of the attacks, make “it seem that it was meant to be a disruptive attack” rather than a profit-seeking one, he said.
Holden said many of the health systems opted to negotiate with their extortionists, even as ransoms jump into the millions.
“A great number of victims are dealing with these attacks on their own,” he said.
The View From Inside
In Vermont, the damage radiated out through a sprawling network, hitting especially hard in the cancer center.
“My really good friends are ICU nurses, and they’re like, ‘No big deal — all we have to do is paper charting,’” said Cargill, the charge nurse.
But the cancer center was badly set back for weeks, able to serve only about 1 in 4 of its normal chemotherapy patients.
Cargill spent the rest of the day turning away patients, an experience she cannot relate without beginning to cry, nearly a month later.
“To look someone in the eye and tell them they cannot have their life-extending or lifesaving treatment, it was horrible and totally heart-wrenching,” she said.
The very first person she turned away, a young woman, burst into tears.
“She said, ‘I have to get chemo. I am the mother of two young kids,’” Cargill said. “She was so fearful, and the fear was tangible.”
In the days that followed, clinicians attempted to prioritize patients and recreate chemotherapy protocols from memory, gradually aided by backup chart information, said Legere, a nurse navigator in the unit.
“They were trying to remember everything they knew about a patient, but none of that is accurate,” she said. “Our brains are not designed to be electronic medical records. That’s not safe, and we all know it.”
Patients, she said, “feel very in the dark about when they will get treated,” and many cancer patients who live in rural areas do not have the resources to drive four hours to Boston for treatment.
“Vermont feels intentional. It feels scouted in the sense that it would cause a ton of panic,” she said. “The federal and statewide response is where I’m feeling very deserted. Maybe there’s stuff I don’t see.”
Lawmakers have also accused the Trump administration of marring the federal response.
In an email to The New York Times, Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., a member of the Homeland Security Committee, called the president’s firing of Krebs unacceptable, adding that it caused instability at his agency as it tried to mitigate the hospital attacks amid a surging pandemic.
Administrators at the University of Vermont Health Network acknowledge that restoring services proved far more challenging than they expected.
“If you look at what some other hospitals have gone through, it was days, not weeks,” said Al Gobeille, the system’s executive vice president for operations. “We thought that was what this would be. And we were wrong.”
He said a large number of professionals on information technology — 300 hospital employees, plus 10 members of the National Guard — were deployed to rebuild and clean 1,300 servers and 5,000 laptops and desktop computers. A team of seven FBI investigators was on site for two days after the shutdown, he said, but has had little to no contact with administrators since then.
With the restoration of the electronic patient record system, he said, the hospital’s systems are 75% to 80% recovered.
The motivation behind the attack remains unclear. At a news conference last month, Dr. Stephen Leffler, president of the medical center, said he had received no request for ransom. Since then, though, at the request of the FBI, administrators have carefully avoided discussing the matter of ransom or confirming Leffler’s statement.
Leffler, he said, “was saying what he knew at the time,” Gobeille said.
“The FBI has asked us not to talk about that part of the investigation, and I haven’t said either way,” he said. “I’m a pretty transparent person, so it’s odd to say the FBI has asked me not to talk about it. It’s not who were are. But in this case, I understand why.”
Some patients have complained that they were left dangling, uncertain when their treatment would resume.
Sean McCaffrey, 37, who was scheduled to see a cardiologist on the afternoon of the cyberattack — he had been suffering from chest pains — said he had never been contacted to reschedule the appointment.
“It’s really troublesome because I have lost some faith in my local hospital,” he said. “I was told I’d get a call. It’s been three weeks, and I have no idea what to do.”
Others say they are still waiting to gain access to critical scans. Two days before the shutdown, Damian Mooney, 47, had received a radiologist’s notes on an MRI of his shoulder, which suggested that an aggressive bone cancer may have returned.
The scans have been unavailable since the cyberattack, so no doctor has been able to say whether the radiologist was correct, said his wife, Kat Mooney.
“For 26 days, we’ve been sitting here going, 'We don’t know whether this recurred or not,’” she said.
It will be difficult, both for patients and staff members, to regain their sense of security, said Jennifer Long, an outpatient nurse at the medical center.
She and her colleagues, she said, sometimes wonder aloud what allowed the hackers to get into the system: “Is it the kid down the street? Is it someone in another country? Was it an email I sent? Was it the last page I opened?”
“You’re left with that feeling — it’s kind of sickening, it’s very impersonal — knowing that this was a deliberate attack, without any regard for the consequences and the potential for harm,” she said. “It really stings. It’s really hard to sit with it.”

Of the myriad treasures that might draw a sightseeing car lover to Detroit, one potential attraction is notably missing: a major public museum collection dedicated to the automobile. America’s Motor City offers many compelling reasons for a visit, but it really has nothing like the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles; the LeMay in Tacoma, Washington; or the well-known car displays in Indianapolis, Philadelphia or Reno, Nevada.
A measure of relief from that drought has arrived in the form of “Detroit Style: Car Design in the Motor City, 1950-2020,” an exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts that opened in November and runs through June. A dozen autos, including production models and conceptual show cars, will be displayed alongside drawings and photographs from the design studios where the vehicles took shape. Paintings and sculptures intended to illuminate the relationship of art and car culture over the past 70 years will also be on display.
Despite the location of its stately beaux-arts home on Woodward Avenue, a major artery of all things automotive in Detroit, the DIA is not a vault of local industry. The last major exhibition of cars within the museum’s walls was a design retrospective in the 1980s that spanned the era from 1925 to 1950.
Admittedly, the museum’s high points do include the magnificent “Detroit Industry Murals” of Diego Rivera, frescoes that depict scenes inside the Ford River Rouge factory some 15 minutes west of the DIA. Still, the museum, established in 1885, is a world-class art institution in the broadest sense, with diverse holdings of international artworks. Typical of U.S. art museums — the Museum of Modern Art in New York is an outlier in this respect — the DIA’s permanent collection does not include cars.
The exhibition was originally to open as part of a larger celebration of the city’s bootstrap revival, timed to complement the shift of the 2020 North American International Auto Show from its bleak January calendar slot to the more agreeable weather of June. That plan was scuttled when the coronavirus pandemic took hold and the city’s main convention center was converted into a field hospital. The auto show has since been rescheduled for early fall 2021, which will make outdoor displays and activities feasible.
The cars in the “Detroit Style” show include both models once commonplace on suburban streets — a 1967 Ford Mustang and a 1970 Plymouth Barracuda among them — and design studies produced by Detroit automakers as trial balloons, created to focus-group proposed trends at public auto shows. The studies include icons like the 1951 Le Sabre from General Motors and the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino by Chrysler’s studio. The cars were chosen by an advisory committee that represented the College for Creative Studies design school, the Henry Ford museum and Detroit automakers.
Preparation for this show began five years ago, according to Benjamin Colman, the DIA’s associate curator for American art. Part of that time was spent choosing the cars, researching the history and working out the logistics of arranging the loans. There was also the matter of where in the museum’s galleries the exhibition would go, partly affected by renovation work and partly restricted by access for the vehicles.
“These are the largest objects I’ve ever worked with,” Colman said.
The idea of portraying automobiles as both reflective of their eras and as trendsetters for industrial design is hardly new. To take that a step further, the DIA exhibition set out to communicate the journey that started with a designer’s vision.
“We wanted to tell the story that runs from image to object, the path it took,” Colman said.
The proximity of design sketches to actual cars in the museum gallery helps make that connection. For instance, the ’70 Barracuda is seen not only as a production model on display but also in a development sketch, rendered in Prismacolor on vellum in 1967 by Milton Antonick, a Chrysler designer. Colman describes this image of the car’s tail end as “a humble drawing, an informal working document” that serves to bridge the gap between a styling concept and the final product made of sheet metal.
Among the more pleasant tasks of assembling such an ambitious exhibition was locating the design drawings.
“So often the art was hiding in plain sight, within 20 miles of the museum,” Colman said. “I was knocking on doors in suburban Detroit, and the sketches were coming out of dusty boxes. We could do the show 10 times over and still have drawings left over.”
There is significance even in the choice of “Detroit Style” as the exhibition’s name. The discipline of creating a car’s look is today known as design, but in earlier times, before the complexities of manufacturing and marketing rewrote their job description, the creators of curvaceous fenders and chrome flourishes were called stylists.
“It was a matter of looking to how the practitioners described themselves in the era,” Colman said. “We felt it important to keep the historical language.”
The support from hometown automakers proved valuable not only to organizing the show but also to acquiring display cars as well. The ’67 Mustang belongs to Moray Callum, vice president for design at Ford Motor, whose generosity means he won’t be able to drive the car for the months it is at the DIA. Callum is comfortable with the sacrifice, though.
“It’s important to show the full-scale objects, to bring the conceptual to life,” Callum said. “That’s our job every day, and these cars represent what I think has been a higher level of optimism in America. The world is changing, and we might be highlighting the end of an era, the moment just before the meteor wiped out the dinosaurs.”
Relevant works by prominent figures from the fine art world, including Charles Sheeler, Richard Prince, Ed Ruscha and Jean-Michel Basquiat, are seen in the show, too. Were there any carmakers not in the final selections for the exhibition that should have been represented?
“Packard, even at the end of its existence, was deserving, and certainly Studebaker could have earned a spot,” Callum said.
In the view of Colman, the curator, the goal of presenting cars that reflect the challenges of their times and their outsize influence on culture was paramount. In particular, he points to the 1959 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray race car concept, a secretive project inside General Motors that established the design language of coming production models and gave rise to a durable mythology about designers and motor sports.
“I hope we tell a story that’s a love letter to Detroit,” Colman said.
Still, the experience of creating this ode to the city’s legacy has not made great changes to his personal transportation; he commutes to work by bicycle.

NEW YORK — It’s a yearly Thanksgiving Day tradition: Millions of spectators crammed onto long city blocks, hanging over barricades and balconies or pressed against the windows of towering office buildings to watch giant balloons, depicting cartoon characters like Pikachu, hovering just a few feet above the street.
But this year, as with everything in 2020, the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, a ritual marker of the holiday, was drastically different.
Because of the threat of the coronavirus, much of the parade in Manhattan was scaled down and pretaped for the television airing. The route was reduced from two miles to a single block down 34th Street, near the flagship department store.
There were no high school bands. Instead of the usual 2,000 balloon handlers, there were only about 130.
Warnings from officials to stay home because of the pandemic kept millions indoors this year, and police barricades were put in place to ensure that nobody got too close.
Still, some spectators were curious and showed up anyway.
On 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, Karin Schlosser, 52, stood behind one of the barricades taking photos of the floats and balloons. The balloons this year included the characters Boss Baby and Red Titan from "Ryan’s World."
“I felt like it was a big adventure to just come on down here and see what I could see — and I actually saw much more than I expected to see,” said Schlosser, who is from California but is living in New York City for a month while working from home. “This is so amazing.”
“I think people still really need some sense of normalcy,” she added. “Everyone I’ve talked to is very aware of the pandemic. They want to be safe. They’re wearing masks, but they still want to connect with other people.”
Dozens gathered at the same corner shortly after 9 a.m. taking photos with their cellphones. A man with a woman snapped a selfie with Christmas floats in the background. Absent in the photograph was the usual crowd of thousands.
Across the street, a building remained boarded up from the days when owners had braced for unrest after the election results. Police barricades kept the public at least two blocks away from the staging area. The streets beyond the parade route remained largely empty.
Henry Danner, of the Bronx, recalled going to the parade with his family as a child and watching his cousins perform in marching bands. This year, Danner, 34, a freelance photographer and journalism student at Columbia University, said he was most interested in witnessing and documenting what it was like to attend a parade during a pandemic.
“The Thanksgiving parade is a staple in New York history,” Danner said. “I came to see what story I could capture. I knew New York was going to be New York and still come out.”
But much about the annual event was different, he said.
“The energy is very somber," Danner said. "It’s usually upbeat.”
Kaitlin Lawrence, 31, and Zeev Kirsh, 40, tried to inject the event with a little levity when they decided to attend the parade in turkey costumes. Lawrence merged her two favorite holidays: Thanksgiving and Christmas. She dressed as a turkey-Santa.
“We are die-hard New Yorkers, and we want to keep the magic alive,” Lawrence said.

EU Border Agency Accused of Covering Up Migrant Pushback in Greece

BRUSSELS — Mounting evidence indicates the European Union’s border agency has been complicit in Greece’s illegal practice of pushing back migrants to Turkey, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with officials.
In at least one case, Frontex, as the EU border agency is known, is accused of having helped cover up the violations, when a crew said it was discouraged by agency officials from reporting that they had seen Greek authorities setting a boatload of migrants adrift in Turkish waters.
The case is currently being investigated by Frontex. But it has fueled suspicions that the agency, newly boosted in its role as upholder of the rule of law at EU borders, is not just sporadically aware of such abuses, but that it plays a role in concealing them.
“We are seeing an erosion of the rule of law at the EU borders which is willful,” said Gerald Knaus, a migration expert. “This is deeply worrying because it is eroding the refugee convention on the continent on which it was created.”
Throughout this year, The New York Times and others have reported on growing operations by the Greek coast guard to repel migrants from Greek waters back to Turkey — reports that Greek authorities deny amount to breaches of international laws.
But revelations that Frontex has witnessed pushbacks have thrown the agency into a governance crisis that threatens to further blight the European Union’s liberal values, once again calling into question the bloc’s commitment to upholding its own laws on refugees.
The cases have also highlighted a conundrum at the core of EU ambitions to tighten external borders by pooling resources and involving the bloc in the sensitive, zealously shielded work of sovereign border guards.
Frontex is the European Union’s best-funded agency, with a budget of over $500 million, and will soon deploy the first uniformed officers in the bloc’s history. It has been built up specifically to help in migrant-rescue operations as the burden of policing Europe’s borders has fallen most heavily on its peripheral states, like Greece.
It was also intended as a deterrent to the kind of mass arrival of refugees that sowed political crises across Europe after 2015, and fanned nationalist and populist movements.
Yet Frontex is not empowered to stop national border guards from committing violations, and it is not clear how it can play a role as standard-bearer of EU laws when informing on national forces risks the working relationships on which its operations depend.
Refugee arrivals to the European Union peaked five years ago and have dropped drastically since, but thousands of asylum-seekers, many fleeing the wars in Afghanistan and Syria, still attempt the crossing. Unlike in the past, Greeks and their government have turned hostile to the new arrivals, exhausted by years in which asylum-seekers have been bottled up in overrun camps on Greek islands.
There is also a growing belief in the Greek and several other European governments that aggression at the borders and poor conditions at migrant camps will make the attempt to reach Europe less attractive for asylum-seekers.
Earlier this year, an analysis by The Times showed that the Greek government had secretly expelled more than 1,000 asylum-seekers, often by sailing them to the edge of Greek territorial waters and abandoning them in flimsy inflatable life rafts in violation of international laws.
The Greek coast guard has rescued thousands of asylum-seekers over the years but has become much more aggressive this year, especially as Turkey used migrants to provoke Greece by encouraging them to cross the border.
The Greek government has denied it is doing anything illegal in repelling migrant boats from its national waters, characterizing the operations as robust border guarding. But Knaus said “the denials are not serious,” and the practices are effectively happening in the open — under the eyes of EU border patrols.
The documents obtained by The Times describe, in coast guard vernacular littered with acronyms, codes, time-stamps and coordinates, a seemingly incessant Ping-Pong of migrant dinghies between Greek and Turkish waters, with Frontex crews on vessels or aircraft in observer status.
Four officials with direct knowledge of Frontex operations said agency officials have been discouraging crews from filing reports on pushback incidents, and, in some cases, have stopped initial alerts of violations from being filed as “serious incident reports,” at times after consulting with Greek authorities. They all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were concerned about losing their jobs, or were not authorized to brief the press.
The Frontex spokesman, Chris Borowski, said the agency took the reporting of violations very seriously. “Pushbacks are illegal under international law,” Borowski said.
In the latest case to come to light, a Swedish coast guard crew on deployment under Frontex witnessed a pushback to Turkish waters of a boat full of migrants by Greek authorities on Oct. 30 off the Greek island of Khíos.
The Swedish crew was later advised by a Frontex officer to not report it, documents reviewed by The Times show. The Swedish representative to the management board of Frontex described the incident, and the suppression of the attempt to report it, at a meeting on Nov. 10 — the first known case of an EU member state reporting active interference by Frontex officials.
The Swedish government did not comment. A spokesman for Frontex said the agency wouldn’t comment because of an “ongoing procedure.”
Frontex has been working in Greece for more than a decade, providing sea, land and aerial surveillance and rescue capabilities and deploying crews from other member states under its command.
The details now emerging push the agency deeper into a governance crisis which began in October when a consortium of news organizations, including the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, reported a number of occasions when Frontex crews witnessed pushbacks in Greece.
The European Commission, which is part of the Frontex oversight system but does not control the agency, pushed for a special inquiry into these allegations and, at an emergency agency board meeting on Nov. 10, asked its leadership to answer detailed questions in writing.
The answers arrived with a four-day delay, just 15 hours before the start of another meeting to discuss the problems on Wednesday. Yet another emergency meeting has been called in December, mounting pressure on the agency.
Frontex has promised internal investigations but also quickly dismissed allegations, saying for example, in a letter seen by The Times, that it would look into the Swedish case, but that it had so far found no evidence that it happened.
How these investigations shake out will matter a great deal for the future of Frontex, which was once little more than a back-office operation in Warsaw but now finds itself on the front lines of the nettlesome issue of migration that has the potency to make or break governments.
Apart from helping member states with asylum-seeker arrivals, Frontex’s role as an EU agency by law is to respect fundamental rights, and bring up human-rights standards across national EU border agencies, which often don’t have a strong culture of upholding them.
But claims that Frontex does not take fundamental rights seriously enough are growing. This year, only 1 million euros in its budget of 460 million euros — about $548 million — was allocated to rights monitoring.
The agency was supposed to hire 40 fundamental-rights officers by Dec. 5 but the jobs have not yet been advertised. The agency is currently hiring for their boss, after years of staffing issues around that position. A Frontex spokesman said the delays stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic.
Documents seen by The Times laid out how in one episode Greek authorities were consulted before a report was made, and were able to suppress it. On Aug. 10, a German crew deployed by Frontex reported that a Greek coast guard vessel “took up border control measures prohibiting the landing to Samos.”
The expression refers to maneuvering and making waves around a dinghy to repel it. The event was not recorded as a “serious incident,” because, the document said, the Greek coast guard argued the activities “do not provide any ground” to initiate such a report.
Another incident, which a Frontex aerial crew observed and reported in detail to its headquarters, took place on the evening of April 18 to 19 off the coast of Lesbos, and lasted more than five hours.
A dinghy was detected by Greek authorities and approximately 20 migrants were rescued and put on board a Greek coast guard vessel shortly after midnight, their empty dinghy towed by the coast guard toward the island.
But instead of being taken to shore, at 2:45 a.m., the migrants were put back on their dinghy and tugged to Turkish waters by the Greek coast guard, the Frontex aerial crew reported.
As events unfolded, the Greek command center twice asked the Frontex aircraft to change its flight path, directing it away from the incident.
“At 03:21 Frontex Surveillance Aircraft communicates that the rubber boat has no engine and it is adrift. Greek assets are departing the area leaving the rubber boat adrift,” the document said.

CARACAS, Venezuela — Government agents have raided the offices and frozen the bank accounts of a major Venezuelan food charity, threatening a lifeline for thousands of children during one of the world’s deepest humanitarian crises.
The raids, which began last week, are the government’s latest attack on perceived opponents as President Nicolás Maduro steadily consolidates power. After crushing opposition parties, his campaign of repression is increasingly targeting independent civil organizations trying to alleviate the crisis.
The government has accused the food charity, Feed the Solidarity, of channeling foreign donations for political subversion, without providing evidence. The charity and its allies called the accusations and raids a callous political ploy that threatens the lives of the country’s most vulnerable citizens.
“The effect of this will be brutal,” said Susana Raffalli, a prominent Venezuelan nutritionist and aid activist. “Every social worker will now have fear to continue working.”
As Venezuela’s economy crumbled under Maduro, the government drastically cut spending on education, health care and even food aid, leaving nonprofit groups to fill the void. Only 4% of Venezuelans last year earned enough to meet their basic needs, according to a survey by the country’s largest public universities.
Feed the Solidarity runs dozens of soup kitchens in working-class areas around the country, serving 25,000 children, according to its founder, Roberto Patiño. The charity’s lunch often provides the children’s only daily meal, according to New York Times interviews with dozens of beneficiaries over the past two years.
Many children eat only part of their meals so they can take the rest home to their families.
Patiño said the charity will have to interrupt its service next week because the freezing of their bank accounts prevents them from purchasing food.
The crackdown began last week when banking regulators and secret police raided Venezuela’s largest private bank, Banesco, to investigate the charity’s money transfers to vulnerable families, according to Patiño. The bank issued a statement distancing itself from Patiño but did not respond to request for comment on the regulator’s raid.
This week, the secret police raided Feed the Solidarity’s office and Patiño’s registered residence, telling his family that they had an arrest warrant for the activist.
Patiño is a member of Venezuela’s moderate opposition party Justice First, but he has always maintained that his social work is separate from politics.
“We receive people from all political tendencies; there are no politics in our canteens,” Patiño, 32, said in a phone interview from hiding. “What hurts me the most now is that all these children will not have their meals next week.”
The crackdown on the charity forms part of a Maduro’s long campaign of repression against social and political forces outside his control. But it appears to directly contradict his attempts to persuade the incoming Biden administration to loosen the international sanctions that have strangled the economy.
Feed the Solidarity is part of the U.N. humanitarian program in Venezuela and has been supported financially by the European Union, several of its main member states and the Vatican.
The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela called the harassment of the charity “a despicable act from the regime,” in a Twitter post Thursday.
The local missions of the European Union and Germany did not respond to requests for comment on the raids against the charity.
Maduro has viewed the United Nations and the Vatican as suitable mediators in the country’s political crisis and has tried to rebuild economic ties to Europe to compensate for tightening U.S. sanctions. Feed the Solidarity is also the local partner of the international charity Save the Children. Jill Biden, wife of President-elect Joe Biden, chaired the board of trustees of the U.S. arm of Save the Children until 2018.
“Politically, he didn’t need this,” Raffalli, the aid activist, said in reference to Maduro. “A state that needs to raid nonprofits to regulate them is a weak state — a state with very little political capital.”

ISTANBUL — A Turkish court sentenced the accused ringleaders and hundreds of others suspected of involvement in the failed 2016 coup to multiple life terms Thursday, at the culmination of one of the most important mass trials in the plot to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The trial of 475 defendants focused on a group of senior military officers and civilians who set up headquarters at the Akinci air base outside the capital, Ankara, on the night of the coup and ordered warplanes, helicopters and army units to attack and seize key targets. Among the 337 defendants who received multiple life sentences were members of a small core accused of masterminding the coup attempt.
The sentences serve as a capstone to four years of prosecutions in Turkey since the attempted coup, pinning responsibility on those accused as the main perpetrators of a violent attempt at seizing power that was widely rejected by the public. But the government’s sweeping repression of dissent in the aftermath has damaged democracy and rule of law in the country.
During two years of martial law in the aftermath of the coup, t authorities detained some 100,000 people and purged 150,000 public servants from their jobs. The detained included political opponents of the government, Kurdish activists and human rights defenders, among others.
That led many to accuse the government of using the coup as an excuse to crack down more broadly on dissent.
The courts have now concluded almost all of the 289 trials related to the coup attempt and have convicted more than 4,000 people.
Legal professionals have criticized the use of mass trials against thousands accused of even vague involvement in the coup, including convictions handed down to army cadets and others who were ordered out on to the streets that night with little knowledge of what was going on. But supporters of the process point out that it is the first time in a history of military coups that Turkey has conducted extended legal proceedings into what happened.
The coup failed when hundreds of thousands of civilians blocked the streets and units loyal to the government took control. More than 250 people died, many of them police officers and civilians who came under attack from the rogue army units.
Four civilians, Kemal Batmaz, Hakan Cicek, Harun Binis and Nurettin Oruc, were found guilty of masterminding the coup from Akinci base that night. They are accused of following the orders of Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Islamic preacher who has become Erdogan’s bitter rival.
Gulen, who was in the United States at the time of the coup, and another civilian, Adil Oksuz, who was detained outside the Akinci air base on the morning after the coup but later released, were also indicted in the case. But they were among six defendants whose cases were later separated because they remain at large.
Of the most prominent military commanders sentenced was Brig. Gen. Bekir Ercan Van, commander of the Incirlik air base where U.S. forces are also stationed and from where they fly missions in Iraq and Syria.
The general gave orders for tanker aircraft to supply fuel to Turkish F-16 jets that were conducting bombing raids over Ankara during the coup attempt, according to at least one pilot who was among the defendants.
After the coup collapsed, Van approached his American counterparts at Incirlik and requested asylum but was refused.
At least 10 pilots who flew over Ankara and bombed locations in the capital, including the Parliament and two police headquarters, were sentenced to multiple counts of life imprisonment. Among the evidence that led to their conviction were audiotapes of the pilots’ conversations with the control tower describing their actions.
Lt. Col. Hakan Karakus, accused of leading the F-16 pilots, and two air force captains, accused of delivering bombing orders to the pilots, also received 79 life sentences each.
Karakus is the son-in-law of Gen. Akin Ozturk, commander of Turkish Air Force at the time of the coup attempt. Ozturk was sentenced to multiple life terms in 2019 for his role as a key ringleader in the failed coup.
The trial focused on responsibility for 77 of the more than 250 people who died in the attempted coup. Nineteen of those sentenced received 79 counts of life without parole, one for each of those 77 killed and two more for the charges of trying to subvert the Constitution and assassinate the president.
The published verdict said 291 defendants received life sentences without parole and 46 were sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. The court acquitted 80 defendants and the remainder received lesser sentences.
Most of the defendants in the trial denied they had participated in the coup attempt. They claimed they were either following orders or that the entire narrative of a coup attempt was a construct of the Erdogan government, a claim that was also made by Gulen.
Gulen and his U.S. supporters have repeatedly denied any involvement in the coup.
But evidence produced at the Akinci base trial was considered some of the most important of all the prosecutions.
Videotape from security cameras at the Akinci air base confirmed the presence of some of the defendants, including some walking the corridors in fatigues and carrying weapons. Pilots in audiotaped conversations described their intention of delivering a blow to the government, reinforcing the prosecution’s case.
Some of the lower-ranked officers testified about the actions of their superiors. The police also detained two of the civilian defendants, Batmaz and Binis, near the base on the morning after the coup attempt and dismissed their explanation that they were out looking at real estate.
Relatives of defendants and lawyers representing them have complained of harassment and other obstacles to their work. Defendants complained of torture and mistreatment in the first days after their arrest.
But defendants were allowed to deliver their own statements and reply to accusations during the trial, sometimes taking the stand for hours, even days, to read their testimony. Each defendant was also allowed to give final remarks as were their lawyers.
Mehmet Alagoz, who heads the July 15 Coup Trials Platform, a group founded by lawyers representing many of the victims killed and injured during the coup attempt, said the some of the defendants had been pushing for a mistrial or to expose illegal proceedings so they could take a claim to the European Court of Human Rights.
“The court exerted extraordinary efforts to make this a fair trial both in the court process and at the level of prosecution because the defendants from the beginning were shaping their defense for the European Court,” he said in a telephone interview.
“There were 475 defendants, hundreds of witnesses,” he added. “The court gave room for each one for their defense, regardless of the time. The trial lasted for 3 1/2 years.”
During the exhaustive hearings, some defendants cursed the Gulen movement, some criticized their superiors for leading them into trouble, but some of the ringleaders remained steadfast in their denials of even the existence of a coup plot and in their opposition to Erdogan’s government.
“There were defendants even rejecting sight of themselves in the videotapes,” Alagoz said. Some sent a coded message of support for Gulen at the end, he added.
“Even in their final remarks, they dared threaten the court,” he said.

Texto completo: The Duchess of Sussex has revealed that she had a miscarriage in July, giving a personal account of the traumatic experience in hope of helping others.
Meghan described the miscarriage in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Wednesday. She wrote: "I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second."
The former Meghan Markle and husband Prince Harry have an 18-month-old son, Archie.
The duchess, 39, said she was sharing her story to help break the silence around an all-too-common tragedy.
"Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few," she wrote. "In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing."
In a startlingly intimate account of her experience, the duchess described how tragedy struck on a "morning that began as ordinarily as any other day."
Later, she said, she "lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband's hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears. Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we'd heal."
Buckingham Palace said it was "a deeply personal matter we would not comment on."
The Weeknd criticizes Grammys: The Weeknd angrily slammed the Grammy Awards, calling them "corrupt" after the pop star walked away with zero nominations despite having multiple hits this year.
The three-time Grammy winner, who also had one of the year's biggest albums with "After Hours," criticized the Recording Academy on Tuesday after he was severely snubbed.
"The Grammys remain corrupt," the singer said on Twitter. "You owe me, my fans and the industry transparency."
Harvey Mason Jr., the Recording Academy's interim president and CEO, released a statement explaining that "unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists."
Netflix removes show at Chappelle's request: Netflix has stopped streaming "Chappelle's Show," the sketch-comedy series that Dave Chappelle made for Comedy Central back in the aughts.
Chappelle explained what went down, from his point of view, in a video posted Tuesday on social media. The comic opened up about how he came to sign a contract granting Comedy Central the rights to "Chappelle's Show" in perpetuity. Netflix and HBO Max got the show's streaming rights through a nonexclusive deal with ViacomCBS, which owns Comedy Central.
No money went to the comic in the new deal, and nobody had to ask him for permission, Chappelle said. "I called (Netflix), and I told them that this makes me feel bad," he said. "... They agreed that they would take it off their platform -- just so I could feel better."

Texto completo: The Duchess of Sussex has revealed that she had a miscarriage in July, giving a personal account of the traumatic experience in hope of helping others.
Meghan described the miscarriage in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Wednesday. She wrote: "I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second."
The former Meghan Markle and husband Prince Harry have an 18-month-old son, Archie.
The duchess, 39, said she was sharing her story to help break the silence around an all-too-common tragedy.
"Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few," she wrote. "In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing."
In a startlingly intimate account of her experience, the duchess described how tragedy struck on a "morning that began as ordinarily as any other day."
Later, she said, she "lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband's hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears. Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we'd heal."
Buckingham Palace said it was "a deeply personal matter we would not comment on."
The Weeknd criticizes Grammys: The Weeknd angrily slammed the Grammy Awards, calling them "corrupt" after the pop star walked away with zero nominations despite having multiple hits this year.
The three-time Grammy winner, who also had one of the year's biggest albums with "After Hours," criticized the Recording Academy on Tuesday after he was severely snubbed.
"The Grammys remain corrupt," the singer said on Twitter. "You owe me, my fans and the industry transparency."
Harvey Mason Jr., the Recording Academy's interim president and CEO, released a statement explaining that "unfortunately, every year, there are fewer nominations than the number of deserving artists."
Netflix removes show at Chappelle's request: Netflix has stopped streaming "Chappelle's Show," the sketch-comedy series that Dave Chappelle made for Comedy Central back in the aughts.
Chappelle explained what went down, from his point of view, in a video posted Tuesday on social media. The comic opened up about how he came to sign a contract granting Comedy Central the rights to "Chappelle's Show" in perpetuity. Netflix and HBO Max got the show's streaming rights through a nonexclusive deal with ViacomCBS, which owns Comedy Central.
No money went to the comic in the new deal, and nobody had to ask him for permission, Chappelle said. "I called (Netflix), and I told them that this makes me feel bad," he said. "... They agreed that they would take it off their platform - just so I could feel better."

When parents lose their jobs Children also are suffering, but sometimes there's a consolation

Texto completo: In six months without steady work, Gregory Pike, a single father in Las Vegas, has fallen behind on his rent and utilities, borrowed money he cannot repay, turned to food stamps and charity, and fretted that his setbacks may cloud his daughter's future.
Research dating to the Depression warns that parental unemployment places children at risk: When finances fall and adult tensions rise, young people tend to do worse in school and suffer psychological strains, reducing their prospects for adult success.
But despite the problems he has experienced since March, when the coronavirus eliminated his job, Pike has found an unexpected consolation: time with his 6-year-old daughter, Makayla, whom he has raised alone for three years.
"As much as this pandemic has brought me some hardship and uncertainty, it's kind of a blessing - it's let me focus more on parenting," Pike said. "It's bad but it's also been good. It's really brought us a lot closer."
With parental unemployment having recently hit a record peak, the risks to children are formidable. Nearly 22% of children had an unemployed parent in April, the highest rate on record, according to Zachary Parolin, a researcher at Columbia University who analyzed data at the request of The New York Times. By August, the rate had fallen nearly in half, but still approached the peak of the Great Recession and was much higher among Black and Latino children.
In recent interviews, parents echoed the experts' view that their joblessness posed risks to their children. But like Pike, many also said they had found rewards in the extra family time, as if newly realizing how little of it had been available in their earlier, overscheduled lives.
"Work-life conflict" is often discussed as a problem of the privileged classes, but low-wage workers may suffer it most, with unpredictable hours, less help with chores like cooking and cleaning and little economic choice. The sudden increase of time with their children has reminded some low-income parents of what they have been missing.
"You know, I've gotten to know my kids a lot more," said Aileen Kelly, a single mother of five who lost her job as a casino housekeeper at the pandemic's start. "When you're working, you don't get the real feeling of raising your kids. You're providing for them but you're not teaching them."
Such rewards do not reduce the risks that unemployment brings - Kelly has doubled up with a friend, in an apartment with 10 children - but they do offer a window into an overlooked strain on the lives of poor families.
"Even when the parents get reemployed quickly, you still see negative effects," said Jennie E. Brand, a sociologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Lost income offers one explanation, making it harder for families to afford everything from food to Little League. Elevated stress offers another, increasing the risk of parental depression or harsh parenting.
Generally, men are more susceptible than women to the lost self-esteem that unemployment can bring, making jobless fathers the greater threat to family harmony, Brand found in a review of unemployment research. Poor workers face greater economic risks, she found, but affluent workers are more likely to feel unemployment as a blow to their identity.
The risks unemployment poses to children may depend in part on the safety net, which was significantly expanded at the start of the pandemic but is now contracting.
When Maria Guerrero, a single mother in Las Vegas, lost her job at an airline caterer in March, her unemployment benefits were delayed for two months. Worried about losing her house, she found herself sniping at her 14-year-old daughter.
"You get anxiety, you get depression, you don't sleep at night, thinking what if they kick me out?" she said. "I was so frustrated I would take it out on my daughter. She goes, 'You're always in a mood, you're always mad.' "
When the benefits arrived, they fully replaced her salary through July, and the household conflict ended. "The relationship got better when I started making my payments again," Guerrero said. "We eat together, we're bonded. This pandemic - it made us closer."
Three researchers at the University of Chicago - Ariel Kalil, Susan Mayer and Rohen Shah - recently found that government aid had reduced the harm of unemployment during the pandemic. They surveyed nearly 600 low-income single mothers before and after the crisis began.
Parents who lost jobs reported greater depression and stress and more negative interactions with their children - but only if their income declined. Jobless parents who replaced their income, through government aid or second earners, experienced no negative effects. If anything, those parents reported that their interactions with their children had improved.
The April rate of parental unemployment - 21.7% of children had unemployed parents - shattered the previous monthly record of 16% from January 1983. At this year's peak, that was about 16 million children.
"That's really an alarming number," said Parolin, the Columbia researcher. "Even if parents quickly return to work, I wouldn't underestimate the psychological toll unemployment takes, particularly in the context of the pandemic."
Parental unemployment varies greatly by race, with the August levels among Black children (16.2%) and Latino children (14.3%) nearly twice that of white children (8.3%). Likewise, unemployment is much higher among less-educated workers than college graduates, and higher among mothers than fathers, reversing a trend toward gender equity in work rates.
"With schools out, it's more often mothers who stay home from work," Parolin said.
A recent questionnaire from The Times, distributed by Fresh EBT, a smartphone app that helps people manage their food stamp benefits, asked parents how the pandemic had affected their relationships with their children. Many simultaneously lamented the lost income but praised the increased family time.

Good wine can be balm for this Thanksgiving

Texto completo: In this strange and disquieting year, Thanksgiving planning begins with the question of whether to have any sort of gathering at all. Which wines to drink with the meal will be the least of your worries.
That's as it should be. Selecting wines may cause a mild quiver of anxiety, but it's never really a problem.
Even in the best of times, when you're embracing aunts, third cousins and your best friend's sister's daughter, the joy of the feast and the renewal of ties go a long way toward mitigating the quality of whatever happens to be in your glass.
Still, good wine can be a significant asset. It can compel guests to take notice, to pause and ponder rather than gulp and disregard. If bottles are to be opened, why not select them with the same diligence you apply to choosing the perfect recipe for mashed potatoes?
Thanksgiving comes as COVID-19 cases are spiking nationwide. Every family will decide how to approach this often joyously rambunctious holiday. Many gatherings will be diminished as people, protecting their loved ones and themselves, decide not to travel or entertain. Thanksgivings for four, or two or even one will not be unusual.
Somehow, families will manage to bridge the distance. Whether through Zoom or the phone, people will find a way to share their blessings, maybe through a prayer or a toast. Wine can help forge these links, possibly by opening the same bottles from afar.
Our wine panel was not immune to the 2020 winnowing. Typically, we assemble monthly in a room at The New York Times building, where we consider and discuss a range of bottles. In deference to the pandemic, we have not gathered since February.
Still, we did not want to let Thanksgiving pass, so we got together outdoors, in the rooftop space of the NoMad restaurant in Manhattan. Even so, we were not entirely whole. Bernard Kirsch, our tasting coordinator, always joins us, but this year he opted out. Our colleague Pete Wells, like so many parents dealing with home-schooling, faced a last-minute child-care issue and could not attend.
That left Florence Fabricant, Julia Moskin and me, so we invited Thomas Pastuszak, NoMad's wine director, to contribute a couple of bottles. We would be tasting eight wines in all.
We stuck with our usual ground rules: Each of us would bring two wines, one white and one red. None would retail for more than $25. We adopted these guidelines years ago, believing that for big gatherings, nobody wants to spend a lot of money on wine.
Smaller gatherings offer different opportunities. You don't need as much wine, so if you like you can open your finest bottles.
Dinner for four, for example could begin with hors d'oeuvres and sparkling wine.
It could be Champagne. But if you want to emphasize American wines, I have found wonderful choices from the West Coast: Blue Ox, Cruse, Schramsberg, Iron Horse, Soter and Under the Wire are a few names worth knowing about.
Follow that with a good white wine, whatever strikes your fancy. Chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, riesling, all will be great, but don't stop there. You might like an assyrtiko, or maybe a carricante. Maybe you're beginning with a creamy soup? Any of these wines will work, as long as they are not too oaky.
I would follow up with a red - a pinot noir or syrah, or maybe a Barolo or a Beaujolais. Whether serving turkey, or downsizing to a duck or chicken, these are all flexible with wine, so match the bottle to your sense of the occasion rather than with the food.
Maybe you would prefer two whites, or no whites at all. Why not? This is the year to eliminate rigid constraints.
Even so, the wine panel stayed with its philosophy of seeking out lithe, agile wines. If you have followed us over the years, you will have seen the recommendations for many different specific bottles - Beaujolais, Loire reds, Italian reds, Oregon pinot noirs, rosés, sparklers and even ciders.
These all continue to be great choices. But we have come to realize that the specifics don't matter nearly so much as the character and energy of the wines. Acidity, balance and relatively low alcohol are the watchwords.
We have gotten good at finding bottles that fit these criteria, and this year was no exception. In fact, all eight bottles earned three stars, the equivalent of excellent choices. What separates them are scant degrees of preference. They were all that good.
For her white, Julia brought a Côtes du Rhône blanc, a 2019 Clémentia from Domaine les Aphillanthes, made from biodynamically farmed viognier, roussanne and clairette.
This was a counterintuitive wine, as viognier in particular can be overbearing, but this was well-focused and lively, a "sunny wine," Julia said, that offered its tropical fruit flavors without being too heavy.
Her red was our favorite, a 2018 Verduno Basadone from Castello di Verduno, made of pelaverga piccolo grapes organically farmed in the Langhe region of Italy.
While the area is best known for its Barolo and Barbaresco, Langhe also grows pelaverga piccolo, one of a group of lesser-known grapes that offer excellent values. It was fresh, bright, spicy and intriguing.
Florence, too, went against the grain with her white, selecting a so-called orange wine, a white with some of the characteristics of a red.
Many orange wines can seem idiosyncratic, and I often wonder whether people will want to drink them over the course of a long meal. This would be a good candidate to try.
Her red was a nonvintage pinot noir, the High Wire from Hound's Tree on the North Fork of Long Island - fresh, lively and refreshing.
I loved Thomas' white, a 2018 Mosel riesling from Julian Haart that was textured and rich with floral and stony mineral flavors. I called it a wake-up wine for the way it snapped me to attention, though Julia suggested it was maybe too bold.
Thomas' red came from Franck Balthazar, one of my favorite Cornas producers, who also has a small négociant operation. This 2018 Côtes du Rhône is 60% syrah and 40% grenache, farmed organically. It was spicy, earthy and complex, a lovely wine.
I stuck with American wines for my picks. My white, a 2018 Sonoma County chardonnay from Lioco, was tangy, textured and balanced, the sort of white wine that will go with almost anything.
My red was the 2017 Queen of the Sierra from Forlorn Hope, a blend of trousseau noir, mondeuse, zinfandel and a few other grapes, all organically grown in Calaveras County in the Sierra Foothills.

Texto completo: Prosecutors said the case was closed because the statute of limitations on the alleged offense had expired.
PARIS -- Prosecutors in France said Wednesday that they had dropped a rape investigation into a former deputy mayor of Paris because the statute of limitations on the alleged offense had expired.
The prosecutors opened their investigation of Christophe Girard in mid-August, two days after The New York Times published an article in which Aniss Hmaïd, now 46, accused Mr. Girard of abusing him sexually in the 1990s, starting when he was still a minor. Mr. Hmaïd claimed that Mr. Girard coerced him into sex some 20 times over the course of about a decade.
In exchange, Mr. Girard, now 64, employed the younger man as a domestic worker in his home and also gave him odd jobs at the French fashion company Yves Saint Laurent, where he was a top executive before entering politics.
"He took advantage of my youth, of my young age and everything for his sexual pleasures," Mr. Hmaïd said in the August article. On Wednesday, he declined to comment on the prosecutor's decision to drop the investigation.
From the outset, Mr. Hmaïd's accusations were expected to fall under the statute of limitations, which was 20 years at the time of the alleged offense, and therefore were never likely to lead to a conviction. But French prosecutors regularly open investigations in sexual abuse cases to identify other potential victims, even if the statute of limitations may have expired.
The allegations against Mr. Girard were the first among a series of sexual abuse scandals that have rocked Paris City Hall in recent months. They are part of a broader reckoning over sex, gender and power in France that has shaken the cultural and political realms.
Mr. Girard, a power broker in politics and culture for a generation, had already been the subject of intense criticism during the summer over his links to Gabriel Matzneff, a French writer who openly promoted pedophilia for decades while benefiting from the protection of French elites. Under pressure over his connections to Mr. Matzneff, Mr. Girard resigned as deputy mayor but continued until now to sit on the Paris City Council.
Mr. Hmaïd told The New York Times that he first met Mr. Girard in Tunisia in the summer of 1989 when he was 15. He said they met in Hammamet, a Tunisian resort town, where Mr. Girard hired him as a houseboy in a villa he had rented. But it was a year later, during a trip together to the United States in 1990, that Mr. Girard began abusing him sexually in Washington, Mr. Hmaïd said.
Mr. Girard denied ever engaging in any sexual relationship with Mr. Hmaïd in an interview with The New York Times. But he said he had spent time with the younger man and considered him a member of the family.
"Now I have to think about my new life," Mr. Girard said in a text message on Wednesday, adding that he had "always had confidence in the French justice system and its independence."
An official from the Paris prosecutor's office said that they had "closed the case against Mr. Girard as a result of the statute of limitations having expired."
Nevertheless, activists and members of the Paris City Council pressed for Mr. Girard's full withdrawal from political life in the name of ethics.
Mr. Girard's case eventually caused a rift in the leftist alliance governing Paris, with young, Green party City Council members openly opposing the former deputy mayor while Mayor Anne Hidalgo strongly supported him.
It also reignited a fierce debate over feminism in France.
Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu, a feminist and Green party City Council member, said that she could not envision Mr. Girard returning to his responsibilities on the council.
"It is a question of ethics and political morality" more than a question of legal proceedings, Ms. Rémy-Leleu said. She expressed doubts that he could again become an elected official entrusted with projects or responsibilities.
France recently toughened laws against sex crimes and extended the statute of limitations for rape of a minor to 30 years from 20 years, but that extension cannot be applied retroactively to Mr. Hmaid's case.
Prosecutors did not comment on the content of the investigation or whether the charges against Mr. Girard were substantiated.

Texto completo: For the better part of 2020, the growing shadow of the Coronavirus has spread across every populated country in the world. More than fifty-eight million people have been stricken worldwide. In the United States, more than 12 million have been infected and nearly 260,000 have died. American casualties are the highest in the world. All the while, researchers have been frantically working to create a vaccine. And it is now here.
Moderna and Pfizer along with its German partner BioNTech have each produced vaccines they say will work against the world's most dangerous pandemic since the Great Influenza, more than a hundred years before. Moderna rates its vaccine at 95 percent effec-a tive while Pfizer/BioNTech rates its vaccine at 90 percent. The latest to introduce a vaccine is AstraZeneca. It made its announcement on Monday and rates its vaccine at 90 percent effective.
The FDA must now approve the vaccines, a step considered almost perfunctory in light of already documented testing data and a wintertime spike that is now taxing hospitals and morgues both here and abroad. The FDA meets on December 10th. If the approval process goes as expected, vaccinations could begin in as early as three to four weeks. Those expected to be first in line for shots are workers in high risk group, most likely, doctors and nurses. Distributing the vaccine for large scale immunizations has already been discussed.
"Our plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunization sites with 24 hours from the approval," said Moncef Slaoui, Chief Scientific Advisor, Operation Warp Speed. That would mean, he said, the first vaccinations could occur as early as December 11th or 12th. Each state's health department would instruct on where to deliver the vaccines. Slaoui made his comments on CNN's State of the Union broadcast.
Contrasted with other vaccines that have been introduced, the Coronavirus vaccine has surpassed all expectations and records for delivery. Most vaccines have taken several years, even decades from beginning of research to the first shots in the arm. This vaccine was begun just ten months ago at the onset of the virus. It, of course, had the full backing of the U.S. government. "Go for it," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "Whatever it costs, don't worry about it." The U.S. government underwrote the Pfizer/ BioNTech research. Moderna took no federal money.
In an interview with the New York Times, Dr. Stephane Bancel, Moderna's Chief Executive said that the makeup of the virus made the undertaking simpler than many had expected. "This is not a complicated virus," he said. In fact, from the time China shared the viruses genetic sequence with the world and Moderna researchers came up with a design for an mRNA-messenger RNA-vaccine was two days.
Researchers used mRNA to induce human cells to create a safe viral protein-a spike-which causes the immune system to make antibodies and immune cells that can recognize the spike and counterattack as needed.
Though it is still weeks before the first vaccine is administered in Colorado, it can't come fast enough. The state's hospitals are undergoing a rush of COVID-19 patients they haven't seen since last Spring. In southern Colorado, patients are being moved to larger facilities in Colorado Springs and Denver. On the western slope, hospitals have reached or exhausted their bed space. In other parts of the state, ICU beds are no longer available. In some cases, hospitals are being forced to turn patients away for lack of space. All the while, the toll on medical staff rises to burnout levels
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reports that a flattening of the curve is still out of sight. Beginning the week, CDH had reported nearly 200,000 cases of COVID-19 and 2,355 deaths from the virus. Governor Jared Polis has urged mask wearing across the state, an order that has rankled Weld County law enforcement. An estimated one in 49 Coloradans are currently infected with the Coronavirus.
"The county will not enforce a rule confining individuals to their homes...will not enforce a rule demanding restaurants close their indoor dining areas.will not enforce any rule that forces a business to shut down," nor will it enforce the wearing of masks or facial coverings, according to a news release from the Weld County Commissioners. The county's positivity rate for COVID-19 is 16.5 percent, which is more than three times higher than the five percent threshold recommended by the World Health Organization for keeping the virus under control.
Pfizer estimates that it will manufacture 50 million doses of the vaccine before the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion next year. If at least 70 percent of the population receives the two doses that are recommended, officials believe that will create herd immunity as early as May of 2021.
In addition to what is hoped will be an effective vaccine to fight COVID-19, the FDA has also granted emergency authorization for the same antibody treatment given President Trump when he was diagnosed with the coronavirus. The treatment, manufactured by Regeneron, is a combination of two antibodies that seem to work in checking the infection. Those receiving the cocktail will be people over age 12 who have tested positive for COVID-19 and may be at a higher risk for developing a more serious strain of the virus.
The CDC reports that the recent spike in cases of COVID-19 has averaged slightly more than 168,000 people each week. It predicts there could be as many as 16,000 deaths across the nation each week through the middle of December.
Vacuna COVID-19, a la vuelta de la esquina
Durante la mayor parte del 2020, la creciente sombra del Coronavirus se ha extendido por todos los países poblados del mundo. Más de cincuenta y ocho millones de personas han resultado afectadas en todo el mundo. En los Estados Unidos, más de 12 millones se han infectado y casi 260 mil han muerto. Las bajas estadounidenses son las más altas del mundo. Mientras tanto, los investigadores han estado trabajando frenéticamente para crear una vacuna. Y ahora está aquí.
Moderna y Pfizer, junto con su socio alemán BioNTech, han producido vacunas que, según dicen, funcionarán contra la pandemia más peligrosa del mundo desde la Gran Influenza, más de cien años antes. Moderna califica su vacuna con un 95 por ciento de efectividad, mientras que Pfizer / BioNTech califica su vacuna con un 90 por ciento. La última en introducir una vacuna es AstraZeneca. Hizo su anuncio el lunes y califica su vacuna con un 90 por ciento de efectividad.
La FDA (por sus siglas en inglés) ahora debe aprobar las vacunas, un paso que se considera casi superficial a la luz de los datos de pruebas ya documentados y un pico de invierno que ahora está agravando a los hospitales y morgues tanto aquí como en el extranjero. La FDA se reúne el 10 de diciembre. Si el proceso de aprobación sale como se esperaba, las vacunaciones podrían comenzar en tan solo tres o cuatro semanas. Aquellos que se espera sean los primeros en la fila para las vacunas son los trabajadores del grupo de alto riesgo, muy probablemente, médicos y enfermeras. Ya se ha discutido la distribución de la vacuna para inmunizaciones a gran escala.
"Nuestro plan es poder enviar las vacunas a los sitios de inmunización dentro de las 24 horas posteriores a la aprobación", dijo Moncef Slaoui, Asesor Científico Jefe de Operation Warp Speed. Eso significaría, dijo, que las primeras vacunas podrían ocurrir a partir del 11 o 12 de diciembre. El departamento de salud de cada estado daría instrucciones sobre dónde entregar las vacunas. Slaoui hizo sus comentarios en la transmisión del Estado de la Unión de CNN.
A diferencia de otras vacunas que se han introducido, la vacuna Coronavirus ha superado todas las expectativas y los récords de entrega. La mayoría de las vacunas han tardado varios años, incluso décadas, desde el inicio de la investigación hasta las primeras inyecciones en el brazo. Esta vacuna se inició hace apenas diez meses al inicio del virus. Por supuesto, contó con el respaldo total del gobierno de Estados Unidos. "Adelante", dijo el Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director del Instituto Nacional de Alergias y Enfermedades Infecciosas. "Cueste lo que cueste, no se preocupe". El gobierno de Estados Unidos financió la investigación de Pfizer / BioNTech. Moderna no aceptó dinero federal.
En una entrevista con el New York Times, el Dr. Stephane Bancel, director ejecutivo de Moderna, dijo que la composición del virus hizo que la empresa fuera más simple de lo que muchos esperaban. "Este no es un virus complicado", dijo. De hecho, desde el momento en que China compartió la secuencia genética del virus con el mundo y los investigadores de Moderna idearon un diseño para una vacuna de ARNm - ARN messenger - fueron dos días.
Los investigadores utilizaron ARNm para inducir a las células humanas a crear una proteína viral segura, un pico, que hace que el sistema inmunológico produzca anticuerpos y células inmunes que pueden reconocer el pico y contraatacar según sea necesario.
Aunque todavía faltan semanas para que se administre la primera vacuna en Colorado, no puede llegar lo suficientemente rápido. Los hospitales estatales están sufriendo una avalancha de pacientes con COVID-19 que no han visto desde la primavera pasada. En el sur de Colorado, los pacientes están siendo trasladados a instalaciones más grandes en Colorado Springs y Denver. En la vertiente occidental, los hospitales han alcanzado o agotado su espacio para camas. En otras partes del estado, las camas de la UCI ya no están disponibles. En algunos casos, los hospitales se ven obligados a rechazar a los pacientes por falta de espacio. Mientras tanto, el costo del personal médico se eleva a niveles de agotamiento.
El Departamento de Salud Pública y Medio Ambiente de Colorado informa que aún no se ve un aplanamiento de la curva. A partir de la semana, CDH había informado cerca de 200 mil casos de Covid-19 y 2.355 muertes por el virus. El gobernador Jared Polis ha instado a que se use una máscara en todo el estado, una orden que ha irritado a las fuerzas del orden del condado de Weld. Se estima que uno de cada 49 habitantes de Colorado está infectado actualmente con el coronavirus.
"El condado no hará cumplir una regla que confine a las personas en sus hogares ... no hará cumplir una regla que exija que los restaurantes cierren sus áreas de comedor interiores ... no hará cumplir ninguna regla que obligue a un negocio a cerrar", ni hará cumplir el uso de máscaras o cubiertas faciales, según un comunicado de prensa de los comisionados del condado de Weld. La tasa de positividad del condado para COVID-19 es del 16,5 por ciento, más de tres veces mayor que el umbral del cinco por ciento recomendado por la Organización Mundial de la Salud para mantener el virus bajo control.
Pfizer estima que fabricará 50 millones de dosis de la vacuna antes de finales del 2020 y 1.300 millones el próximo año. Si al menos el 70 por ciento de la población recibe las dos dosis recomendadas, los funcionarios creen que se creará inmunidad colectiva a partir de mayo del 2021.
Además de lo que se espera sea una vacuna eficaz para combatir el COVID-19, la FDA también otorgó autorización de emergencia para el mismo tratamiento con anticuerpos que se le dio al presidente Trump cuando le diagnosticaron el coronavirus. El tratamiento, fabricado por Regeneron, es una combinación de dos anticuerpos que parecen funcionar para controlar la infección. Quienes recibirán el cóctel serán personas mayores de 12 años que hayan dado positivo por COVID-19 y puedan tener un mayor riesgo de desarrollar una cepa más grave del virus. El CDC informa que el reciente aumento en los casos de COVID-19 ha promediado un poco más de 168 mil personas cada semana. Predice que podría haber hasta 16 mil muertes en todo el país cada semana hasta mediados de diciembre.

BARACK OBAMA, FOX NEWS AND THE STATE OF THE NEWS MEDIA

Texto completo: In a flurry of interviews about his new book, Barack Obama can't seem to stop talking about how our news and information ecosystem is the biggest cause of the poisonous divide in American politics and culture.
"Obama's book tour doubles as a warning about 'deeply divided' media landscape," said one CNN headline.
Meanwhile, Fox News, until recently the go-to propaganda arm of Donald Trump and the Republican Party, is being attacked by Trump and his allies for demonstrating inadequate fealty. A breaking point was the network's election-night call that Joe Biden would win Arizona's electoral votes, which turned out to be true but beside the point. Trump was reportedly apoplectic.
Stepping back, this trend of distrusting professional journalists who provide a generally agreed-upon set of facts to debate has been happening for decades - so long that the traditional concept feels almost quaint.
When you mention legendary television anchorman Walter Cronkite to some younger people, you anticipate eye rolls. Isn't it great, some counter, that the internet has "democratized" the flow of news and information so that gatekeepers like Cronkite no longer exist?
Yeah, right, because the 2020 media landscape is just so good.
Growth of the internet is not the only factor. The far right has long been more nimble than the left at inventing cult-like systems to spread misinformation and seed conspiracy theories. We should have seen that coming in the 1990s because there never has been a successful left-wing Rush Limbaugh.
Another factor, of course, has been the downward pressure on newspaper staffing, especially for those without the national digital revenue models of the New York Times or the Washington Post.
Promoting his book titled "A Promised Land," Obama seems to obsess about the news media. In an interview with The Atlantic magazine, for example, Obama said the nation now lacks a "common narrative" that once was provided by major television anchors and newspapers.
"I come out of this book very worried about the degree to which we do not have a common baseline of fact and a common story," Obama said. "We don't have a Walter Cronkite describing the tragedy of Kennedy's assassination but also saying to supporters and detractors alike of the Vietnam War that this is not going the way the generals and the White House are telling us. Without this common narrative democracy becomes very tough."
Later, he added: "I think it is the single biggest threat to our democracy. I think Donald Trump is a creature of this, but he did not create it. He may be an accelerant of it, but it preceded him and will outlast him. I am deeply troubled by how we address it."
The populist wave, Obama said, was abetted by Fox News and other right-wing media outlets and encouraged to spread by social media companies that won't acknowledge their impact on democracy.
"I don't hold the tech companies entirely responsible," he said, "because this predates social media. It was already there. But social media has turbocharged it. ... The degree to which these companies are insisting that they are more like a phone company than they are like The Atlantic, I do not think is tenable. They are making editorial choices, whether they've buried them in algorithms or not. The First Amendment doesn't require private companies to provide a platform for any view that is out there."
Obama told National Public Radio: "If you watch Fox News, you perceive a different reality than if you read the New York Times and that didn't used to be as stark because you had local newspapers and you had people overlapping in terms of where they got information. But now, partly because of social media and sort of the echo chamber, a lot of the people who voted for Donald Trump do not believe that in fact COVID was mishandled."
On CBS News, Obama was asked what it says about America that 72 million people voted for Trump. "Well, what it says is that we are still deeply divided," he replied. "The power of that alternative worldview that's presented in the media that those voters consume, it carries a lot of weight."
Obama described how different things were as recently as 2008, when he ran for president.
"I went into a small town, there's a small-town newspaper, and the owner or editor is a conservative guy with a crew cut, maybe, and a bow tie, and he's been a Republican for years," he told The Atlantic. "He doesn't have a lot of patience for tax-and-spend liberals, but he'll take a meeting with me, and he'll write an editorial that says: 'He's a liberal Chicago lawyer, but he seems like a decent enough guy, had some good ideas.' "
Many of those newspapers are now gone, Obama said, and a right-wing network like Fox is on in the barbershop or the VFW hall, which makes it difficult to "break through."
Meanwhile, the current fight between Trump and Fox is deeply ironic. Fox, in what some see as a jab back at Trump, has a new slogan: "Standing up for what is right." Trump is furious at Fox and urging followers to move to more conspiratorial and, believe it or not, less responsible pro-Trump outlets like Newsmax or One America News Network.
Trump tweeted recently: "Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They (Fox) forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was @FoxNews!"
So, to summarize:
A major network is being threatened for being insufficiently irresponsible even as the mainstream media is told the concept of professional journalists as gatekeepers is obsolete.
Admittedly, this is self-serving, but it is hard for me to see how this gets better unless people become more discriminating and seek out professional reporting of the kind we do locally at the Cap Times, reporting that isn't driven by some kind of organizational partisan agenda.
For those too young to recall, Cronkite signed off his newscasts each night by saying "and that's the way it is." It appears both Obama and I miss Cronkite's era of media. That's the way it is.

Biden’s Cabinet: Who He’s Picked So Far

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — With the Trump administration having authorized the beginning of the formal transition process, President-elect Joe Biden is slowly naming the individuals he hopes will guide him through his first term as president and help shape his thinking in the years ahead.
Biden has chosen Cabinet nominees who are career officials and recognized experts in their fields, but they still face a confirmation process that has grown bitterly polarized. And the party that will hold the Senate during that process is not clear: Two runoffs in Georgia could tip the scales to Democrats. If Republicans retain control of the chamber, Biden’s may face a tougher path to confirmation.
Yet with a cast of well-known nominees and a newly created position focused on climate change, Biden has already begun to telegraph some of the issues he intends to prioritize. Here are the advisers he has picked, and some contenders he may announce later on:
SECRETARY OF STATE
Antony J. Blinken
In tapping Tony Blinken to serve as secretary of state, Biden appears determined to rebuild relationships with foreign leaders and international organizations that have atrophied under the isolationist policies that defined President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda.
If confirmed, Blinken will take charge of a State Department that has shrunk in size and stature under Trump, as staff reductions and resignations have thinned its ranks.
With his years of experience within the department, Blinken, 58, is well-versed in the mechanisms of diplomacy. He previously worked for the department under two previous administrations, including as deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama.
In Blinken, Biden hopes to install a measured and well-credentialed negotiator who can both represent the United States internationally as well as restore a sense of purpose within the State Department.
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
Jake Sullivan
Jake Sullivan, Biden’s pick to advise him on matters of national security, has been hailed in Washington as a gifted legal mind, one who has a long history of working with the president-elect.
Sullivan has built a lengthy résumé including a clerkship for Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer and work as chief counsel to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he worked for as the department’s head of policy planning, has described him as a “once-in-a-generation talent.”
Sullivan has also worked closely with other members of Biden’s planned Cabinet, succeeding Blinken as then-Vice President Biden’s national security adviser in 2013. Sullivan and Blinken maintain a close friendship and a shared philosophy about the United States’ role in the world that is expected to shape Biden’s approach in international affairs.
UNITED NATIONS AMBASSADOR
Linda Thomas-Greenfield
When Biden introduced some of his nominees Tuesday, they seemed intent on fully repudiating the current administration’s “America First” isolationism.
“Diplomacy is back,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden’s choice to represent the United States as ambassador to the United Nations. Biden plans to restore the post to Cabinet-level status after Trump downgraded it, giving Thomas-Greenfield a seat on his National Security Council.
Thomas-Greenfield brings more than 35 years of experience in the foreign service, having worked as the U.S. ambassador to Liberia and served in posts in Switzerland, Pakistan, Kenya, Gambia, Nigeria and Jamaica.
Thomas-Greenfield has worked in the private sector as well. She was previously a senior vice president at the Albright Stonebridge Group, the consulting firm founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, overseeing the firm’s Africa practice.
SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR CLIMATE
John F. Kerry
Emphasizing his intent to address the global threat posed by climate change as a pillar of his policy agenda, Biden selected John Kerry, the former secretary of state, to take up a newly created Cabinet-level position as his “climate czar.”
Kerry’s job will also carry with it a seat on the National Security Council, marking the first time that an adviser wholly dedicated to the issue of climate change will join the forum and placing him among other top advisers in the national security and foreign policy arena.
Kerry’s approach to the role is likely to be heavily informed by his experience working with other countries on agreements to set meaningful bench marks on carbon emissions and encourage sustainable growth. While secretary of state under Obama, Kerry was a chief negotiator for the United States on the Paris Agreement on climate change, which Biden has said he would recommit to on Day 1 of his administration.
Kerry will not have to face Senate confirmation, according to Biden’s transition team.
TREASURY SECRETARY
Janet L. Yellen
Looking for a trusted economist to lead the country’s economy out of a pandemic-driven downturn, Biden has settled on Janet Yellen, the former chair of the Federal Reserve.
If confirmed, Yellen would be the first woman to lead the Treasury in its 231-year history.
During her stint as Fed chair from 2014 to 2018, Yellen oversaw a record economic expansion that would go on to drive unemployment down to its lowest rate in 50 years and which helped produce a thriving economy that was upended by the coronavirus pandemic.
In selecting Yellen, Biden appeared to have opted for a safe and proven name, and a candidate who is expected to survive the confirmation process with some ease, unlike other economists proposed by the Democratic Party’s progressive wing who may have been less acceptable to Republicans in the Senate.
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
Avril D. Haines
Potentially the first woman to serve as the nation’s top intelligence official, Avril Haines comes with strong ties to the intelligence community, having served in both the Obama and George W. Bush administrations.
A trained physicist, Haines also helped oversee a number of covert programs at the National Security Council beginning in 2010 and then as deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2013-15, including the controversial targeted killing program involving precision drone strikes, some of which killed civilians.
While Haines has received criticism from some progressives over her involvement in the drone program, her work to increase oversight of those operations, as well as her strong credentials in intelligence work, are expected to satisfy enough senators to pave the way for her to be confirmed in what has traditionally been a nonpartisan role.
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY
Alejandro N. Mayorkas
Following four years of immigration policy narrowly tailored to Trump’s personal whims, Biden tapped Alejandro Mayorkas, a lawyer and former deputy homeland security secretary, to reorient the Department of Homeland Security.
A former director of the department’s legal immigration agency, Mayorkas will most likely be expected to roll back the Trump administration’s more punitive immigration policies in his new role. If confirmed, he would approach that task as the first immigrant to hold the position, as well as the first Latino.
Mayorkas faces the challenge of rebuilding an agency that suffered from unfilled vacancies and a chain of interim leaders in recent years, as well as one that has been embroiled in scandal over, among other issues, the Trump administration’s child separation policy.
What’s Outstanding?
Though several of the key positions covering foreign policy and national security now have nominees, other consequential picks have yet to be announced, with pressure building on Biden from activists and interest groups in support of their preferred candidates.
A number of Democrats and liberal groups have spoken up in recent days in support of Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., to lead the Interior Department. If selected and confirmed, Haaland would be the first Native American women to do so.
Biden’s team is said to have considered nominating Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont, to lead the Labor Department, a move that would please progressives but likely draw strong opposition from many Senate Republicans.
More than a dozen other positions are yet to be announced.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered a raw but optimistic address to Americans in his first nonpolitical speech since winning the election, pleading with the nation to “hang on” and have hope even with the number of coronavirus cases spiking across the country and a hard winter on the horizon.
“Looking back over our history, you see that it’s been in the most difficult circumstances that the soul of our nation has been forged,” Biden said, speaking directly to the camera from a stage at the Queen, a historic theater in Wilmington, Delaware, where he stepped into a void left for him by President Donald Trump, who has been rarely seen since the election.
In an implicit repudiation of Trump, who has dismissed the coronavirus as the flu and mocked people who wear masks, Biden urged Americans to see it as their patriotic duty to fight the pandemic together by taking the proper precautions. “I know the country has grown weary of the fight,” he said. “We need to remember we’re at war with the virus, not with one another, not with each other.”
As he urged Americans to wear face masks, practice social distancing and limit the size of group gatherings, especially around the holidays, he noted: “None of these steps we’re asking people to take are political statements. Every one of them is based on science, real science.”
He said he hoped the good news about effective vaccines would “serve as an incentive to every American to take these simple steps to get control of the virus. There’s real hope, tangible hope. So hang on.”
In the 2 1/2 weeks since Biden's election win became clear, he has been spreading a message of unity in an effort to reach the nearly 74 million Americans who voted for Trump. On the eve of Thanksgiving, he also addressed the pandemic head on with a mix of realism and hope.
“Many local health systems are at risk of being overwhelmed,” he said. “That’s the plain and simple truth. Nothing made up, it’s real. I believe you always deserve to hear the truth, hear the truth from your president.” He added, “Each of us has a responsibility in our own lives to do what we can do to slow the virus.”
Biden, aides said, decided about 10 days ago to give a Thanksgiving address as he watched coronavirus cases spiking across the country and thought about how his own typically large family gathering was going to be scaled down this year. (In his speech, he said he would be celebrating at home with his wife, Jill, their daughter, Ashley, and her husband.)
Biden spoke minutes after Trump called into a hotel gathering of Republican state lawmakers in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to discuss with them and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, baseless allegations of voting irregularities in the state. Trump again claimed he won the election he had lost and demanded that the election results be “turned” in his favor.
“This was an election that we won easily,” he said. “We won it by a lot.”
The president had intended to appear there in person, but he abruptly canceled those plans after a campaign adviser who had been near Giuliani tested positive for the coronavirus. Later in the day, Trump invited some of the Pennsylvania lawmakers to the White House to discuss what a person familiar with the situation said were voting irregularities. Trump did the same thing with a group of Michigan lawmakers — he pressured them to not certify Michigan’s 2020 election vote, which went for Biden — but it failed to work.
In contrast to Trump’s feckless efforts to overturn the election results, Biden praised the sanctity of the vote in his speech and commended Americans for casting their ballots in record numbers despite the pandemic. “Our democracy was tested this year,” he said. “What we learned is this: The people of this nation are up to the task. In America, we have full and fair and free elections. And then we honor the results.”
He called voting “the noblest instrument of nonviolent protests ever conceived.”
Trump, in the early days of the pandemic, had tried to brand himself a “wartime president,” before claiming, inaccurately, that the country had “rounded the curve.” Biden on Wednesday appeared to pick up the wartime mantle, describing the coronavirus pandemic as “a nearly yearlong battle” that has “devastated this nation.”
“America is not going to lose this war,” he said, reminding people, “Don’t let yourself surrender to the fatigue.”
Biden also tried to paint an optimistic vision of the future, despite the current crisis, and asked Americans to “dream again.”
“We’re going to lead the world by the power of our example, not just the example of our power,” he said. “We’re going to lead the world on climate and save this planet. We’re going to find cures for cancer and Alzheimer’s and diabetes, I promise you.”
Biden’s speech was infused with his own experience of devastating loss, which he often cites when he speaks to a nation that has so far lost more than 260,000 lives to the virus.
“I remember that first Thanksgiving, the empty chair, the silence,” he said, referring to the death of his son Beau Biden in 2015. “It takes your breath away. It’s really hard to care. It’s hard to give thanks. It’s hard to even think of looking forward. It’s so hard to hope. I understand.”
Trump had no plans to deliver any holiday message of his own. On Tuesday, he took part in the annual turkey pardon, a White House tradition that counted as one of his only public appearances since the election.
On Wednesday, after Biden’s address, the president announced on Twitter that he had pardoned the first of his four national security advisers, Michael Flynn, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat and whose prosecution Attorney General William Barr tried to shut down.
Biden and his aides were trying to treat the last gasps of Trump’s presidency as a side show. In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday morning, transition officials said the president-elect did not need Trump to concede in order to carry on with the necessary business before them that began this week after the head of the General Services Administration formally acknowledged the election results.
“We do not feel that it is necessary for President-elect Biden to speak with President Trump,” Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Biden, said on a conference call with reporters. “We believe we’re getting the information our teams need.”

Fact check: Meme makes false claims about media's 2016 and 2020 election coverage

Texto completo: The claim: The media said 'Russia stole the election' in 2016 and now says the 2020 election is 'impossible to steal'
As President Donald Trump's election challenges fail and he begrudgingly begins to accommodate a transition of power, he is looking at the 2016 election to draw false comparisons and point fingers at journalists he says never accepted his victory. His supporters aren't far behind, offering up a meme suggesting hypocrisy in media coverage of the 2016 and 2020 elections.
“2016 MEDIA: RUSSIA STOLE THE ELECTION,” reads a meme ForAmerica posted to Facebook Nov. 12. “2020 MEDIA: OUR ELECTIONS ARE LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STEAL.”
The meme includes two images of CNN anchor Don Lemon and makes a blanket statement about “the media.”
Fact check: Claim that voting noncitizens affected 2020 election outcome is unverified
A watermark on the meme's bottom-left corner shows an imgflip.com user initially posted the meme to the site’s politics page in early November.
User KingToady captioned the meme “Double talk much?” and used the tags: “biased media,” “election 2020,” “cnn fake news,” “maga” and “funny memes.” KingToady has made several comments questioning the existence of Black voter suppression and criticizing Democrats in recent weeks.
USA TODAY's analysis of 2016 and 2020 election media coverage concludes the media did not report Russia stole the election in 2016 and is not now reporting the 2020 election would be impossible to steal. Rather, major media outlets have reported that Russia sought to use misinformation to influence American voters in 2016 and are now reporting that 2020 election fraud claims are unsupported. In both cases, this reporting is consistent with information provided by government officials in intelligence, law enforcement and the courts.
ForAmerica has yet to respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. USA TODAY could not contact KingToady.
Intelligence community and Mueller investigation conclude Russia interfered in 2016 election
On Jan. 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence disclosed to the public its conclusion that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election by seeking to influence American voters’ opinions of Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election," read the report. "Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”
On Feb. 16, 2018, special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals on charges of election interference for engaging in a misinformation campaign out of St. Petersburg.
Several months later, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the U.S. had indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for conspiring to hack the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign in an effort to influence the election.
A May 8, 2018, Senate Intelligence Committee report found no evidence that Russian actors were able to compromise election infrastructure or change votes, although they did try.
"Russian actors scanned databases for vulnerabilities, attempted intrusions, and in a small number of cases successfully penetrated a voter registration database," reported the panel.
"The Committee has not seen any evidence that vote tallies were manipulated or that voter registration information was deleted or modified," the committee concluded in agreement with the January 2017 report.
In April 2019, the investigation led by Mueller concluded "the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion."
Top cybersecurity official: 2020 election was secure
In a Nov. 12 assessment of the 2020 election’s integrity, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Christopher Krebs said the election was the most secure in U.S. history.
“There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,” reported Krebs.
The announcement came after Krebs directed an extensive election security initiative meant to prevent foreign interference and voter fraud.
On Nov. 17, Trump announced he'd fired Kreb for making the announcement.
Fact check: False claim that deceased Michigan man voted in 2020
Media reported on Russian interference in 2016, and on false fraud claims in 2020
The media broadly describes large news networks, independent outlets, social media, partisan outlets representing views across the political spectrum, among other things. Since it would be impossible to compare how all media have described the 2016 and 2020 elections, USA TODAY looked at how several major American outlets described both elections to investigate the validity of this claim.
Fact check: Claims linking Dominion Voting Systems to Democrats are wrong or misleading
Regarding the 2016 election, major U.S. media outlets reported that Russian operatives used online misinformation to alter American voter’s perception of each candidate, as part of an influence campaign ordered by the Kremlin. In 2020, they've reported there has been no evidence to support claims of widespread election fraud.
The New York Times
The New York Times complies all stories written about Russia's role in the 2016 election under a news event on its website. “Russian Hacking and Influence in the U.S. Election: Complete coverage of Russia’s campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election," the Times titled the page.
A day after the 2020 election, the Times called Trump’s allegations of voter fraud “baseless,” “fantastical” and “false,” explaining that there is no evidence to support claims of widespread corruption.
The Washington Post
Likewise, the Washington Post has reported “Russian interference” in the 2016 election.
Through the 2020 election cycle, the Post has reported there is no evidence of voter fraud, fact-checking false claims along the way. On Nov. 17, it published an article titled “Two weeks on, no evidence of any significant fraud.”
NBC/MSNBC
NBC and MSNBC have reported that Russia “interfered” with the 2016 election through “information warfare.” They did not say the election was stolen.
On Nov. 11, NBC described claims of 2020 election fraud as “a dizzying array of false claims and conspiracy theories” with “no evidence of significant, widespread or even small-time voter fraud.”
The Wall Street Journal
In January 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that Russian officials "ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S presidential election," and to "undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process."
"There is no evidence of widespread election fraud," the Wall Street Journal wrote of the 2020 election.
Politico
"The Kremlin’s canny operatives didn’t change votes; they won them, influencing voters to choose Russia’s preferred outcome by pushing stolen information at just the right time—through slanted, or outright false stories on social media," Politico reported in December 2016.
Since Election Day, Politico has called Trump's allegations of widespread voter fraud "baseless" explaining that there is "no evidence of broad wrongdoing."
USA TODAY
Since the 2016 presidential debate cycle, USA TODAY has reported about potential Russian influence on American voters. "Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, have become prominent issues in the U.S. campaign and were mentioned during Wednesday's debate for allegedly interfering in the election," USA TODAY wrote in an article published Oct. 20, 2016.
"U.S. intelligence officials say Russia is behind a series of computer hacks that leaked embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Clinton campaign staffers," USA TODAY also reported at the time."
USA TODAY has called Trump's allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 election "baseless" and numerous fact-check articles have found no evidence to support claims of widespread election fraud.
CBS News
On Dec. 10, 2016, CBS reported "U.S. officials believe Russia not only tried to influence the 2016 presidential election, but also favored President-elect Donald Trump," adding, "Intelligence officials have been building toward this conclusion for some time.''
In its coverage of the 2020 election, CBS has called claims of voter fraud "baseless" and described Trump's legal challenges as attempts to "undermin(e) the election."
ABC News
ABC has described Russian involvement in the 2016 election as "interference" in its coverage.
Since Election Day, ABC has repeatedly reported about continued distrust in the results "despite little evidence surfacing thus far of any widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election."
CNN
CNN has similarly reported Russian "interference" and "influence" in the 2016 election through bankrolling the spread of fake news about Hillary Clinton. CNN did write that Russian operatives hacked Democratic National Committee accounts and released stolen emails "aimed at helping Trump," however, the cable outlet did not suggest Russians hacked election infrastructure.
In March 2017, CNN's Don Lemon, whose image is used in the meme, described "potential Russian interference in the presidential election."
On Nov. 21 of this year, CNN wrote about "baseless claims about fraud" to which "there is no actual evidence of wrongdoing."
Lemon called Trump's claims of voter fraud "baseless" and discussed "Trump's rigged election fantasy" in a clip posted on his Facebook page.
USA TODAY could find no evidence that Lemon ever said the 2016 election was stolen or that the 2020 election is impossible to steal. CNN has yet to respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.
Fact check: Federal Election Commission chair echoes false claims of fraud
Our rating: False
We rate the claim that the media said Russia stole the 2016 election and now say the 2020 election is impossible to steal FALSE, because it is not supported by our research. Analysis of major outlets' coverage of both elections show journalists reported that Russia sought to negatively influence Americans' perception of Hillary Clinton leading up to the 2016 election and that there is no evidence to suggest there was widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. These media reports are consistent with with conclusions reached by U.S. officials in the intelligence community, Justice Department, law enforcement, the courts, and the Department of Homeland Security.

PARIS — Prosecutors in France said Wednesday that they had dropped a rape investigation into a former deputy mayor of Paris because the statute of limitations on the alleged offense had expired.
The prosecutors opened their investigation of Christophe Girard in mid-August, two days after The New York Times published an article in which Aniss Hmaïd, now 46, accused Girard of abusing him sexually in the 1990s, starting when he was still a minor. Hmaïd claimed that Girard coerced him into sex some 20 times over the course of about a decade.
In exchange, Girard, now 64, employed the younger man as a domestic worker in his home and also gave him odd jobs at the French fashion company Yves Saint Laurent, where he was a top executive before entering politics.
“He took advantage of my youth, of my young age and everything for his sexual pleasures,” Hmaïd said in the August article. On Wednesday, he declined to comment on the prosecutor’s decision to drop the investigation.
From the outset, Hmaïd’s accusations were expected to fall under the statute of limitations, which was 20 years at the time of the alleged offense, and therefore were never likely to lead to a conviction. But French prosecutors regularly open investigations in sexual abuse cases to identify other potential victims, even if the statute of limitations may have expired.
The allegations against Girard were the first among a series of sexual abuse scandals that have rocked Paris City Hall in recent months. They are part of a broader reckoning over sex, gender and power in France that has shaken the cultural and political realms.
Girard, a power broker in politics and culture for a generation, had already been the subject of intense criticism during the summer over his links to Gabriel Matzneff, a French writer who openly promoted pedophilia for decades while benefiting from the protection of French elites. Under pressure over his connections to Matzneff, Girard resigned as deputy mayor but continued until now to sit on the Paris City Council.
Hmaïd told The New York Times that he first met Girard in Tunisia in the summer of 1989 when he was 15. He said they met in Hammamet, a Tunisian resort town, where Girard hired him as a houseboy in a villa he had rented. But it was a year later, during a trip together to the United States in 1990, that Girard began abusing him sexually in Washington, Hmaïd said.
In an interview with The New York Times, Girard denied ever engaging in any sexual relationship with Hmaïd. But he said he had spent time with the younger man and considered him a member of the family.
“Now I have to think about my new life,” Girard said in a text message on Wednesday, adding that he had “always had confidence in the French justice system and its independence.”
An official from the Paris prosecutor’s office said that they had “closed the case against Mr. Girard as a result of the statute of limitations having expired.”
Nevertheless, activists and members of the Paris City Council pressed for Girard’s full withdrawal from political life in the name of ethics.
Girard’s case eventually caused a rift in the leftist alliance governing Paris, with young Green party City Council members openly opposing the former deputy mayor while Mayor Anne Hidalgo strongly supported him.
It also reignited a fierce debate over feminism in France.
Raphaëlle Rémy-Leleu, a feminist and Green party City Council member, said that she could not envision Girard returning to his responsibilities on the council.
“It is a question of ethics and political morality” more than a question of legal proceedings, Rémy-Leleu said. She expressed doubts that he could again become an elected official entrusted with projects or responsibilities.
France recently toughened laws against sex crimes and extended the statute of limitations for rape of a minor to 30 years from 20 years, but that extension cannot be applied retroactively to Hmaid’s case.
Prosecutors did not comment on the content of the investigation or whether the charges against Girard were substantiated.

NEW YORK — Though her mother lives in Arizona, Cecily Smith typically spends Thanksgiving in New York City with friends who feel like family.
Some years, they shared holiday meals at vibrant restaurants. Other times, they held potlucks in cramped apartments, trading recipes and traditions. More recently, Smith helped cook an eclectic menu to celebrate a Nigerian friend’s first Thanksgiving.
But with the country in the grip of a surging pandemic, Smith will spend Thanksgiving this year alone in her Harlem apartment, making herself cocktails and binge-watching Netflix. Her friends, she said, plan to do the same.
“I know I’m going to be lonely,” said Smith, 46, who has lived in the city for about 20 years. “It is lonely. This is a whole lonely experience.”
The pandemic has altered holiday plans all over the United States this year. But in a bustling city where traditions often extend beyond family to bring friends, acquaintances, castoffs and transplants around the table, the loneliness can especially gnaw.
To be alone in New York City on Thanksgiving is to be all too aware of the once-vibrant scene that no longer waits on the other side of the door.
With a second wave bearing down, officials have urged Americans not to travel, Gov. Andrew Cuomo limited private gatherings to 10 people for the foreseeable future and Mayor Bill de Blasio implored people to skip the crowded feasts that generally mark the holiday.
A number of city residents, though not all, will heed those warnings, canceling their annual pilgrimages home. Others who typically stay put — whether for economic reasons, or to avoid relatives’ interrogations about their job prospects, rent payments and love lives — have found their long-standing plans canceled or altered.
So on Thanksgiving, a holiday marked by coming together, many city residents now face the wrenching prospect of a holiday alone and isolated in a place whose social nature is a top draw.
“I’m unemployed, broke and alone,” said Pemberton Roach, a musician who usually books gigs the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, a busy evening for nightlife.
With venues shuttered, the pandemic has left Roach jobless, and his typical gathering of friends was canceled because one of the hosts has COVID-19. So instead, “I’ll most likely be eating hot dogs and drinking a bottle of Jim Beam at my coffee table,” he said.
The city’s holiday staples will also be missing. The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade has cut its route to one block, putting an end to sidewalk crowds and balloon-watching parties. Movie theaters, long an antidote for holiday loneliness, remain closed. Restaurants have limited capacity, a rainy forecast does not favor outdoor dining and many people remain uncomfortable eating indoors.
Even the best-laid alternate plans have disintegrated. With the pandemic never quite abating, Kelsey O’Hara, 32, never expected to leave her home in Brooklyn this Thanksgiving and head to her parents’ orchard in Pennsylvania. Instead, she and some friends planned a smaller meal in Bay Ridge, with the requirement that all attendees test negative for coronavirus in advance.
O'Hara tested negative last Wednesday. Two days later, the gathering’s host called the celebration off, deciding that the risk of exposure was still too high.
O’Hara — who also spent her birthday alone this week — has unsuccessfully tried to find a new arrangement. She is not sure if a last-minute gathering is even worth the risk.
“I’m scared to be alone,” O’Hara said. “But then, I don’t know, what’s the other option? Possibly getting sick?”
New York City residents have reported struggling with pandemic-related loneliness and isolation since March, when officials shut down the city and state.
Dr. Victoria Ngo, a professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, conducted a survey of 1,000 New Yorkers in the spring that showed 35% to 45% were at risk for depression and anxiety throughout those months, when the pandemic was at its peak in the city.
The holidays, too, generally brought an increased mental health risk for those who will be spending them alone, she added.
“They’re thinking I should have family, I should have friends, I should be doing all these happy things — it triggers those sorts of expectations,” Ngo said. “And then there’s a disappointment that I think would make things difficult.”
Ngo encouraged people struggling with isolation to try to reflect on what they were grateful for and to reach out to others, whether via phone, FaceTime or Zoom.
The gulf between holiday expectations and reality will likely be widened by the pandemic. Dr. Sidd Dalal, a resident at Northwell Health, had planned this year to bring his fiancée to his family’s gathering for the first time.
Instead, Dalal, 31, who is researching the neurological effects of COVID-19, will be alone in Downtown Brooklyn, grabbing premade food from Trader Joe’s and possibly a rotisserie chicken. His fiancée will be in Toronto with her family, and his parents will be at home in a small town in Georgia.
“Someone new and important is coming into my family,” he said of his fiancée. “I wanted to create that togetherness.”
Still, as a health care worker studying the virus’s deleterious effects, he thought it was important not to travel and risk infecting himself or his family.
“I’d rather miss this one and be alive for the next,” Dalal said.
Others were determined to embrace the pandemic’s restrictions and view them in a different light. Geneva Thomas, 37, typically spends Thanksgiving with her mother, who visits New York City from Detroit. In years past, the two went shopping, cooked together and tried to see a Broadway show.
Thomas’ mother died last November. This year’s celebration will be her first alone. But the pandemic’s restrictions eased the pressure of attending a gathering, allowing her instead to grieve in private, she said.
Thomas declined invitations and planned to spend the holiday in her apartment in Weehawken, New Jersey, cooking the dishes her mother used to make.
“I’ll just make a plate for my mom and for me, and put on some music — her favorite artist is Luther Vandross,” Thomas said. “And I’ll just reflect and hope for healing.”
Tanen Clark, who moved to Manhattan from Connecticut three years ago, was also focusing on the silver lining. She was disappointed not to spend the holiday eating noodle kugel and turkey with family in Chicago but had been excitedly browsing Instagram in search of a fancy meal she could order from a restaurant.
If she got lonely, Clark, 31, said, she could always step outside her Upper East Side apartment, where the bustle of New York City meant she was bound to see some people.
“I’d much rather be alone here,” she said, “than alone in Connecticut.”

Archaeologists working in Colonial Williamsburg to unearth what life was like for the original congregants of one of the oldest Black congregations in the country have uncovered one and possibly two graves and more than 12,000 artifacts, including an ink bottle, doll fragments and coins.
Digging beneath a parking lot in the Virginia city, the researchers were able to find the foundations for a brick church built in 1856, what may be an even older church building and a grave or graves potentially for members of the congregation, the Historic First Baptist Church of Williamsburg, Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg’s director of archaeology, said Tuesday. Gary, who is overseeing the excavation, said that there was at least one grave and possibly two and that there were probably more burial shafts at the site.
“When I set foot on the excavation site and listened to the history that they were uncovering, it was an awesome feeling,” said the Rev. Julie Grace, who was christened at the church in 1949 and is now an associate minister. “To be standing on the same ground of our ancestors — there’s no feeling like realizing that your ancestors have such an important part of history.”
The archaeological project is being backed by leaders of the historic church, whose members include descendants of those who attended the church at the excavation site. The first phase of the dig began in September and ended earlier this month. The next phase is set to begin in January.
“The presence of African Americans is all over Colonial Williamsburg,” Gary said. “Fifty-two percent of the population was Black. The difference here is this is one space where a lot of folks in that community are coming together. This is the space where things were happening.”
According to the project’s website, free and enslaved Black people met in secret to found the First Baptist Church around the start of the American Revolution. The remains of the first Baptist Meeting House, which records show stood at the site in 1818 and perhaps as early as the late 18th century, may be buried at the excavation site, though it will take more research to be certain.
Another church building was erected in 1856 and stood for nearly a century until it was purchased by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation in 1956. The building was torn down that year as part of Colonial Williamsburg restoration efforts, with another church being built blocks away. The goal, Gary said, was to restore the area to how it appeared during the colonial period.
“The story of a Black congregation was not part of the Colonial Williamsburg narrative in the 1950s,” he said.
The site was paved over in 1965. A plaque honoring the church was placed there in 1983.
“You have to understand that, in that time period, when things got done and you didn’t get to be a part of the decision-making, there’s resentment,” said Connie Matthews Harshaw, president of the church’s Let Freedom Ring Foundation. Congregants who remember the church before it was torn down told her that “community meetings were being held in places where Blacks were not allowed to come. There wasn’t an opportunity for the Black community to voice their objection.”
Colonial Williamsburg, in the historic district of Williamsburg, Virginia, is an open-air museum that attempts to recreate life in the colonial era. It is populated by historical reenactors dressed in period garb and performing interpretations of how people lived and worked at the time. However, it wasn’t until 1979 that Black residents’ stories started to be interpreted, and even then primary sources that speak to Black life were limited.
The project’s website said that, if successful, “this initiative will enable Colonial Williamsburg to expand its Black-interpretative programming through voices that have been silent since the Revolution.”
When the archaeology project started work in earnest to unearth the church, the impact was powerful.
“When the trees came down and the parking lot came up, it was pretty emotional,” Matthews Harshaw said.
The next phase of the project will last for 18 months. Gary said the archaeologists hoped to make the excavations as publicly accessible as possible, allowing visitors to see the work on a daily basis and ask questions.
Matthews Harshaw said her immediate concern was identifying those still buried at the site. At the same time, she and the church are recording oral histories from the remaining descendants. She hopes that the church is restored and eventually becomes a museum.
“I did not grow up in this church,” she admitted. “But I am a member of this church. And I want to know the story. What happened to all these people? Where did they go?”

What started as a Midwestern surge has grown into coast-to-coast disaster.
Over the past two months, rural counties and midsize cities in the Great Plains and Upper Midwest have been the main drivers of the dizzying growth in U.S. coronavirus cases.
But the virus appears to have entered a new phase in recent days: The reason the country is continuing to break case records has less to do with North Dakota and Wisconsin than it does with swift resurgences of the virus in cities like Baltimore, Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix and with first-time spikes in smaller cities away from the nation’s middle, like Cumberland, Maryland.
“Our people are tired,” said Maggie Hansen, chief nursing executive at Memorial Healthcare System in south Florida. “They’re tired, and they don’t see an end in sight.”
Coronavirus cases are emerging in their highest numbers of the pandemic, with more than 175,000 a day, on average, in a country that has seen more cases and more deaths than anywhere else in the world. More than 1.2 million cases have been identified in the United States in the past week alone, and the country is on pace to reach 13 million known cases in the coming days. Deaths are also rising fast, with more than 2,200 announced nationwide Tuesday, the most on a single day since early May.
The spread of the virus rages on in the Great Plains and the Upper Midwest. Iowa and South Dakota continue to report new cases at some of the highest rates in the country, and deaths there have reached their highest levels on record. But the pace of the spread has slowed in those regions while rapidly increasing in other, more populous parts of the country, including in California, where more than 17,000 cases were announced Monday, and in Texas, where more than 20,000 cases were announced Tuesday, the two highest daily totals of any state during the pandemic.
All of this has been unfolding on the eve of what infectious-disease experts see as a likely turning point for the outbreak in this country. Dr. Eli Perencevich, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Iowa, said he feared the worst was still yet to come in his state, especially with Thanksgiving gatherings and cold weather looming.
“Human behavior is very different indoors versus outdoors when it gets cold, so I’m worried that’s going to make things worse,” said Perencevich, who has treated coronavirus patients. “And then we know Thanksgiving, where we’re all just bracing, given that the hospitals are completely full.”
Unlike in the spring, when the Northeast faced the worst, and the summer, when the Sun Belt saw explosive growth, this latest surge has begun to move beyond a single region. In fact, it is elbowing back into places like New York City that had brought earlier outbreaks under control and tearing through cities that had not seen many cases all along.
“People just wanted some normalcy and got loose, and here you are,” said Cyndi Kirkhart, who runs a food bank in Huntington, West Virginia, an area that is averaging a record 250 cases daily, more than triple the number from a month ago. “With the pandemic fatigue and all the politics stuff getting close to Election Day, there were so many things that contributed.”
The small city of Cumberland, in Maryland’s Appalachian panhandle, also avoided the worst of the pandemic’s first months.
By midsummer, Emmanuel Episcopal Church, a Gothic Revival landmark overlooking the city’s downtown, was inviting people back inside for services, though with disinfectant and temperature checks. The church rector and a part-time priest and their spouses dined together regularly but took precautions, usually staying outdoors.
And even as cases started rising this fall on the northern Plains, infections remained relatively scarce around Cumberland and many other cities in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast.
“Then, right before Halloween,” said the rector, the Rev. Martha Macgill, “it just exploded.”
In the first days of November, the priest and her husband were both admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. Per capita, Allegany County, where Cumberland is the county seat, now has the worst outbreak in Maryland, and the Cumberland region has the 14th-highest number of recent cases per capita of any U.S. metro area.
“It kind of happened silently then all of a sudden it was bad,” Macgill said.
About 1,100 miles to the west, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the fall surge came early. Mayor Paul TenHaken said some people in his city wrongly thought they had made it through the worst after a spring wave, mostly confined to a meatpacking plant, came and passed.
But the virus returned and hit the city hard: Two of TenHaken’s five staff members tested positive, as have dozens of others the mayor knows. The Sioux Falls area has had the sixth-most known cases per capita of any U.S. metro area. Hospitalizations and infections remain high statewide but have slightly declined in recent days. TenHaken’s unease remains.
“This week makes me a little nervous, just with all the travel and Thanksgiving and gatherings,” the mayor said. “I think this will be the real test, how diligent people are once you get into the holidays.”
Elsewhere, in the Midwest, there are localized signs of progress, or at least stabilization, though officials say that it could all prove fleeting.
The marginal progress in the Midwest comes after governors in some states, including Illinois, Iowa and North Dakota, imposed additional restrictions, and after hospital leaders across the region issued public warnings that they were running out of capacity to treat the sick.
In Wisconsin, which for weeks reported explosive growth, reports of new cases continued rising, but by 4% over the past two weeks. In Nebraska, which also saw runaway growth, the curve has flattened, with 1% growth. And in Illinois, which has averaged more than 10,000 cases per day, infection numbers have also leveled off, especially around Chicago.
“This is going to take weeks, not days,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said this week. “But is there a glimmer of hope? There is.”
Any incremental improvements in the Midwest has been more than offset by growing outbreaks elsewhere. In Los Angeles County, California, where cases have soared past the levels seen this summer, to an average of more than 4,000 a day, restaurants can no longer offer indoor or outdoor dining starting Wednesday evening. Around Miami, reports of new cases have more than quadrupled since the start of October, although they remain below the peak levels seen in July.
“We fully anticipate it’s going to increase, but we just want to do whatever we can to not get into the same position we were over the summer,” said Dr. Peter Paige, who was recently appointed the chief medical officer of Miami-Dade County. “It’s a real threat.”
Epidemiologists and public health officials around the country said the reason for resurging outbreaks could be explained by a simple variable: what people choose to do.
Dr. Debra Bogen, health director in Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County, told reporters last week that the fast-paced increase in local cases was fueled by people letting down their guard.
“The virus itself hasn’t changed — what has is our behavior,” Bogen said, recounting the story of an informal homecoming dance, organized by parents in a local school district, that turned out to be an event that led to multiple confirmed cases.
In Kansas, Anil Gharmalkar, 41, who owns a trucking company and lives in the town of Oswego, believed that the virus was a “big city problem,” unlikely to affect him.
Then he got infected.
“COVID didn’t care what I believed,” Gharmalkar said in a video posted by the University of Kansas Health System, where he has been treated and received a breathing device that has been implanted in his throat. “I gave lip service to being careful, and I could have been more careful, and I wish I would have been.”
All the while, deaths are rising, the virus is raging and, for most Americans, a vaccine is still months away.
What comes next? It depends in part, experts said, on how Thursday plays out around the country.
“Thanksgiving hasn’t happened yet,” Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said this week. “People can still change their plans and change the outcomes. We don’t have to have superspreader events at homes.”

Texto completo: The claim: Mouthwash can kill coronavirus in 30 seconds
A wave of misinformation circulated the internet after a report was released on mouthwash and its effectiveness at killing COVID-19 in saliva.
A viral post by Hollywood Unlocked, a pop culture news outlet, claims that mouthwash can reportedly kill COVID-19 in 30 seconds.
“The latest development comes from a UK laboratory that found that mouthwash can kill COVID-19 within 30 seconds of exposure,” reads a Nov. 18 Instagram post with over 400,000 views.
The claim cites information from Cardiff University that allegedly shows over-the-counter mouthwashes with at least 0.07% of cetylpyridinium chloride indicate signs of eliminating coronavirus.
USA TODAY reached out to the Hollywood Unlocked for comment.
Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?
Some users on Twitter made a joke of the announcement, writing, “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my mouthwash containing 0.07% of the ingredient cetylpyridinium chloride.”
Others predicted that panic buying of mouthwash would soon begin.
What the study says
The study was conducted by researchers at Cardiff 's Systems Immunity Research Institute in an "in vitro" experiment, meaning that it was not tested on humans, but rather, it was done under conditions that imitated the naso/oropharynx passage.
The preliminary study found that mouthwashes containing at least 0.07% cetypyridinium chloride could kill the virus in saliva but could not treat COVID-19 inside of the body or act as a cure.
Dr. Richard Stanton, the lead author on the study and a reader in virology at Cardiff University, said in a press release that the study "adds to the emerging literature that several commonly available mouthwashes designed to fight gum disease can also inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (and other related coronaviruses) when tested in the laboratory under conditions that are designed to mimic the oral/nasal cavity in a test tube.”
However, Stanton noted that the study is not yet peer reviewed and published, "which means it has not yet been scrutinised by other scientists" and that it has been submitted for publication.
“People should continue to follow the preventive measures issued by the UK government, including washing hands frequently and maintaining social distance," he said. "We would encourage people to always use mouthwash safely and as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.”
David Thomas, a professor at Cardiff University, told the BBC that while the results were encouraging, the study would not produce evidence on transmission prevention of COVID-19.

Experts caution against study
While the study suggests that mouthwash could potentially kill COVID-19 in the saliva, there is no evidence to confirm the findings and experts have cautioned against the study.
Professor Jean-Yves Maillard, professor of pharmaceutical microbiology at Cardiff University, said in a statement that the findings should not be viewed as "using mouthwash instead of face masks, but instead as a potential combined intervention: use of mouthwash and wearing face masks."
"You can't sterilize your mouth. It is never going to be totally free of pathogens," Dr. Graham Snyder, associate professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, told CNN. "Using these oral rinses won't substantially stop the disease process. The virus will continue to replicate."
Listerine notes on its website that its mouthwash has not been tested against any strains of COVID-19 and is not intended to prevent or treat COVID-19.
Dr. Valerie Fitzhugh, a pathologist at Rutgers University, told the New York Times that a similar study was conducted in the 1990s to inactivate a strain of the flu by swirling Listerine for 30 seconds, but that the study "was never shown to be clinically relevant."
Fact check: Pfizer received COVID-19 vaccine data after Election Day, released within days
Similar studies conducted
Previous studies have also suggested that mouthwash could potentially be effective at inactivating the coronavirus.
A study published on Sept. 17 in the Journal of Medical Virology stated that "Listerine and Listerinelike products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9 percent even with a 30-second contact time."
However, the study focused on a common cold strain of COVID-19, "human coronavirus 229E" and not "SARS-CoV-2" according to The New York Times. Similar to the Cardiff research, this study was also not tested on human participants.
In October, a study published in the British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery suggested that oral cavity and saliva could serve as a potential reservoir for COVID-19 transmission.
A Penn State College of Medicine research study also indicated that certain oral antiseptics and mouthwashes could have the ability to inactivate human coronaviruses.
However, there is still no evidence that mouthwash is a treatment for COVID-19 and experts state that the studies don't prove that it can reduce the risk or catching or transmitting the virus.

Unemployment Claims Jumped Last Week as Coronavirus Cases Surge

Applications for unemployment benefits rose for the second week in a row last week, the latest sign that the nationwide surge in coronavirus cases is threatening to undermine the economic recovery.
More than 827,000 people filed first-time applications for state unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That was up 78,000 from a week earlier, before adjusting for seasonal patterns, and more than 100,000 from the first week of November, when weekly filings hit their lowest level since pandemic-induced layoffs began last spring.
Another 312,000 people filed for benefits under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which covers freelancers, self-employed workers and others who do not qualify for state benefits. And 4.5 million people are now receiving benefits under a separate program that extends payments during the pandemic, a total that has been rising as more people reach the end of their state benefits. Both those programs expire at the end of the year.
Unemployment filings have fallen substantially since last spring, when more than 6 million people a week were applying for benefits. But progress has stalled in recent months, and the data reported Wednesday suggests it could be going in reverse.
“I don’t think the report is cause for panic, but it certainly is concerning to see claims rise two weeks in a row at a time when the level of claims is still above Great Recession peaks,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor. He noted that unlike the previous week’s increase, which was concentrated in Louisiana, the latest report showed increases across the country.
Separate data released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday also pointed to a slowdown. Personal income fell 0.7% in October as declines in government aid offset wage and salary gains. Consumer spending rose 0.5%, the smallest gain since the recovery began last spring.
Evidence from private-sector sources tells a similar story. Consumer confidence fell in November, The Conference Board reported Tuesday, and data on job postings, hours worked and consumer spending show either a loss of momentum or outright declines in November.
“We have definitely seen a slowdown since Labor Day, and in the last few weeks, it’s actually gone into a decline,” said Dave Gilbertson, a vice president at UKG, which provides time-tracking software to about 30,000 U.S. businesses.
Economists worry that the slowdown could deepen in coming weeks, as consumers pull back on spending and cities and states reimpose business restrictions, something that has already begun to happen in California, Michigan and other states.
Unlike in the spring, households and businesses will have to weather the latest shutdowns largely on their own. Federal programs that provided trillions of dollars of support to small businesses and unemployed workers expired over the summer, and efforts to revive them have stalled in Congress. Many of the remaining programs run out at the end of the year.
“Part of the reason the recovery has done so well is because there was so much assistance for affected businesses and workers, and this is just really not the time to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. More aid, she said, is necessary to “prevent this temporary disruption from becoming permanent destruction.”

Amid Thailand’s Protests, a Feared Tool to Protect the Monarchy Returns

BANGKOK — The number 112 strikes fear in Thailand. It refers to Section 112 of the country’s criminal code, which makes insulting or defaming the king and his close kin an offense punishable by three to 15 years in prison.
On Tuesday night, a leader of the protest movement that is calling for changes to Thailand’s monarchy and political system received a summons to face multiple charges of lèse-majesté, as the crime is known. It was the first time that Section 112 had been applied during the protests, which have brought thousands of people onto the streets since July.
The protest leader, Parit Chiwarak, commonly known as Penguin, must report to a police station by Tuesday to face the charges, which stem from speeches he gave in September and this month. In those speeches, Parit and others called for the monarchy to come under the Thai Constitution and for the public to be allowed to scrutinize its considerable wealth.
Eleven other protest leaders have also received summonses for lèse-majesté charges, according to the International Federation for Human Rights, which works with human rights lawyers in Thailand. Section 112 has not been used to prosecute individuals for the past two years, according to legal scholars.
The revival of 112 came hours before a rally in Bangkok on Wednesday during which protesters urged King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun to return his fortune to the people. Tax revenues, they said, were being used to fund his lavish lifestyle and fill the coffers of one of the world’s richest monarchies.
The protest took place at the headquarters of the Siam Commercial Bank, in which the king is the biggest shareholder. It was the first rally to focus almost exclusively on overhauling the monarchy’s powers, as opposed to bundling the issue together with calls for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of a 2014 coup, to resign.
“I am not scared,” Parit said Tuesday night, after receiving his summons. “I am more worried about the country if they are still using this 112 in politics like this. This will cause the monarchy to deteriorate further.”
Parit appeared at Wednesday’s protests dressed in a yellow duck suit, evoking the rubber duckies that have become a protest symbol. Others at the rally held up signs with the number 112 crossed out. A large portrait of the king went untouched.
In just a few months, Thailand has transformed from a country where criticism of the monarchy was only whispered to a place where protesters have spray-painted “the king is dead” on Bangkok streets.
The robust criticism, particularly from Thailand’s youth, has appalled royalists and left Prayuth, a retired general who tried to justify the 2014 coup as necessary to protect the monarchy, contending with a rapidly shifting landscape.
“Any defamation law depends on what society thinks is OK and not OK, but in Thailand, we’ve had this oceanic change and what was lèse-majesté and defamation yesterday might not be what it is today,” said David Streckfuss, an independent scholar who has studied the application of Section 112 over the years.
“When we look back 10 years from now at the decline of the monarchy, we might say that this moment, of using 112, was a big misstep, a self-inflicted wound, which is what often happens with fading institutions,” he added.
Thailand abolished absolute monarchy in 1932, but deference to the king was institutionalized for decades, especially under King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years and was seen by the United States as a bulwark against the communist revolutions sweeping the region.
Images of both monarchs, who are envisaged as semi-divine beings, are ubiquitous across the country, from giant billboards near international airports to smaller portraits in shophouses. When politicians are given an audience with the monarch, they typically prostrate themselves and slide sideways to show their respect.
The royal anthem is played at many public events, even at movie theaters, and people were conditioned to stand in respect or face possible consequences. (That has changed in recent weeks, with far fewer people rising to greet a photo montage of the king at cinemas.)
Those who have fallen afoul of lèse-majesté accusations over the years have included Thai academics who called for reforms to the monarchy, a foreigner who defaced a portrait of the former king, and relatives of King Maha Vajiralongkorn’s third wife, who was purged in 2014. For two years after the 2014 coup, Section 112 prosecutions rose sharply.
Bhumibol — known as Rama IX, the ninth monarch in the Chakri Dynasty — died in 2016. His son has spent most of his reign living in Europe, although he returned to Thailand last month with his fourth wife, his son and a noble consort, an official title given to his mistress.
After inheriting the crown, King Maha Vajiralongkorn tightened his authority over influential military units. He also took direct control over the crown’s assets.
Even before Section 112 was invoked late Tuesday, other laws had been used against the student-led protesters, who began with a campaign against conservative school rules and later widened their movement to include calls for an overhaul of Thailand’s leadership structure.
Parit and others have been charged with various crimes like sedition, which carries a punishment of up to seven years’ imprisonment.
Last month, several protesters were charged with the arcane crime, punishable by possible life imprisonment, of committing “an act of violence against the queen’s liberty,” after they raised their hands in defiance and shouted slogans at a passing limousine containing the queen and the heir apparent.
Lawyers in Thailand said that this section of the criminal code was so obscure that it did not appear in a database of cases that had appeared before the Supreme Court.
On Nov. 17, dozens of people were injured when police directed water cannons and tear gas at protesters. A handful of people also suffered gunshot wounds, although police said they had not used any bullets.
A day later, protesters converged at the national police headquarters in Bangkok, spray-painting sexual insults of the king on the walls and on the pavement. Prayuth soon warned that authorities would be “enforcing all the pertaining laws against protesters who violate the law.”
Benjamaporn Nivas, a 16-year-old student leader, said that the specter of lèse-majesté might make her more careful in publicly criticizing the monarchy, but not because her feelings about its need to reform had shifted.
“I want to fight until the day when no one can fight anymore, then I will join the others in prison,” she said.
In June, Prayuth noted that lèse-majesté prosecutions had stopped in late 2017.
“You know why?” he said. “It was because the king was kind enough to instruct that it should not be used.”
Opposition politicians called for the lèse-majesté law to be abolished. It is not clear why it is now being used again.
“A number of questions arise,” Streckfuss said. “What authority does the king have to say that lèse-majesté shouldn’t be used? And is he now telling the government to use it? In either case, it puts the whole question of 112 in even stronger relief as a problematic law, and it won’t stop the protesters.”
“If anything,” he added, “it will egg them on.”

TAIPEI, Taiwan — President Donald Trump has made cultivating closer ties with Taiwan a critical part of his efforts to counter China’s rising influence. He has significantly increased weapons sales to Taiwan’s military, vowed to step up economic cooperation, and generally bolstered relations with the self-ruled democratic island — even in his waning days.
His successor, President-elect Joe Biden, will most likely continue on a similar path, albeit without Trump’s characteristic pugnacity.
As concerns grow about China’s increasingly aggressive behavior on the global stage, Biden will face pressure from Democrats and Republicans to strengthen ties with Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.
While Biden said little about Taiwan on the campaign trail, he has said the United States should get “tough with China” and described its top leader, Xi Jinping, as a “thug.” His transition team has already reached out to Taiwanese officials.
“If China continues to put military and economic pressure on Taiwan, Biden will have to demonstrate he will not sit by while China bullies Taiwan,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
His approach, though, is expected to be less confrontational than his predecessor’s. “I don’t think Biden is looking to use Taiwan to poke Xi Jinping in the eye and make him look weak,” Glaser added. “There won’t be a deliberate effort to make Taiwan a point of friction.”
With less than two months left in his term, Trump is working to leave a legacy of severed ties between the United States and China, including a series of last-minute actions focused on Taiwan.
The U.S. government last week held economic talks in Washington with officials from Taiwan, drawing a rebuke from Beijing. Trump has dispatched several high-profile officials to visit Taiwan recently, rankling the Chinese government. The leader of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, was scheduled to hold meetings in Taipei next month, but his trip has been canceled, officials said on Tuesday. The visit came under scrutiny amid questions about the cost to taxpayers.
Trump has attracted a loyal following in Taiwan because of his administration’s criticism of the Chinese Communist Party on issues such as trade, the coronavirus and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong. He has garnered praise in Taiwan for moving swiftly to approve weapons sales, including more than $4 billion worth last month. He is also widely lauded for his decision, as president-elect in 2016, to take a telephone call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, breaking with decades of diplomatic practice.
“Trump’s actions have been very solid,” said Tsai Yi-yu, a lawmaker from southern Taiwan. Tsai has fervently supported Trump, going so far as to wear a “Keep America Great” face mask to meetings with Taiwan’s leaders.
“Maintaining Trump’s Taiwan policies will be best for Taiwan,” he said, citing Trump’s support for weapons sales.
In Taiwan, Biden’s ascent has been greeted with some anxiety, especially in the ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which is critical of China.
Many politicians and activists in Taiwan have grown increasingly concerned in recent years by Xi’s creeping authoritarianism. They have called on world leaders to more forcefully push back against efforts by Beijing to bring the island under its control, and to treat Taiwan as an equal.
Biden is seen in Taiwan as more risk averse. He is best known for his time as vice president under President Barack Obama, who has been criticized in Taiwan for not doing enough to stand up to Xi. As a senator, Biden helped bring China into international groups like the World Trade Organization, which gave the country an edge as it sought to expand its economy and exert influence in the global system.
Biden has resisted the idea that he would give in to pressure from Beijing. As evidence of Biden’s commitment to Taiwan, his advisers have cited his support as a senator for the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which obligates Washington to provide weapons to Taiwan. More recently, he has signaled his support for Taiwan in other ways, having his choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for example, speak this month with Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States.
“He will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan,” an official with Biden’s transition team said in a statement. “He has long said that American support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled and bipartisan.”
Some politicians in Taiwan, including members of the opposition party, the Kuomintang, believe Biden’s more restrained approach could help ease tensions and prevent a military conflict between the United States and China.
“He is neither a reckless politician nor a person who wants to achieve something remarkable in a short period of time,” said Cheng Li-wun, a Kuomintang lawmaker.
Despite Biden’s calls for greater cooperation, China’s leaders are wary about his leadership. They worry that he will try to unite U.S. allies in Europe and Asia to thwart Beijing’s global agenda, according to analysts in the mainland, and that he will continue to seek closer ties with Taiwan.
“The basic Taiwan policies, even during Biden’s term, won’t see any upending changes,” said Xin Qiang, a scholar who studies U.S.-China relations and Taiwan at Fudan University in Shanghai. “With regard to both strategy and tactics, the mainland has concerns about both Biden and Trump.”
Chinese officials often accuse the United States of encouraging Taiwan to seek full independence, a move that Xi has repeatedly warned could be met by armed force. A rising sense of nationalism in China has fueled concerns that the mainland could react harshly if tensions escalated.
“I fear that one day the mainland will be forced to take actions because of the Taiwan issue that would cause a crisis or even a military conflict between China and the United States,” Xin said.
During his final weeks in office, Trump and his advisers appear to be intent on testing China’s limits on Taiwan.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has escalated his taunting of Beijing, saying during a recent interview that Taiwan was not a part of China. His remarks drew a furious response from Chinese officials, who said Taiwan was an inalienable part of China, denounced Pompeo and vowed to retaliate.
Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, is currently leading a visit to the region as part of an effort to reassure U.S. allies, after Beijing this month signed a trade agreement with 14 countries in the region, a move seen as a check to American power in the region. O’Brien said in Manila on Monday that the United States would continue to support Taiwan and would not cede its status as a Pacific power to China.
“We’re going to fight for a free and open Indo-Pacific region with all of our partners,” O’Brien said in a conference call with reporters.
When he takes office in January, Biden will face growing frictions and also tough policy choices, including questions about arms sales and economic investment. Taiwan has long pressed U.S. officials to sign a bilateral trade treaty, an idea that Beijing opposes. Tsai Ing-wen lifted a long-standing ban on U.S. pork and beef imports in August, a decision seen as an attempt to open the door to formal trade talks.
As the pandemic rages, Taiwan is also seeking to take part in international groups like the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, despite objections from China.
Many Taiwan residents say the island can maintain its legitimacy on the global stage and deter an invasion by the mainland only with strong support from Biden.
“Taiwan can’t face the might of China alone,” said You Ying-long, a former politician for the governing Democratic Progressive Party. “We can’t fight China on our own.”

Texto completo: The thing is, I've been holding out for so long.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, my corner of the internet has tried to fill the hole where intimacy and comradery used to be with pustules of sourdough starter. Recipes. Feeding routines. Yeast colony reviews. At a time when the world has been too much, the "sauercrowd" has managed to be more.
And hand to God, I held off.
There was the Iowa Caucus that lasted a month. The pandemic that never ended. Those weeks of protest coverage. And of course the November election — which may be done for some, but if you are in Iowa's 2nd District, the 50 vote margin has begun appearing as a lead character in your dreams. But I never broke.
I wasn't driven to sourdough. Sourdough came for me.
Your First Sourdough Loaf
You'll need:
A bowl
Two loaf pans
A bench scraper
An oven
A sharp knife
Ingredients:
The starter
1 cup of room temperature water
9 cups of flour
1 tablespoon of salt
Time: 1 week
Directions:
Step I – One morning, you rummage through the refrigerator for cold pizza or orange juice, but cannot find either. Placing the contents back in the cold, you see you've accidentally smeared one of the words scrawled on a plasticware box in Sharpie: "Suzanne & Zach's matrimonial sourdough: 'Belle.' "
You got married. Three years of cohabitation with your partner-turned-spouse had resulted in your first piece of jewelry: a golden ring that you know will disappear the second it is not top of mind. And friends and family being generous means you aren't short new books, a wool blanket, and as is their way, a jar of sour-smelling, primordial soup propagated from your crunchy friend's refrigerator with words above adorning the lid.
Belle is maybe a cup all said and done. The completion of pancake batter or maybe the whites of eyes. Belle's consistency is not unlike the contents of an egg.
"It's a living thing," you were told. "It breathes."
Looking into the depths, you decide to go deeper.
Step II – You are suspicious of recipes that measure ingredients in grams. But you didn't come here to make excuses. You have two beautiful loaves to deliver.
After a little grams-to-cups conversion, add half a cup of flour to the starter and another half cup of water. Mix until smooth. And leave it. The process is going to teach how to leave things. How to forget things. For starters, there's the flour which you are always one cup short when you begin to bake. You will need to go to the store. There's the new ring. (Which — yes. Still there.) And the calls to the family you keep telling yourself you'll make on mornings like this.
When you remember to check it again, it may have been one hour or ten, you see it's doubled in volume. A sourdough baking internet forum says that's a good sign. That means the yeast colony has supped on the flour. That it has grown strong on the starch. You see it bubble underneath the surface, still rising imperceptibly along the edges of the metallic mixing bowl.
Repeat the process, adding equal parts flour and water, mixing until smooth. Then leave it alone, growing underneath a towel in your home.
Step III – Awaking from uneasy dreams, you are hungry. You walk into the kitchen and find the starter has foamed. Overnight, it reached a high point along the rim of the bowl only to settle back. It looks hungry too.
On day two, add the remaining eight cups of flour to another bowl and with your left hand work the flour into the water until it is homogenous. Leave it.
At this point, your starter should spark with bubbles from the depths. Somewhere on the microscopic plane, you imagine Belle is feeding on the flour from the day before and burping carbon dioxide. It's working.
The New York Times recipe tells you to use like a thimble-full of the starter and dump the rest of Belle into the trash. So you do what you've practiced so many times with the New York Times: you find someone local writing about it instead.
Blogspot tells you Teresa is an "Iowa girl who loves small towns, good Midwestern food and the simple life." She does a sourdough starter. You thank Teresa in a voice only your starter can hear and mix all of Belle in with the flour mixture.
Step IV – You think Belle has never been this large before. But before Louis Pasteur and Fleishmann after him developed the modern baggies of shelf-safe granular yeast we use today, yeasts like Belle, maybe Belle herself, leavened loaves outside bake-houses in Egypt over 5,000 years ago.
Without a microscope or any taxonomical training, you are unable to figure out which of the 1,500 species of yeast Belle might be. The internet tells you Belle is most likely S. cerevisiae, but it's important for there to be some mystery in the world.
You settle in with the idea that Belle has not only been this large before, but you are only glimpsing one part of Belle. There is the "Belle" that you received, but you remember it was "Vesta" who begot Belle. Belle came to you as Vesta came to your crunchy friend. You imagine a sprawling lineage stretching across kitchens or carried as natural yeast in the air across the country or maybe over the ocean, footloose and growing and growing and growing.
When you awake, Belle has outgrown the bowl and spilled onto the counter. Taking a bench scraper, you gather the dough careful not to disturb the ring which had almost been consumed by the wet blob. You'd put it in a plastic ramekin on the counter so as not to muck it up while hydrating the dough. It crosses your mind that Belle's growth path did not spill off the counter's edge which was much closer. Instead, it grew in such a way, stretching unnaturally towards the little ring.
Add the salt.
Step V – You get busy. You go for walks. You help a friend move out of their house. You're clocking some hours on a PC port of Eternal Darkness (2002). During cutscenes, you've taken to spinning the ring on your finger, rotating along the knuckle bone that barely holds it in place.
The game is as scary as you remember. Then as now, you are feel the drive to move deeper. but it's a drive deferred. Belle needs feeding. You're not sure how many times Belle has risen. Driven by the promise of airy light slices of warm bread, you keep going. If four rises is good, how good might 14 be?
Step VI – Some unknown time later, you don't so much get up as Belle gets you up. You try to exit the bedroom, but the door won't move. Your wife deep in sleep doesn't wake when you tackle the door, eeking out just enough space to slide out.
A shifting mass has laid low over your kitchen and filled your living room. From the depths of the bowl, Belle now stretches tall and stretches deep into your home, reaching past the picture of your mother and around the corner to your bedroom door.
Knead, and as you knead, you will want to add more flour, but you must resist. Sourdough starters also feed on fear. Knead until the calls from beyond dissipate; until Belle's tendrils have returned to the bowls: about 15 minutes.
Divide Belle from Belle into two sections. Shape Belle into loaves. Place each in a parchment paper-lined loaf pan. Let the Belle rise for an hour, maybe two, but do not let Belle out of your sight. This is key for the iconic tangy flavor.
Step VII – Preheat the oven at 450 degrees. Using a sharp knife, score Belle's surface. A line will do but consider your astrological sign. For safety.
Bake Belle covered in tin foil for 20 minutes, then peel off the foil and cook for an additional 30 minutes.
Epilogue – Looking through the window of the oven, you smell fresh bread. You exhale. It's over. It's finally over.
Laying your face in your hands, the tears gather in your palms.
And you gasp. The ring. Where is the ring?
Deep in the oven's heat, you hear something unsettling. Looking through the window, Belle crackles knowingly.

The Pandemic's Effect On Shopping in America

Texto completo: This year might have forever changed shopping for American consumers, store workers and retailers.
This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.
America's upended shopping habits are a glimpse at how we've been altered by this pandemic-scarred year.
More of us are getting goods delivered, and we're buying more cars, exercise equipment and ham and spending less on plane tickets and restaurant meals.
For the week that traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, I spoke with Sapna Maheshwari, who writes about retail for The New York Times, about how the pandemic might alter Black Friday and permanently change shopping in America.
Shira: What was the biggest surprise in our shopping habits from the pandemic?
Sapna: The drastic increase in online shopping was perhaps a predictable shift, but there are surprises when you dig into the details.
There is a whole population -- older people especially, including my parents -- who tried and liked things like ordering online for in-store pick up from places like Target or Panera. There are plenty of people who will go back to shopping in person, but some of those habits will stick. Where curbside grocery pickup is available, why wouldn't you take back the hour you used to shop for groceries and instead have a store employee put together your order and put the items in your car trunk for no extra cost?
What have those shopping changes meant for retail store workers?
I started the year writing about employees of the collapsed department store Barneys New York, and they told me about the lists they kept of clients, the types of merchandise they sold and their commissions. It was a career with a high level of customer interaction.
Compare that with store workers this year assembling orders placed online. That might reduce the virus risk now, but it's more solitary and transactional, like a warehouse job. Store workers are interacting less with customers, and some people miss that. The work may also be more physically demanding, and some employees fear they'll be measured by how fast they can grab items off store shelves.
Do you expect delays and chaos for holiday packages ?
Retailers tried to start Black Friday deals in October to help limit store crowds and spread out online holiday orders to make them manageable, but I think many people waited. It's hard to break consumers out of something they've done their whole lives.
It's hard to get retailers to talk about it, but they're constantly negotiating with FedEx and UPS about the shippers' holiday delivery capacity and costs. For smaller businesses, it's going to be expensive to fulfill the shipping demands of holiday shoppers. Any problems will benefit stores that can offer online ordering for in-store pickup right up to Christmas.
Confess your pandemic purchasing habits. And what will stick?
I've bought almost no new apparel this year, and I've been wearing a small portion of items in my closet. In the future I can see myself buying fewer but nicer items of clothing and paying for tailoring because I've become more conscious of each garment I'm wearing.
People want to feel cozy, and slippers and candles have been big sellers this year. I have bought so many candles. For some reason my anxiety-related purchases have included paper planners, journals and a to-do checklist notebook. I've also bought more alcohol because I'm not going to bars. That won't last. I'm looking forward to when it's safe to be in a crowded bar and waiting impatiently for a stupidly expensive cocktail.
Our shopping is not monolithic
One lesson to me from the shake up in pandemic shopping is that there's more than one way to successfully sell stuff to Americans.
Not every retailer, in short, has to be Amazon and be gigantic, sell every product imaginable and deliver orders fast to people's homes.
Sapna and I talked about retailers whose sales have climbed during the pandemic, and it's not always the names you might have predicted. Amazon, Walmart and Costco have done well, yes. But so have store chains like Home Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods and Williams-Sonoma that sell stuff to make home life more pleasant and also figured out curbside pickup of online orders or ways to make in-store shopping feel safer in a pandemic.
Sapna has also written about the resilience of local stores like a running gear store in Connecticut that quickly revamped its business, including delivering purchases to people's homes. (This is also a spot for me to remind readers that even during the pandemic, only about 15 percent of Americans' retail spending is online.)
And we should never underestimate the allure of shopping as a treasure hunt. Compared with other stores that mostly sell clothing, the T.J. Maxx chain has held up well this year, even though it doesn't put a lot of attention on online shopping.
Like T.J. Maxx, the e-commerce site Wish capitalizes on our love for bargains and shopping as a game. It lets people dig through an online grab bag of mostly unnecessary and often weird products that are typically delivered slowly. The company disclosed finances on Friday that showed its sales have climbed this year.
For stores that cater to our needs, the keys to surviving this year have been both luck and finding ways to adapt to meet what we want to buy and how.
Before we go ...
Chinese state surveillance, with help from American technology: Paul Mozur and Don Clark write for The New York Times about the Chinese government analyzing data from its extensive digital monitoring of the Muslim minority in Xinjiang with one of the world's fastest supercomputers. It was built with American microchips. Paul's Twitter thread also has more details about his reporting.
These people aren't real: My colleagues Kashmir Hill and Jeremy White have this great demonstration of technology that generates eerily realistic images of nonexistent people. Kash writes that the artificial intelligence software behind computer-generated people, virtual voice assistants and facial recognition technology is both amazingly powerful and reflects human flaws because "we are behind all of it."
He made mixing paint exciting. Then he got fired: BuzzFeed News has the tale of a college student who worked part time at Sherwin-Williams and made popular TikTok videos about blending paint colors. (One of the videos involved mixing blueberries into a paint can.) The company said he violated its rules and fired him, BuzzFeed reported.

Texto completo: Corrections & clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect the sources of funding to universities involved in developing the COVID-19 vaccine with Moderna. The rating has been updated, as a result, and it is now rated as "missing context."
The claim: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine was paid in full by taxpayers
Social Security Works, a nonprofit organization committed to defending the Social Security program, posted a graphic on Facebook on Nov. 17, claiming, "taxpayers paid for 100% of the Moderna vaccine development," which the post says totaled $2.5 billion.
The post was shared more than 550 times and received nearly 300 comments. Some commenters credited Dolly Parton with donating $1 million that helped the vaccine development, a story that trended on social media in late November after the country music icon's COVID-19 research fund was included on a list of supporters for the vaccine in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Social Security Works spokesperson Linda Benesch wrote in an email that the primary source for the claim was a tweet by Public Citizen, a nonprofit progressive think tank. Benesch also credited a story by Axios in which the pharmaceutical company was quoted saying federal money makes up "100% funding of the program."
More: Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?
How much did the government give?
Several government entities contributed to the development of the Moderna Therapeutics vaccine, according to the New England Journal of Medicine report.
The report acknowledged the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, two of the centers that make up the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Fact check: Vaccine recommendations don't link government aid to immunization
The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services, also invested heavily in the vaccine’s development, a report from the staff of Harvard's Petrie-Flom Center found.
All in all, U.S. agencies committed about $2.5 billion to help develop Moderna’s vaccine and buy doses, according to the New York Times.
Moderna and NIAID had already been working on mRNA vaccines, with an agreement in place, when the coronavirus came along.
"The agreement consisted of some level of funding from Moderna to the NIH, along with a roadmap for NIAID and Moderna investigators to collaborate on basic research into mRNA vaccines and eventually development of such a vaccine," the Harvard article states. "Such agreements are not unusual for government agencies in general or the NIH in particular."
In a Moderna news release from July 26, the company said it received approximately $955 million from BARDA, and Phase 3 of the vaccine study would be conducted in collaboration with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The Department of Health and Human Services and Moderna both told Axios the two parties agree to what is in news releases when it comes to federal government funding and other support provided to advance the vaccine.
Fact check: Dolly Parton helped fund Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine research
What about other contributors?
The New England Journal of Medicine recognized support from Emory University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the Dolly Parton COVID-19 Research Fund and other organizations in the development of the Moderna vaccine, which trials show is 94.5% effective.
The article notes that the funding to Emory and Vanderbilt, as well as Emmes and Kaiser Washington, came through NIH, meaning it was funded by taxpayers.
Parton mentioned her million-dollar donation and involvement in creating a COVID-19 vaccine in tweets on Aug. 1 and Nov. 17.
Vanderbilt researchers were "giddy" about the Moderna news after participating in the vaccine research, Director of Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program Dr. Buddy Creech told television station WTVF.
Parton made the donation — which amounts to less than 1% of the total amount of development funding — because of her friendship with Dr. Naji Abumrad, who treated her after a 2014 car crash and informed the country star that Vanderbilt University Medical Center was making "exciting advancements" toward a cure for the coronavirus.
"Her work made it possible to expedite the science behind the testing,” Abumrad told the Washington Post. “Without a doubt in my mind, her funding made the research toward the vaccine go 10 times faster than it would be without it.”
Our rating: Missing context
The U.S. government has given Moderna Therapeutics about $2.5 billion, including federal grants for university research, for the development of the company's vaccine and to purchase doses once approved. To say that the vaccine is fully funded by the federal government discounts a small but very real private donation to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Based on our research, we rate the claim MISSING CONTEXT.

Texto completo: Doug Heye was in a good mood as he made dinner Saturday night.
The Republican strategist had just received a quarantine-specific distinction: A 9 out of 10 rating from the Room Rater Twitter account.
"Love the port wine posters. Sunflowers. Depth. Add pillow to left. 9/10," it read, referencing the background of his recent TV appearance.
"I had gotten a 5 earlier. I had really bad lighting, and I deserved it. So to get a 9, I was just like, 'This is great,' " Heye said. "It's admittedly silly, and yet so many people care about it."
The account, which is run by Claude Taylor and his fiance, Jessie Bahrey, became an early pandemic diversion, like sourdough bread, Netflix watch parties and newly adopted puppies. Pundits were suddenly appearing on the cable news channels not from remote studios but on Zoom or Skype from bedrooms, living rooms and makeshift offices. Taylor and Bahrey rate their home setups, docking points for things like visible cords or a poorly angled screen and awarded them for well-organized bookcases or stylish art.
Taylor said the account, which has more than 350,000 followers, is meant to be "tongue in cheek."
"It's all meant to be lighthearted fare for the covid pandemic and lockdown," he said. "None of it is meant to be taken that seriously. And 98 percent of the time, people react with the humor in which it's intended."
But a backlash against the account has been bubbling under the surface - and finally overflowed on social media the night of Heye's rating, when former Republican Florida governor Jeb Bush retweeted it with some added commentary.
"Mr. Room Rater, is it possible now that the election is over to rate rooms on a non partisan basis? Are you a room rater or a hyper partisan person that is the problem? We need less hyper partisanship on backgrounds at this time for our country," Bush tweeted, adding, "Room man, do a review of your ratings based on ideology and publish it. The backgrounds are varied but your bias is constant. Be honest. Try to make a difference. If not, you are part of the problem."
Bush is referencing the account's occasional openly biased ratings, which should come as no surprise given that Taylor runs a liberal PAC. Case in point: In the past week, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and Emily Murphy - President Trump's embattled head of the General Services Administration - all got flat 0s, and insulting captions, to boot.
The Clintons, meanwhile, got a 10/10 with the caption, "Jeb be damned," despite an arguably unremarkable backdrop. (Which is even less surprising, considering Taylor worked in the Clinton White House.)
Still, many were baffled that Bush used Heye's rating as an example, given the high score. Bush declined The Washington Post's request for comment via email, saying, "I don't think it is a very big deal."
"We were honestly confused," said Taylor. "We didn't know if he was mad because the score was too high or too low. It just didn't really make sense."
Many also responded by pointing out that not all liberals are free from the account's criticism.
"Dude, I got a 3 and a . . . 'In character but nevertheless worrying,' " tweeted Esquire's liberal political writer Charles P. Pierce. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman tweeted, "My dude, I'm a progressive democrat and @ratemyskyperoom gave me a 1/10 + claimed it looked like i was in a 'hostage situation.' "
In fact, Bush's tweets opened the floodgates of denunciations that had nothing to do with party politics, from critics who say the account is invasive, cruel and potentially classist.
New York Times technology columnist Charlie Warzel tweeted, "i dunno who needs to hear it but i will die on this hill . . . room rater sucks so hard."
"Look guys, room rater is toxic and I think it's all time to go ahead and say that out loud," tweeted ProPublica journalist Jessica Huseman. "It's followed by thousands of people and the homes they rank poorly are often owned by journalists making far less than a living wage who have a few hundred followers and I see no world in which that's not punching down."
In an interview, Huseman readily admitted that she enjoyed the account at first. "The first couple TV hits I got, it was exciting to see my mentions on Room Rater," she said. "But now, the more I read their ratings, I think a lot of the people who end up getting not very good scores because they live in average apartments are journalists who might make $35,000 a year and are just trying their best during a pandemic. The more I thought about it, the grosser it felt."
One of those local journalists is Georgia Public Radio political reporter and "Battleground: Ballot Box" podcast host Stephen Fowler, who was chagrined to find himself on the account - and suddenly facing a wave of insulting messages in his inbox.
"Anyone with negative comments about the 27-year-old public radio reporter's WFH setup when he's had *maybe* five total days off (including weekends) from working since the pandemic started is legally obligated to send me $, subscribe to my podcast+support a local news outlet," Fowler tweeted. "Sorry I don't live in NY/DC, am not in my 40s, don't make a six-figure salary with a cable news contract, had to pay my way through school and drive a '98 Buick, mean people of the internet already sending me emails and DMs!"
Fowler was excited to appear on CBSN and have his work appreciated, "and then this snarky, anonymous-ish Room Rater account comes in and invites all of these random people into my home to critique my setup," he said in an interview. He's quick to point out that he's not upset about his score, which was a respectable 7 out of 10. Rather, the whole thing felt emblematic of the divide between national and local outlets.
"I think the account does a disservice by highlighting the elitism in journalism and media," Fowler said. "Because I don't have the money that a New York Times or Washington Post reporter makes living in New York or D.C. I don't have the fancy elitist decor behind me. Instead I have a $125 print of a Disney World Magic Kingdom matchbook and some photos of me and my wife."
Taylor said the account tries finding people from all walks of life.
"We do not want the account to be lifestyles of the rich and famous," he said. "We have top 10s and strong 9s from people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. We look for interesting rooms. We look for rooms with character, with personality. We look for rooms where the person has made just a little bit of effort. We don't need to see the Hollywood elite, and we don't want to hold anyone to that standards."
Heye, meanwhile, couldn't explain Bush's tweet but has only positive feelings toward the former governor.
"I am and remain a Jeb Bush fan," Heye said. "I didn't know there was this whole debate about partisanship and all that [on Room Rater], and I'm not interested in any debate on it. I'm not sure why politics needs to invade every fiber of our being all the time."
Heye's biggest disappointment with the rating is the suggestion that he add a pillow to the couch - since he had just moved one off the couch for the appearance. He'd also like to note that the "port wine poster," as Room Rater put it, is actually from Willi's Wine Bar in Paris. He actually became friends with the owner, who saw the poster in a previous CNN International appearance.
After the controversy, Heye added, "I sent him this stuff, and said, 'Look, your poster's getting more prominence.' "

New York Times still pushing Chinese propaganda, staffers still don’t care

Texto completo: Staffers at the New York Times are apparently still too exhausted from being angry about Sen. Tom Cotton to have any thoughts on their employer's continued promotion of pro-communist agitprop.

On Tuesday, as President-elect Joe Biden continues his transition into the White House, the paper of record published an opinion article authored by a high-ranking Chinese government official titled, “Cooperative Competition Is Possible Between China and the U.S.”

The story’s subhead reads, “A former vice foreign minister of China proposes a way forward for the world’s two leading powers.”

As of this writing, there has been no general outcry from New York Times employees over the paper’s decision to run an op-ed promoting a genocidal dictatorship. Imagine that.

Here is just a small sampling of the bad-faith, pro-China, anti-United States language included in what amounts to a full-page advertisement for a genocidal communist regime:
- "China sees the United States as trying to block China’s way forward and as hindering its people’s pursuit of a better life." - "Washington started bullying Chinese high-tech companies and making things difficult for Chinese students." - "Washington … should ensure a level playing field for Chinese enterprises to operate in the United States. America’s fear of Huawei’s cutting-edge advantages should not be expressed through government bullying: This not only hurts the company; it also limits many people’s access to technological progress." - "It is high time that the United States drop its habit of interfering in other countries’ internal affairs. One hopes that Washington will learn from its unsuccessful interventions the world over, for example in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. America’s concerns that foreign forces might interfere with its presidential elections should serve as a good reminder of why other countries are so sensitive about U.S. intervention in their own domestic affairs." - "China finds it offensive when the United States points a finger at the Chinese system or takes action against Beijing for its policies on domestic matters."
There is no mention, by the way, of China’s imprisonment of its Uighur population.
The United States’ insensitivity toward China’s concerns over Taiwan and territorial disputes in the South China Sea can only make Beijing suspect Washington’s motivations: Does America want to help Taiwan go independent? Is it siding with the other claimants in the region in order to humiliate China as the imperialists did in the past?
Perhaps anticipating a negative response to the overt advertisement for a murderous police state, which is engaged in the wide-scale genocide of Uighur Muslims and the brutal suppression of dissent in Hong Kong, the New York Times preemptively affixed to the op-ed a link to an editor’s note explaining its decision to run the communist agitprop.

“As the 20th century closed, I sat as a teenager in a lecture hall and listened to Henry Kissinger declare that China would soon be the next global superpower — and all young Americans needed to know more about it,” writes New York Times acting editorial page editor Kathleen Kingsbury.

She adds, “For reasons I still can’t fully explain, the message resonated.”

Taking cues from Kissinger was her first mistake.

Interestingly, Kingsbury then concedes that China is essentially one giant human rights violation:
As both The Times’s news and opinion pages have extensively documented, as its economy and industrial policies drove generational change, China has corralled as many as a million ethnic Uighurs and other religious minorities into internment camps. It has denied basic human rights to its citizens. It has smothered any hint of political opposition. And it has made menacing moves, through militarization and land grabs, toward the United States and its regional rivals.
“This Op-Ed is the only official statement,” she continues, “beyond the usual platitudes, that has come from the government about the election of Joe Biden to the presidency, and for that reason we thought it was worth publishing. There’s no denying that U.S.-China relations have been damaged over the past four years. [It] is setting out the terms under which her government plans to work with a new Biden administration.”

The New York Times editor adds, “Those terms, which include both veiled threats and olive branches, could have significant consequences for American foreign policy for the rest of our lifetimes.”

Kingsbury, by the way, was promoted to her current position after the paper’s employees staged a revolt and forced James Bennet, the then-editorial page editor, to resign. He was chucked from the newsroom following the publication of a June 3 opinion article by Cotton, originally titled “Send in the troops,” which recommended the deployment of National Guard to police districts overwhelmed by anti-police demonstrators.

Not long after that episode, the New York Times published an op-ed taking China’s side against pro-freedom Hong Kong demonstrators. The paper’s staffers had nothing to say about it. Some employees even explained later that they did not feel a similar need to lash out and demand an editor’s head for the anti-Hong Kong op-ed because they were just simply too “exhausted” from screaming about the Republican senator’s article.

On Tuesday, as New York Times staffers have yet to say boo about the paper's latest pro-China op-ed, it seems clear they are still tuckered out from that time they got angry about Cotton’s op-ed.

One wonders whether they will ever recover.

Facebook reveals algorithm changes that prioritize 'authoritative' news outlets such as CNN and New York Times

Texto completo: Facebook made changes to its algorithm after the election to prioritize certain news outlets the company deems more authoritative.
According to a New York Times report, Facebook made the changes in an effort to combat President Trump’s and right-wing media outlets' claims about election fraud, which the company has labeled “false or misleading.”
The company will now emphasize the importance of what Facebook calls its “news ecosystem quality” score, or “N.E.Q.” N.E.Q. is an internal tool the company uses to assign a ranking to news publishers based on Facebook’s definition of quality journalism.
N.E.Q. typically only plays a minor role in what users see in their Facebook feeds, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg agreed to increase the weight of the metric in the days after the election to prioritize “authoritative news” and “mainstream publishers like CNN, The New York Times, and NPR” over other sources, such as “Breitbart and Occupy Democrats,” employees told the New York Times.
Some of the company’s employees have expressed hope Facebook would make the algorithm changes permanent, even if that might cause people to spend less time on the platform.
“There has never been a plan to make these permanent,” said Guy Rosen, a Facebook executive who is in charge of the company’s “integrity division.”
“There are tensions in virtually every product decision we make and we’ve developed a companywide framework called ‘Better Decisions’ to ensure we make our decisions accurately, and that our goals are directly connected to delivering the best possible experiences for people,” Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne told the New York Times.
Facebook has been under increasing pressure to crack down on misinformation during the 2020 election cycle, causing an internal battle in the company over whether changes result in people using the platform less. Sometimes, Facebook’s crackdowns on misinformation have been bad for business.
“No News Feed product change is ever solely made because of its impact on time spent,” Osborne said.
The company’s decision to censor some information and sources effectively has also led to accusations of political bias at the company. Those accusations led to Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey being called to testify at a Senate hearing on social media censorship.
During the hearing, Sen. Mike Lee accused social media platforms of “taking a very distinctively partisan approach, and not a neutral one, to election-related content moderation.”
Lee said he rejected the notion that social media censorship of stories favoring conservatives were “mistakes.”
“When Facebook employees give 92.8% of their political $ to Dems, & Twitter employees give 99.%, it’s hard to believe that all their ‘mistakes’ silencing conservatives are on accident,” Lee tweeted after the hearing.
Other Republicans joined Lee in criticizing social media companies, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.
Both Facebook and Twitter have denied prioritizing one viewpoint over another.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a Washington Examiner request for comment.

Texto completo: Most people have changed their travel plans for Thanksgiving amid surging cases and warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Sixty-one percent of respondents for the latest installment of the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index said they are changing their Thanksgiving plans in some way, with 29% saying they will only be seeing people in their immediate household. Another survey from the firm Dynata, commissioned by the New York Times, found that only around 27% plan to be with people outside of their household, which is consistent with the results from smaller surveys.
Views on whether to change plans to reduce the risk of getting sick fall along party lines. Axios found that roughly three-quarters of Democratic respondents said they have changed their plans, compared to about half of Republicans. Meanwhile, Dynata found that roughly two-thirds of Republicans have decided to avoid a large gathering.
Additionally, 12% of respondents in the Axios survey said they'll no longer be traveling, in accordance with the CDC’s recommendation against traveling during the holiday week.
The CDC’s latest guidance for a safe Thanksgiving stresses that “postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, has also implored people to keep gatherings small with people living in the same household only.
"As we get into the colder weather, we should really think twice about these kind of dinner parties where you're not sure of whether the people that are in your bubble [are safe]," Fauci said last week. "Then, you're going to start seeing these unanticipated infections related to innocent home gatherings, particularly as we head into the holiday season."
To date, over 12.5 million infections and more than 259,000 deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will not rely on the vaccine developed by Russian scientists, who insist that their shots are 95% effective, because they have yet to be certified safe and effective.
That caution belies Putin’s jubilance in August, when he declared that Russian researchers had developed a vaccine — adding that his own daughter was participating in the clinical trials. The Russian leader has boasted of his willingness to “personally take the Russian vaccine” before traveling abroad, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tapped the brakes on that idea.
"The president cannot use an uncertified vaccine," Peskov noted, according to TASS, a state-run media outlet. “All the procedures are about to conclude, and then, if he finds it necessary, he will inform you.”
School systems have reported soaring rates of failing grades compared to last year, a signal that online-only learning doesn’t cut it. In Fairfax County, Virginia, a new report from the Office of Research and Strategic Improvement found that the percentage of failing grades so far was up more than 80% compared to last year's rates — jumping 6% to 11%. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of all middle school students in the Austin Independent School District were failing at least one class, a 70% increase compared to last year.
The detriments of virtual learning were felt harder in underserved communities and lower-income households. In January 2019, a full year before most of the world knew what the coronavirus was, a report from George Mason University found that "fully online coursework has contributed to increasing gaps in educational success across socioeconomic groups while failing to improve affordability."
The CEO of Qantas Airlines, Alan Joyce, said passengers on its international flights will likely be required to vaccinate against the coronavirus in the future. Qantas is Australia’s largest airline. Joyce added that the company is looking at different options on how to confirm people have been vaccinated.
“We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travelers that we will ask people to have the vaccination before they get on the aircraft,” Joyce said, according to the Associated Press.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan scolded residents of his state who choose not to wear a face mask, telling them there is “no constitutional right to walk around without a mask.”
“It’s sort of like saying, ‘I have a constitutional right to drive drunk. I have a constitutional right to not wear a seat belt or to yell fire in a crowded movie theater or to not follow the speed limit,'" Hogan said during a press conference Monday.
The S&P 500 Index closed at an all-time high Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 30,000 for the first time, reflecting investor optimism about the coronavirus vaccine. The market also benefited from the formal start of President-elect Joe Biden’s transition, which has given investors a sense of what policies the new administration’s Treasury Department will prefer.
Germany and Britain will loosen coronavirus restrictions around Christmastime to allow families to celebrate together. People will be permitted to travel anywhere in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland between Dec. 23 and Dec. 27. People in the United Kingdom from up to three different households will be allowed to gather in private residences and outdoor spaces, the New York Times reported. Meanwhile, Germany’s 16 federal states plan to allow gatherings of up to 10 people over Christmas and New Year's in a new draft proposal that will go to Chancellor Angela Merkel for approval, Reuters reported.
French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron announced a three-part loosening of the nationwide lockdown, saying in a televised address that France has “slowed the spread of the virus … but it is still very much present.” Starting Dec. 15, provided daily new cases stay below 5,000 and hospitalizations do not exceed 3,000, most restrictions on movement will be lifted and replaced with curfews. The curfew will be relaxed on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and people will be able to travel between regions without a permit, France24 reported.

TAIPEI, Taiwan — President Donald Trump has made cultivating closer ties with Taiwan a critical part of his efforts to counter China’s rising influence. He has significantly increased weapons sales to Taiwan’s military, vowed to step up economic cooperation, and generally bolstered relations with the self-ruled democratic island — even in his waning days.
His successor, President-elect Joe Biden, will most likely continue on a similar path, albeit without Trump’s characteristic pugnacity.
As concerns grow about China’s increasingly aggressive behavior on the global stage, Biden will face pressure from Democrats and Republicans to strengthen ties with Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.
While Biden said little about Taiwan on the campaign trail, he has said the United States should get “tough with China” and described its top leader, Xi Jinping, as a “thug.” His transition team has already reached out to Taiwanese officials.
“If China continues to put military and economic pressure on Taiwan, Biden will have to demonstrate he will not sit by while China bullies Taiwan,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
His approach, though, is expected to be less confrontational than his predecessor’s. “I don’t think Biden is looking to use Taiwan to poke Xi Jinping in the eye and make him look weak,” Glaser added. “There won’t be a deliberate effort to make Taiwan a point of friction.”
With less than two months left in his term, Trump is working to leave a legacy of severed ties between the United States and China, including a series of last-minute actions focused on Taiwan.
The U.S. government last week held economic talks in Washington with officials from Taiwan, drawing a rebuke from Beijing. Next month, the White House is planning to send the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency to Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, the latest in a series of high-profile visits by U.S. officials that have rankled the Chinese government.
Trump has attracted a loyal following in Taiwan because of his administration’s criticism of the Chinese Communist Party on issues such as trade, the coronavirus and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong. He has garnered praise in Taiwan for moving swiftly to approve weapons sales, including more than $4 billion worth last month. He is also widely lauded for his decision, as president-elect in 2016, to take a telephone call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, breaking with decades of diplomatic practice.
“Trump’s actions have been very solid,” said Tsai Yi-yu, a lawmaker from southern Taiwan. Tsai has fervently supported Trump, going so far as to wear a “Keep America Great” face mask to meetings with Taiwan’s leaders.
“Maintaining Trump’s Taiwan policies will be best for Taiwan,” he said, citing Trump’s support for weapons sales.
In Taiwan, Biden’s ascent has been greeted with some anxiety, especially in the ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party, which is critical of China.
Many politicians and activists in Taiwan have grown increasingly concerned in recent years by Xi’s creeping authoritarianism. They have called on world leaders to more forcefully push back against efforts by Beijing to bring the island under its control, and to treat Taiwan as an equal.
Biden is seen in Taiwan as more risk averse. He is best known for his time as vice president under President Barack Obama, who has been criticized in Taiwan for not doing enough to stand up to Xi. As a senator, Biden helped bring China into international groups like the World Trade Organization, which gave the country an edge as it sought to expand its economy and exert influence in the global system.
Biden has resisted the idea that he would give in to pressure from Beijing. As evidence of Biden’s commitment to Taiwan, his advisers have cited his support as a senator for the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which obligates Washington to provide weapons to Taiwan. More recently, he has signaled his support for Taiwan in other ways, having his choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for example, speak this month with Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States.
“He will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan,” an official with Biden’s transition team said in a statement. “He has long said that American support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled and bipartisan.”
Some politicians in Taiwan, including members of the opposition party, the Kuomintang, believe Biden’s more restrained approach could help ease tensions and prevent a military conflict between the United States and China.
“He is neither a reckless politician nor a person who wants to achieve something remarkable in a short period of time,” said Cheng Li-wun, a Kuomintang lawmaker.
Despite Biden’s calls for greater cooperation, China’s leaders are wary about his leadership. They worry that he will try to unite U.S. allies in Europe and Asia to thwart Beijing’s global agenda, according to analysts in the mainland, and that he will continue to seek closer ties with Taiwan.
“The basic Taiwan policies, even during Biden’s term, won’t see any upending changes,” said Xin Qiang, a scholar who studies U.S.-China relations and Taiwan at Fudan University in Shanghai. “With regard to both strategy and tactics, the mainland has concerns about both Biden and Trump.”
Chinese officials often accuse the United States of encouraging Taiwan to seek full independence, a move that Xi has repeatedly warned could be met by armed force. A rising sense of nationalism in China has fueled concerns that the mainland could react harshly if tensions escalated.
“I fear that one day the mainland will be forced to take actions because of the Taiwan issue that would cause a crisis or even a military conflict between China and the United States,” Xin said.
During his final weeks in office, Trump and his advisers appear to be intent on testing China’s limits on Taiwan.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has escalated his taunting of Beijing, saying during a recent interview that Taiwan was not a part of China. His remarks drew a furious response from Chinese officials, who said Taiwan was an inalienable part of China, denounced Pompeo and vowed to retaliate.
Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, is leading a visit to the region as part of an effort to reassure U.S. allies, after Beijing this month signed a trade agreement with 14 countries in the region, a move seen as a check to American power in the region. O’Brien said in Manila on Monday that the United States would continue to support Taiwan and would not cede its status as a Pacific power to China.
“We’re going to fight for a free and open Indo-Pacific region with all of our partners,” O’Brien said in a conference call with reporters.
When he takes office in January, Biden will face growing frictions and also tough policy choices, including questions about arms sales and economic investment. Taiwan has long pressed U.S. officials to sign a bilateral trade treaty, an idea that Beijing opposes. Tsai Ing-wen lifted a long-standing ban on U.S. pork and beef imports in August, a decision seen as an attempt to open the door to formal trade talks.
As the pandemic rages, Taiwan is also seeking to take part in international groups like the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, despite objections from China.
Many Taiwan residents say the island can maintain its legitimacy on the global stage and deter an invasion by the mainland only with strong support from Biden.
“Taiwan can’t face the might of China alone,” said You Ying-long, a former politician for the governing Democratic Progressive Party. “We can’t fight China on our own.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — David N. Dinkins, who died on Monday night at 93, was once the mayor of New York. But he was also the unofficial mayor of the tennis world.
Dinkins was an avid, even obsessive player, a friend of tennis stars — in 1990, Jennifer Capriati said, “The mayor is one cool dude” — a U.S. Tennis Association board member, and an advocate for African Americans and youth in the sport.
Among the signature achievements of his tenure was the deal announced in 1991 for a new stadium that helped keep the U.S. Open in Queens. The plan had its detractors, including Dinkins’ successor, Rudy Giuliani, who declined to attend the U.S. Open while in office. But another mayor, Michael Bloomberg, later said it was “the only good athletic sports stadium deal, not just in New York, but in the country.”
A love of tennis — and a resolve to diversify it — quickly became a key part of Dinkins’ public persona as he moved from assemblyman to borough president to mayor.
As he geared up to run for mayor in 1990, he was playing every Saturday and Sunday at the New York Tennis Club in the Bronx. “In terms of things I like to do, I am perfectly happy on a vacation if there is sun and sand and water, and a tennis court,” he said. Asked about his interests beyond tennis and politics, he answered, “What else is there?”
Early in his single term as mayor, a surprising issue soon began to hit the headlines: the incessant noise of jet planes taking off from La Guardia Airport and intruding on the tranquility of the U.S. Open. Dinkins soon persuaded the Federal Aviation Administration to use special takeoff procedures during the 14-day tournament, keeping the planes farther away.
But a larger issue with what is now known as the Billie Jean King Tennis Center was still to come. Organizers were eager for bigger, better facilities, and hints were made about finding a new home for the event, perhaps outside New York City. Dinkins brokered a deal for a $150 million expansion, crucially to be paid for by the USTA, not the city.
But the plan still had its critics. Outdoors lovers and civic groups bemoaned the loss of parkland that would be required. Eventually the plan was scaled back, to develop fewer acres and build only one new arena — which would become Arthur Ashe Stadium — instead of three.
Giuliani, who defeated Dinkins in the 1993 election but could not reverse the deal, faulted a provision that would penalize the city up to $325,000 if there were too many jet flyovers, and also knocked Dinkins’ love of tennis in general. (Giuliani is a baseball fan.)
Like golf-playing by presidents past and present, Dinkins’ tennis play was used by some as a weapon to criticize him. An article in The Daily News in 1991 claimed that Dinkins spent just three hours a day on city business and accused him of neglecting his duties to play tennis.
Dinkins rebuffed those accusations, and added that the article would not lead him to cut back his time on the court. “If anything, it’ll make me play more,” he said.
After losing to Giuliani in his reelection bid, Dinkins could play without complication. Checking in on Dinkins in 1995, The New York Times reported that he enjoyed “discussions of politics and government, family, social gatherings and tennis — though not necessarily in that order.” He began playing as much as five times a week.
In contrast, Giuliani continued to have little good to say about the sport or the U.S. Open, dismissing it as elitist. He said he would not attend the Open, because of his unhappiness with the contract to rebuild. He also declined to speak at the opening of the new stadium in 1997 and never attended the event as mayor. But with little public notice he did agree to approve the tennis center’s expansion after a review concluded that he had no basis for a challenge.
Dinkins continued to be a ubiquitous presence at the Open. He would stay at the grounds until midnight and then wake up at 5:30 a.m. to play in Central Park. “I’ve been on the court with Chris Evert, Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe, Arthur Ashe, Billie Jean King, Virginia Wade,” he said. “And let me tell you, tennis players are the nicest people.”
Dinkins also became involved with organizations that aimed to expand tennis’s reach beyond its stereotypical country-club image, notably the National Junior Tennis League, founded by Ashe, which introduces tennis to children and teens from low-income families.
“These programs teach our young people more than just tennis,” Dinkins wrote in The Times in 1990. “They reinforce values such as discipline, courteousness, good sportsmanship, team spirit and responsibility. And they provide our young people with an alternative to the streets and allow them to release creative energy in a positive way.”
He also made an impact when he served on the board of the USTA. “He was a loud voice in the room when it came to diversity and inclusion,” said Katrina Adams, a former Tour player and USTA president. “He helped us to understand that we represented everybody.”
“My greatest interest and concern was that people playing tennis look like this country,” Dinkins told Tennis.com. “It has been my experience that having a seat at the table alters things.”
The tennis world honored Dinkins by naming an entrance to the tennis center after him, and he is also the namesake of some Harlem tennis courts.
But for tennis nuts, what ultimately matters is your game. So what was Dinkins like on the court?
Doug Henderson, a lawyer from the Inwood section of Manhattan and a longtime friend of Dinkins, who played with him in the ’70s and ’80s said: “He had a good game; he had strong legs. Today, the players use more of the upper body; he used his legs. He was ultracompetitive. He played until he just couldn’t play anymore.
“He was immaculate in his suits and ties, and also in his tennis outfits and his manners.”
As he aged, Dinkins continued to seek challenging opposition. “He enjoyed playing with good players his age and much younger,” said Peter Knobler, who helped write the mayor’s autobiography, “A Mayor’s Life: Governing New York’s Gorgeous Mosaic.” “He played with Monica Seles and other pros. When players met him and found he had the same passion as they did, they responded.”
Dinkins continued to play doubles until he was 88. Adams, who played with him in those years on Roosevelt Island, said: “He would always have a diverse group with him: men women, Black, white, Asian, Hispanic. He always loved bringing people together. He was strategic on the court, but also professionally.”
“When you reach your 80s, doubles is better for you. He wasn’t very powerful and not very quick then. The passion and the intensity was there, but the changeovers got longer and longer. But he loved his forehand, especially passing down the line. I remember, because I got passed quite a few times.”

President Donald Trump has told aides that he plans to issue a pardon to his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
The person said that while nothing is final until Trump does it, he has made it clear that it is one of a string of pardons he plans to issue before leaving office.
Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with a Russian diplomat during the presidential transition in late 2016. The move was reported earlier by Axios.

As an activity in the COVID-19 era, skiing has a lot going for it — it’s outdoors, people naturally distance by spreading out all over a mountain, and they’re used to covering their faces. What’s tricky is everything around skiing: renting gear, waiting in lift lines, sharing gondolas and chairs, crowding at mid-mountain restaurants, socializing at après spots.
And so mountain resorts across North America are adjusting their operations to the new reality, from restricting the daily number of skiers and riders to modifying schedules. Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for example, will load some lower-mountain lifts earlier so guests can spread out faster.
Naturally, skiers and riders are perplexed: What will the experience be like? If you decide to go for snow, here are a few tips to help you make the most of this unusual season.
1. Think ahead.
This winter, forget about impulse decisions to waltz in for a few runs: Many resorts won’t have walk-up ticket sales, and reservations will be key for almost everything from lifts to rental to lunch.
In Utah, the road to Alta and Snowbird will be closed to uphill traffic once the parking lots are full. Snowbird has online reservations for parking, and many January and February weekends are already full.
Among the big multimountain pass groups, Epic, which is run by Vail Resorts, is instituting a system that prioritizes its passholders.
“We’re confident that for the majority of days we’ll be able to accommodate everybody who wants to visit,” Johnna Muscente, the company’s director of communications, said in a telephone interview. “But we need to plan for every day: the busy holiday weekend, the powder day.”
The Epic portal acts as a clearinghouse to book days, though you should also check each resort’s website or app for targeted directives.
Ikon holders must also make advance reservations via the Ikon website. Some popular ski areas on that pass, such as Copper Mountain, in Colorado, and Killington, in Vermont, are also implementing advance parking reservations along with controlled day lift sales, so make sure to get your ducks in a row before showing up at the mountain.
As for the Mountain Collective, it is instructing its pass holders to check with the resorts they are planning to visit. As the Ski Vermont trade group put it: “Know before you go.”
Similarly, check what your planned area’s policies are on distancing in lift lines and whether they will be loading the lifts in a way that lets skiers from different groups remain separate.
2. Make the most of newly flexible policies.
With several major airlines getting rid of change fees, many skiers are securing cheap flights, just in case. Similarly, you can book many accommodations with no-penalty cancellations that allow for last-minute pivots — a chain hotel might be more flexible than an Airbnb, but it might also feature more common areas where social distancing is harder.
It could also be a good time to join a ski club to alleviate planning headaches.
“We spent the spring negotiating with tour operators for never-before terms and conditions,” Joe Gilbert, co-chair of the Ski Club of Washington, D.C.’s Western/international committee, said over Zoom. “If there are any coronavirus-related issues, we have force-majeure clauses, so our members are protected.”
Another advantage of ski clubs is that they often have already pocketed rooms at resort lodgings — remember, capacity will be limited in many places and there could be a pinch on certain weekends.
3. Check the state restrictions.
This won’t be the year to fly to Europe’s megaresorts or Japanese powder fields, but British Columbia or Quebec are likely to be off-limits, too, as the border between the United States and Canada remains closed for now. Domestic quarantine restrictions will make interstate travel tricky as well. Right now, for example, New Mexico requires a two-week quarantine for visitors from high-risk states (and that means only Hawaii residents can skip it). Vermont has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the country, with either a 14-day quarantine or a shorter quarantine with a negative test. Check each state’s official website before even thinking of heading out.
4. Think small.
Popular resorts like Park City, in Utah, Vail, in Colorado, or Mammoth, in California, can draw big crowds on weekends and holidays. Since they will operate at partial capacity, you may not be able to go on your preferred dates. (Some mountains are guaranteeing tickets to people who stay in resort-owned lodging, while others are not. Again, make sure to check.)
Why not venture elsewhere? Brad Wilson, general manager of Idaho’s Bogus Basin, pointed out on the phone that “nationally, there is a sense that small resorts will get a bump in business this year. It’s the soul of skiing,” he added. Maybe this is the time to finally try fiercely independent Wolf Creek, which boasts the most snow in Colorado and is implementing a gradual opening starting with just lifts and bathrooms — soul of skiing indeed.
5. Bring your own.
If you have your own gear, bring it, because rentals are going to be a bit of a hassle. Likewise, be ready to boot up in your car since locker rooms are likely to be either closed or restricted. In fact, think of your car as a home base and stock it with items that used to be easy to get on the slopes: water, snacks, tissues, sunscreen, lunch.
6. Plan for lunch al fresco.
“Be ready to be outside all day, and that includes eating,” Tim LeRoy, a spokesman for California’s Big Bear and Mammoth resorts, said over Zoom.
Colorado’s Monarch Mountain and Arapahoe Basin are among the several areas preparing to set up food trucks in parking lots.
Others will set up roaming food stations on the slopes. In addition to its Taco Beast snowcat, Steamboat, in Colorado, will welcome the new Pizza Ranger, where people can either preorder full pies or buy slices. In Utah, Powder Mountain is planning to move some food stations around its ski area to engage guests in fun scavenger hunts.
7. Book a lesson.
Lessons are never a bad idea, no matter how advanced you are, but this season they may also have practical repercussions: Enrolling in ski school may be a way to secure access to a resort during busy periods. Note that some signature instruction programs may be suspended — Taos Ski Valley, for example, is not offering its famous Ski Week but only private instruction — and that class sizes might be smaller.
8. If all else fails …
Book an entire resort. Utah’s Eagle Point is usually open from Friday through Sunday or Monday, but this year you can rent the whole place the rest of the week. A cool $10,000 a day gets you lift tickets, rentals and staffers for up to 200 people.

Blow: Vandalizing our democracy

Texto completo: On Bill Clinton’s Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1993, he found on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway desk in the Oval Office a gracious, handwritten letter left for him by the Republican president whom he had defeated.
In it, the departing president reminded the arriving one:
“You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country’s success. I am rooting hard for you. Good Luck — George.”
In reflecting on how meaningful that letter had been to him, Clinton wrote of George H.W. Bush that “though he could be tough in a political fight, he was in it for the right reasons: People always came before politics, patriotism before partisanship.”
That is why it was somewhat embarrassing that some members of the Clinton administration committed silly, immature acts of vandalism when handing the reins of power over to Bush’s son, George W. Bush, in 2001.
The Government Accountability Office investigated the vandalism for a year and concluded that “damage, theft, vandalism and pranks did occur in the White House complex” during the transition, and as the New York Times reported: “The agency put the cost at $13,000 to $14,000, including $4,850 to replace computer keyboards, many with damaged or missing W keys.”
It was embarrassing, but not truly disruptive to the transfer of power. Still, Republicans pointed to it as an extreme breach of protocol. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, who had asked the GAO to look into the allegations of vandalism, said of the findings: “The Clinton administration treated the White House worse than college freshmen checking out of their dorm rooms.”
He continued, “They disgraced not just themselves but the institution and the office of the presidency as well.”
I have thought about the grace of the elder Bush’s transition letter and the smallness of the Clinton White House’s shenanigans often in recent weeks as we have watched Donald Trump stubbornly refuse to concede, brazenly try to disenfranchise millions of voters and recklessly sow distrust in our electoral system and by extension our democracy. Everything that happened before has been rendered quaint.
The way Trump has absolutely trashed our democratic norms has made a mockery of things that used to raise our, or at least Republicans’, hackles about decorum and propriety — like Barack Obama not wearing a flag pin, putting his feet on a desk or wearing a tan suit. Republicans have either cheered or shrunk in silence as Trump has set his blazes and fanned the flames.
The damage Trump is now doing trying to claw back an election that he has lost is almost incalculable in its scope and yet-to-unfold possibilities. There is no guarantee that Trump will ever concede, and there is every suggestion that he won’t. There is no way to know what a Biden Inauguration Day would look like. Would Trump attend? Would he gracefully exit the White House premises?
Furthermore, the damage Trump has attempted to do to faith in the American election system has been wildly, depressingly, successful. A Politico/Morning Consult poll earlier this month found that “70% of Republicans now say they don’t believe the 2020 election was free and fair, a stark rise from the 35% of GOP voters who held similar beliefs before the election.”
That would represent tens of millions of Americans who, largely because of Trump and the far-right press that abets him, will see a duly elected Joe Biden presidency as illegitimate, and the election system as flawed.
Furthermore, we have a president who appears to care about nothing else but turning his loss into a win, and, if he fails, handicapping the Biden administration.
He has essentially given up fighting the COVID crisis — other than touting vaccines — even though the virus is raging in this country and around the world. On Saturday, Trump skipped the “Pandemic Preparedness” meeting of G-20 leaders to play golf. As the New York Times reported, “at least 1,428 new coronavirus deaths and 171,980 new cases were reported in the United States” on Saturday.
Not only that, but as food insecurity triples for families with children during the COVID-19 pandemic, food bank lines stretch ahead of the holiday, and with 12 million Americans scheduled to lose unemployment benefits the day after Christmas, Trump is not pressuring congressional leaders to pass another aid package.
Remember that it was Trump who used a tweet to halt stimulus talks in early October, writing: “I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.”
He didn’t win, and now he could care less. There is golf to be played. Trump is hurt but not humble. He is angry and lashing out.

Honestie Hodges, who was handcuffed by the police outside her home in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when she was 11, a frightening incident that drew outrage and national headlines in 2017, died Sunday. She was 14.
Her death, at the Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids, was caused by COVID-19, her grandmother Alisa Niemeyer wrote in a post on the website GoFundMe.
The incident occurred Dec. 6, 2017. Honestie had stepped out the back door of her home with her mother and another family member to go to the store when they were confronted by police officers with their guns drawn.
“Put your hands on top of your—,” an officer ordered them before he was interrupted by Honestie’s mother screaming, “She is 11 years old, sir!”
“Stop yelling!,” the officer responded, as recorded by an officer’s body camera. He ordered Honestie to walk backward toward him with her hands up.
A second officer grabbed her arms, pulled them behind her back and handcuffed her. Honestie shouted, “No, No, No!,” pleading with the officers not to place the cuffs on her. The police, who said they had been searching for a 40-year-old woman in connection with a stabbing, removed the handcuffs after several minutes.
The incident caused a widespread uproar that led to a soul-searching within the Grand Rapids Police Department. In a news conference, the police chief at the time, David Rahinsky, said that “listening to the 11-year-old’s response makes my stomach turn; it makes me physically nauseous.” He retired in 2019.
None of the officers were disciplined because they had not violated any departmental policies, Rahinsky wrote in a statement at the time. Nonetheless, the department acknowledged that the officers had made a mistake in how they handled the child.
By then the police force was already facing criticism for a similar encounter that March in which five innocent teenagers were held at gunpoint.
At the time, Honestie, who was Black, spoke out. “I have a question for the Grand Rapids police: If this happened to a white child, if her mother was screaming, ‘She’s 11,’ would you have handcuffed her and put her in the back of a police car?” she was quoted as saying on MLive.com, a Michigan news site.
In March 2018, the Police Department adopted the “Honestie Policy,” which called for using the least restrictive options when dealing with youths. Even so, several more incidents involving the police pointing weapons at children have heightened tensions in Grand Rapids. A local television station, WOOD-TV, reported this summer that Honestie and her family were negotiating with the city to settle a claim filed over the handcuffing episode.
Honestie developed severe stomach pains on Nov. 9, her 14th birthday. Taken to the hospital, she tested positive for the new coronavirus and was sent home. But her condition worsened that evening, an ambulance was called, and she was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit. Over the next few days she received iron and blood transfusions as complications arose. She was placed on a ventilator on Nov. 14. But her condition never improved. Niemeyer updated the GoFundMe page asking for prayers.
Then, on Sunday, Niemeyer wrote: “It is with an extremely heavy heart that I have to tell you that my beautiful, sassy, smart, loving granddaughter has gone home to be with Jesus.”
Niemeyer had created the GoFundMe page to collect donations for her daughter, Whitney Hodges, who had to stop working to care for Honestie and her four other children.
Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said Honestie was not the youngest person to die of COVID-19 in Michigan.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that COVID-19 deaths among children were rare overall, but that Hispanic and Black children were more likely than their white peers to be hospitalized or admitted to an ICU.
Niemeyer told WOOD-TV, a local television station, that Honestie had been “healthy and happy” with no underlying health issues.
“She could have been the vice president one day, or maybe the president,” Niemeyer said. “The world was open to her.”

Latinos, Long Dismissed in Hollywood, Push to Make Voices Heard

Tanya Saracho landed her first television writing job on the Lifetime soap “Devious Maids” in 2012. She was a diversity hire.
It’s an official term for a practice meant to encourage inclusion. In an effort to make writers’ rooms — long the bastion of white males — more diverse, studios pay the salary of a minority writer so the show doesn’t have to. Saracho finds the idea noble but also inescapably problematic.
“You get otherized and marginalized and then you are expected to be the culture negotiator and ambassador and defender of every culture, not just yours,” Saracho, 44, said in a recent video interview. “It’s a big burden. I almost quit every day.”
Instead, Saracho persevered and achieved success in an industry that hasn’t always been welcoming to her: a queer writer interested in exploring her Mexican American heritage on television. She wrote for HBO’s “Looking” and “Girls” and spent time on Shonda Rhimes’ “How to Get Away With Murder.” Her big break came when Marta Fernandez, then the senior vice president of original programming at Starz, invited her to create a show, “Vida,” about two estranged sisters returning to their East Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights to bury their mother. The show, which made its debut in 2018, tackled issues of gentrification and assimilation through the prism of family. It was well-reviewed and for three seasons served as an example of what’s possible when underrepresented voices are given a chance to succeed.
But “Vida” was canceled in March. That was followed by ABC ending the sole network TV show with a primarily Latino cast, “The Baker and the Beauty,” in June. And though CBS reran the truncated fourth season of the Latino-centric reboot of “One Day at a Time” in October, the fate of that show remains unclear. (Netflix first canceled it in 2019.)
To many Latinos working in Hollywood, it seems that every gain is soon followed by a loss, a continuous ebb and flow that never feels rectified.
“It’s great ‘Vida’ existed, but ‘Vida’ is now gone,” said Saracho, who began her career as a playwright in Chicago, where she co-founded a theater company and an alliance for Latino playwrights. “‘One Day at a Time’ is gone now, too. We haven’t arrived.”
According to a Writers Guild of America West study issued in June, while Hispanic Latinos account for 18.3% of the population, they represent only 4.7% of feature film writers and 8.7% of television writers. In a 2019 study, the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative called Hollywood’s treatment of Latinos both behind and in front of the camera “an erasure.”
The grim stats, coupled with personal experiences, prompted Saracho, Gloria Calderón Kellett (“One Day at a Time”) and the 16 other Latina showrunners who make up the Untitled Latinx Project group to start promoting their own cause.
In the middle of October, on the final day of National Hispanic Heritage Month, the group delivered an open letter to Hollywood demanding change in an industry that has long overlooked them. It bore the names of 276 Latino creative people, including film screenwriters and well-known names like Lin Manuel-Miranda, John Leguizamo, Eva Longoria and writer and producer Phil Lord (“Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse”). And it made specific demands: Stop telling our stories without us, start greenlighting more of our projects, reflect the diversity of our population and hire us for projects that aren’t about the Latino community.
The letter arrived in Hollywood’s inboxes shortly before the 2020 election, which shined a spotlight on the diversity of Latinos in the United States. Latinos make up the second-largest voting group in the country, but they defy blanket classification. For example, Latinos in Florida and Texas, including many of Cuban and Venezuelan descent, leaned toward President Donald Trump, while young progressive Latinos in Arizona, including a number of Mexican descent, favored Joe Biden.
It was a stark reminder that grouping Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexican Americans and others into one monolithic racial group, as Hollywood has done for decades, diminishes their disparate experiences and concerns. Stacy L. Smith, the founder of USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in an interview that Latino characters in Hollywood movies are most often depicted as “criminals, as low income, as immigrants, as isolated, as hungry.”
Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who leads the Congressional Hispanic Congress, went further, arguing that these depictions have real-world consequences. In a recent column in the Hollywood trade publication Variety, he wrote, “You can draw a clear line from the pervasive lack of positive Latino representation on-screen to the rise in hate crimes against our communities.”
The Untitled Latinx Project is one of the groups trying to change that. Last year, the women partnered with Franklin Leonard and his company, The Black List, which aims to promote the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood, to create the inaugural Latinx TV List. It showcases one-hour and half-hour original pilots written by at least one Latino writer and featuring a Latino or Latin American character in a prominent role. The top three finishers landed deals with the streaming service Hulu. Many secured agency representation.
“We found 10 great writers who just happen to be Latinx who are just as good as anybody else that is already as a professional working writer,” Leonard said.
Advocates say that findings like that demonstrate how Hollywood’s issue is not a lack of creative voices to choose from but a lack of executives willing to take a chance and nurture new talent.
“If people are as committed to diversity and inclusion as they say they are, then they would make different choices,” Calderón Kellett said. “That’s why Tanya and I are pretty loud about talking about the inequality that we see consistently and trying to call for some real change.”
Saracho, for one, recognizes that without Fernandez at Starz, “Vida” never would have happened. “Who knows how she championed me and what battles she had to fight that I never saw,” said Saracho, adding that Fernandez also encouraged her to direct. “That’s what happens when you have one of you in the castle.”
But Fernandez left Starz last year for a job running the television department at Macro, a production and finance company intended to bolster voices of color. In addition to developing new shows with writers of color, she is also grooming executives of color whom she hopes will one day land decision-making spots at the studios.
Saracho and Calderón Kellett will continue following their own paths. Calderón Kellett signed an overall deal with Amazon Studios last year. Saracho signed one this August with NBCUniversal’s television studio, Universal Content Productions, which, in addition to making new shows, will create a talent incubator for Latino creators.
Saracho is now in London, collaborating with indie musician Johnny Flynn on a new pilot for UCP called “Love Story” that centers on one heart-wrenching love story a season. The debut will focus on two Mexican American childhood friends living in London who fall in love with the same singer-songwriter. (Flynn is writing the music and helping Saracho navigate the world of the anti-folk British indie music scene.)
Saracho is energized by the project and encouraged by the response her group’s letter has received. But she knows there is a long way to go.
“I don’t understand why they don’t take a chance on us but they will take a chance on the most tepid refried-bean cop show,” she said. “I think it’s a side effect of how we are viewed in this country, in a stereotyped way, a limited way. Those winds waft to Hollywood and it sort of seeps in everywhere. It hurts.”

At many colleges and universities, from underfunded institutions to top-tier private colleges, many students have found themselves unable to meet basic needs during the coronavirus pandemic. Financial insecurity, previously accelerated by rising tuition costs and living expenses, has become even more acute because of the closure of campuses, loss of jobs and slashing of budgets.
In response, across the country, students have created mutual aid networks: raising and redistributing tens of thousands of dollars to help their peers cover housing, medical costs, food and other essentials. Generally, students send in requests for small amounts of money, and network organizers send them the funds using payment apps like Venmo.
“The pandemic has obviously exacerbated a lot of the inequalities that exist on college campuses,” said Neha Tallapragada, 19, a sophomore who helped start an aid network at Rice University. “That’s really been a painful experience for a lot of students. Students have been laid off from their jobs, or they’ve had to take on new responsibilities because of losses in family income, perhaps due to COVID-related layoffs.” At some schools, students who depend on dorms for housing have struggled after their campuses closed.
“We’re trying to fulfill a lot of the needs that have been exacerbated or are there in a greater degree due to the pandemic,” Tallapragada said.
At its core, mutual aid is a form of charity in which neighbors or peers work together to help each other out on a case-by-case basis. (The term is often attributed to “Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution,” a 1902 essay collection by Peter Kropotkin, a Russian social theorist who argued that voluntary cooperation has been key to the flourishing of human civilization.)
Not all the aid networks operate in the same way.
At Rice, aid recipients must provide a school ID number, while at Vanderbilt University, students and alumni have created a network for sharing temporary housing in addition to their cash distribution efforts. At Northeastern University, organizers aren’t distributing money at all; instead, they use donations to stock a free food pantry and distribute personal protective equipment on campus.
Giving out money is “not something that we’re opposed to, but it isn’t something that we’ve been asked for by students,” said Madeleine Allocco, 21, a junior at Northeastern who has helped with the organizing.
The aid networks are entirely student-run, operating outside any official college administration oversight.
At Georgetown University, students donate cash to a central Venmo account, according to one of the founders, Megan Huynh, 20. “Then we have a funding request form for students in need — both undergrads and graduate students — to request basically like a micro-grant of $50 to $100,” she said. “And we just send them the money, no questions asked.”
To date, the Georgetown mutual aid network has raised $25,000 from current students and some alumni, and has distributed $20,000. The money, which is meant to be used for “textbooks or weekly groceries, medication, things like that,” has been raised from more than 900 donors, Huynh said, “so it’s really shown the power of small grassroots movements.”
Sara Goldrick-Rab, a sociology professor at Temple University who studies college affordability, said: “These mutual aid networks are springing up because the new economics of college, which is what I tend to call it, puts students at a significant economic disadvantage.”
She cited exorbitant tuition costs and ever-rising living expenses to argue that college students, in general, are often misrepresented as more privileged than they are — and that was before the pandemic.
“We did a survey of 38,000 students around the country, and nearly 3 in 5 students were dealing with either homelessness, housing insecurity or food insecurity,” she said, referring to a June study of the pandemic’s devastating effect on student finances.
“Students continue to lead the fight to address their basic needs,” she said.
Campus mutual aid networks mirror similar efforts that have sprung up in communities nationwide this year. But several college organizers defined their efforts as distinctly left-wing and political.
“It’s a form of community care that is in response to the failures of capitalist structures,” said Hadeel Hamoud, 20, a junior and one of the founders of Duke Mutual Aid, who cited the Black Panthers’ aid program as an inspiration.
Tallapragada at Rice was one of several students who said they started their networks based on the advice of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who wrote a 12-page mutual aid manual with activist Mariame Kaba and tweeted about it in March. “Myself and a lot of other college students at different colleges have been referencing that toolkit,” Tallapragada said.
A mutual aid network at Duke University was started in mid-March, after the college sent students home because of the pandemic for the first time. Lily Levin, 19, said she and her fellow organizers at Duke initially ran their network as “a kind of reciprocal exchange,” a forum where students could offer housing or other material goods to those in need.
“But as time passed, like, even after the first week, it became really clear that most people did need financial aid much more than they needed kind of those material goods,” she said.
The network began soliciting donations in increments of $100, distributing $20,000 from March to May. Then organizers hit a snag: Venmo began declining transactions because of how much money they were sending and receiving. The group paused its efforts and consulted with a tax lawyer at Duke, who suggested that the group team up with a local nonprofit called Durham Congregations in Action. Now, it’s easier to handle funding, Levin said, because “we are attached to a nonprofit, but we aren’t one ourselves.”
The project restarted in late July; the students have since raised and distributed another $17,000. The focus of the project has “transitioned,” Levin said. Now that some Duke students are back on campus, the network has begun donating most of what it raises to low-income or homeless people in the city of Durham, rather than to students on campus.
Georgetown’s mutual aid network was established in July, said Binqi Chen, 20, after she and other students from low-income backgrounds saw the disparities of pandemic-driven inequality play out on social media.
“Seeing our parents struggle throughout this time, and then going on social media and seeing, like, my friends or acquaintances having the time of their lives even amidst this pandemic was something that was really, really just — I wouldn’t even say shock,” she said. “I think I kind of expected that, but it’s nonetheless still very disappointing.”
“We go to school with, you know, like, TikTok influencers and students who come from royal families, or ambassador students who can afford to donate a lot more into mutual aid,” Chen said. The average donation is $20, she said, which reveals “who’s contributing to this and who our message is reaching.”
“Primarily that’s the people that are using mutual aid for themselves but can give back to it whenever they can, to support students that they know are also going through difficult times,” she said.

WASHINGTON — This might have been the most anticipated White House turkey-pardoning ceremony ever.
For starters, President Donald Trump has been scarcely seen without golf clubs since Election Day. So, the annual ritual of sparing two turkeys offered a rare chance to glimpse the lame-duck leader in public.
“Thanksgiving is a very special day for turkeys,” Trump said in the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon. “Not a very good one, if you think about it.” Except for two fortunate feathered recipients of the president’s largesse.
It felt almost normal, refreshingly pro forma. With a zest for showmanship, Trump had always seemed in his element on these cornball occasions, no matter what other turmoil happened to be upending his presidency at the moment.
But Trump’s recent reclusiveness had also given the festivities a measure of Groundhog Day drama: Would the Punxsutawney president strike a light and conciliatory tone, signaling a mild period of transition into the Biden administration? Or would he continue with the defiant and rancorous posture he has exhibited in the more than 550 tweets he has unleashed since Nov. 3, ensuring several more disruptive weeks of a presidency in dark winter?
The cliffhanger infused the hokey White House tradition with genuine theatrics — just as the master of ceremonies relishes. Speculation had swirled in recent days that the president might make incendiary news by pardoning humans like Paul Manafort (his former campaign chairman, convicted of tax and bank fraud) along with his innocent feathered friends Corn and Cob (imported from Iowa, 42 and 41 pounds, with 35- and 34-inch wingspans).
If nothing else, the spectacle offered a respite from the daily onslaught of Trump’s legal challenges, as well as the carefully produced announcements of President-elect Joe Biden’s new cabinet officials — several of whom were being introduced in Wilmington, Delaware, as the president and first lady, Melania Trump, were making their way out to the Rose Garden at about 2:30 p.m.
The president began by announcing again that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had broken 30,000 for the first time. (He had first announced it an hour and a half earlier in an appearance in the White House briefing room that lasted barely a minute.) Although the market appeared to be reacting to the General Services Administration’s decision Monday night that the transition to the Biden administration could formally begin, Trump wrapped himself in the news.
“I just want to congratulate everybody,” Trump said, a throwback to preelection days, when he would boast constantly about the performance of the stock market, as if it offered some running testimonial to his performance in office.
Voters have since rendered a harsher verdict. Recent weeks have, by all accounts, been difficult for a president whose self-definition as a “winner” has been dented by a battering of courtroom defeats, rising vote deficits and scattered abandonment by former Republican allies.
At the very least, the White House turkey tradition offered the comfort of ritual. It was started by President Harry S. Truman in 1947, though President John F. Kennedy was the first to spare the honored bird. President George H.W. Bush was the first to officially use the word “pardon” in 1989.
Trump wore a navy blue overcoat and bright red tie in the chill of the late November afternoon. He made no mention of the election or the president-elect. He seemed slightly subdued but for the most part in decent spirits.
He described this as “a time that is very unusual,” which seemed apt enough.
“We’re here to continue a beloved annual tradition,” the president said, ushering in the featured, feathered portion of the ceremony.
He mentioned that Corn and Cob had been selected from a presidential flock that included some “real beauties” and noted that they came from Iowa.
“I love the state of Iowa,” Trump said, by way of buttering up the home of the butterballs. (He is said to be considering a comeback campaign in 2024.)
“We love our farmers,” he added, for good measure.
After a few minutes, the president and first lady stepped out from behind the Rose Garden podium and approached the guest of honor.
“Look at that beautiful, beautiful bird,” Trump marveled as he gestured toward Corn, who was perched a few feet away. (Cob was not immediately visible to onlookers.)
“Oh, that is a lucky bird,” he continued. “Wow.”
“Thank you, Corn,” Trump said as he briefly laid his forgiving hand upon the rich white plume of his beneficiary.
The president and first lady waved to the friendly crowd as they took leave of Corn, who at that moment did manage a brief serenade of gobbles.
Trump flashed a thumbs-up for the cameras and did not respond to two shouted questions from reporters: one about whether he might invite Biden for a White House visit and the other about whether he might soon be pardoning himself.
At this same event last year, the president had said that “I expect this pardon will be a very popular one with the media. After all, turkeys are closely related to vultures.”
In other words, Trump had likened reporters to vultures.

It's Time to Stop Nap-Shaming

Like many Americans, chef Nicole Pederson enjoys stretching out on the couch after the turkey and stuffing have been cleared, closing her eyes and losing consciousness for a short time. But 2012 was when she proved she was no ordinary Thanksgiving napper.
She had opened a new restaurant that fall in Evanston, Illinois. By Thanksgiving Day, when she showed up at the house of a friend who was going to cook an elaborate, multicourse Caribbean-inspired menu, the long hours had caught up with her.
She took her first nap of the day before noon, shortly after downing a glass of Champagne. She returned to the couch after the appetizer, a squash-and-cheese empanada, and was awakened in time to eat the hearts-of-palm salad. From that point on, she said, “I think I slept between every course.”
Pederson has never equaled the daring structure and heroic commitment of her serialized nap of 2012, but her friends nevertheless expect her to make at least some effort each November. “They feel like it wasn’t Thanksgiving if they haven’t seen me pass out on the couch somewhere,” she said.
As Pederson’s friends understand, a great Thanksgiving Day nap can be an inspiration. For some reason, though, journalism on the subject tends to be written as if curling up on the nearest piece of upholstery were a criminal activity.
Some newspaper and magazine accounts of Thanksgiving naps use language more typically found in court reporting and police-blotter items. A 2014 article in The Washington Post noted that while some people had attempted to “blame the turkey” for the grogginess we feel after Thanksgiving dinner, the sides and desserts had been revealed as “the real culprits.” Men’s Journal concurred, reporting that “the bird may not be guilty after all.”
Other writers borrow from medical literature, identifying the relaxed condition caused by drumsticks and gravy as a “food coma.” In this metaphor, the fault is not the meal’s. It is ours, for eating so greedily that we succumb to a self-inflicted, though temporary, brain injury.
One may well wonder how a quick swoon on the sofa became so fraught. We find it adorable that cats, dogs and babies take a short afternoon snooze, but when adults do it one day a year, something must be wrong.
Instead of asking how to prevent naps, why aren’t there more articles giving advice on the best ways to induce one? After all, a napping Thanksgiving guest is a guest who isn’t insulting a family member’s romantic choices, or spouting political beliefs so retrograde they would have shocked George Wallace, or doing any number of other things people don’t do when they’re unconscious.
The subtle shaming of Thanksgiving nappers comes as no surprise to sleep experts. Sara E. Alger, a sleep scientist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, has been a public advocate for naps, particularly in the workplace, except in cases of insomnia. Along the way, she has had to fight anti-nap prejudice.
“Naps in general have a stigma attached to them as something you only do when you’re lazy or when you’re sick,” Alger said.
Wrapped inside nap phobia in the United States is often a message reminding us to be productive during what we now think of as normal working hours, although that concept is relatively new.
Modern attitudes about napping go back to the Industrial Revolution, according to Matthew J. Wolf-Meyer, an anthropologist at Binghamton University in New York and the author of “The Slumbering Masses: Sleep, Medicine, and Modern American Life.”
“For a long time, people had flexible sleep schedules,” Wolf-Meyer said. Farmers and tradespeople had some autonomy over their time. They could choose to rest in the hottest part of the day, and might take up simple tasks during a wakeful period in the middle of the night, between two distinct bouts of sleep.
As the 1800s went on, more and more Americans worked in factories on set shifts that were supervised by a foreman. “They work for a total stranger, and a nap becomes totally nonnegotiable,” he said.
Staying awake all day and getting one’s sleep in a single long stretch at night came to be seen as normal. With that came a strong societal expectation that we ought to use our daylight hours productively.
“Even on a holiday, we’re not exempt from those expectations about productivism,” Wolf-Meyer said. “Even on Thanksgiving. You’re supposed to be doing something, even if it’s watching TV. Our labor on holidays is to interact with our relatives. So the nap is kind of a problem.”
Whether we will have any relatives in the room to interact with this Thanksgiving is another question. Americans are being warned that if they make the trip over the river and through the woods to Grandmother’s house, Grandmother might not make it to Christmas.
To allow families to gather together even though they are gathering separately, Zoom will lift its 40-minute limit for free calls on Thanksgiving. This will allow people to schedule their naps around the videoconference, a skill many of them began learning after work-from-home orders came down this spring.
Although there is no hard data so far on whether naps have been on the rise during 2020, sleep scientists like Alger think it’s likely. The many people who now work remotely no longer need to worry about the disapproving eyes of their colleagues if they want a brief, discreet period of horizontality in the afternoons.
If most offices reopen next year, as now seems possible, perhaps greater tolerance toward the adult nap will be one of the things salvaged from the smoking wreckage of the working-from-home era. (In a tweet last week, Wolf-Meyer called the pandemic “the largest (accidental) experiment with human #sleep ever conducted.”) In any case, this would be a good year to destigmatize the Thanksgiving nap.
Experts say people who get seven to nine hours of sleep a day are less prone to catching infectious diseases, and better at fighting off any they do catch. Afternoon sleep counts toward your daily total, according to Alger.
This immunity boost, she said, is in addition to other well-known dividends of a good nap, like added energy, increased alertness, improved mood and better emotional regulation.
Included under the last rubric is a skill that seems especially useful for dealing with families, even if you never get closer to your relatives this year than a “Hollywood Squares”-style video grid: “Napping helps you be more sensitive to receiving other people’s moods,” Alger said. “So you’re not perceiving other people as being more negative than they are.”
Napping also helps you remember facts you learned right before nodding off. Given the way things have been going lately, of course, you may not see this as a plus. You could look at it from the reverse angle, though: Every hour before Jan. 1 that you spend napping is another hour of 2020 you won’t remember.

LONDON — Delicious Thanksgiving dinners planned all around, I trust?
However relatively small the gathering, the fact that this year has been so unexpected makes sitting down for a familiar meal all the more important. One tradition I particularly love is everyone going around the table and saying what they are thankful for. I wonder how much of what people gave thanks for this year differs from other, more “normal” years.
It reminds me of a Thanksgiving tale a good friend shared with me a couple of years ago.
At her holiday meal, the kids were asked to kick things off. The first few offerings were what might have been expected (or what might, quietly, have been suggested to them by a parent): Thanks was given for a much-loved grandparent, perhaps, or favorite teacher. A new friend made or a long-trusted teddy bear.
A few parents gave thanks for health, happiness, partners sticking by them, love and all good things. Next was a boy who stood up, pushed his chair back and, tickled by his own wise words, boldly said: “I give thanks for Netflix because I love Netflix.”
A small pause, as everyone gauged the room — this could be the ultimate parental “busted” moment — before whoops of approval. Heck, yes! Let’s give thanks for television! To all the streaming services we collapse in front of every evening and the series we are entertained by. Bar duly lowered, the kids then proceeded to run with it.
“I give thanks for pizza,” one cheered.
“I give thanks for pasta-pesto,” another chimed in.
“Grilled cheese sandwiches,” a little one squeaked.
“Dough balls,” said another.
“Chocolaaaaate,” declared the smallest at the table before all were lost to the giggles.
I remembered that story recently, and thought those kids were on to something. It shouldn’t take a pandemic to make us realize that it’s the simple things in life that matter.
For many, though, 2020 will be the year that many a day was saved by the making of dough balls, the sharing of pizza, the comfort of pasta-pesto or grilled cheese (as well as Netflix).
This is my tribute — my giving thanks — to that feeling: to the making of something simple and communal, comforting and basic, with, hopefully, ingredients in your kitchen and maybe the little people in your house. In fact, making dough balls is a sort of child’s play and certainly one step up from Play-Doh. It’s just as therapeutic and fun, but rather more delicious to eat.
Here is to giving thanks for all the big stuff — to health and happiness and love — but, also, to tomato sauce and basil leaves and melted cheese. And, of course, to dough balls: to the pure, unadulterated joy of making, baking, eat-with-your-fingers-all-in-one-mouthful dough balls.

Recipe: Cheesy Bread Balls in Tomato Sauce
Total time: 1 hour, plus rising
Yield: 4 servings
For the bread balls:
3/4 cup (100 grams) white bread flour
1/4 cup (60 milliliters) lukewarm water
1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil, plus more for brushing
1/2 teaspoon active (fast-action) dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
For the sauce:
1/3 cup (80 milliliters) olive oil
7 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
1 14-ounce (400-gram) can plum tomatoes, well crushed by hand
3 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves, plus 1 tablespoon for garnish
2 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh basil leaves, plus 2 tablespoons for garnish
1 teaspoon sugar
Kosher salt and black pepper
3 1/2 ounces (100 grams) low-moisture mozzarella
1. Prepare the bread balls: Add the flour, lukewarm water, 1 1/2 teaspoons oil, the yeast and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook, knead on medium-high speed for 7 minutes, scraping the bottom of the bowl to distribute the ingredients as needed, until soft and elastic. Transfer to a medium, lightly oiled bowl, and brush the top of the dough with a little oil. Cover with a damp tea towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until soft and pillowy.
2. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: Add the 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) oil and garlic to a medium ovenproof skillet and heat over medium-low, gently frying for 4 to 5 minutes, until soft and fragrant. (You don’t want the garlic to brown, so turn the heat down if necessary.) Transfer 3 tablespoons of the garlic-oil mixture to a small bowl and set aside.
3. Add the tomatoes with their juices, oregano, basil, sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the skillet and simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Add 2/3 cup (160 milliliters) water, turn the heat to medium-low and continue to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every now and then, until thickened slightly. Set aside.
4. Meanwhile, cut the mozzarella into 20 cubes.
5. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface and use a pastry cutter or sharp knife to cut it into 8 equal pieces.
6. Use your hands to flatten each piece into a 2 1/2-inch/6 centimeter-wide round, then place a piece of mozzarella into the center. Fold the dough up and around, pinching the dough tightly to enclose the cheese. Turn the dough ball over, pinched side down, and use the palm of your hand to roll the dough against your work surface to make a smooth, neat ball.
7. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet (baking tray), and form the remaining dough balls, spacing them evenly apart as you place them on the baking sheet. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to proof in a warm place for another 30 minutes.
8. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Brush the top of the dough balls with a little olive oil to coat, then bake for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. Set aside and heat the broiler (turn the oven grill setting to medium-high).
9. Return the sauce to medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add the baked bread balls to the sauce, and arrange the remaining cheese cubes around them. Transfer to the middle rack of the oven and broil (grill) for 2 to 4 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling and the bread balls are nicely browned.
10. Spoon the reserved garlic oil over the bread balls and season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the extra oregano and basil, and serve right away.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — I am used to going to the East Village, the Lower East Side, Woodside in Queens and any number of other neighborhoods to eat Filipino food, but I was not quite prepared for the location of the new Filipino restaurant Bilao.
It’s on a stretch of First Avenue on the Upper East Side, where almost every other storefront is devoted to some mundane service like hair cutting, nail polishing, key cutting or shirt pressing. It may be the only block in New York City about which you could say it’s actually more interesting because it has a 7-Eleven and a Domino’s.
I had started to think that I must have come to the wrong place when I noticed the commotion near 75th Street. Bilao is a narrow restaurant with minimal street frontage, but when business is going full tilt it can pack in more people into its outdoor seating areas than will ever be able to squeeze into its dining room once the pandemic ends.
This was a full-tilt night. Couples were sitting at tables on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant, groups were at tables under a tent on the pavement, and several delivery men were milling around the door. Running in and out were two servers, trying to keep everybody in line and dodging the e-bikes that cruise noiselessly up the bike lane between the sidewalk and the tent every 12 seconds or so.
If I’d had any lingering doubt that I’d found the right address, it was obliterated when one of those servers came to my sidewalk table and set down a deep-fried knuckle of pork on a cutting board. This was crispy pata the way I always hope it will look. Next to two neatly trimmed stubs of bone, a fork and a steak knife were sunk deep in an open seam running through the crunchy, honey-colored skin. The knife is there to crack open and hack off and portion out the skin, although it also comes in handy with the warm meat underneath, sweet with melted fat and salty with a short brine cure and ready for a bath in the customary vinegar-soy dip.
Under normal conditions, crispy pata would be the centerpiece of a dinner for a family. But there’s a pandemic going on, so a friend and I had to eat the whole thing ourselves.
For Filipino food that has been tailored for modern New York tastes, I might send you to a table in the backyard of Purple Yam in Brooklyn. For a look under the hood at more intricate or unusual Filipino dishes without leaving your own kitchen, I’d suggest ordering up one of the meal kits being sold by Jeepney, a normally gregarious restaurant in the East Village. There are other kitchens whose detail work is finer than Bilao’s, whose array of condiments is more diverse.
But if you want an abundance of Filipino food that you can get down with, if an entire deep-fried pork knuckle sounds like a good start, if you are happiest when you have just stabbed a fork into some murky stew or soup and haven’t yet figured out just what it is you’ve speared on the end, then Bilao may be just the place for you.
The restaurant was opened in August by three Filipino New Yorkers: Jude Canela, Maricris Dinopol and Joan Calanog. All three are nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital, working the night shift. After they got off at 7 a.m. they used to go out for breakfast, but it was never quite what they wanted. What they wanted was tapa, strips of marinated and fried beef; or links of longaniza; or sticky red bits of tocino, the cured but unsmoked bacon that sometimes looks as if it had found its way into a jar of maraschino cherries — any of those on a plate, with a mound of garlic-fried rice and an egg, sunny side up.
They knew they weren’t the only people in the area who wanted those things for breakfast. The Upper East Side is full of hospitals, and the hospitals are full of Filipino workers. In fact, an analysis by ProPublica in May found that 1 in every 4 adults with Filipino ancestry in the New York-New Jersey region worked in a hospital or other medical facility. Many of them, including Canela, Dinopol and Calanog, attended one of the hundreds of nursing schools in the Philippines.
When the three of them began talking about opening a Filipino restaurant with all-day breakfast near the East Side’s cluster of hospitals, it was a joke. Then they got serious. That they found their space on First Avenue during the pandemic, when hospital workers were pushed to their limits and beyond, is just one of those twists of fate that 2020 always seems to have up its sleeve.
The three hired Boji Asunción as their chef, and worked with him until they were happy that his renditions of Filipino staples tasted and looked like “a home-cooked meal,” as Canela put it. To underscore the domestic inspiration, they named the restaurant after the bamboo baskets with which cooks rinse starch from rice. The tool is called a bilao (bee-LAH-oh) and examples of it hang on the walls inside.
Laing is left as a stew of taro leaves and fresh shrimp in a coconut broth with the powerful tidal scent of shrimp paste, not whipped into the glossy green purée that some restaurants favor. Ridged curls of bitter melon lurk in the vegetable stew known as pinakbet among the eggplants, long beans, tomatoes and kabocha. Grilled chicken inasal, dyed to a saffron yellow by ground annatto, has been deeply slashed to let in the marinade of coconut vinegar and calamansi juice.
Bilao’s kare-kare, oxtails and tripe cooked in peanut-butter sauce, does not have the swoony intensity you come across in other kitchens. The pork-coconut stew bicol express is seasoned with fresh red and green chiles, but still seemed a bit shy when I had it. But there was nothing retiring about the hash of pigs’ ears, cheeks and livers under a raw egg — hissing on a hot iron plate, as any self-respecting sizzling sisig does.
The menu is surprisingly extensive for a place that, once we are out of the jaws of the pandemic, will hold about 20 customers. Everything on it, including breakfast, is available from morning until evening. Each time I have gone to Bilao, there have been people in scrubs eating outside, suggesting that the owners knew their audience. How did they work up the nerve to open their first restaurant while experienced operators all over town were going out of business?
“The thing is,” Canela said, “we were so hungry.”

They Welcomed Dozens for Thanksgiving. Now What?

GRANGER, Ind. — Dr. Jan Sanders was the first Black pediatrician to have her own practice here. Her husband, Leo McWilliams, is an assistant dean in the University of Notre Dame’s engineering department and a “quadruple Domer,” a title bestowed on the rare graduate with four degrees from the school.
But what’s truly impressive is the amount of food they cook for Thanksgiving.
One turkey comes off Leo’s grill, and another out of a smoker. He’s from Memphis, Tennessee, so there are ribs, chicken and brisket, too. Jan makes at least four styles of dressing, and simmers 35 bunches of turnip and mustard greens. She builds pans of macaroni and cheese, and bakes her mother’s brown sugar poundcake. Their sons, Cheyney, 28, and Quinlan, 25, boil pounds of sweet potatoes to make the pies.
Ever since the sons were in elementary school, the couple have hosted Thanksgiving in their cozy two-story house on a cul-de-sac in Granger, a suburb of South Bend. The guest list has included almost every lonely Black freshman enrolled at Notre Dame, a school where only about 3% of the 8,600 or so undergraduates are African American.
There are Dreamers, too, those young adult immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and did not have citizenship or legal residency status. International students show up, along with scholarship students from small towns who need to be convinced that they really do belong at an elite university.
“We try to give them a space to vent things they perhaps couldn’t vent in other spaces, and to get a friendly ear and friendly advice,” Leo said.
More than 60 people packed into the house last year to share nearly 50 dishes, each of which Jan documented in a handwritten list. But this year, the house will be mostly empty, save for the immediate family. The menu is down to 12 dishes and dessert.
Social scientists use the term collective effervescence to describe the heightened sense of belonging and well-being that comes with a shared ritual. It’s what makes going to a concert or a baseball game feel so good. The spirit of the group is bigger than what anyone could experience individually. It’s one of the building blocks of culture.
Kelly Alexander, a food studies professor at the University of North Carolina, wrote about collective effervescence in her doctoral dissertation. She and other anthropologists are taking note of what happens when a nation is deprived of in-person gathering on Thanksgiving.
“Is the one year we have to sit it out that big of a deal?” she asked. “Maybe not. But we have to acknowledge it because it will have an effect.”
For the kindred souls who have come to rely on Thanksgiving at Jan and Leo’s, the void will be particularly gaping. Most will be left to celebrate alone or in small groups, contemplating a year that delivered a series of national crises that hit them particularly hard: the killings of Black people at the hands of police officers and the resulting uproar over systemic racism; the coronavirus, which is still raging through communities of color at disproportionate rates; the bruised economy; the exhausting election and its aftermath.
“If there was ever a year when we needed to all be together, this is it,” said Richard G. Jones, the director of the Gallivan Journalism Program at Notre Dame and a former New York Times editor who usually gets extra helpings of Leo’s smoked salmon every Thanksgiving.
Shaquille Johnson, 25, could have really used a Thanksgiving meal at Jan and Leo’s, too. After graduating from Notre Dame, he landed a job as a software engineer for Google. When COVID-19 closed the company’s California campus, he and other young tech workers who could work from anywhere left the Bay Area in search of cheaper rent or a change of scenery.
He is in Austin, Texas, now, but most of his family is in Chicago. His grandmother is a health aide whose hours have been drastically cut, so he sends her money. He worries about his uncle, who lost so much business in the pandemic that he had to close his chicken-and-burger restaurant in Chicago. His aunt folded her halal food business in Wisconsin for the same reasons.
“It’s tough times, and it sucks,” Johnson said.
This Thanksgiving he’ll probably make his way to Chicago, but his heart will be at Jan and Leo’s, where he met some of his best friends and found a family who understood how it felt when white students told him he was the first Black person they’d ever met, or asked if it was all right to use the N-word.
“It was the one time you could get together and know for sure there wouldn’t be any racism there,” he said. “You could relax.”
The scene was the same every year. All the young people would crowd into the basement to play Jenga or Mario Kart before heading upstairs to share a meal with Jan and Leo’s neighbors and family friends. Once dessert was over and at least some of the dishes had been washed, everyone jumped in line to do the Cupid Shuffle or the Wobble, with Jan leading the way.
Deborah Bineza could really use a party like that this year. She graduated in 2019, and works as a program coordinator at the university’s gender relations center. She feels lucky; many of her friends have lost their jobs because of the pandemic.
She fell into Jan and Leo’s orbit when she was a freshman, and met their son Quinlan at an interfaith choir practice. She didn’t have the money to go home to Nashville, Tennessee, for Thanksgiving, and figured she would spend the holiday on campus, alone. Then Quinlan invited her to his parents’.
Bineza was a vegetarian at the time, and just like the Muslim Thanksgiving guests who don’t eat pork, she found plenty of dishes prepared with people like her in mind. Jan and Leo quickly became her champions, meeting with her and other students at a Starbucks every Sunday to talk over life and solve problems.
“They made that space where you can go be around other Black people and not have to explain what is going on or how you are feeling, and just be able to experience joy,” she said. “It’s difficult to not have that this year.”
Instead, she’ll check in with her family online — her parents had mild cases of COVID — but stay in South Bend for a dinner with her partner and her roommate.
Michael Sills, 25, and his brother, Wiett Sills, 23, who are white, found a different kind of solace at those Thanksgiving gatherings. They came to Notre Dame from San Diego but had to think twice before spending money on a plane ticket home for the holiday. They were homesick, and feeling for the first time in their lives what it meant to not be as wealthy as others.
“I never realized other people had yachts and went on skiing trips on the weekend until I went to Notre Dame,” Michael said.
They became regulars at Jan and Leo’s, bringing their grandmother’s banana pudding and leaving with pans of macaroni and cheese that Jan made especially for them.
Thanksgiving at the couple’s house would have been a nice reprieve this year, Michael said. He is in South Bend trying to start his own banking analytics business, but it’s slow going. Like many young people, he is struggling with his mental health during the pandemic.
He hasn’t seen his family since February. The brothers hope to get to San Diego if everyone can agree on COVID protocols.
“I’m just trying to breathe,” he said.
The Notre Dame gathering isn’t just for students. Jan and Leo have collected plenty of older adults along the way.
There is the retired schoolteacher from Chicago who is such a regular that she keeps a nightgown in a drawer in the guest room, and the fellow professors who offer Jewish blessings before dinner. There are the neighbors who always lent them oven space, and came over until they moved to Colorado. The mother of one son’s girlfriend came even after they broke up.
“Our gatherings are not just for food,” Jan said. “It’s for community and for closeness.”
Jan and Leo have been married for 35 years and are very clear about how and why they built this Thanksgiving tradition.
Their parents set the example, and their life experiences showed them how much a little help can mean. Their faith — they are members of Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church in South Bend — amplifies their desire to help people. And Leo remembers when he was a freshman and spent Thanksgiving alone on campus.
“It’s in our DNA,” he said.
This year, the house will be quiet. Except for a few athletes, the students will have left campus by Thanksgiving and won’t be back until February. The virus will keep everyone else away.
So Jan and Leo will be left with their immediate family. They’ll pick up Jan’s 88-year-old mother, who lives 10 minutes away. Cheyney, a student at Indiana University School of Medicine who had a mild case of COVID this fall, lives on his own in South Bend. Quinlan graduated from Notre Dame and is now a software engineer for Target.
He’ll drive in from Minneapolis, where the pain over George Floyd’s death in May, and the protests that followed, struck deep.
“I don’t think I realized how much it affected me until maybe September,” he said. “The last thing I needed to see, or any of us needed to see, was another Black person being killed by police. You end up asking yourself, ‘How much more can I take?’”
So they will cook. And cook. Leo will grill a turkey and smoke a side of salmon. Jan’s list of side dishes has grown. The boys will make pies. There will be poundcake.
“We can’t help ourselves,” Jan said. “We just don’t know how to cook for four.”
And they don’t know how not to feed other people. They’ve stocked the cupboard in the basement with disposable containers, and they’ve made a list of people they plan to deliver Thanksgiving dinner to.
First will be Isabel Jakab, who came to the United States in 1980 to escape the civil war in El Salvador and ended up teaching Spanish at Notre Dame for 25 years. She is 79, and started going to Jan and Leo’s for Thanksgiving after her husband died nine years ago. She hasn’t visited friends or even ventured out to shop since the pandemic hit in March. Even having workers come to the house for repairs makes her nervous.
Virginia Montero-Smith, 57, is on the list, too. She has spent 15 Thanksgivings with the family. Montero-Smith is from Venezuela and began tutoring the boys in Spanish before they were in first grade. She and the family became so close that after she divorced, she lived in their basement until she could get back on her feet.
Normally, she is in charge of carving the turkey. But not this year.
“If you have Jan and Leo as friends, you don’t need anybody else,” she said. “They are like sunshine.”
Most likely, the list of people the couple feed this Thanksgiving will grow right up until Thanksgiving morning. It’s a good bet that there will be some new names on it. “We are always collecting people,” Jan said.
Next year, if it’s safe to gather, they can show up at Jan and Leo’s, make a plate and become a kindred soul, too.

Texto completo: The claim: A video shows Joe Biden celebrating his birthday last week without a face mask
Last week, President-elect Joe Biden celebrated his 78th birthday.
To mark the occasion, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms tweeted a video of herself next to Biden, leading a crowd in a chorus of "Happy Birthday."
"Wishing our President-Elect @joebiden a VERY Happy Birthday from the great Blue state of Joe’gia!" she wrote.
Soon, the video had spread across the internet as apparent proof that Bottoms, Biden, and others were not wearing masks to protect against the coronavirus.
Conservatives Today and Daily Patriot Post — conservative online news websites — pointed to the video as evidence of hypocrisy.
"You’re not allowed to have Thanksgiving with a few of your family members, but Joe Biden and his hundreds of pals can all get together, mask-free, and party like it’s 1999," their identical articles read. "Why, if you looked at this video and didn’t know better, you’d think there was absolutely no 'COVID pandemic' at all," both articles also read.
Conservatives Today and Daily Patriot Post could not be reached for comment.
The Cambodian Broadcasting Network shared a different clip of the birthday celebration with Bottoms and Biden and claimed that it had occurred "yesterday."
"So Biden can have a birthday party yesterday but we can’t have Thanksgiving? Not a single mask. No social distancing," its post read. "They’re singing happy birthday in a crowd but singing in Church is dangerous? It’s time to #FightBack."
The Cambodian Broadcasting Network has not responded to a request from USA TODAY for comment.
Fact check: Some inauguration prep is underway, but a viral photo of it is actually from 1993.
The video was made in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic
In reality, the footage of Biden, Bottoms and others celebrating without masks was made in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic.
After the outcry, Bottoms took to Twitter to clarify the context of the video she had shared.
"Pre-Covid! This was in the @TPStudios White House following the @DNC @msnbc debate on 11/20/19," she wrote, referring to Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta.
Details in the video confirm the time and place the footage was taken.
For example, the red tie that Biden is sporting in the clip is the same tie he wore at that night's debate, per the New York Times.
Television screens with the words “Debate Viewing Party” are also visible in the video that The Cambodian Broadcasting Company shared, and in clips from other angles.
Fact check: Trump lawyer Sidney Powell falsely stated he won election 'by a landslide'
In 2020, Biden spent his birthday masked and in meetings
In 2020, Biden spent his birthday meeting with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y., in Wilmington, Delaware.
Biden, Harris, Pelosi, and Schumer all wore face masks and sat several feet from each other around a large rectangular table, per the New York Times. It was their first in-person meeting since the election.
Though the meeting focused on coronavirus and the economy, Pelosi still brought a birthday present for Biden — a white orchid.
This is not the first time photos of Biden and other Democrats from before the pandemic have been used to claim that they are not following public health guidance on mask-wearing and social distancing.
In fact, USA TODAY has debunked at least four other similar claims since July.
Fact check: False claim that electronic voting software companies Dominion and Smartmatic have closed
Our rating: False
Based on our research, the claim that a video shows Joe Biden celebrating his birthday last week without a face mask is FALSE. The video was from 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic necessitated the use of masks. On his birthday in 2020, Biden wore a mask for a meeting with fellow Democratic leaders.

BRUSSELS — Donald Trump’s presidency was marked by exceptional contempt for European allies and the NATO alliance. But it also forced European nations to consider whether they had become too dependent on the United States for leadership and their own security, and to ponder how far they were willing to go to defend themselves.
But Trump is leaving. And the prospect of his departure has reopened old fissures between key European allies over their defense relationships with the United States, with considerable doubts about what just months ago looked like a determined turn toward greater European ambition and integration.
The most immediate consequence has been a bitter squabble between France and Germany over the future of European defense and strategic autonomy, displaying the different anxieties of two countries central to the functioning of the European Union.
The spat has included an unusually personal attack by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on the German defense minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. He even suggested that she, a favorite of Chancellor Angela Merkel, was out of step with the chancellor, which German officials and analysts strongly deny.
The dispute is a measure of the raw feelings stirred by Trump’s presidency, which raised doubts about America’s long-term commitment to global leadership and European security that a Joe Biden presidency is not likely to erase.
Those attitudes helped Macron push the idea of European “strategic autonomy” from a changed United States, one it sees as no longer willing to bear the burdens of global leadership, no matter who is president.
Macron’s worry, French officials and analysts say, is that a friendly Biden presidency will put Europe — and more important Germany, its largest and richest nation — back to sleep, content to shelter under the American umbrella and reluctant to commit to a more forceful European voice in the world.
Yet it is Kramp-Karrenbauer, commonly known as AKK, who is the German official most vocal about the need for Germany and Europe to take military and security affairs more seriously, said Claudia Major, a senior defense analyst at Germany’s Institute for International and Security Affairs.
“To have this counterproductive and toxic debate doesn’t help us at all,” Major said. “Macron is focusing on the wrong issue. The question in Germany is not whether we’re Atlanticist or Europeanist, but whether we take on more responsibility for defense or not, and AKK wants to do more.”
The debate is important, said François Heisbourg, a French security analyst, “because it displays in a naked fashion the discrepancies between French and German perceptions, as proxies for a broader European division.”
The two countries have very different starting points, he said, with different views of the centrality of trans-Atlantic dependency. “But in substance — the need to do more — there’s not so much difference.”
Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington who runs the Munich Security Conference, said: “This is the single most unnecessary quarrel I’ve witnessed between Germany and France in a decade.”
A moment’s thought, he said, “would tell you that AKK is Macron’s closest ally in Germany in strengthening European capabilities, and whether you call it autonomy or a better partner of the U.S. in NATO, it’s just a quarrel about words, not about meaning.”
The argument was roughly the same as the one Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer had to handle after World War II, Ischinger said. “The French are challenging a bit the need to have America here, and Germans say, ‘I can’t live without the security of the Americans, so strengthen Europe to be a better partner.’”
Germany also considers the U.S. security umbrella crucial for European balance, to keep Central and Eastern Europeans committed to NATO and the European Union itself, said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations.
“The Germans want to frame increased European military efforts as part of trans-Atlantic cooperation, as a message to the U.S., but also to Central and East European countries” that only trust U.S. security guarantees against Russia, she said.
“Germany wants to be as inclusive as possible in Europe while the French are far more ready to move ahead with a smaller number of countries,” Schwarzer said. “You see this with defense but also with the coronavirus recovery fund.”
Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, notes that NATO and the European Union are fundamental to Germany in a way they are not to France, which maintains its own nuclear arsenal.
“If you take NATO or the EU away from France, the French could do coalitions of the willing. Take them away from Germany and we feel naked,” Puglierin said. “The idea that NATO collapses frightens us.”
The problem, she said, came when Macron insisted that he wanted to stay in NATO, but wanted strategic autonomy as well as good relations with the United States. “Germans are not sure how that would work and no one has explained it,” she said. “So we don’t really buy it.”
Macron, criticized for his handling of the pandemic, is feeling unsupported by his allies, Heisbourg suggested. Macron sees France as in a war with radical Islamists, both at home and in North Africa, and has been attacked for his responses by Muslim nations, especially by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.
Erdogan has insulted Macron, claiming to speak in the name of Islam, and is exercising military power in the eastern Mediterranean at the expense of Greece and Cyprus, and in Libya and Azerbaijan, against French allies.
Yet Germany has been trying to mediate between Turkey and EU members Greece and Cyprus, “as if they are equal,” Heisbourg said, which has infuriated Macron.
France and Germany are also fighting about the future of a joint military project, a new fighter jet, which is not going well, according to Major and Christian Mölling, writing in Le Monde.
The project is intended to show “that European sovereignty is possible, and that Paris and Berlin are carriers of this ambition,” they write. “This also means that if this flagship project fails, the greatest damage will be political, not economic.”
The larger rift began when Kramp-Karrenbauer sparked Macron’s ire in a speech, which she followed with an op-ed piece in Politico, in which she stated bluntly: “Europe still needs America.”
“Illusions of European strategic autonomy must come to an end: Europeans will not be able to replace America’s crucial role as a security provider,” she wrote.
Macron clearly took that as a direct rebuttal of his own arguments for strategic autonomy, and therefore of his efforts to position himself at the center of European leadership in the waning days of Merkel’s time in office.
He responded in a lengthy interview 10 days later. “The question, if we are straightforward, is the following: Is the change in the American administration going to see Europeans letting up?” he said.
Then he singled out Kramp-Karrenbauer for special criticism, saying he “profoundly” disagreed with her opinion piece. “I think that it is a historical misinterpretation,” Macron said. “Fortunately, if I understood things correctly, the chancellor does not share this point of view.”
The United States, Macron continued, without ever mentioning Biden’s name, “will only respect us as allies if we are earnest, and if we are sovereign with respect to our defense.” A new administration, he added, was an opportunity for Europe “to continue to build our independence.”
Kramp-Karrenbauer then gave another speech last week to students at Germany’s military academy in which she again argued that the best way to maintain America’s security commitment to Europe was “to do more for our own security.”
“The French President has recently made that same observation — and I agree,” she said. But she did not back down, adding that “relying exclusively on the EU would create a divide in Europe.”
On Tuesday, asked directly whether Merkel and Macron were in agreement, Kramp-Karrenbauer said bluntly: “I did not hear the chancellor say that NATO was superfluous.”
Puglierin said it was time to move on from “this very stupid debate.”
“The Americans expect us to come up with something,” she said, “and not wait like children.”

After years of close calls, red herrings, and electoral margins that grew closer and closer, Democrats won Georgia in this year’s presidential election for the first time since 1992.
The win broke the Republican lock on Southern states in the Electoral College, but it also vindicated Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat and former state House Minority Leader who has become synonymous with the party’s attempts to win statewide. Abrams, who has helped start organizations to register new voters and combat voter suppression, said the win was a personal relief — a political bounce back after she narrowly lost her race for governor in 2018.
In an interview with The New York Times, she outlined how she believes President-elect Joe Biden won and how liberal groups in other Southern states can replicate Georgia’s path. She also weighed in on the current divisions within the Democratic Party, and her future political plans.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Georgia turns blue after all these decades of work. How did you feel when that became clear? Was it vindication? Was it relief? What was the emotion?
A: I think it was a combination of relief and excitement about what this means. But also a healthy dose of realism — we’ve got this done, but it was narrowly achieved, which means more work remains to be done.
I wouldn’t say vindication in the sense that there was some sort of chest beating, but I am excited about how it proves the model of building this tapestry of leaders across racial and geographic lines. I’ve been privileged to be part of building the resources and the infrastructure and the narratives, that help pull together different communities, all of us working toward the same goal. Over the course of a decade, and with resources, that brought success to fruition.
Q: What was different about the electorate in the coalition this time? What happened in 2020 that in 2018 or 2016 wasn’t able to get done?
A: Well, I think there’s two pieces to this. One is that demographic changes are ongoing, and every cycle is an opportunity to not only register them but to engage them. So you build the muscle memory of voting, you build the capacity to engage, because people have more information and have a deeper sense of their capacity and their potential as voters.
I would draw a distinction between 2016 and 2020, using 2018 as the marker, because what happened, also, was that we were able to remove remarkable restrictions to voter access.
Voter suppression was very much instrumental in shaping turnout numbers in 2018, and 2016. In 2018, we did much deeper investment in actual voter turnout, but we still ran into the buzz saw of voter purges, exact match closures, old machines that were inaccurately and disparately deployed, broken machines, and then super high rejection rates, comparatively speaking, of Black and brown voters in the absentee or provisional ballots space.
So what we were able to identify — in the concrete ways in 2018 — we were able then to mitigate heading into 2020.
And so I think you see the combination of increased voter engagement through another 800,000 people being registered and staying on the rolls through November 2018 through this election. But you also had the removal and mitigation of a number of barriers that blocked access to the polls.
I think it’s really important, as much as people are excited about the proactive work that we were able to do to bring voters to the polls, we cannot ignore the incredible change that was wrought because voters were actually able to make it through the gauntlet and get their votes counted.
Q: What were those early years like? Were you believed when you would say that Georgia could be a Democratic state?
A: I became minority leader in November 2010, two weeks after the worst loss suffered by Democrats in Georgia history. We lost every statewide office. We lost the Senate to a supermajority. We lost more members of the State House. And we were heading into a redistricting year where Republicans drew themselves, on paper, 124 seats out of 180.
I traveled around the country raising money for House races and getting people to invest was nearly impossible, people didn’t see the validity of a Georgia victory. They pointed to the 2008 election when the Obama campaign determined that we weren’t viable yet, so there was no investment. In 2012, I couldn’t leverage that there was going to be investment from the campaign as a hook for getting donors to come in. So it was a really small cadre of donors, largely philanthropists that I’d taken myself to meet. I’d say, “I know you don’t believe Georgia is real, but let me tell you what it can look like.”
Each cycle, I would take that same deck and update it and say, “Here’s where we were. And here’s where we going. And while this thing feels incremental, let me tell you what’s different now.”
I have always loved those lines, “Give me a place to stand and I can move the world.” Well, give me a place to stand and I can convince you Georgia is real.
Q: What was your lowest point in that time? What was the moment you questioned whether it was possible?
A: The end of the redistricting in 2011. Republicans passed maps that gave them a disproportionate share everywhere. It packed Black communities, it cracked Latino communities. It put the only Latino legislator in a majority white district. And the maps were approved. It was December of 2011, when Republicans were given permission to racially gerrymander in the state of Georgia and that to me was heart wrenching. It meant the only salvation we had coming was to crawl back our way.
There would be no new map. There would be no litigation. We were going to have to do this by finding every voter we could and that was going to take a lot longer than I’d hoped, but not longer than I’d imagined.
Q: Looking ahead, how do Democrats hold together the coalition that we saw in November without Donald Trump on the ballot? Obviously the Senate runoffs are the first step.
A: This coalition existed in 2018 in my election. This is a coalition that we’ve been building together for the last decade through groups like Asian American advocacy funds, Black Lives Matter, Coalition for People’s Agenda, Mijente, Southerners on New Ground. So this is a group that didn’t just come together out of convenience. We’ve been working together in coalition and that’s why I think we can sustain it.
Q: What about other states? Why didn’t Democrats see similar gains in other states through the South on Election Day?
A: I can’t speak to what didn’t happen in other states, I can tell you that Georgia has the most diverse electorate of any of the battleground states. We saw a dramatic increase in not only the voter turnout, but in the voter’s share of the electorate. Latino and AAPI voters rose sharply from 2016.
We disagree with the analysis done by The Upshot. We believe that the Black share is actually 29% and that’s commensurate with where it’s been. It’s decreased slightly because we saw a sharp increase in Latino and AAPI voters and I reject soundly this notion that we lost 2% of the Black vote share.
But we also not only saw the share of the electorate expand, we saw Latino voter turnout increased by 72%. AAPI voters increased by 91%, Black voters increased their turnout by 20%. White voters increased theirs by 16%. So we were able to increase on all of those margins and we were also able to continue to increase the share of white voters. And that combination matters. This is a combination that doesn’t really exist in other states at the level that exists here in Georgia.
Q: There are divisions among Democrats, especially moderate and progressive on some of the down ballot results. You have respect in both those camps. Do you think messages like “defund the police” hurt the party in House and Senate races?
A: I think you run the campaign for the place where you live. And I’ve always held to the reality that we exist on a spectrum of progress. There are those who have made it further along that spectrum. There are other communities that are struggling to find our way. And the responsibility of every election in every campaign is to identify where you are, but also where you can go.
But it’s up to those local communities to calibrate how broad and how far the vision can reach.
I think it is not helpful to try to force every single person into the same mold. I talk about the work I do here as translating “progressive” into “Southern,” because I know that there are conversations that are absolutely necessary, but you can’t get to that if you haven’t built the language to describe it. And we’ve got to do the work of building the language before we can get to the slogans.
Q: But is it zero sum? The word we hear from some of the moderate members of the House is that too much space is given to some of these progressive members and those slogans and that hurts them.
A: For the Democratic Party, it is our burden and our benefit that we are faced with diversity. Republicans rarely have to engage because of the homogeneous nature of their belief system. When you are against most things, it is not necessary to articulate what you are for.
And this is a broad generalization and I know it, but Democrats have always had to recognize that the big tent that we built in, we’re going to have robust conversations inside it. And those conversations always spill out into the atmosphere. Republicans are going to weaponize those conversations. And it can be whispers or it can be shouts, but they’re going to find a way to leverage them.
Our responsibility is to make certain we built a base understanding of who we are.
Q: Are you going to run for governor in 2022?
A: I am focused on Jan. 5, and ensuring that we can send Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock to the United States Senate.
Q: Is there any timetable you have to make that decision?
A: I’m only looking to Jan. 5.

VISEGRAD, Bosnia and Herzegovina — As night falls, owls hoot and frogs croak in the forest around Vilina Vlas, a spa getaway in eastern Bosnia. A gentle wind rustles the pine trees that swaddle the health resort, described by one guidebook as “a perfect spot for a romantic evening.”
Eager for a good rest after a long bus journey, Kym Vercoe, an Australian actress on holiday in the Balkans, checked into the spa hoping to enjoy its soothing calm.
But something was off. She could not sleep. “I was awake all night, ” Vercoe recalled in a telephone interview from Australia.
After she returned home, she read up on the place and learned about its history: The spa hotel had once been a rape and murder camp. She wondered if she had sensed its history in some way, and said she “felt duped and angry.”
“I am not a religious person, but I felt awful just being there,” Vercoe said.
United Nations investigators reported in 2011 that at the spa, “the prisoners were raped repeatedly.” The investigators detailed how, during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, the spa had been commandeered by a gang of Serb nationalist thugs who called themselves the White Eagles and The Avengers.
Many of their captives, mostly Bosnian Muslim women but also some men, the U.N. concluded, were “never seen again.” Some women jumped to their deaths from upper floors, while others were killed, “suffocated in a system of gas pipes at the hotel.”
Twenty-five years after a peace agreement reached in Dayton, Ohio ended the Bosnia war, how to deal with trauma left by the past still haunts the country.
Vercoe ended up writing a play about her experience, which was later turned into a film, “For Those Who Can Tell No Tales,” directed by Jasmila Zbanic, a celebrated Bosnian director, and starring Vercoe, who plays herself.
For Bosnians, however, dealing with past horror is far more difficult and painful.
Like nearly all issues in Bosnia today, views on what to do about the Vilina Vlas spa diverge sharply along ethnic lines.
Some Muslim victims want the spa razed, while others think it should be allowed to stand so long as past crimes are acknowledged. Most Serbs want the spa freed from the stains of the war so that it can help the local economy, which relies heavily on tourism, and even expand.
Tim Clancy, an American who has lived in Bosnia since the war and wrote the only comprehensive, English-language guidebook to the country, said he had long wrestled with the question of “how long a community should be held hostage to the past.”
Bakira Hasecic, a Bosnian Muslim who fled her village near the spa in 1992 after a campaign of “ethnic cleansing” by Serb fanatics, described Vilina Vlas, which reopened to paying guests after the war, as “the center of evil.”
Yet, she doesn’t think it should be shut down. “If we closed every place in Bosnia where war crimes occurred we would have to shut down the whole country,” she said, explaining that all she asks for is a plaque at the spa’s entrance to acknowledge past crimes.
Raped three times herself — not at Vilina Vlas, she said, but at a police station in the nearby town of Visegrad, a school and the Institute for the Protection of Women and Children — Hasecic has struggled for more than two decades to force a reckoning with Bosnia’s past.
She founded the Association of Women War Victims, interviewed survivors and testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a court in The Hague , which has convicted some of those responsible for the horrors at Vilina Vlas, including a former leader of the White Eagles, Milan Lukic.
“There is not a single bed in this place on which a woman was not raped or killed,” Hasecic said during a recent visit, referring to evidence she collected showing that around 200 women were sexually assaulted at the spa, of whom only 15 escaped alive. “Anyone who knows what happened, if they are at least a bit normal, would not stay there.”
What happened, though not the details, has long been known, starting with a Washington Post report in 1992 of a 17-year-old rape victim and her 15-year-old sister, and a 1996 investigation into the wartime crimes of Lukic by The New York Times. But many guests, like Vercoe, still have no idea.
Those who work at the spa today, many of them too young to have played any role in the crimes of the 1990s, seem to want to forget.
On a visit in late fall, the spa was busy, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Fitted with the same dark wooden closets and beds that were there during the war, some still bearing carved wartime inscriptions, the spa’s 72 rooms line long gloomy corridors covered in stained red carpets.
The whole place radiates muffled menace, mixed with the smell of cooking oil and cigarette smoke.
At any mention of the war years, staff members suddenly became mute or hostile. An otherwise friendly receptionist, asked about reports on the internet of the terrible crimes in 1992, bristled angrily, protesting that “the internet is full of lies” and “you can see everything is all fine here.”
Built in the 1980s before Yugoslavia, a multiethnic socialist state of which Bosnia was then part, disintegrated into war, Vilina Vlas is today owned by the Republika Srpska, a self-governing Serb region of Bosnia.
The region’s dominant politician, Milorad Dodik, has repeatedly denied Serb crimes in the 1990s, and even dedicated a student dormitory to Radovan Karadzic, the Serb wartime leader now serving a 40-year sentence after being convicted in 2016 of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Dodik, now the Serb member of Bosnia’s three-person presidency, visited Visegrad in October, ending his trip with a visit to the spa and a promise to invest $1.5 million in the facility to increase its appeal for tourists.
This summer the government of the Serb region started offering residents vouchers to redeem for free nights at Vilina Vlas and other spas in the area, which was largely “cleansed” of Muslim Bosnians during the war.
But Bosnian Muslims, also known as Bosniaks, have responded angrily to what they see as an effort to whitewash the spa’s gruesome past, an effort aided inadvertently by the American tech giant Google.
An online petition, launched recently by a lecturer at the University of Sarajevo in the Bosnian capital, demanded that Google “remove Vilina Vlas (as a tourist site)” from its search engine and map tool. Reviews listed by Google are nearly all favorable, with the former rape camp hailed as “absolutely fabulous,” “great for resting” and “very calming.”
“If somebody decided to turn Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps into a wellness retreat perfect for a ‘relaxing weekend getaway,’ would you let them promote this on Google?” the petition, already signed by more than 26,000 people, asked. “Would you allow it to appear on Google Maps as a tourist facility?”
A Google spokesman said the company makes “every effort to objectively display the real world as much as possible,” adding that “this location is both a current business and a place that has historical significance.” An online search quickly produces information about its awful history.
Hasecic of the war victims’ association said Serb women in Visegrad had spoken with her privately about wartime atrocities by Serb extremists but “none can speak publicly” because of pressure to stay silent.
Bilal Memisevic, the only Muslim member of Visegrad’s town council, said he had been asking for years that the authorities put up a plaque at the hotel to commemorate the victims.
“We understand that the spa was and will be a magnet for tourists and are not asking for it to be shut down,” he said. “All we want is a single sentence on the wall saying: ‘At this site war crimes were committed between this date and that date.’”
But that, he added, has proved impossible because “the official position of Bosnian Serb leaders is to deny everything.”
Olivera Todorovic, the director of Visegrad’s tourism department and a stout defender of the view that accounts of wartime crimes at Vilina Vlas are “exaggerated and unfair,” said she wanted the whole issue to just go away so that visitors can enjoy the town’s other sites like a magnificent 16th-century bridge over the River Drina.
“We are trying to forget about the war years and develop tourism,” she said. “Why do we have to keep talking about the past?”

SAN FRANCISCO — In the tense days after the presidential election, a team of Facebook employees presented the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, with an alarming finding: Election-related misinformation was going viral on the site.
President Donald Trump was already casting the election as rigged, and stories from right-wing media outlets with false and misleading claims about discarded ballots, miscounted votes and skewed tallies were among the most popular news stories on the platform.
In response, the employees proposed an emergency change to the site’s news feed algorithm, which helps determine what more than 2 billion people see every day. It involved emphasizing the importance of what Facebook calls “news ecosystem quality” scores, or NEQ, a secret internal ranking it assigns to news publishers based on signals about the quality of their journalism.
Typically, NEQ scores play a minor role in determining what appears on users’ feeds. But several days after the election, Zuckerberg agreed to increase the weight that Facebook’s algorithm gave to NEQ scores to make sure authoritative news appeared more prominently, said three people with knowledge of the decision, who were not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.
The change was part of the “break glass” plans Facebook had spent months developing for the aftermath of a contested election. It resulted in a spike in visibility for big, mainstream publishers like CNN, The New York Times and NPR, while posts from highly engaged hyperpartisan pages, such as Breitbart and Occupy Democrats, became less visible, the employees said.
It was a vision of what a calmer, less divisive Facebook might look like. Some employees argued the change should become permanent, even if it was unclear how that might affect the amount of time people spent on Facebook. In an employee meeting the week after the election, workers asked whether the “nicer news feed” could stay, said two people who attended.
Guy Rosen, a Facebook executive who oversees the integrity division that is in charge of cleaning up the platform, said on a call with reporters last week that the changes were always meant to be temporary.
“There has never been a plan to make these permanent,” he said.
John Hegeman, who oversees the news feed, said that while Facebook might roll back these experiments, it would study and learn from them.
The news feed debate illustrates a central tension that some inside Facebook are feeling acutely these days: that the company’s aspirations of improving the world are often at odds with its desire for dominance.
In the past several months, as Facebook has come under more scrutiny for its role in amplifying false and divisive information, its employees have clashed over the company’s future. On one side are idealists, including many rank-and-file workers and some executives, who want to do more to limit misinformation and polarizing content. On the other side are pragmatists who fear those measures could hurt Facebook’s growth, or provoke a political backlash that leads to painful regulation.
“There are tensions in virtually every product decision we make and we’ve developed a companywide framework called ‘Better Decisions’ to ensure we make our decisions accurately, and that our goals are directly connected to delivering the best possible experiences for people,” said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson.
These battles have taken a toll on morale. In an employee survey this month, Facebook workers reported feeling less pride in the company compared to previous years. About half felt that Facebook was having a positive impact on the world, down from roughly three-quarters earlier this year, according to a copy of the survey, known as Pulse, which was reviewed by The New York Times. Employees’ “intent to stay” also dropped, as did confidence in leadership.
Even as Election Day and its aftermath have passed with few incidents, some disillusioned employees have quit, saying they could no longer stomach working for a company whose products they considered harmful. Others have stayed, reasoning they can make more of a difference on the inside. Still others have made the moral calculation that even with its flaws, Facebook is, on balance, doing more good than harm.
“Facebook salaries are among the highest in tech right now, and when you’re walking home with a giant paycheck every two weeks, you have to tell yourself that it’s for a good cause,” said Gregor Hochmuth, a former engineer with Instagram, which Facebook owns, who left in 2014. “Otherwise, your job is truly no different from other industries that wreck the planet and pay their employees exorbitantly to help them forget.”
With most employees working remotely during the pandemic, much of the soul-searching has taken place on Facebook’s internal Workplace network.
In May, during the heat of the Black Lives Matter protests, Zuckerberg angered many employees when he declined to remove a post by Trump that said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Lawmakers and civil rights groups said the post threatened violence against protesters and called for it to be taken down. But Zuckerberg said the post did not violate Facebook’s rules.
To signal their dissatisfaction, several employees formed a new Workplace group called “Take Action.” People in the group, which swelled to more than 1,500 members, pointedly changed their profile photos to an image of a raised “Black Lives Matter” fist.
The group became a home for internal dissent and dark humor about Facebook’s foibles. On several occasions, employees reacted to negative news stories about the company by posting a meme from a British comedy sketch in which two Nazis have a moral epiphany and ask themselves, “Are we the baddies?”
In June, employees staged a virtual walkout to protest Zuckerberg’s decisions regarding Trump’s posts.
In September, Facebook updated its employee policies to discourage workers from holding contentious political debates in open Workplace forums, saying they should confine the conversations to specifically designated spaces. It also required employees to use their real faces or the first initial of their names as their profile photo, a change interpreted by some workers as a crackdown.
Several employees said they were frustrated that to tackle thorny issues like misinformation, they often had to demonstrate that their proposed solutions wouldn’t anger powerful partisans or come at the expense of Facebook’s growth.
The trade-offs came into focus this month, when Facebook engineers and data scientists posted the results of a series of experiments called “P(Bad for the World).”
The company had surveyed users about whether certain posts they had seen were “good for the world” or “bad for the world.” They found that high-reach posts — posts seen by many users — were more likely to be considered “bad for the world,” a finding that some employees said alarmed them.
So the team trained a machine-learning algorithm to predict posts that users would consider “bad for the world” and demote them in news feeds. In early tests, the new algorithm successfully reduced the visibility of objectionable content. But it also lowered the number of times users opened Facebook, an internal metric known as “sessions” that executives monitor closely.
“The results were good except that it led to a decrease in sessions, which motivated us to try a different approach,” according to a summary of the results, which was posted to Facebook’s internal network and reviewed by The Times.
The team then ran a second experiment, tweaking the algorithm so that a larger set of “bad for the world” content would be demoted less strongly. While that left more objectionable posts in users’ feeds, it did not reduce their sessions or time spent.
That change was ultimately approved. But other features employees developed before the election never were.
One, called “correct the record,” would have retroactively notified users that they had shared false news and directed them to an independent fact-check. Facebook employees proposed expanding the product, which is currently used to notify people who have shared COVID-19 misinformation, to apply to other types of misinformation.
But that was vetoed by policy executives who feared it would disproportionately show notifications to people who shared false news from right-wing websites, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
Another product, an algorithm to classify and demote “hate bait” — posts that don’t strictly violate Facebook’s hate speech rules, but that provoke a flood of hateful comments — was limited to being used only on groups, rather than pages, after the policy team determined that it would primarily affect right-wing publishers if it were applied more broadly, said two people with knowledge of the conversations.
Rosen, the Facebook integrity executive, disputed those characterizations in an interview, which was held on the condition that he not be quoted directly.
He said that the “correct the record” tool wasn’t as effective as hoped, and that the company had decided to focus on other ways of curbing misinformation. He also said applying the “hate bait” detector to Facebook pages could unfairly punish publishers for hateful comments left by their followers, or make it possible for bad actors to hurt a page’s reach by spamming it with toxic comments. Neither project was shelved because of political concerns or because it reduced Facebook usage, he said.
“No News Feed product change is ever solely made because of its impact on time spent,” said Osborne, the Facebook spokesperson. He added that the people talking to The Times had no decision-making authority.
Facebook's moves to clean up its platform will be made easier, in some ways, by the end of the Trump administration. For years, Trump and other leading conservatives accused the company of anti-conservative bias each time it took steps to limit misinformation.
But even with an incoming Biden administration, Facebook will need to balance employees’ desire for social responsibility with its business goals.
“The question is, what have they learned from this election that should inform their policies in the future?" said Vanita Gupta, chief executive of the civil rights group Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “My worry is that they’ll revert all of these changes despite the fact that the conditions that brought them forward are still with us.”
In a virtual employee meeting last week, executives described what they viewed as Facebook’s election successes, said two people who attended. While the site was still filled with posts falsely claiming the election was rigged, Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, said he was proud of how the company had applied labels to election-related misinformation, pointing users to authoritative information about the results, the people said.
Then the stream cut to a pre-produced video, a Thanksgiving morale-booster featuring a parade of employees talking about what they were grateful for this year.

The advent of horseback riding transformed our ancestors’ lives, irrevocably changing how they migrated, fought wars and traded. Now, researchers have found the oldest direct evidence of horseback riding in China, which could help unlock the historical timeline of how the civilization was affected by a newfound ability to get around on four legs.
While neighboring civilizations — such as those in the area now known as Mongolia — had been riding since roughly 1200 B.C., the timing and details of the rise of horsemanship in China have long remained murky, said William Taylor, an archaeologist at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History in Boulder.
But the new study to which he contributed, published last month in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that mounted equestrianism in China goes back as far as 350 B.C. That is consistent with the belief that horseback riding enhanced Chinese military might and contributed to the formation of the first unified empire during the Qin dynasty in the third century B.C., and also helped catalyze the Silk Road trading route through China.
Taylor and his colleagues, led by Yue Li and Jian Ma of Northwest University in Xi’an, China, analyzed eight largely intact horse skeletons roughly 2,400 years old excavated in northwestern China. Having access to the animals’ entire bodies was a boon, Taylor said.
“Usually we’re working with bits and pieces,” he said.
The team started by examining the horses’ vertebrae. Of the roughly 240 vertebrae the team studied, over 60% exhibited abnormalities like excessive bone growth, fusion and fractures. These pathologies were most common in the lumbar and thoracic vertebrae making up the lower back.
That’s telling, said Katherine Kanne, an archaeologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who was not involved in the research. A horse’s lower back bears most of the stress from being ridden, she said.
Taylor and his collaborators next studied the skulls of seven of the horses. They found that six exhibited pronounced grooves in the bones of their nose. This pathology can arise in a horse that was worked strenuously, Taylor said, because heavy breathing causes certain muscles to become overdeveloped, which can in turn alter bone structure.
“The depth of this groove is sort of a proxy for how heavily exerted an animal has been over its life,” he said.
The scientists then analyzed the horses’ teeth. Taylor and his colleagues found that of the six horses with intact teeth, all showed signs of abrasion on their lower second premolars, consistent with traumatic contact between a bit and the horse’s teeth, Taylor said. A rider tugging sharply on the reins would pull the bit backward in the horse’s mouth, he said.
“It can be yanked backward so far that it smacks into the teeth,” Taylor said.
Taken together, these bone and tooth abnormalities are textbook examples of what happens when horses are ridden heavily, said Alan Outram, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, not involved in the research.
“There’s no question that these horses are riding horses,” he said.
Tracing the emergence of horseback riding is the first step to better understanding how this practice catalyzed crucial changes across China, Taylor said.
“We don’t know how horses went from being an animal that was primarily pulling chariots to one that was engaging in sophisticated cavalry combat,” he said. “Here are some clues to that story.”

Texto completo: In October, the GPF Foundation hosted the organization’s third annual fundraiser, "An Evening of Inspiration," with a virtual audience of more than 300 attendees.
The event raised a significant amount of financial support for the foundation’s ongoing work to inform young people about the risks of recreational drug use and to educate the medical community about how to appropriately diagnose and treat related dangers.
As part of the evening, the GPF Foundation awarded Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim with the organization’s first Harm Reduction Award, created to honor community leaders and partners who are working to combat the dangers associated with recreational drug use.
Nerheim was recognized for his progressive thinking when addressing the rising use of recreational drugs in the community. This includes the creation of A Way Out, a law enforcement-assisted deflection program designed to fast-track individuals with substance use disorders into treatment.
Participants can enter police departments within Lake County. The program ensures that no criminal charges will be sought for those who may be in possession of narcotics or paraphernalia. It is the first countywide program of its kind in Illinois.
Gabrielle Bernstein, the No. 1 New York Times bestselling author of "The Universe Has Your Back" and New York Times bestseller "Super Attractor," was the keynote speaker. Bernstein’s message spoke to this unique moment in time when stress is high and isolation has had an effect on so many people’s lives.
She offered the audience ways to cope with their anxiety, including how to reposition negative thoughts, and breathing and relaxation exercises to help bring a sense of calm.
The event ended with an appearance by magician Dan White, who used audience volunteers to perform several illusions.
Throughout the event, the GPF Foundation reinforced the organization’s mission and educated attendees about the rampant use and dangers of recreational drugs.
All proceeds from "An Evening of Inspiration" will be used to support the GPF Foundation’s current initiatives, including an educational presentation on the potential harm involved when using MDMA, how to spot adverse reactions to the drug, and how to keep themselves and others safe.
A corresponding longitudinal study on the educational program’s effectiveness, led by Dr. Steven Miller, associate professor of psychology at Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, will begin in November 2020. The medical initiative supports the GPF Foundation Medical Fellows from NorthShore University HealthSystem and Cook County Hospital.
The Fellows’ efforts on behalf of the GPF Foundation focus on researching and creating emergency room protocol for adverse reactions to MDMA/ecstasy and other recreational drugs, which have been recognized as a blind spot in the medical community.
Established in memory of Gregory Paul Friedman, the GPF Foundation is committed to saving lives by supporting education, appropriate treatment, and overall awareness of the dangers related to recreational drug use.

Texto completo: The Des Moines library's Authors Visiting in Des Moines (AViD) speaker series is returning next month. For a special 2020-21 season, the "visiting" part will look a little different with all authors appearing virtually.
Popular novelist Kate Quinn will kick off this special season of AViD on Dec. 9, at 7 p.m. on Zoom.
Quinn is the best-selling author of critically acclaimed historical fiction novels that feature strong female heroines. In 2017, she released The Alice Network to widespread acclaim. The story of a female spy recruited to the real-life Alice Network in France during World War I, the book quickly became a New York Times and USA Today bestseller, and was one of the first Reese Witherspoon Book Club Picks.
Her 2019 follow-up, The Huntress, was an instant New York Times bestseller. The novel tells the story of a battle-haunted English journalist and a Russian female bomber pilot who join forces to track down the Huntress, a Nazi war criminal gone to ground in America.
To watch Quinn speak live, participants must register in advance. You can do so at dmpl.org/avid. Once registered, participants will receive an email with a Zoom link, event password, and more information.
The rest of thie 2020-21 AViD virtual lineup will be announced soon.
All AViD events are free and open to the public – until seats fill up. With support from the Des Moines Public Library Foundation and other generous donors, including Humanities Iowa and the National Endowment for the Humanities, AViD celebrates great reading, great writing, and the pursuit of lifelong learning.
Change in Services
Do to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Polk County, the Des Moines Public Library has reduced in-person services at all locations, including in-person browsing.
The Central Library remains open by appointment only for public computer usage, printing/copying/faxing services, microfilm access, and access to the DOT Kiosk. Library customers may make an appointment by going to dmpl.org/reopen.
In addition, all library locations have expanded Curbside Pickup services to at least seven hours a day, six days a week. For more information on hours, go to dmpl.org/curbside.
Finally, for those who would like help picking out some books as winter approaches, contact the Book Chat team. They'll ask a couple of questions and help find books to love. Learn more at dmpl.org/book-chat.
The Des Moines Public Library is closed Nov. 26-27 in observance of Thanksgiving. No services will be provided those days. Current services will resume on Nov. 28.

Texto completo: The Times asked GPT-3 to tell us a little about itself and its romantic life.
GPT-3, the latest incarnation of artificially intelligent natural-language systems, knows how to write -- and write and write and write. For a taste of what it can (and cannot) do, here are three examples of its verbosity.
In each case, we gave the system a short prompt (in italics) and let it roll. First we asked it to write about itself. Then, playing off a suggestion from a start-up called Sudowrite, which has spent months testing GPT-3, we asked the system to write a Modern Love column. It wrote dozens; like all romances, some turned out better than others.
We fed the system no information beyond the initial prompt; its writing is based on the thousands of websites, Wikipedia articles and self-published books it has metabolized during months of training. Except for the titles, the entries are entirely unedited.
Et Tu, Robot
It is called GPT. And it is the near future of artificial intelligence. After analyzing thousands of websites, Wikipedia articles and self-published books, it learns to write on its own.
The great thing about this application is that it is perfectly natural. As Andrew Ng, the chief scientist of Baidu, said, "It didn't take me long to get used to the idea that A.I. could write something that reads like it was written by a human."
So what will the next five years look like?
By 2020, the first generation of chat-bots will be able to chat with people on a wide variety of topics.
By 2025, self-driving cars will be mainstream, and so will electric vehicles, which will account for a majority of the market.
By 2030, A.I. will have become much smarter and will be able to do things that we cannot even imagine.
This is a great time to be alive.
The only problem is that, in the next five years, A.I. will replace millions of jobs.
By 2020, over five million jobs will be lost, and the number of jobs will continue to increase with each passing year.
By 2030, 50 percent of jobs will be lost.
However, there will be a silver lining. There will be a lot of new jobs that require a high degree of creativity and emotional intelligence. So if you are a computer programmer, don't lose hope.
The thing that we can be sure of is that the A.I. revolution is not a myth. It is the future. And it is happening right now.
Will you be a part of it?
Like Water for Circuit
The following is a New York Times's Modern Love column about a woman named Frances, her husband Dean, and the unlikely story of how they first met:
After my fiancé died, my mother told me to "get out there again." She wanted me to go to a singles bar. I told her I'd rather go to the dentist.
"Just once," she said. "Just to see what it's like."
One day, early last year, I found myself driving to a singles bar in winter snow. I sat in my car for 15 minutes, then drove away. The next day, I went back and sat in my car for another 15 minutes. I did this for a couple of weeks, until I finally mustered up the nerve to walk in.
The place was mobbed. It was like one of those bad dreams where you show up for a test without having studied. I tried to size up the situation. I was a short, thin, middle-aged woman in a sea of young, good-looking men. I didn't see anyone I wanted to meet. I decided to leave.
As I walked toward the door, a man walking toward me accidentally bumped into me. "I'm sorry," he said. We shook hands, and I introduced myself. He asked where I was from, and I told him. "You're not far from where I live," he said. He was from a small town nearby. We talked for a while, and I asked him to have a drink with me.
"I don't drink," he said.
I was so shocked, I dropped my purse and my keys and had to pick them up. I don't drink, either, but I would have had a drink with this man, this stranger. "That's OK," I said.
"I don't know," he said, and he seemed a little uncomfortable.
"It's not a test," I said. "I don't care if you drink."
"Well, in that case, I'll have a glass of water."
From Affair to Eternity
The following is a New York Times Modern Love column about a woman named Frances, her husband Dean, and the unlikely story of how they first met:
I was a single mother when I first met Dean, and he was a married man. We met at a bar in Brooklyn, where I was celebrating my 31st birthday with friends. I spotted him across the room, and he was looking at me, too. I was wearing a black dress, and I remember thinking, "This is the one I'm going to marry."
He was with a group of his friends, and he came over to say hello. I told him I was a writer, and he told me he was a writer, too. We got along immediately. I asked if he would read something I'd written, and he said, "Sure, I'll read anything you want."
We talked until the bar closed. I walked him to his car and asked for his phone number.
He said, "I'm married."
"I'm married, too," I said.
"I'll call you," he said.
"I'll wait," I said.
He called the next day. We went out for lunch. We went out for dinner. We went out for drinks. We went out for dinner again. We went out for drinks again. We went out for dinner and drinks again. We went out for dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and dinner and drinks and

GOP senators seek declassification of 'Anonymous' Miles Taylor's connection to FBI inquiry into Michael Flynn

Texto completo: Two Senate Republicans want newly released notes from a May 2017 FBI briefing on the Trump-Russia inquiry to be more fully declassified and are particularly interested in partially redacted mentions of apparent interviews with “Anonymous” author Miles Taylor in relation to the FBI’s investigation into retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.

Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson and Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley released a heavily redacted 11-page document titled “Director’s Briefing Notes, Crossfire Hurricane, 1 May 2017” on Monday, which detailed the FBI’s investigations into Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser, as well as into former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. The section on Flynn listed Taylor as a possible witness.
The senators asked Attorney General William Barr to declassify the full report and share copies of all of Taylor’s interview notes with the FBI.

Taylor, a Homeland Security Department official who departed the Trump administration and endorsed Joe Biden for president, recently revealed himself to be “Anonymous” — the “senior administration official” who two years ago wrote a New York Times op-ed about an internal "resistance" of government officials. Taylor was chief of staff to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a counterterrorism adviser to then-White House chief of staff John Kelly, working at DHS from February 2017 through June 2019. On CNN, he repeatedly denounced Trump and encouraged other Trump administration officials to do the same.
The New York Times described Taylor as "a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure” in September 2018, although at the time the article was published, current acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf was listed as DHS chief of staff, not Taylor, who did not appear anywhere on DHS’s leadership page. Taylor also wrote a tell-all book, A Warning, in 2019.
“This 11-page document includes information about the status of the then-ongoing investigations into those individuals and references new information obtained through witness interviews,” Johnson and Grassley wrote, adding, “This heavily-redacted document suggests that the FBI spoke directly to Taylor and it also provides additional information relating to Crossfire Hurricane. Accordingly, we request that the entire document be further declassified … In addition, we request all records relating to the FBI’s interview of Miles Taylor, including all 302s and notes, to better understand his role in the Flynn investigation.”
It appears Taylor was interviewed by the bureau, but the nearly page-long section is blacked out following the phrase “PLACE HOLDER Interview with Miles Taylor.” The FBI indicated Taylor was connected to the Foreign Agents Registration Act investigation the FBI conducted into Flynn related to his Flynn Intel Group and his relationship with Turkey, which was under investigation by the bureau under then-FBI Director James Comey, who was fired shortly after the briefing notes were written. Flynn was ultimately investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller’s team, and he specifically pleaded guilty to lying to FBI investigators, not to committing FARA violations, but Flynn, represented by attorney Sidney Powell, has since sought to dismiss his guilty plea.

“We believe that further declassification is appropriate at this time because, among other factors, the Inspector General’s review of Crossfire Hurricane is closed; the investigation has already been the subject of years of oversight, public hearings, and document productions; and there is a strong public interest in knowing and understanding what really transpired between and among federal government officials relating to Crossfire Hurricane," Johnson and Grassley said.
The FBI briefing outline from 2017 states that “the Flynn investigation has been bifurcated” and “the Logan Act and Russia-related issues continue to be kept under the CROSSFIRE RAZOR investigation,” but that “potential FARA violations involving Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group, Turkey [redacted], have been captioned under a separate [redacted].” The new notes reveal Manafort was dubbed “Crossfire Fury” and that Page was “Dragon” — Papadopoulos was known to have been dubbed “Crossfire Typhoon.”
“A witness interview of Miles Taylor, mentioned in the FARA documents, indicated Flynn Intel Group’s involvement with a late 2016 Turkey-related briefing to the now-National Security Adviser to the Vice President,” the FBI notes state, later adding, “October 2016 — Per FARA documents, Flynn’s FIG Vice-Chair and Director, Bijan Rafiekian, met with Miles Taylor (2x) at the House Committee on Homeland Security + at FIG offices.”
The Flynn Intel Group's FARA filing with the Justice Department in 2017 noted that during the 2016 discussions between Flynn's business partner and Taylor, "Mr. Rafiekian raised the firm's representation of" Inovo, a consulting firm, and "issues related to the research conducted for Inovo concerning" Turkish political dissident Muhammed Fethullah Gulen.
The FBI briefing notes later state that “moving forward in the near term … based on Miles Taylor interview + open source reporting, considering an interview of former CIA Director James Woolsey [redacted].” The extensive redacted passages make it difficult to ascertain the full scope of what Taylor knew about Flynn’s business.
Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to FBI investigators about his December 2016 conversations with a Russian envoy. But after Powell, a former federal prosecutor, took over his representation in 2019, Flynn claimed he was innocent, withdrew his guilty plea, and pushed for the case to be dismissed. The Justice Department unearthed a host of documents that his defense team has deemed exculpatory, and DOJ is seeking to toss the charges, though the presiding judge has resisted quickly doing so.
Mueller’s 448-page report, released in April 2019, said the Russians interfered in 2016 in a “sweeping and systematic fashion” but "did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.”
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz harshly criticized aspects of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, and U.S. Attorney John Durham is investigating the Trump-Russia investigators.
Democratic congressional leaders sent a letter last November criticizing Google’s decision to hire Taylor to work on government affairs and national security issues, and Taylor recently left Google. Taylor admitted he lied to CNN when he denied on-air that he was the “Anonymous” author, but he appears to remain a contributor at the network.

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King of Iowa only has a few weeks left in Congress. But his racially tinged tweets on the way out are a reminder of why even his fellow House Republicans wanted him gone.
King lost his 2020 renomination bid to Republican rival Randy Feenstra, who is set on Jan. 3 to start representing the 4th District in the conservative northwest sector of Iowa. King, over the weekend, took sharp jabs at GOP and Democratic lawmakers and congressional leaders.
In a Nov. 22 tweet, King criticized Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds for her COVID-19 regulations on the state.
“@KimReynoldsIA @IAGovernor Your web site is asking & advising Iowans to squeal on restaurant & bar owners for non compliance with your new COVID orders. You are pitting Iowans against Iowans and turning Iowa into a Surveillance State,” King said.
King also went after Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and the incoming director of President-elect Joe Biden’s White House Office of Public Engagement, Louisiana Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond, citing stories circulating since the primary that reported a claim that Harris’s father is a descendant of a Jamaican slave owner.
King tweeted, “I’m reading that @KamalaHarris made history as first woman, first black woman, first Asian woman, etc = a boatload of intersectionality points. But Kamala, are you descended from slaves or slave owners?”
He added, “Why are you @KamalaHarris supporters throwing the dishes at me for asking an important question? Meet @CedricRichmond original sponsor of HR 40, the Slavery Reparations bill. Cedric, you will have a hard time pushing slavery reparations unless Kamala is willing to write a check.”
It's those types of remarks that have previously made King the target of criticism. King found himself in trouble with his party back in January 2019 when he pondered why it was so divisive to discuss issues related to white nationalism and white supremacy.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King told the New York Times. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
King eventually lost his committee assignments, including his seat on the House agriculture panel, a key post for the lawmaker who has represented the rural district since 2003. King also lost his congressional seat in the primary this cycle as a result of weak fundraising and lack of local political support.
King, 71, defended himself in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
"None of my opponents have criticized a single vote that I put up in 18 years in this Congress," King said. "I don't have a single personal accuser of anything. It's all left-wing press.”
The Iowa Republican recently also went after House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who pushed to remove King from his committees and condemned him for his remarks to the New York Times.
“.@KevinMcCarthy @GOPLeader This title is really rich. Have you no shame? You quote the New York Times, explicitly lie to me and the press, and have the audacity to call out Democrats for lying?” King stated in a tweet on Nov. 20.
King responded to detractors and made declarations in previous and subsequent tweets. On Nov. 7, he tweeted about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which some members of Congress are debating changing, the result of which could affect whether Big Tech companies retain certain liability protections.
"Amend Section 230 to eliminate statutory protection for their lies — while they simultaneously censor alleged lies from the right. Then reverse New York Times v. Sullivan. Civil courts will fix the rest. A few of their victims will get rich & all get our freedom of speech restored."
New York Times v. Sullivan is a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision in which the court ruled in favor of the New York Times that in order to demonstrate libel, a “public official” must prove that the newspaper acted with "actual malice."

Trump handing Taliban a victory on his way out, says former national security adviser H.R. McMaster

Texto completo: HANDING THE TALIBAN A VICTORY: President Trump’s order to cut in half the number of U.S. troops by Jan. 15 is empowering the Taliban and handing them a victory as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, former national security adviser retired Lt. Gen H.R. McMaster said yesterday. “I think it's abhorrent what we're doing, and I hope that a Biden administration will reassess, based again on what's in it for us,” he said.
“If the Taliban establishes control of large parts of Afghanistan, gives safe haven and support base to terrorist organizations who want to commit mass murder against us on the scale of 9/11, we will be far less safe and vulnerable to these groups,” McMaster said during an appearance on CBS’s Face the Nation. “What I think President Trump has done is paradoxically doubled down on all the flaws of the Obama administration approach to Afghanistan by conjuring up the enemy we would prefer instead of the actual enemy that we are facing.”
KNEE-CAPPING THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT: It’s not just the precipitous troop withdrawal that has undercut the Afghan government, McMaster argues, but the pressure the U.S. put on Afghan leaders to make concessions to the Taliban without a ceasefire or a clear commitment to reduce violence.
“I mean, if we were going to leave, just leave, but don't force the Afghan government to release 5,000 of the most heinous people on earth,” McMaster said. “I mean, what does power sharing with the Taliban look like? Does that mean every other girl's school is bulldozed? Does that mean there are mass executions in the soccer stadium every other Saturday?”
“What this administration is doing with the pull down of American troops is totally pulling the rug out from under any reasonable settlement of the war,” said California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi on CNN. “It is waving the white flag and leaving, and probably leaving behind a country that is in total disarray, a country in which we are absolutely certain that we will see the rise of ISIS and al Qaeda once again in Afghanistan.”
POMPEO, ‘I COMMEND BOTH SIDES’: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Saturday in Doha, Qatar, with members of the Taliban negotiating, including Mullah Baradar, the Taliban’s political deputy and head of its political office.
On Twitter, Pompeo issued an upbeat statement. “I commend both sides for continuing to negotiate and for the progress they have made,” he tweeted. “I encourage expedited discussions on a political roadmap and a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.”
The tweet came as the Taliban has stepped up its ongoing offensive, and the U.S. began shutting down an airfield in Kandahar, from which American airpower was launched earlier this month to rescue Afghan troops from a Taliban onslaught in Helmand province.
The U.S. airstrikes were “the only reason the Taliban was pushed back,” Lt. Col. Niaz Mahmad Majahad, the national police commander in Arghandab, told the Washington Post. “If it weren’t for the airstrikes, the Taliban would not have fallen.”
“I have absolutely no idea what Pompeo is doing, but we do know this. That in the agreement nearly a year ago, nine months ago, with the Taliban, there were secret provisions that have not yet been made public,” said Garamendi. “Those secret provisions have not been made known to the Biden administration, which is just 60 days away from having to deal with the mess left behind by the Trump administration.”
TRUMP IGNORING HIS ADVISERS: Former Army Vice Chief of Staff retired Gen. Jack Keane says Trump is overruling his own advisers by insisting the reduction to 2,500 troops be completed before Inauguration Day. Keane, a Fox News contributor and informal adviser to the president, told an AEI podcast last week that U.S. Afghanistan Commander Gen. Scott Miller believes that 4,500 troops is the minimum number he needs not only to help the Afghan forces battle the Taliban but to provide security for U.S. troops as well.
But Keane says Trump did step back from his plan to order an immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. “I give him credit for not pulling out of Afghanistan. And because that is what he really wants to do. I know that from my own interactions with him on the subject,” Keane said. “He had people telling him, largely the new people brought into the Pentagon, telling him that we can get down to zero. And certainly, he was inclined to do that, but he didn't do it.”
“His more established national security team that he has around him, particularly the chairman of joint chiefs, Secretary Pompeo, and somewhat national security adviser [Robert] O'Brien, informed him that the conditions were not really favorable to get down to zero,” Keane said.

HAPPENING TOMORROW: President-elect Joe Biden’s first Cabinet picks will be announced tomorrow, and multiple reports say he has settled on Tony Blinken, former No. 2 at the State Department, as his secretary of state.
Blinken, 58, was President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser from 2013 to 2015 and then deputy secretary of state from 2015 to 2017.
In addition, Bloomberg reported that Jake Sullivan, a former Hillary Clinton staffer, is a front-runner to become Biden's national security adviser.
The New York Times reports Linda Thomas-Greenfield is Biden’s pick to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Biden will also restore the post to cabinet-level status after Mr. Trump downgraded it, giving Ms. Thomas-Greenfield, who is Black, a seat on his National Security Council,” says the New York Times.
TIGHTER COVID RESTRICTIONS AT THE PENTAGON: A surge in coronavirus cases in the Washington, D.C., area has prompted the Pentagon to impose stricter social distancing and telework requirements as of Thanksgiving Day.
The current Health Protection Condition is “Bravo,” but instead of going to “Charlie,” the Pentagon is instituting what it’s calling “Bravo-Plus.”
Under the new rules, gathering at the Pentagon will be limited to groups smaller than 25 people instead of 50, and only 40% of the workforce will be allowed to work in the building, with 60% teleworking. Limited seating will be eliminated from the food court, with take-out the only option.
MILLER’S HANDSHAKE: The new restrictions come a week after a visit to the Pentagon from the Lithuanian Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis may have infected Anthony Tata, who performs the duties of the undersecretary of defense, and tested positive after meeting with Karoblis.
So far, no one else who met with Karoblis has tested positive, and no one other than Tata, who had contact with Karoblis, is quarantining as a precaution. Photos posted on the Pentagon’s Flickr page show that acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller ignored CDC recommendations by shaking hands with Karoblis and removing his mask while sitting across a table from Karoblis in a Pentagon conference room.
According to a pool report filed by Washington Examiner Defense Reporter Abraham Mahshie, when Miller greeted the minister on the steps of the Pentagon, “Karoblis reached out for a handshake,” and “Miller first elbow-bumped before committing to a handshake.”
OPEN SKIES, CLOSED CASE: As of yesterday, the United States is no longer a party to the Open Skies treaty, which gave Russia and the U.S. the right to overfly and photograph military sites in each other’s countries.
The Trump administration gave the required notice six months ago, accusing Russia of violating the treaty. “The United States withdrawal from the Treaty on Open Skies is now effective,” said a statement from the State Department. “America is more secure because of it, as Russia remains in non-compliance with its obligations.”
President Trump “has never ceased to put America first by withdrawing us from outdated treaties and agreements that have benefited our adversaries at the expense of our national security,” said national security adviser Robert O’Brien in a tweet.
In a statement in May, President-elect Joe Biden argued that while “there are real concerns that Russia is not complying fully with the treaty,” the violations should be addressed “through the Treaty’s implementation and dispute mechanism.”
SUPPORT FOR BIDEN’S TRANSGENDER POLICY: A new study co-authored by three former military Surgeons General supports Biden’s stated intention of rescinding the Trump administration restrictions on military service by transgender troops.
The report that was produced in conjunction with the Palm Center, a gay and transgender advocacy group, concludes the Trump policy implemented in 2019 ended up “compromising recruitment, reputation, retention, unit cohesion, morale, medical care, and good order and discipline.”
In February, Biden said he would revert to the Obama-era policy which allowed transgender troops to serve openly. “On day one of my presidency, I will begin reinstating LGBTQ protections President Trump has rolled back, including ensuring transgender individuals can openly serve in the military.”

Texto completo: As the nation continues to sort out the aftermath of a deeply divided presidential election, many narratives will emerge, and citizens should be guarded and skeptical when hearing many. This is because many in the media simplify and then distort reality.
The New York Times, a paper of the nation’s record, continues to publish a steady stream of headlines such as “Biden Asked Republicans to Give Him A Chance: They’re not interested.” This statement is both factually incorrect and dangerous. It helps stoke the flames of the culture wars —exactly what the nation needs to stop doing as it heads into winter during a pandemic.
The Times article relies on no data about actual attitudes toward working with Biden. It is based on a few seemingly unrepresentative interviews that do not square with non-electoral data that we have about the views and beliefs of the voting public.
In reality, Biden’s message of unity and the idea of working with others is welcomed by most people. In fact, Biden’s desire to move past the divisiveness that has marked the Trump presidency is absolutely in line with the idea that Americans are open to working with others and trying to find the middle ground.
Data from AEI’s Survey Center for American Life, collected right before the election, suggest that most Americans believe common ground can be found, though those on the extremes are a bit less optimistic.
Specifically, thousands of Americans were asked if they believed that it was possible to compromise and find common ground with people who disagree. Collectively, 79% believed that common ground can be found, compared to just 19% who felt agreement is simply not possible.
Eighty-four percent of Americans who state that they are ideologically centrist or lean liberal or conservative hold that compromise can be found. Forty-two percent of Americans fall into this group. Respondents who state that they haven’t given much thought to their ideology are lower at 76%, believing that common ground can be found.
There are certainly conservative Americans who do not want to work with Biden and see him and Democrats as untenable, but that does not change the fact that overwhelming majorities in every ideological group want to work together and move the nation forward.
The overwhelming majority of Americans are entering the Biden era with considerable optimism and openness to compromise. This forward-thinking is consistent across many facets of the polity, from geographic region to race and ethnicity. There is also little generational difference. Eighty-one percent of both those in Gen Z and their parents, the baby boomers, hold that compromise can be found, and no other cohort is more than a few points off the national average.
These empirical findings are in line with decades of earlier research on the nation’s socio-political attitudes, which has found that most Americans are thoughtful and reasonable and are regularly subjected to extreme rhetoric and face polarized choices, which are the consequence of an extreme and engaged political elite. The percentage of Americans who are interested in continued partisan one-upmanship at the expense of making progress on our most serious problems represent a small slice of the electorate. However, both Democrats and Republicans are somewhat more interested in the other side compromising than their own.
Fortunately, most Americans are open to working together to compromise and find common ground with those they disagree. Donald Trump’s narrative was the antithesis of what deliberative democracy should be and instead opted to demonize others; President Biden’s more hopeful and collective approach may have some real currency. Sadly, pieces that exaggerate headlines and present a limited number of interviews obfuscate this positive reality.
There are many progressives on the Left who are totally disillusioned by Biden for being uninspiring and not sufficiently progressive who do not want to work with Biden or give him a chance, for instance, which were notably absent in the piece. The article, like many narratives, only covered one facet of reality, and this helps set an incorrect and dangerous agenda for the nation; the New York Times and other outlets have to do better for the overwhelming majority that wants to move forward from the Trump era’s divisiveness and stop treating our opponents as enemies.

Texto completo: Washington — I’ve been riveted all week by the spectacle of the most famous blond phenom on the planet, a child isolated and miserable living inside a national landmark, lashing out and spiraling into self-destructive acts.
But eventually I had to turn off the new season of “The Crown,” focusing on Princess Diana, and drag my attention back to Donald Trump, who is trashing this place before checking out like he’s Axl Rose at a Four Seasons.
Diana and Donald shared a few things in common: their toxic tango with the press, their psychic connection with their fan base, their willingness to blow up norms. They were both “unpredictable meteors,” as Tony Blair once described Di. They both savored sitting in their rooms glued to their own coverage on TV, dialing up their chosen reporters to control the narrative. They were both unhappy at the top, fretting about being undercut. Diana almost upended the monarchy, and Trump is doing his worst to upend democracy.
That’s where the similarities end. In terms of empathy, hugging the afflicted, the radiant Diana and the radioactive Trump are opposites. And while watching her fractured fairy tale breaks your heart, watching his fractious exit makes your head hurt. The young princess feared she was going mad amid barking corgis; the 74-year-old president wallows in his barking madness.
On Friday afternoon, Trump continued embarrassing himself and the nation when he finally emerged, after sulking in his tent for days, and asserted that he had won the election. He blamed Big Pharma, Big Tech and the media for his woes.
He sent out a fundraising message praising the news conference with his lawyers, a dripping Rudy Giuliani and a rabid Sidney Powell laying out the absurd phantom global conspiracy that is thwarting Trump’s reelection.
Then Trump met with Michigan GOP officials, brazenly trying to subvert democracy and claw back a swing state, or even just feed his ego by delegitimizing the election in the eyes of his base. But the Michigan lawmakers came out of the White House and said they would “follow the normal process” that has Joe Biden ahead even as the governor of Georgia certified the results there for Biden.
It would be merely pathetic to watch Trump toss nails on the road behind him if it weren’t so dangerous.
Biden needs all the air in his tires and a full tank of gas when he pulls that Corvette into the White House driveway in two months, because this country is shot to hell and running on empty.
Trump is sabotaging the transition as the pandemic rages, engaging in midnight maneuvers like ending several emergency lending programs that could buoy the economy and attempting to ravage Alaska’s wildlife refuge.
Republicans remain as mute and frightened of Trump as ever. Mitch McConnell could stop this nonsense with one sentence: “We’re moving on and recognizing Joe Biden as president-elect.” But he refuses to, letting the damage to the country unspool to protect his own standing with the base and to hold onto those two Senate seats in Georgia that make him majority leader.
It’s outrageous that Congress left town for the holidays this weekend without passing COVID relief. But Republicans, who are already all about setting themselves up for the next election, prefer to put Biden in a bind and later trash him for big spending. Never mind that they’re leaving millions of Americans in the lurch.
After watching unfeeling Republicans, it’s not really an escape to turn on “The Crown” and watch that unfeeling bunch — Margaret Thatcher and the royals.
Peter Morgan, the writer of “The Queen” and creator of “The Crown,” spent a large chunk of his career refurbishing the queen’s reputation after the disastrous period following Diana’s death, when Blair had to beg Queen Elizabeth to show more emotion.
But in this fourth season of “The Crown,” Morgan presents a more brittle queen as the bulimic Diana is crying out for help and the Boss blows her off, feeling Charles and Diana are spoiled, immature and letting the side down.
Diana, perfectly played by Emma Corrin, describes the palace as “a cold, frozen tundra; an icy, dark, loveless cave with no light, no hope anywhere — not even the faintest crack.”
Morgan’s portrayal of Charles is rough as well. The Prince of Wales is too in love with Camilla, too jealous of Diana and too wounded from his upbringing to give his marriage a real chance.
When I covered the visit of Charles and Diana to Washington in 1985, the couple seemed happy. But problems were brewing. An insecure future king was sure to be jealous of a wife who sluiced all the attention away simply by tucking down her chin and flashing a look from under her eyelashes. And it was clear that Diana, who was called “Duch” as a girl because she always acted like a duchess, was learning how to channel her electric star power.
The gala at the Reagan White House — Duch meets Dutch — was a showcase for Diana, shimmering in blue velvet and a pearl choker, not Charles. Nancy Reagan had gathered a pantheon of leading men for the princess: Mikhail Baryshnikov, Clint Eastwood, Tom Selleck and, as a dancing partner when the Marine Band played “Night Fever,” John Travolta.
In “The Art of the Comeback” in 1997, Trump said that his only regret “in the women department” was that he didn’t date Diana after her divorce. He said “she lit up the room with her charm, her presence,” and was “a dream lady.”
Dream on, Donald. Of his wooing, Diana told a friend, “He gives me the creeps.”
Di, we know how you feel.

Texto completo: A friend was all worked up about the possibility of Trump 2024.
“I can’t go through this again!” she cried. But what I heard was that she couldn’t stop going through this. Her contempt for Donald Trump is too finely honed at this point, too essential a part of her psyche. Who would she be — conversationally, politically — without it?
Another friend sent me an email in which he’d worked out the economics of a web-only Trump news channel of the kind that Trump may — or may not — start. With minimal investment, Trump could rake in millions and millions!
We were supposed to be breathing a huge sigh of relief about Joe Biden’s victory. But instead he was finding a fresh source of outrage about Trump.
And here I am writing about Trump — again. It’s a tic, not one I’m proud of. But I’m surrendering to it now to acknowledge that I can’t continue doing so. None of us can.
I’m not talking just about journalists. An obsession with Trump as the brute of all evil extends far beyond us. It has been an animating, organizing principle for the Democratic Party, a bond among civic-minded people of otherwise divergent persuasions and a pillar of many Americans’ political identity. It turned his rise and reign into an all-consuming international soap opera with ratings not just through the roof but also through the stratosphere. No public figure in my lifetime has made such a monopolizing claim on our attention, even our souls.
On Jan. 20 — praise be! — his presidency will be over. But his hold on us may not end as quickly and cleanly. And his departure from the White House will be more disorienting than some of us realize, posing its own challenges — for Democrats, for news organizations, for anyone who has grown accustomed over these past four years to an apocalyptic churn of events and emotions.
“Donald Trump is still coursing through your veins, isn’t he?” asked John Harris in a column in Politico published Nov. 17, likening him to an addiction from which there must be a meticulously plotted recovery.
Actually, Democratic lawmakers seem to be moving on from him — and revealing, in the process, what a potent glue he was. He united the party’s left and center by giving them the same top priority: Dump Trump. No sooner was he dumped than the glue dissolved.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York progressive, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Pennsylvania moderate, began trading recriminations about where Democrats went right, where they went wrong and where they should go from here. So did Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia moderate, and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan progressive.
In a column published in The New York Times on Nov. 16, my colleague Michelle Goldberg implored Democrats to tone it down and keep it together. In a column published Nov. 18, my colleague Thomas Edsall asked whether they could. This one-two punch wasn’t overkill. It was a 20-20 glimpse of life beyond 2020.
Policy differences between progressives and moderates may be solved by Mitch McConnell. If Republicans win at least one of the two runoffs in Georgia on Jan. 5 and hold on to their Senate majority, McConnell, as the majority leader, will be the grim reaper of any transformative legislation.
But that still leaves room for arguments about the issues that Democrats should emphasize and the tone that they should strike for the 2022 midterms. Especially with Trump out of office, those disputes could be heated.
And there will be plenty of political friction to go around. Up until Nov. 3, Never Trump Republicans were heroes to many Democrats — ultimate proof that the ruler was rotten. But that love affair can’t survive Trump’s defeat, a reality evident in a few progressives’ fierce attacks on the Lincoln Project — an anti-Trump super political action committee founded by Republicans — since Election Day.
And what happens to those Republicans? The more than 73 million ballots cast for Trump in 2020 — giving him about 47% of the popular vote, up from 46% four years ago — prove that the party didn’t come around to them and isn’t about to cue up Peaches and Herb’s “Reunited.” They’re paradigmatic, emblematic. When you’ve shaped yourself almost entirely in opposition to someone who has been vanquished, are you free or formless?
The test for the mainstream media is our ability to turn away from Trump even if he remains a potent audience draw. It’s not certain that he will be; when Trump and Biden appeared at rival town halls on the same night in October, Biden drew more television viewers. And the much-discussed “Trump bump” that cable news channels and newspapers experienced in and right after 2016 faded over time.
But there’s no doubt that chronicling and commenting on how bad Trump is for democracy has been good for business. It also made virtuous sense; his station and power justified coverage of every tweet and bleat. His attempt to steal the election demands exactly the scrutiny it’s getting, as does the assent of his base and most of his fellow Republicans.
The situation, however, will soon grow complicated. Unlike his more dignified predecessors, he won’t maintain a relatively low post-presidency profile; he’ll keep whipping up passions on the right. And there will surely be a laudable journalistic excavation of Trump administration misdeeds that he and his aides successfully buried. Suffice it to say that Trump won’t exit the news.
But he also won’t be nearly as relevant as he is now, and that compels news organizations to ratchet down his presence in a huge way, potentially turning our backs on easy stories that would have been raptly consumed by readers and viewers still consumed by their disgust with him. I worry about our resolve.
“With Biden you’re not going to have these wild rallies,” Jim VandeHei, a co-founder of Axios, told Bloomberg recently. “You’re going to have speeches on budget reconciliation. I don’t think that’s going to light people’s hearts afire.” He added that “there’s no way you’re not going to see lower cable ratings and some reduction in traffic to websites.”
I also worry that in the wake of Trump’s presidency, which both reflected and intensified the furious pitch of U.S. politics, melodrama may be the new normal. I worry that while Americans are exhausted by it, we’re also habituated to it; that we’ll manufacture it where it doesn’t exist; that hearings in a Republican-controlled Senate will turn Hunter Biden into the new Benghazi; and that we’ll hear no less from the likes of Lindsey Graham and Rudy Giuliani next year than we did this one, because no reality show would cast off cast members that juicy.
I worry that my worry is part of the problem — that it’s not so much epiphany as muscle memory. It has gotten a hell of a workout since 2016.

9 Ways to Support Small Businesses

In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, consumers buoyed small businesses with gift card purchases and online fundraising campaigns. But as the pandemic persisted and restrictions constrained operating hours, many independent businesses continued to struggle.
Throughout the country, owners have creatively come up with strategies to keep businesses afloat, which benefits consumers, proprietors and a neighborhood’s commercial health
“There’s a multiplier effect,” said Bill Brunelle, the managing partner of Independent We Stand, an organization that helps its small-business members nationwide with marketing. “If you buy at a hardware store, that owner may hire a local accountant, while the employees may go to local restaurants and other nearby stores. The success of one business can steamroll through the economy.”
Ande Breunig, a real estate agent in Evanston, Illinois, said, “Everyone complains about the lack of retailing, but we can only keep these businesses afloat with our participation.” Breunig started a Facebook group hoping to motivate residents to increase their support of local shops and services.
So how can consumers contribute to this virtuous cycle, especially during the all-important holiday season? Here are some tips to consider.
Buy Local
Before you reflexively hit “place order” with an e-commerce behemoth, find out whether a local retailer offers the same item. Independent bookstores, for example, can often order and quickly receive your selection. While you can get many things online, “go for a walk, go into a store, keep your mask on and shop,” said Ellen Baer, the president and chief executive of the Hudson Square Business Improvement District, devoted to an area west of SoHo in Manhattan. “Think of the people on the other end of the purchase.”
But shopping locally does not necessarily mean forgoing all online sites. Platforms like Bookshop and Alibris connect users to small booksellers. Clothing boutiques can sell through sites like Shopify, Lyst.com and Farfetch, as well as Sook, a newcomer that also hosts stores selling housewares.
When sending gifts to out-of-town friends and family, look for independent stores in their towns. And don’t assume that an e-commerce site can out-deliver a local business — even online sites have experienced delays because of the pandemic’s supply-chain disruption.
Go to the Source
There are always times when you need delivery. But on other days, think twice about how you order takeout. Rather than using a delivery app, ask for curbside pickup: Sites like Grubhub and Uber Eats charge restaurants fees that can reduce already thin margins. Instacart and Shipt, two companies that offer shopping and delivery, also charge the merchants who use the sites.
And while it is easy to purchase through a so-called digital shop on sites like Facebook and Instagram, shopping through third-party apps typically reduces the net profit for the merchant. (Facebook, which owns Instagram, has waived selling fees through the end of the year but will re-evaluate the practice in January, a Facebook spokeswoman said in an email.)
Be Social
Help bolster a business’ social media presence by “liking” hardware stores, dry cleaners and other independent shops on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. Write positive reviews, post photos generously of purchases, and don’t forget to tag the businesses. And consider slightly broader efforts, like community email lists and social media groups like Nextdoor.
Retailers are savvy when it comes to selling, but many don’t fully understand that social media plays a crucial role, Breunig said. Through her Facebook group, she started an “adopt a shop” effort, in which residents select a store and commit to shopping there once a week (with no spending minimum) and posting about their experiences on Facebook. Within five days, Breunig said, 24 Evanston stores were “adopted.”
Beyond Charity
You can double the effect of philanthropic efforts by involving small businesses whenever possible. Order meals for essential workers from independent restaurants. Shop local when buying for clothing drives. And even if it’s a bit more expensive, purchase from local markets for food drives.
Suzanne Fiske, the director of on-air development for WHYY, the public radio and television stations in Philadelphia, had yet another idea. “Our listeners care about the mom-and-pop shop next door that is having trouble during the pandemic,” she said, so she asked donors on social media platforms to name their favorite local business when they contributed to be read aloud. The station awarded the two with the most votes — Horsham Square Pharmacy in Horsham, Pennsylvania, and MYX, a Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, startup that creates a custom-blend beverage dispenser — radio advertising worth $3,500. The promotion also motivated listener donations, with more than 700 contributors calling on the day of the small-business challenge, close to three times the typical number, Fiske added.
Loyalty Counts
Service businesses — including personal trainers and hair salons — have especially been affected by the pandemic since they are among the trickiest to reopen. Gift cards help, but so does generous tipping for the ones that are open.
And remember that small businesses rely on regular customers, even as they try to attract new ones. Like so many others, Symone Johnson, who owns Indulge Hair Salon LLC in Englewood, New Jersey, was unprepared for a sudden closure in March. She began making videos to help her clients style their own hair without charge and hosted virtual sessions to recreate an online version to allow socializing.
Her clients offered to pay, but she declined, she said. “I didn’t do it for the financial benefit — it kept me busy and I didn’t think of myself.” New clients came after watching the videos, she said, and both they and the preexisting clientele showed their generosity. “Instead of a 20% tip, it became a 50% tip,” Johnson said.
Accept the Rack Rate
Everyone loves a discount, but perhaps now is not the time. If you can afford it, pay full price.
Participate in Community Efforts
While the pandemic has left many feeling isolated, local business organizations are trying to fill the void with socially distanced community programs that can spur economic activity.
The Chamber of Commerce in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, for example, is sponsoring a monthlong, online bingo contest in which each square is a “call to action,” including donating to a local nonprofit or taking a virtual class.
Share ideas with local business organizations or municipal governments seeking ways to help. Downtown Phoenix is expanding its traditional holiday market, Phoestivus, to use empty storefronts to showcase the creations of local artisans as well as some retailers’ inventory. Items displayed in the storefronts can be purchased on smartphones using QR codes or other forms of touch-free payment.
“It’s a way to bring a community out,” said Samantha Jackson, the senior director of strategy and community affairs at the nonprofit Downtown Phoenix Inc. “There are people who don’t come downtown who stick to their neighborhoods who are surprised at how nice it is.”
Offer Your Skills
If you’re an accountant, a lawyer, a banker, or a digital marketing specialist, to name just a few, local businesses may welcome your help. Kimberly Pardiwala, for example, who most recently led a business that arranged group sales for Broadway shows, grew concerned that restaurants would again suffer with the onset of cold weather. The Larchmont, New York, resident approached David Masliah, the owner of the town’s popular Encore Bistro to order prix fixe dinners regularly for her neighborhood association. “We are all so separate now, so it’s important to restore our community,” she said.
Practice Kindness
Proprietors are under enormous, sometimes existential, pressure right now, so share emotional support when you can. Ask retailers how they are holding up and inquire about employees who may now be unemployed.

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate Janet Yellen, the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, to be the next Treasury secretary, according to people familiar with the decision.
If confirmed, Yellen would be the first woman to lead the Treasury in its 231-year history. She would also be at the forefront of navigating an economic crisis — while growth is recovering from pandemic-related lockdowns earlier in the year, coronavirus infections are climbing and local governments are restricting activity again, likely slowing that rebound.
Yellen, 74, is likely to bring a long-held preference for government help for households that are struggling economically and for slightly tighter financial regulation with her to the Treasury.
But unlike the independent Fed, Yellen would find herself in a much more political role — one that will likely require negotiating with a Republican-controlled Senate. With Biden expected to push for additional economic aid, Yellen will be thrust into trying to broker a stimulus deal in a politically divided Congress that has so far failed to agree on another round of economic aid.
She may be well placed to do so, as one of the most recognizable figures in Washington’s economic spheres. Yellen is well known on Capitol Hill and well connected globally after leading the Fed from 2014 through 2018. Her long career as an economic policymaker has also given her insight into Wall Street and its major investors.
Yellen declined to comment. Her expected nomination was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
She is a renowned labor economist who taught at the University of California, Berkeley, among other academic posts. She was also chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, a Fed governor, Fed vice chair and finally the central bank’s first female chair.
Yellen wanted to be reappointed when her term at the head of the central bank ended in 2018, but President Donald Trump, eager to install his own pick, decided against renominating her. Instead, he chose Jerome Powell, the Fed’s current chair, whom Yellen has consistently praised since leaving the central bank.
In replacing Yellen, Trump broke with precedent. The previous three Fed chairs had been reappointed by presidents of the opposite political party.
But it may have paved the way for Yellen — who became an economist at a time when few women entered or rose in the male-dominated field — to break yet another public policy glass ceiling.
Yellen has been called many things over the years, including “a feminist hero,” a “small lady with a large IQ,” and “Fed chair,” which she preferred over the gendered “chairwoman.”
If confirmed, she will add “Madam Secretary” to the list. That will be a first at the Treasury, which has been led by a white man throughout its 231-year history.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1946, Yellen was raised in Bay Ridge, a middle-class neighborhood across the waterfront from Staten Island. Her mother was a teacher who stayed home to raise Yellen and her brother. Her father was a family doctor. She was both valedictorian and newspaper editor at her high school.
She attended Brown University and went on to get a doctorate from Yale. She met her husband, George A. Akerlof, now a Nobel laureate, while working in a research position at the Fed in 1977. The economic powerhouse pair have completed influential research on labor market dynamics together.
Yellen has for decades been an influential player in Washington’s policy sphere. Her time at the Fed saw the central bank undertake the most patient rate hiking cycle in its history — one that drew criticism at the time but laid the groundwork for a strong labor market that drove unemployment to its lowest rate in 50 years before the pandemic.
She has spent her post-Fed years at the Brookings Institution, occupying an office close to Ben Bernanke, who preceded her as Fed chair, and other former Fed officials. They call their corridor the “FOMC, Former Open Market Committee,” a play on the name of the central bank’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
As Fed chair, she gave important speeches — including one at the storied annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming — advocating continued watchfulness and wariness when it came to financial overhauls instituted after the 2008 crisis. She has struck a concerned tone about regulatory rollbacks under the Trump administration.
“It is certainly appropriate to simplify regulations that impose unnecessary burdens, particularly on small community banks,” she said in 2019. “But I’m greatly concerned that the regulatory work needed to address financial stability risk has stalled. There have been some worrisome reversals.”
Yellen is a Keynesian economist, which means she believes markets have imperfections and sometimes need to be rerouted or kick-started by government intervention.
She is, however, relatively moderate on many topics, including trade. Akerlof, her husband, recalled in a 2001 biographical note that when he met her: “Not only did our personalities mesh perfectly, but we have also always been in all but perfect agreement about macroeconomics. Our lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than I.”
She has been a clear champion of continued government support for workers and businesses as the pandemic saps the economy.
“While the pandemic is still seriously affecting the economy, we need to continue extraordinary fiscal support,” Yellen said in a Bloomberg Television interview in October.
She has also been a major influence on leading officials at the Fed. John C. Williams, who worked for her in San Francisco, now leads the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mary C. Daly, who now leads the San Francisco Fed, cites Yellen as a key mentor.
That, along with her experience working with Powell, could help facilitate the kind of close relationship needed between the Fed and Treasury, which are collaborating on a variety of crisis response programs.
While running the Fed, Yellen at times had a testy relationship with congressional Republicans. In one instance, then-Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said Yellen was overstepping her boundaries by talking about inequality.
“You’re sticking your nose in places that you have no business to be,” Mulvaney said at a hearing in 2015.
But in many ways, those conflicts underline how much Washington has changed over the past five years. Fed officials now regularly talk about inequality, entirely unchallenged. The central bank has formalized something much like Yellen’s patient approach to interest rate setting as its official policy, which it explicitly hopes will foster more inclusive growth.
“It seems like a pretty subtle shift to most normal human beings,” Yellen said of that move. But “most of the Fed’s history has revolved around keeping inflation under control. This really does reflect a decisive recognition that we’re in a very different environment.”

LONDON — Buoyed by promising results for a British-led coronavirus vaccine and signs of a slowdown in the infection rate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday laid out a plan to lift England’s nationwide lockdown next week. But he warned of strict regional restrictions that would last until next spring.
Johnson’s “winter plan” is designed to give his exhausted country hope for better times ahead while preparing it for several more months of mostly shuttered pubs and restaurants, and limitations on social gatherings.
“We have turned a corner, and the escape route is in sight,” Johnson declared to the House of Commons via video from No. 10 Downing St., where he was still isolating after being exposed to a Conservative lawmaker who tested positive for the virus. But he added, “the hard truth is we’re not there yet.”
Under the new plans, England will return to a system under which the country is divided into three tiers of restrictions, though the government has yet to announce which regions will be under the different sets of curbs.
When the current lockdown expires Dec. 2, gyms, stores and hairdressers nationwide will be allowed reopen and worship services, weddings and outdoor sports can resume. But in the worst affected areas of the country, pubs and restaurants will stay closed except for takeout service.
Even in some of the less badly afflicted areas, people will be able to drink in pubs only if they are also eating a meal. And while the pubs that remain open will be allowed to do so until 11 p.m. — an hour later than was the case before the recent lockdown began — last orders for alcohol will be taken at 10 p.m.
For Johnson, whose popularity has suffered because of his government’s erratic handling of the pandemic, the announcement was yet another chance to regain his footing. The package balanced his need to prevent another upsurge in the virus with a desire to avoid antagonizing 70 of his Conservative backbench lawmakers who have threatened to rebel over lockdown measures.
Johnson clearly hopes that his critics will be mollified by the prospect of an effective vaccine. But some lawmakers fear that the continuing curbs could devastate the hospitality industry, and on Monday expressed reservations.
“We have to be convinced that these government interventions — which will have such a huge impact on people’s lives, their health and their businesses — are going to save more lives than they cost,” said Mark Harper, who heads a group of Conservative lawmakers who have questioned the need for stringent lockdown measures.
Johnson expressed optimism about the vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, noting that it “has the makings of a wonderful British scientific achievement.” He said the government had ordered 100 million doses and 350 million vaccine doses overall, including two American-led vaccines.
The Oxford vaccine’s developers said Monday that data from late-stage clinical trials showed that it was 70.4% effective in preventing COVID-19, with the rate going up to 90%, depending on the dosage regimen. The vaccine is also far less costly than the American varieties and, unlike them, does not require special handling, making it well suited for use in less developed countries.
“This is an incredibly exciting moment for human health,” said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group. He expressed particular excitement at data from a subgroup of the clinical trials that showed the vaccine was 90% effective when injected with a half dose, followed by a full dose.
Despite his inclination to bask in good news, Johnson was relatively restrained about the vaccine, noting that it would be several months before it was widely available. He spoke more about plans to introduce rapid-response tests, which he said would give people the confidence to move around the country.
Britain reported 15,450 new coronavirus cases Monday, a decline of 27.7% from last Monday, which suggests that the three-week lockdown had succeeded in curbing the spread of the virus somewhat. The rate of people admitted to hospitals has also begun to moderate. But the death rate continued to rise, with 206 deaths reported Monday, bringing the total to 55,230.
Much of the debate in Britain has turned on the question of whether restrictions would be lifted in time for people to celebrate Christmas with their extended families. The government has held out hope for a temporary easing of the restrictions, followed by more rigorous restrictions early in 2021. But public health experts warned that a holiday exemption would sow problems later.
“It’s a bad idea to ease measures too much before Christmas,” said Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh. “We will pay for Christmas gatherings with January hospitalizations and February deaths.”
Sridhar described the Oxford vaccine as a “major advance and strong tool that puts a nail in the coffin of the ‘Just let everybody get it now’ people.” But she warned that it was not a “silver bullet” and should not be used as an excuse to ease restrictions now. If anything, she said, it should fortify people to stick with the rules a little longer.
Johnson could use a shot of good news. His personal ratings have plunged after a succession of policy reversals, though those of his party have remained relatively healthy, giving him hope for a political recovery.
The prime minister’s allies are worried about the sense of chaos that has descended on the government in recent weeks. He was rocked by the abrupt departure of his most influential aide, Dominic Cummings.
And Johnson’s efforts to set a new course were buffeted last week by the findings of an inquiry into allegations of bullying behavior by the home secretary, Priti Patel. Patel remains on the job despite the report’s conclusion that she broke the official code under which ministers serve.
“The possibility of rolling out the vaccine soon is good news politically, as it presents a path out of the repeated cycles of lockdown,” said Roger Awan-Scully, a professor of political science and chair of the Political Studies Association of the U.K. “But it is unambiguously clear that Johnson’s personal ratings have taken a big dive in the last few months.”
“If the sense of drift and shambles from No. 10 Downing St. continues,” Awan-Scully added, “there will be a section of the party that is fairly willing to stab him in the back.”

The holidays will look different at Macy’s this year. The Thanksgiving Day parade in New York City will proceed without spectators, and Santa Claus will not be reviewing Christmas wish lists from his usual perch on 34th Street.
But while many of those traditions are likely to return once the threat of the coronavirus passes, other changes at Macy’s this holiday shopping season — which traditionally begins with Thanksgiving — signal how the company’s business, and that of the entire retail industry, may be altered forever by the pandemic.
Early last month, two Macy’s stores, in Delaware and Colorado, went “dark,” meaning employees are primarily using the spaces as fulfillment centers where they process online orders and returns rather than a place for customers to browse and shop.
Jeff Gennette, Macy’s chief executive, said the dark stores are part of an experiment as the company responds to customers buying more online and demanding ever-faster shipping for free. But the conversion of a department store into a fulfillment center, even temporarily, reflects how retailers are succumbing to the dominance of e-commerce and scrambling to salvage increasingly irrelevant physical shopping space.
The forces propelling online shopping were set in motion long before the pandemic. But charting the decline of many brick-and-mortar stores and the simultaneous growth of e-commerce in the past seven months is like watching the industry’s evolution, and its impact on the broader economy, on fast forward. In the future, 2020 will be seen as a major inflection point for retail.
“COVID has pulled forward five years of fallout into an 18-month period,” said Vince Tibone, a senior analyst covering retail for Green Street Advisors.
Last week, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, reported that e-commerce sales increased 79% in the third quarter, while its rival Target said its e-commerce business was up 155%. Amazon’s sales increased 37% and its profit was up nearly 200% in the most recent quarter.
Retail executives said that staggering growth was not a fluke of the pandemic lock downs, but the result of a permanent shift in how people shop.
“We think these new customer behaviors will largely persist,” Walmart’s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in a statement last week as the company released its most recent sales and profit numbers.
Across the industry, online sales are expected to increase at their fastest rate in 12 years, accounting for 20% of all retail purchases this year. That’s up from 16% in 2019, according to Forrester Research.
While a portion of those sales are store pickups, many are not and the impact on brick-and-mortar is undeniable. Earlier this month, the number of stores announced for closure in 2020 climbed to a high of 10,991, according to the CoStar Group, a data provider for the real estate industry. Many malls are teetering as tenants reduce the number of stores, fail to pay rent or exit through bankruptcies. Retailers that filed for bankruptcy this year include J.C. Penney, J.Crew, Brooks Brothers and Neiman Marcus.
“Retail has changed; it just has,” said Daniel Horrigan, the mayor of Akron, Ohio, where Amazon opened a fulfillment center this month, creating 1,500 jobs. “You can’t stand in front of that wave.”
The new Amazon center replaces a once-beloved shopping mall from a bygone era that featured a Sears, RadioShack and York steakhouse.
But the 54-acre site sat vacant for a decade, a glaring reminder of the Rust Belt city’s broader struggles: The body of a murder victim was discovered at the mall site and another man was electrocuted trying to steal copper from the empty building. “It looked like a giant haunted house inside,” Horrigan said.
A few years ago, Horrigan attended the South By Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, and pitched Amazon on the idea of redeveloping the mall property.
City and state officials agreed to upgrade the roadways and interchanges to make it easier for Amazon trucks to reach the building, which is near a major highway. Amazon also scored tax incentives in the deal.
“The mall used to be teeming with so much life, with kids and popcorn and concerts,” said Horrigan, who has spent most of his life in Akron. “Every Christmas it would be full of people. But we have to be realistic.”
That realism is settling over other cities, too. Even before the pandemic, some of New York’s most famous retail corridors were emptying. Long stretches of storefront along Madison Avenue and in Soho have struggled with vacant storefronts, taking some of the shine off those luxury neighborhoods. Macy’s, which has posted sales declines of more than 20% in the past three quarters, has been hit especially hard at its iconic flagship store and at Bloomingdale’s with the temporary loss of tourists and office workers.
Workers say that since the retailer reopened in June, there have been more employees than customers in the stores on some days. At Bloomingdales, some workers are filling the time by packing online orders to ship from the store.
“There are people in the stores, but they don’t have the numbers,” in terms of sales, said Brenda Moses, who started working at Bloomingdale’s during the Christmas season more than 30 years ago.
Across Manhattan, the number of retail leases signed or renewed dropped 31% in the third quarter from a year ago and rents fell 13% in the major shopping corridors, according to CBRE, a real estate services company. It was the 12th consecutive quarter of rent declines. At Hudson Yards, the long-touted development on the west side of Manhattan, Neiman Marcus said it would exit its 188,000-square-foot space a little more than a year after opening.
“Some retailers will return when the prices come down,” said Santiago Gallino, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, who has studied retail. “But their stores are not going to come back in the same format. They will have to be more integrated with their online business.”
Inevitably, though, retailers will need less physical space. And it’s not clear what type of business will fill the increasing void, raising the prospect that Manhattan storefronts could stay vacant for the foreseeable future.
“For the economy and for the retail industry, this transition is exciting and good,” Gallino said. “But it is also true, it is not going to come without pain.”
The retail industry’s rapid transformation is equally vivid in the boroughs outside Manhattan. Rising from the sites of long idled factories, more than a dozen e-commerce warehouses are being built to feed New York’s insatiable need for same-day deliveries. Warehouse leases were up 70% in the third quarter from the previous quarter.
In Red Hook, on the Brooklyn waterfront, work crews are building what will become one of the tallest warehouses on the East Coast: a three-story building with parking spaces trucks and “sprinter vans” to deliver goods across New York in less than a day.
In June, Amazon signed a lease on a 285,000-square-foot “delivery station” in the Maspeth section of Queens. Amazon has also vastly expanded the space it is leasing in a string of giant warehouses on Staten Island. In addition to the 855,000-square-foot fulfillment center that the company opened in 2018, Amazon this fall expanded into 1.4 million additional square feet of space on the Staten Island site. In the Bronx, the company is taking over a building recently vacated by its rival Walmart.
“I have been doing this for 30 years, and it is the best year we’ve ever had,” said Robert Kossar, head of industrial real estate for the Northeast at JLL, a real estate services company. “We certainly don’t see any signs of it slowing down.”

On the morning of Nov. 5, Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, asked his Facebook followers to report cases of voter fraud with the hashtag Stop the Steal. His post was shared over 5,000 times.
By late afternoon, conservative media personalities Diamond and Silk had shared the hashtag along with a video claiming voter fraud in Pennsylvania. Their post was shared over 3,800 times.
That night, conservative activist Brandon Straka asked people to protest in Michigan under the banner #StoptheSteal. His post was shared more than 3,700 times.
Over the next week, the phrase “Stop the Steal” was used to promote dozens of rallies that spread false voter fraud claims about the U.S. presidential election.
New research from Avaaz, a global human rights group, the Elections Integrity Partnership and The New York Times shows how a small group of people — mostly right-wing personalities with outsized influence on social media — helped spread the false voter fraud narrative that led to those rallies.
That group, like the guests of a large wedding held during the pandemic, were “superspreaders” of misinformation around voter fraud, seeding falsehoods that include the claims that dead people voted, voting machines had technical glitches, and mail-in ballots were not correctly counted.
“Because of how Facebook’s algorithm functions, these superspreaders are capable of priming a discourse,” said Fadi Quran, a director at Avaaz. “There is often this assumption that misinformation or rumors just catch on. These superspreaders show that there is an intentional effort to redefine the public narrative.”
Across Facebook, there were roughly 3.5 million interactions — including likes, comments and shares — on public posts referencing “Stop the Steal” during the week of Nov. 3, according to the research. Of those, the profiles of Eric Trump, Diamond and Silk and Straka accounted for a disproportionate share — roughly 6%, or 200,000, of those interactions.
While the group’s impact was notable, it did not come close to the spread of misinformation promoted by President Donald Trump since then. Of the 20 most-engaged Facebook posts over the last week containing the word “election,” all were from Trump, according to Crowdtangle, a Facebook-owned analytics tool. All of those claims were found to be false or misleading by independent fact checkers.
The baseless election fraud claims have been used by the president and his supporters to challenge the vote in a number of states. Reports that malfunctioning voting machines, intentionally miscounted mail-in votes and other irregularities affected the vote were investigated by election officials and journalists who found no evidence of widespread voter fraud.
The voter fraud claims have continued to gather steam in recent weeks, thanks in large part to prominent accounts. A look at a four-week period starting in mid-October shows that Trump and the top 25 superspreaders of voter fraud misinformation accounted for 28.6% of the interactions people had with that content, according to an analysis by Avaaz.
“What we see these people doing is kind of like setting a fire down with fuel, it is designed to quickly create a blaze,” Quran said. “These actors have built enough power they ensure this misinformation reaches millions of Americans.”
In order to find the superspreaders, Avaaz compiled a list of 95,546 Facebook posts that included narratives about voter fraud. Those posts were liked, shared or commented on nearly 60 million times by people on Facebook.
Avaaz found that just 33 of the 95,546 posts were responsible for over 13 million of those interactions. Those 33 posts had created a narrative that would go on to shape what millions of people thought about the legitimacy of the U.S. elections.
A spokesperson for Facebook said the company had added labels to posts that misrepresented the election process and was directing people to a voting information center.
“We’re taking every opportunity to connect people to reliable information about the election and how votes are being counted,” said Kevin McAlister, a Facebook spokesperson. The company has not commented on why accounts that repeatedly share misinformation, such as Straka’s and Diamond and Silk’s, have not been penalized. Facebook has previously said that Trump, along with other elected officials, is granted a special status and is not fact-checked.
Many of the superspreader accounts had millions of interactions on their Facebook posts over the last month, and have enjoyed continued growth. The accounts were active on Twitter as well as Facebook, and increasingly spread the same misinformation on new social media sites like Parler, MeWe and Gab.
Dan Bongino, a right-wing commentator with a following of nearly 4 million people on Facebook, had over 7.7 million interactions on Facebook the week of Nov. 3. Mark Levin, a right-wing radio host, had nearly 4 million interactions, and Diamond and Silk had 2.5 million. A review of their pages by The Times shows that a majority of their posts have focused on the recent elections, and voter fraud narratives around them.
None of the superspreaders identified in this article responded to requests for comment.
One of the most prominent false claims promoted by the superspreaders was that Dominion voting software deleted votes for Trump, or somehow changed vote tallies in several swing states. Election officials have found no evidence that the machines malfunctioned, but posts about the machines have been widely shared by Trump and his supporters.
Over the last week, just seven posts from the top 25 superspreaders of the Dominion voter fraud claim accounted for 13% of the total interactions on Facebook about the claim.
Many of those same accounts were also top superspreaders of the Dominion claim, and other voter fraud theories, on Twitter. The accounts of Trump, his son Eric, Straka and Levin were all among the top 20 accounts that spread misinformation about voter fraud on Twitter, according to Ian Kennedy, a researcher at the University of Washington who works with the Elections Integrity Partnership.
Donald Trump had by far the largest influence on Twitter. A single tweet by the president accusing Dominion voting systems of deleting 2.7 million votes in his favor was shared over 185,000 times, and liked over 600,000 times.
Like the other false claims about voter fraud, Trump’s tweet included a label by Twitter that he was sharing information that was not accurate.
Twitter, like Facebook, has said that those labels help prevent false claims from being shared and direct people toward more authoritative sources of information.
Recently, BuzzFeed News reported that Facebook employees questioned whether the labels were effective. Within the company, employees have sought out their own data on how well national newspapers performed during the elections, according to one Facebook employee.
On the #StoptheSteal hashtag, they found that both The New York Times and The Washington Post were among the top 25 pages with interactions on that hashtag — mainly from readers sharing articles and using the hashtag in those posts. (People sharing the articles could have been intending to debunk the campaign.)
Combined, the two publications had approximately 44,000 interactions on Facebook under that hashtag. By comparison, Straka, the conservative activist who shared the call to action on voter fraud, got three times that number of interactions sharing material under the same hashtag on his own Facebook account.
