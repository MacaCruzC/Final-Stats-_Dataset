Texto completo: Joe Biden's presidential campaign contacted top television anchors and networks Sunday to “demand" that Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, be kept off the air because of what they called his misleading comments about the Biden family and Ukraine.
“We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump," wrote a pair of top Biden campaign advisers, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, in the letter.
“Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism," the advisers wrote. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.
The note was sent to executives and top political anchors at ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC, including interviewers like Jake Tapper, Chuck Todd, and Chris Wallace.
Giuliani could not immediately be reached Sunday for comment.
Giuliani has been a ubiquitous presence on television news in recent days, including several appearances on Sunday. Advocating on Trump's behalf, Giuliani has repeatedly alleged that Biden, while serving as vice president, intervened in Ukraine to assist his son Hunter's business interests. No evidence has surfaced that Biden intentionally tried to help his son in Ukraine.

Giuliani says he'd help probe only with Trump's OK
Under fire for peddling a debunked conspiracy theory, Giuliani said Sunday he would cooperate with the House's impeachment inquiry only if Trump gave him permission.
"If he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I'll testify," Giuliani said during a series of television appearances where impeachment dominated the discussions.
But it's not clear whether Representative Adam Schiff, whose House Intelligence Committee is taking the lead on the impeachment investigation, wants to hear sworn testimony from Giuliani.
For now, Schiff, a California Democrat, is working to strike a deal with the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint forms the heart of the proceedings against the 45th president.

Most 'not surprised' Trump asked Ukraine for help
The vast majority of Americans are not surprised that President Trump encouraged the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joe Biden's son, and fewer than half see it as a "very serious" problem, an ABC News-Ipsos poll released Sunday indicates.
Just about half of Americans said they are "not surprised at all" to hear of Trump's actions. An additional 32 percent said they are "not surprised."
The national poll, conducted Friday and Saturday, also finds that 63 percent of adults say it is a serious problem that Trump pushed the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden in a July call that has sparked an extraordinary whistleblower complaint and led Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. Less than half of the public, 43 percent, said Trump's action was "very serious."
The survey did not ask whether Trump should be impeached or about accusations that White House officials tried to keep the July phone call secret, a claim laid out by an unidentified whistleblower in a seven-page complaint released Thursday.
Several reaction polls released in the past week found an increase in the percentage of Americans in favor of impeachment. An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist survey found 49 percent approval for impeachment and 46 percent against. After the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller III's report on Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and throughout the summer, most polls showed majorities opposing impeachment.
House Democrats are gambling that more of the public will support their decision to move ahead with a formal impeachment inquiry as the investigation progresses. Until this week, about half of Democratic caucus members wanted to launch impeachment proceedings. By Friday, all but 11 were on board.
Despite the Ukraine story's domination of headlines, just about one-quarter of adults say they have followed the news "very closely." More than 6 in 10 say they are following the issue at least "somewhat closely."
The survey was conducted Sept. 27-28 using Ipsos' Knowledge Panel, an ongoing survey panel recruited through random sampling of US households. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.
Washington Post
Cory Booker says he could drop his bid by Tuesday
Cory Booker said he could end his presidential campaign by Tuesday unless he is able to reach his goal of $1.7 million in donations within the next 36 hours. Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, Booker said that despite an "avalanche of support," his campaign needed "some more help" from contributors. His campaign website shows he's about $150,000 short of the amount he targeted on Sept. 21 to have a viable path to victory.
Although he has languished at 2% or 3% in most polls and is struggling in fund-raising, Booker has qualified for the October debate of Democratic presidential candidates. In the CNN interview, Booker said he has also met the threshold of 165,000 unique donors required to participate in the November debate.
Booker also rose to the defense of fellow candidate Joe Biden, saying the accusations from President Trump that the former vice president acted improperly to benefit his son Hunter's business interests in Ukraine are unfounded.
"I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I should be president, not him," Booker said of Biden, with whom he has clashed on the campaign trail and at debates. Yet the allegations from Trump "should in no way affect the vice president in his pursuit of the nomination," he said. "This can in no way besmirch his character, his honor, and his incredible service to this country over decades."
Instead, Booker said the focus should be on the actions of Trump and his family.
"I'm watching what's going on with the Trump family right now and Trump properties, and I just find that deeply offensive to just any kind of independent sense of what's honorable, ethical, not to mention consistent with the emoluments clause," he said, referring to a clause in the Constitution that forbids accepting payments from foreign governments. "I just don't think children of president and vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that."

Is Trump’s ‘war’ on California just for show?

Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Jessica Pishko: Why can’t we get rid of bad sheriffs?

Texto completo: A North Carolina prosecutor last week filed felony charges against Brindell Wilkins, the sheriff of Granville County, N.C. According to the indictment, a former deputy had recorded Sheriff Wilkins making racist comments and threatened to make them public. To protect his reputation, Sheriff Wilkins allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the deputy. This plan was concealed for years until recorded phone calls emerged between Sheriff Wilkins and the would-be killer.
Perhaps the most surprising part was the subsequent emergency meeting of the Granville Board of County Commissioners. The commissioners said North Carolina law tied their hands. While state law does provide for the removal of sheriff for reasons like “willful misconduct” and “intoxication,” the county commissioners were stymied by the lack of precedent and clarity. The law does not allow the commissioners to act unilaterally and since sheriff removals are so rare, they didn’t know how to proceed in such an unusual instance. (This week, Sheriff Wilkins agreed to a suspension after the Grandville County prosecutor filed a petition.)
Brindell Wilkins isn’t the only badly behaved sheriff. The Los Angeles County sheriff, Alex Villanueva has been in a protracted battle with the county board of supervisors over hiring people accused of assault, protecting a deputy who faked a shooting and permitting detectives to lie under oath. Last year, The Sacramento Bee reported that the sheriff of Trinity County, Calif., Bruce Haney had moved out of state and largely stopped working, yet was still receiving his taxpayer-funded salary. He retired shortly after that became public.
But in each of these cases, local officials stood by helplessly. Why is it so hard to remove a sheriff from office, even when that person is clearly ineffective or even criminal?
Almost every county has an elected sheriff. Sheriffs serve as the primary law enforcement for many rural areas and small towns, making arrests, serving warrants and enforcing protective orders. They also help city and state police departments in various formal and informal capacities.
Sheriffs have myriad other responsibilities, as well, including operating the county jail, transporting inmates to the courthouse and evicting people. They also monitor polling places and collect taxes.
Sheriffs have a great deal of discretion in how they allocate their budget, whom they hire and whether jails are expanded or overhauled. In many states, there are few requirements to run for the office. Although their jobs require expertise, sheriffs are not vetted other than during elections, which typically have low turnout and little competition.
I spent the past year assessing the laws governing sheriff accountability and found a common theme: They lack even the most basic independent oversight and supervision. In most states, there are few or no ways to hold them accountable, even when they steal, lie or harm others. There are almost no civilian oversight commissions, no uniform disciplinary procedures, no reporting requirements in most states. In fact, sheriffs are generally afforded special protections like complete autonomy, a lack of term limits and the power to hire and fire at will, making it difficult to remove them from office.
There is a network of laws that are both hard to change — in most states, sheriffs are written into the Constitution — and so opaque that county governments struggle with how to handle erring sheriffs.
The problem of sheriffs is particularly acute in the South and Southwest, where the office has more power and was historically used to prop up white supremacy. Consider Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff known for his racist tactics who defended housing inmates in un-air-conditioned tents, reinstating the chain gang and making discriminatory traffic stops.
Efforts to make sheriffs more accountable have run into roadblocks created by state sheriffs associations, powerful lobbying groups that have historically opposed legislative changes and community oversight. Last year, North Carolina voters in some counties elected sheriffs who promised to limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and seek better community relations. In response, lawmakers passed a bill that would have made cooperation with ICE mandatory. (The governor vetoed the bill because it was most likely unconstitutional.)
Some people have called for eliminating the office of sheriff. Here is an even more radical idea: Sheriffs should undertake reconciliation with their communities. Otherwise, progress will be incomplete and unsatisfying. The democratic process involves more than winning elections; it must include transparency and listening. Local lawmakers should pass democratic oversight structures like a civilian complaint review board that will subject sheriffs to the same requirements for accountability as other government officials.
This month, prosecutors from around the country crossed the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to acknowledge the role of racism in the legal system. What if we asked sheriffs to do the same? It was, after all, Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, Ala., who ordered his posse to beat, tear-gas and terrorize unarmed civil rights protesters traveling over the bridge on Bloody Sunday. Sheriffs should acknowledge the problematic role of their office in American history and reimagine a space where community control doesn’t mean the power to arrest but rather the power to heal.

With Facebook's Coming News Tab, Only Some Will Get Paid; Social-media giant plans to pay about a quarter of news organizations whose content will be featured

Texto completo: Facebook Inc. is planning to pay only a minority of publishers whose headlines will be featured in its coming news section, according to people familiar with the matter.
The specialized news section—which will appear on the toolbar at the bottom of Facebook's mobile app—is set to launch as early as the end of October and will include links to stories from about 200 publications, the people said.
A person familiar with the matter said Facebook had never planned to pay all the news outlets whose content it would link to in its news section. The plan is similar to what Facebook has done with its Watch section, which includes videos not paid for by Facebook, the person said. Taking into account companies that own multiple publications, Facebook will pay fees to about one-quarter of the organizations that will be involved at launch, the person said.
Facebook is still negotiating with several big publishers, and in most cases talks have centered around how much of their reporting publishers would allow to be posted on the Facebook tab, the people familiar with the matter said. Facebook wants news organizations to allow access to all their stories for possible inclusion in the news tab, but some outlets have pushed for only allowing limited access.
The outlets in talks with Facebook include Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones & Co., the Washington Post, the New York Times, Business Insider, BuzzFeed, HuffPost and the Philadelphia Inquirer, the people said.
The licensing fees Facebook is offering range as high as $3 million a year for national news outlets to several hundred thousand dollars for regional publications, they said. The deals would be for three years.
Facebook plans to expand the number of publishers included in the program as the product develops, the people said. The feed will become more customizable and individually targeted, and will eventually include links from Facebook's local-news project "Today In."
The company's move to pay for news comes as the big tech platforms have come under growing legal and regulatory scrutiny. Alphabet Inc.'s Google has resisted paying publishers but recently announced changes to how it ranks stories on its news page to better promote original content, another long-running complaint from publishers.
News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti have both called on Facebook and Google to pay organizations that provide quality news. News Corp is the Journal's parent company.
Facebook will highlight only publishers that meet the criteria of its news page index , which requires sites to focus on news reporting and bars those that repeatedly share misinformation and bombard readers with advertising. But the company, which has been accused of bias by conservatives in the past, has been mindful to include a diversity of viewpoints among the outlets that will be featured, one person said. For example, while stories from Infowars won't be included, stories from Breitbart might appear, this person said.
"We've been working closely with news organizations to get this right by emphasizing original reporting and making it much easier to find the most relevant news on Facebook," said Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president of global news partnerships.
Headlines appearing in Facebook's news section will be chosen in some cases by a team of editors and in others by the company's algorithm, people familiar with the matter said. The "Top News" section, which will feature about 10 headlines, will be entirely curated by human editors. News in subsections, such as sports or entertainment, and a "suggested for you" section, will be selected by algorithm. The feed won't include any advertising and all stories will direct readers to the publishers' own websites, the people said.
Facebook's curators will use a detailed list of criteria for which stories to highlight, including promoting outlets that were the first to report the news, the people said. Stories with named sources might also be given priority to those that rely on anonymous sources.
Facebook is looking to expand its team of curators to about 25 people, with some based in London, to work under Anne Kornblut, a Pulitzer Prize winner who joined Facebook in 2015 after stints at the Washington Post, New York Times and Boston Globe, the people said.

Texto completo: Here's a take no one will like: I'm confident he did it. I'm confident it's impeachable. I'm just not so sure he should be impeached for it.
Let's start at the top. It's obvious to me that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden in order to tarnish the image of the Democrat best positioned to defeat him in 2020.
In the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump says America has been very good to Ukraine, but he wants the relationship to be more "reciprocal." Zelenskiy agrees and asks for more anti-tank missiles to deter ongoing Russian military aggression. Trump responds by asking for a two-part "favor."
First, he asks Zelenskiy to look into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers (a bat-guano-crazy request, but whatever). Then, Trump mentions "the other thing" he wants.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Trump says.
The context matters as much as the text. Trump had already blocked the transfer of congressionally approved military aid. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had been hectoring the Ukrainians for months to go after Biden (and it remains his singular obsession even now). Giuliani even admitted it last May in an interview with the New York Times. He said he was lobbying the Ukrainians to investigate Biden because "that information will be very, very helpful to my client."
And that's why Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani.
There's more context as well. There were reportedly other calls in which Trump importuned the Ukrainians this way. Trump's explanation for why he froze the military aid to Ukraine in the first place keeps changing. On Monday he said he blocked it out of concern over Ukrainian corruption (the only corruption in the world he's passionate about, apparently). On Tuesday he said the real reason was that he wanted our allies to pony up even more money for the government he claimed was too corrupt for our aid in the first place.
Normally you'd think an inadvertent confession would settle things. But when Trump said of his call with Ukraine, "There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden," the assumption was that he misspoke.
We also learned Thursday that the "whistleblower" alleges the White House took extraordinary measures to hide the transcript of the call, which, if true, suggests wiser heads understood that the conversation crossed a line.
Regardless, I think Trump did it.
However, that doesn't mean I'm persuaded he must be impeached over it.
Impeachment doesn't mean "removal from office." It's the political equivalent of a grand jury indictment, with the House fully empowered to impeach any action it deems impeachable. It's up to the Senate to decide whether a president should be removed.
The Federalist Papers are clear: Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. Illegal acts are impeachable, but not all impeachable acts are illegal. If the president stood in the Oval Office and shouted obscenities on television while dancing in the nude, that would be impeachable but not illegal (FCC violations notwithstanding).
Impeachment is ultimately a question of whether a president violated the public trust. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says a president must be impeached for violating the public trust. I can list any number of occasions when presidents have done that and it never even occurred to anyone that they should be impeached for it.
It's a prudential question with good arguments on both sides. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I'd be even more torn than she's clearly been. In the modern era, we've never had the drama of an impeachment process in a president's first term or in the run-up to a reelection.
Absent new facts, the GOP-controlled Senate will not remove Trump. The president would claim "exoneration," and his behavior would become normalized for future presidents. So I'm not sure Democrats are right to pursue impeachment. I'm sure Republicans are wrong to pretend that what Trump did was totally fine.

Texto completo: A Rock and a Lightning Rod
Readers responded at nytimes.com to Amy Sohn's article last Sunday about an investor trying to sell a vacant lot in Manhattan that consists entirely of a 30-foot-tall mound of bedrock. Comments have been edited. You can protect a fragment of New York that's been there for ages or you can build another building. How did a piece of bedrock go from $ 10,000 to $ 3 million in 15 years? What is your history worth?
gf, Ireland
I knew this rock from the picture instantly! Our housekeeper in the late '40s and early '50s, a Mrs. Margaret Murphy, originally from County Cork in Ireland, lived on 207th Street and would occasionally treat us to a trip to her apartment and Inwood. (We lived down in Washington Heights, in Hudson View Gardens at 183rd Street and Pinehurst Avenue.)
Whenever we passed that rock, "Mussy" (a nickname coming from a 2-year-old's inability to pronounce Mrs. Murphy) would always tell us that when St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland, he sent them to the rock, where they were turned into stone. It was probably a tale used control two active youngsters on a walk -- she also kept us away from the incinerator shoot door in our own apartment with the threat that "Jack Soot" (again from Ireland) also lived in the incinerator and would certainly come to haul us down should he spot us peering in. I fondly remember both tales frequently.
Virginia McMillan Carr, Evanston, Ill.
There are some elements of nature worth preserving and which should be priceless and protected. The Cooper Rock, the Amazon rain forest, the Arctic and Antarctica. Must every inch of Manhattan be mined and developed for profit? We aren't even content to allow 700-foot office buildings built in the '50s (270 Park Avenue) remain standing -- they must be demolished with materials and labor laid to waste for something bigger. It's no wonder people are protesting climate change globally today.
Shaun, Passaic, N.J.
Lovely if sad story. Yes it can be demolished and a building erected here, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Geologically speaking, however, if the rock is part of an outcrop (of bedrock -- don't you just love geology) then it isn't a glacial erratic and wasn't deposited by a glacier.
No matter, it's a lovely rock and garden to those who live nearby and have worked hard to preserve this bit of old Manhattan nature.
Andrew Macdonald, Alexandria, Va.
If the co-op people want to preserve their whatever, buy the rock. Stop trying to control what you don't own.
Mtnman1963, Maryland
This is a great quintessential New York Times story, the kind of article I relish as an exiled New Yorker. Any chance to preserve the native geology of New York should be seized. The city should declare eminent domain and convert the double lot to a park that can be protected by covenants but still allow the neighbors full access and use. This is a no-brainer.
malabar, fla.
You're suggesting that the most densely populated city in America, in the midst of a housing shortage, should rob a lot from a developer who could build actual housing on it and instead let no one ever develop it? Far from being a "no brainer," that suggestion boggles the mind.
20002, Washington
A rock of ages, taking no notice of man and his petty bickering and self-serving strivings; let it, its birds and other small creatures and plants stay and stand as a testament to the folly of man, all the while reminding the humans that they, and their condos too, shall pass.
Stephen Bowyer, Haliburton, Ontario
It is an odd coincidence that this story is published on the same day as the global climate strike. Come on, really? Just leave the boulder and garden there. The city and the planet don't need another "development." Let it remain a witness, sitting undisturbed long after humans have "developed" their way out of existence. Maybe the city could buy it with all the revenue they've gathered from the billionaire's luxury towers (that have spoiled the New York skyline). Oy.
Andrew N, Vermont
The adage fits, "If you want to control what's done on property, it's best to own it."

B Movies, Where the B Stands for Brutal

Texto completo: S. Craig Zahler's brutal, stylized action films, "Bone Tomahawk," "Brawl in Cell Block 99" and "Dragged Across Concrete," exemplify an attitude: Mash a genre, smash a skull.
The low-budget action movies that the iconoclastic critic Manny Farber called "underground films" in an essay defiantly subtitled "a bit of male truth"-- nothing effete about these flicks -- were Hollywood mainstays through the 1950s.
Although such movies, which Farber saw as the filmmakers' struggle against the constraints of cliché (an "aesthetic give-and-go with banality"), have all but disappeared, a few outré filmmakers continue the tradition. One unsung proponent is the 46-year-old writer-director-heavy-metal musician S. Craig Zahler.
The author of some 40 largely unproduced screenplays, the Miami-born, New York-based Zahler has directed three movies: the horror-western "Bone Tomahawk" (2015), the nightmare prison film "Brawl in Cell Block 99" (2017) and the gruesome bad-cop caper "Dragged Across Concrete" (2019). Their titles give a fair indication of Zahler's attitude: Mash a genre, smash a skull.
Farber described the old-school action director Anthony Mann as "a tin-can de Sade" with "an original dictionary of ways in which to punish the human body." Zahler is another creative sadist, one as humorous as he is lurid in his fabrication of ordeals and gross-out effects (entrails scooped, bones snapped). His films may not be to every taste but they are compulsively watchable.
"Bone Tomahawk," a seeming exploitation film, was almost immediately recognized as something more. The New York Times reviewer Jeannette Catsoulis called it an "unexpected low-budget treat" and the Museum of Modern Art programmed it as one of 2016's underappreciated films in a series called "Contenders."
Simply described, "Bone Tomahawk" is a Grand Guignol spawn of John Ford's classic captivity western "The Searchers" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." Led by Kurt Russell's righteous sheriff, the "four doomed men" of "Bone Tomahawk" ride into the wilderness to rescue a white woman (Lili Simmons) abducted by a clan of cannibal troglodytes -- succinctly described by a Native American as "a spoiled bloodline of inbred animals that rape and eat their own mothers."
"Bone Tomahawk" might be rated "PC" for "pretty crazy." An even more relentlessly punishing movie, Zahler's "Brawl in Cell Block 99" is the calvary of a country-boy auto mechanic, Bradley Thomas (Vince Vaughn, pumped up beyond recognition in a turn Catsoulis described as "revelatory"), who goes to work for a local drug dealer to support his pregnant wife. Vaughn's awe-inspired man-mountain is as stoical as he is potentially violent, a criminal with a code of honor. "I'd rather knit baby bootees out of pink yarn than hit someone who didn't deserve it," he says at one point.
Thomas intervenes in a shootout on the side of the police and, refusing to double-cross those who double-crossed him, suffers the consequences -- passing through a series of horrific dungeons on a mission to bring down an incarcerated narco king in order to save the life of his unborn child. The movie has a long fuse (and a long chain of indignities), ultimately rewarding the protagonist's and viewer's patience with an orgy of stomped-in faces and exploding skulls.
The main characters of "Dragged Across Concrete," which like "Brawl on Cell Block 99" had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, also turn to crime to protect their womenfolk. Mel Gibson plays a frustrated cop named Ridgeman who goes rogue in part because his wife (Laurie Holden) is incapacitated by multiple sclerosis. His more sympathetic counterpart is a black ex-con (Tory Kittles) whose mother has turned to prostitution. Both become involved on opposite sides of a bank robbery gone horrendously wrong. (Vaughn, as Gibson's somewhat more reasonable partner, is dragged along for the ride.)
Zahler's films are largely performance-driven, regularly giving parts to such colorful character actors as the pompous ham Fred Melamed and the reliably slimy Udo Kier. However extreme, Zahler's action movies are often leisurely. They are essentially theatrical, thanks to their distinctive combination of fastidious camera placement (violence staged in long shot as well as shown in close-up) and entertainingly digressive, if not wacky, repartee.
Unabashedly provocative, more truculent than coherent, "Dragged Across Concrete" gives the impression of a man given to directing with a large chip on his shoulder. Like all of Zahler's films, "Dragged Across Concrete" is heavy on a particular ideology, what the Times critic Manohla Dargis characterized as "old-fashioned American anti-authoritarianism -- with its hatred for rules matched only by a love of guns."
It may be coincidental that Zahler's male stars (Russell, Vaughn and Gibson) all lean to the right politically, but the emphasis on family values and religious faith is harder to miss than the crucifix tattooed on the back of Bradley Thomas's bald head. Racial animus is never far from the surface, but if Zahler's protagonists are casually bigoted, his bad guys are far worse. "Just educated two Mexicans on the meaning of Manifest Destiny," the most arrogant member of the "Bone" posse boasts after shooting a pair of unarmed interlopers.
White male grievance is a given. When the cops in "Dragged" are recorded by a civilian in the act of roughing up a Latino perpetrator and suspended from the police force (by the "Miami Vice" star Don Johnson no less) they blame it on "politics, like always." Ridgeman further complains that "being branded a racist" these days is like being "branded a Communist in the 1950s."
I don't know if the filmmaker meant this ludicrous analogy as a joke, but having Ridgeman fatally undone by his racist instincts is the sort of sledgehammer irony Zahler enjoys.
"Bone Tomahawk," "Brawl in Cell Block 99" and "Dragged Across Concrete" can all be streamed via Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, and Vudu. "Bone Tomahawk" is available from iTunes as well.

GOP congressman says he's for 'oversight process,' not impeachment inquiry

Texto completo: A Republican congressman supports an "oversight process" to determine whether President Trump broke the law when he asked a foreign leader to look into a political opponent's activities.
Just don't call it an impeachment inquiry.
Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada used language during a phone call with reporters on Friday night that suggested he supported the Democrats' investigation into Trump.
"Let's put it through the process and see what happens," Amodei said, according to the Nevada Independent. "I'm a big fan of oversight, so let's let the committees get to work and see where it goes."
"Using government agencies to, if it's proven, to put your finger on the scale of an election, I don't think that's right," he added. "If it turns out that it's something along those lines, then there's a problem."
But after news outlets began reporting that Amodei was the first House Republican to side with Democrats on opening an impeachment inquiry, Amodei and his staff pushed back - hard. Sure, they argued, the congressman wanted to find out what occurred between Trump and the Ukrainian president. But that's not the same as wanting the House to begin impeachment proceedings.
To some, it's a distinction without a difference. But for Republicans in Congress, it underscores the delicacy of this moment as they balance their allegiance to Trump with their constitutional duties.
For Amodei, who is in his fourth full term in Congress - he won a special election in September 2011 and has easily won reelection since - that tension revealed itself in real time.
Referencing the Trump situation on Friday, Amodei said to "put it through the process." He also said that he's a "big fan of oversight" and that "the committees" should "get to work and see where it goes."
To many, including the reporters on the call, that sounded a lot like an endorsement of the Democrats' investigation. News outlets from Fox News to the New York Times ran headlines saying he'd come out in support of an impeachment inquiry.
His Wikipedia page now includes the line: "On 27 September 2019, Amodei became the first Republican member of Congress to back an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump."
Amodei's office went into damage control, quickly issuing a statement denying that the congressman was advocating for an impeachment inquiry. He was, he said, referring to his vote to give the whistleblower complaint against Trump to the intelligence committees to vet. That action was supported unanimously in the House and Senate.
"I now have a full appreciation of how the president feels," Amodei said in an apparent dig at the news media.
Amodei's office also pointed to the congressman's support twice in the past week for a resolution offered by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) expressing disapproval of how House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) began an impeachment inquiry without a formal vote in the House. Those resolutions were backed by every Republican and voted down by every Democrat.
When asked to clarify the congressman's position further, Amodei spokesman Logan Tucker said that the difference between backing an oversight process and supporting "Pelosi's inquiry" is that "then you stand with the 223 Democrats who have made clear that if we were to vote right this second today to impeach Trump, they would vote yes before any sort of process has transpired. Again, prior to any such process playing out, the congressman does not support impeachment in any way, shape or form."
But 223 Democrats don't support impeaching Trump without a process. In fact, of the 224 House Democrats who support an inquiry, just 28 say they would impeach the president right now.
When that was pointed out, Tucker reiterated Amodei's support for the resolution releasing the whistleblower complaint and said: "Supporting a process to get to the bottom of what happened in this instance is, yes, something Mark supports right now. I obviously can't speak for any other Democrats on this issue, only what Mark supports . . . which is an oversight process."
Just don't call it an impeachment inquiry.

Texto completo: Larry Krauser has been swimming competitively for more than half a century, and the seven medals he brought home from last month's world championships are just the latest in his illustrious swimming career.
He has competed in almost every World Masters Championships since 1994 and won first place in both the 200 meter and 100 meter freestyle events at the 2019 competition in Gwangju, South Korea.
Krauser placed second in the 50-meter and 800-meter freestyle and fourth in the 200-meter backstroke. He was also on the third-place water polo team.
"I think my favorite swim at this worlds was the 100 freestyle," Krauser said. "I won that by three one-hundredths of a second."
Krauser attributes the win to his technique.
"The way you're supposed to finish is to extend out and rotate your shoulders," Krauser said. "I did - he didn't. That was it."
Krauser started swimming when he was 2 years old and living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. His mother, June Krauser, was a world-renowned swimmer in the 1940s.
"Because my mom was a competitive swimmer, she pushed us into that," Krauser said.
He started swimming competitively at age 5. By the time he was in high school, he was an all-American in both swimming and water polo.
The extremely competitive team he was on in Florida was led by an Olympic coach, and the experience taught Krauser a lot of life lessons.
"The thing that sports brings to kids is learning discipline and dedication," he said. "Discipline in that you have to structure yourself so you get your homework done, get your workout in. I think that's been very beneficial to my professional life, my life in general."
As he finished up his high school swimming career, Krauser evaluated his next steps.
"At that time, I wasn't fast enough to make the Olympics," Krauser said.
So he headed off to his parents' alma mater, Purdue University, on a full-ride swimming scholarship.
He swam and played on the university's water polo team and coached his junior and senior years. After graduation he headed back to Florida, where he coached a women's water polo team to nationals.
But Krauser didn't just coach - he kept competing.
Following in his mother's footsteps once again, Krauser began swimming in U.S. Masters Swimming competitions.
Masters swimming is a membership organization with recognized clubs across the nation for individuals 18 and older that hold regular workouts and swim meets. Those with the fastest times can qualify for national and international competition.
June Krauser is widely considered the "mother of U.S. Masters Swimming," as noted in her obituary in the New York Times. She wrote the rulebook for the organization in the late 1970s as one of the three founders. She was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1994.
"They were interested to know whether competition as you got older was detrimental or not," Krauser said.
When Krauser himself got older, heading to Masters competitions was the logical next step.
"I've been involved since my mom really instigated the whole thing and wrote a lot of the rules," he said of Masters.
Krauser started racking up fast times and in 2003 set the FINA world record for the 100-meter freestyle in the 50-54 age category.
Two more world records followed, one in 2006 for the 200-meter freestyle relay and another in 2013 for the 200-meter freestyle in the 60-64 age category.
He swam in almost every World Masters Championships during the past two decades, placing in at least the top 10 every year, if not taking home a gold metal.
Life got busy with Krauser's career in developing post-tensioning technologies, a technique to reinforce concrete. Krauser, his wife Sheryl and their three children moved to Spokane in 1995. In 2006, he started working at General Technolgies Inc. and is now the executive vice president.
Even with that busy schedule, raising kids, and traveling for business, Krauser stayed passionate about his time in the pool.
"A lot of people in swimming get burned out and they don't keep going with it," Krauser said. "I never got burned out with swimming."
Krauser fits swimming into his daily life on lunch breaks, and tries to swim when he travels for work.
"My wife allows me to go to all these competitions and I appreciate all that," Krauser said.
His wife of 44 years, Sheryl, travels to competitions with him, and on Sundays they swim together.
In the summer, most of the Spokane swimming community heads to Witter Aquatic Center, he said.
There, you can find Krauser putting workouts on the board and talking with other swimmers.
With swimming being a "major part" of his life, Krauser is a part of swimming communities all over the world.
"It's allowed me to meet many people," he said. "I have international friends that I see every two years at these world championships. I have people around the U.S. that I see at nationals and things like that, so it brings in friendships."
Krauser doesn't plan on slowing down anytime soon.
"I'm fortunate that I'm healthy and I think the swimming helps that," he said. "You know, if I don't do it, I miss it."

Texto completo: Echoes of Watergate could be heard in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement Tuesday that the House of Representatives will begin a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But how similar is this path to what the nation experienced 45 years ago?
In 1974, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon as a result of the Watergate scandal, leading him to become the only president to resign. Now Democrats hope their impeachment probe will force Trump from office over allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give him political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a threat to Trump in the 2020 election.
Just as they were during Watergate, accusations of abusing power for personal political reasons are at the heart of the new impeachment inquiry. Trump allegedly froze congressionally approved aid for Ukraine while asking Zelenskiy to provide possibly damaging information about Biden and his son Hunter.
Similarly, the second article of impeachment against Nixon charged him with abusing his presidential power. Nixon had used the FBI and IRS to hurt journalists, Democrats and other people he didn't like. His administration also created a secret unit to illegally wiretap people and break into their offices. And he used the power of his office to cover up the involvement of his aides in the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.
Another similarity is the critical role journalists played in exposing critical information that prompted the impeachment inquiries. Over the past week, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post have revealed details of a whistleblower's warning about Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president, the administration's initial refusal to release an inspector general's report about the warning and White House maneuverings to withhold aid to Ukraine.
During Watergate, the Washington Post, New York Times and other news outlets uncovered important details of the Watergate burglary, cover-up and political sabotage efforts. Like they do now, reporters relied on anonymous sources to disclose much of the information and received the White House's wrath. Nixon and his supporters accused the press of serving the interests of Democrats and engaging in a witch hunt. Trump tweeted Tuesday that the current inquiry was "Witch Hunt garbage."
A third resemblance is the weak public support for impeachment prior to formal proceedings. Most opinion polls have shown the public opposing Trump's impeachment, with an average of only 38.5 percent favoring it since the start of 2017. In Nixon's case, public support for impeachment never reached 50 percent during most of the Watergate investigation. A majority favored removing him from office only after the House Judiciary Committee held its impeachment hearings.
Those similarities between the Trump and Nixon impeachment efforts are striking, but three key differences could lead to different outcomes.
First, during the Watergate scandal, most Americans had a choice of just three television networks, three national news magazines and perhaps a couple of daily newspapers. Although a majority of newspapers endorsed Nixon for reelection in 1972, most media outlets were offering widespread coverage of his administration's crimes by the following year. As a result, it was hard for the public to avoid seeing information about the president's misdeeds.
Now Americans can choose from a multitude of media outlets, many of them highly partisan. Unlike Nixon, Trump has the benefit of outlets such as Fox News and "The Rush Limbaugh Show" that have faithfully backed him, helping him maintain his popularity among conservatives. Trump also has the advantage over Nixon of being able to use Twitter to reach the public directly with his denials and attacks against Democrats and journalists.
Rising partisanship has contributed to another essential difference: declining public trust in public institutions. Once Congress held televised Watergate hearings and the media started covering Watergate extensively, support for impeaching Nixon began to rise.
But since Watergate, the percentage of Americans who have a "great deal" or "quite a lot" of trust in Congress has plummeted from 42 percent to 11 percent. Over a similar span, trust in newspapers has fallen from 39 percent to 23 percent. This growing wariness of the media and Congress could mean that televised impeachment hearings won't sway public opinion regarding Trump's fitness for office.
Finally, Democrats controlled both the House and Senate during Nixon's presidency. This meant they could steer the impeachment process all the way through a potential trial. The presence of moderate Republicans in the Senate who were appalled by Watergate made it likely that Nixon would have been convicted by the required two-thirds vote if he hadn't resigned first.
Trump has the advantage of a GOP-controlled Senate whose members have loyally backed him and are circling the wagons to defend him against impeachment. Even if the House votes to impeach Trump, the Senate could save him.
Of course, we don't know yet what will be revealed during the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower complaint or other new evidence could contain a smoking gun with Trump's fingerprints all over it. If that happens, it could end his presidency just as tapes of Nixon's conversations - released four days before his resignation - showed that he tried to get the CIA to interfere with the Watergate investigation.
But if the impeachment probe doesn't provide any startling new information, it's the Democrats whose political fortunes could be doomed.

Lakers training camp: 5 key questions as LeBron James, Anthony Davis join forces

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

As Santa Anita opens with a nine-race program, including three graded stakes races, horse owners, trainers and the operators of Santa Anita have bigger questions than which horse runs fastest.
— Will it be a safer meet than the winter-spring season from December through June, when 30 horses died either in morning workouts or during afternoon racing?
— Will Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, banned from all race tracks owned by the Stronach Group since June 22, be allowed to race horses at any time during the meet?
— Is the horse population in Southern California large enough to allow the track to follow through on its plan to hold four-day race weeks, as opposed to the three-day schedule track officials were forced to adopt during the final portion of the spring meet?
— Will racing fans stay away, from both the track and the betting windows, like happened during Del Mar’s 36-day summer meet that ended Sept. 2? Del Mar enjoyed a very safe meet, but a hangover from Santa Anita’s troubles hurt its business.
— What kind of spotlight will come with the Breeders’ Cup on Nov. 1-2? Horse racing’s biggest event also raises the pressure on Santa Anita to run a safe meet.
One thing is perfectly clear, and carries no question marks: This is the most important meet in the track’s history.
“For what’s at stake, I think absolutely (it’s the most important),” said Aidan Butler, the new acting executive director of California racing for Santa Anita’s parent company, the Stronach Group. “There are a lot of eye balls on Santa Anita, both on the positive and the negative. I think we need to put our best foot forward and make sure things are done better than they’ve ever been done historically in any country.
“The way I look at it, if this many people are interested, let’s show ’em what horse racing can do. Let’s show ’em how good horse racing, when done right, truly is.”
California governor Gavin Newsom is watching closely. He issued a scathing review of horse racing when he met with reporters from the New York Times this week.
“What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned,” he told the Times. “We own that going into the next season, and we’re going to have to do something about it.
“I’ll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That’s horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace.”
The 42-year-old Butler, a native of Great Britain who came to the Stronach Group from a Toronto law firm in 2018 and assumed his new position in early August, says he sees the need for horse racing to adapt and not conduct business as usual.
“Just because things back in the day were done a certain way and were acceptable does not mean they’ll be acceptable in today’s day and age,” he said.
For example, he cited the days when a racing fatality was treated as back-page news. The nightmare at Santa Anita has changed all of that.
“The way I actually look at it is, if a horse gets injured, everything that happened around that horse, what happened, why did it go on, that needs to be addressed, needs to be looked at,” Butler said. “This is a very fast-paced, active sport and accidents do happen. But that being said, transparency I think will set us all free. I hate to say back in the old days no one cared, well no one cared about a lot of stuff going back a few years.
“There are so many eyeballs on us now that it makes everybody wan to be better. I think if we’re going to try to grow the sport — and I’m not here to keep the status quo, I’m here to try and grow the sport — if we’re going to do that, we need to get confidence back, show (the sport) is as good and safe as can possibly be.”
Thoroughbred owner Jon Lindo is taking a wait-and-see approach, while agreeing that this is Santa Anita’s most important meet ever.
“I think it’s huge,” he said. “Right now, Santa Anita has to earn back the trust and the confidence of not only the horsemen, the owners and trainers, but the fans and the general public. The messages sent during that last meet, that was so confrontational, with the new management team in place we need to see if it’s one that everyone can work with toward a common goal.
“I mean, if this goes the wrong way, we could be out of business. That’s how important it is. It’s a short meet and unfortunately I think we’re all watching, not because we want to see the races, but we just want to see this thing go smoothly. They’ve got to earn my trust back.”
Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O’Neill is taking an optimistic view.
“After the success of Del Mar (no fatalities during live racing), I can speak on the behalf of the majority of the horsemen that we’re real excited to continue it and have a real great Santa Anita,” he said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.”
Is this Santa Anita’s most important meet ever?
“I haven’t thought of it in those terms,” O’Neill said, “but it’s just real important that we all work together and continue to work together, have a good open dialogue and realize we need to share in all the great times and share in all the accidental stuff.
“From what I can see, I really like the way Santa Anita is going into the meet and we’ll know more as we get going. I know we’re all optimistic that we’re going to have a heck of a meet.”
But that doesn’t mean there is no anxiety in the executive offices at Santa Anita this week. Even Del Mar officials admitted to some nervousness on the eve of their pivotal meet.
“Am I a little bit apprehensive? Of course,” Butler said. “I’ve got a few butterflies because I want everything to go as well as it should. But if preparation and hard work and having the right people around (means anything), my confidence level is pretty good.”
The Hollendorfer situation is still under review. The 73-year-old trainer with more than 7,600 lifetime victories was banned from the Stronach Group’s five race tracks — Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields, Gulfstream Park, Laurel Park and Pimlico — after his fourth fatality at Santa Anita on June 22.
Butler would not comment on Hollendorfer, citing litigation, but he did offer a rebuttal to people who believe the Stronach Group banned Hollendorfer in an attempt to take the onus off the race track.
“There is absolutely no truth to that whatsoever,” he said. “I was involved, I was there, I was on the grounds and that was never once contemplated or thought of.”

Tokyo 2020 Olympics: Ticket packages 'running scarce' and other insider travel tips

Resumen: It's time to start planning your Tokyo 2020 Olympics journey.

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. Where should I stay? When should I book my flights? What is there to do while I'm in Tokyo? What is there to do outside of Tokyo? What is the weather going to be like? But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the 2020 Olympics?
July 24 to Aug. 9. U. S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U. S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list. Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471. 50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics?
There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U. S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends travelers fly into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U. S. (i. e. if you're leaving from California, go for under $700).
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10 to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they either arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay?
Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling. " Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a significantly reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. . Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book during that period yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price per night.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o. d. o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant located in New York’s Flatiron neighborhood, recommends travelers stay at a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo?
Shibuya Crossing
Who knew a crosswalk could also double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing isn't just any crosswalk. It could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji
Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails there from early July to early September.
Animal cafes
Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
First time in Tokyo? Here are 5 things you should do
Other notable sights
Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do near Tokyo?
Hakone: "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto: Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are scattered in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima: Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama: Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura: Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura, which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Anything else I should keep in mind?
"One of the greatest misconceptions about Japan is that it can be unapproachable and difficult to navigate effectively because of the language barrier and cultural formality," Tadehara says. "Though it is true that English is not as prevalent here as it is in other non-English speaking countries, getting around and immersing in authentic experiences is easy with a little preparation. "
Getting around
The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says.

Verizon Sponsors New York Times Subscriptions for High Schools; Deal aims to promote Verizon and the Times simultaneously

Texto completo: Verizon Communications Inc. is sponsoring a program to make the New York Times available free to potentially millions of high-school students as part of a deepening advertising partnership between the two companies.
The arrangement will grant free access to the Times site on computers at any of 12,000 schools in low-income areas around the country that elect to receive it, the companies said. That could reach as many as seven million students.
In the schools, the Times' site won't display advertising and won't collect data from its users, but will feature some kind of Verizon branding, noting that it is the sponsor, said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of New York Times Co. The program will be available to schools for two years.
"We've got a heritage of trying to make the Times as useful as it can be to students, and this will include teaching tools that teachers can use in the classroom," Mr. Thompson said.
He said the Times won't count the program toward its overall subscriber totals, a measure that has been core to the media company's growth in recent years. The Times has set a target of 10 million total subscribers by 2025. It ended its last quarter with 4.7 million total subscriptions.
The companies declined to disclose the terms of the deal. It is part of a broad advertising relationship between Verizon and the Times which has in recent years moved to create more elaborate and lucrative ad deals that resemble corporate partnerships.
"It is the biggest single relationship we have with any commercial partner at the moment," Mr. Thompson said of the larger partnership with Verizon.
In addition to a multimillion-dollar ad buy, Verizon and the Times have already partnered on a research project looking at how best to adapt 5G networking and equipment for use in reporting.
Verizon said the partnership is an extension of its efforts to extend higher-speed broadband internet networks to schools in poorer and more rural areas of the country.
"Helping education is an area in which we are heavily invested," said Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg. "This is how you advance social mobility and is very important to us."
He said Verizon intends to spend $400 million on such efforts over the next few years.
The Times has been betting big on subscriber growth as the overall advertising picture for media companies has eroded. Together, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. controlled 60% of the U.S. digital ad market last year, according to eMarketer Inc.
Mr. Thompson said while the program with Verizon wouldn't count toward its subscriber growth, it could pay dividends down the road as would help build brand awareness among younger audiences. Discounted student subscriptions and school programs have long been part of newspapers' efforts to establish lasting relationships with younger readers.
The Washington Post offers standard 50% discounts to university students and discounted bulk subscription packages for colleges and elementary schools. The Wall Street Journal also offers substantially discounted subscriptions to college students and low-cost, bulk packages for universities.

A Rollicking Vernacular For American Diplomacy

Texto completo: How the president deploys his "buddy-buddy" diplomatic vernacular.
Talk to Rudy Giuliani, President Trump instructed -- "highly respected man," "very capable guy," the best.
Get with Bill Barr -- "there are a lot of things that went on," Mr. Trump said, and he can "call you or your people" to sort it out.
But most importantly: "I would like you to do us a favor."
Just a favor. Just see what you can swing.
"Whatever you can do," the president said, "it's very important that you do it if that's possible."
Much is remarkable about the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump's July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which was released by the White House Wednesday following the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry. Not least is the unambiguous finding that Mr. Trump urged a foreign leader to investigate a political rival.
But in a presidency pocked with the less-than-regal vocabulary of this Washington moment -- tweets about witch hunts and hoaxes, liars and leakers -- the document is also striking for its window into the singular verbal tics and strategic instincts of the executive speaker: part flattery-laden banter ("Your economy is going to get better and better I predict"), part foreboding ambiguity ("I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation").
This is the new language of American diplomacy, a high-level conversation between two world leaders that can feel lifted from a Manhattan real estate deal -- or from a B-movie script about Manhattan real estate deals.
"He's trying to make it look like he's not asking," said Barbara A. Res, a former executive vice president of the Trump Organization. "It's not 'I want you to.' It's 'it would be good of you,' 'it would be helpful.' And I've seen him do that before. He did that with his people when he wanted you to do something that was questionable so that he could say that he didn't say it."
To surmount this obstacle, Mr. Trump seemed to rely in his call on a well-worn sleight of attribution: insisting that the thing he wants to talk about is actually a thing that everybody is talking about -- in this case, the would-be corruption of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son," Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky, "that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that."
"A lot of people are talking about that," he said at another point, explaining that he had heard about a Ukrainian prosecutor "who was very good and he was shut down and that's really unfair."
On the other end of the line, Mr. Zelensky proved himself a capable Trump scholar, affirming the American president's positions and showering him with kindnesses.
His lodging of choice in New York? "The Trump Tower."
Mr. Trump's airplane? "Probably much better than mine."
Optimal electoral strategy? "I had an opportunity to learn from you," Mr. Zelensky said. "We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge."
At times on the call, Mr. Zelensky seemed to echo Mr. Trump's own words as a candidate, pledging to surround himself with "the best and most experienced people" and "drain the swamp" in Ukraine.
The five-page memorandum of the conversation includes a note of caution on the transcript's precision, saying it is not verbatim but rather based on "notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty officers" and national security staff members. But officials said voice recognition software was used in producing the document, which includes several lengthy direct quotations. And for anyone fluent in the president's conversational rhythms, little in the document sounds discordant.
"This is the style of conversation that President Trump uses," said Joseph Borelli, a Republican New York City councilman and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump. "Occasionally informal, buddy-buddy. I think it's worked for him."
In past episodes of self-inflicted peril for Mr. Trump, allies have occasionally invoked his plain-spoken hometown as a kind of de facto defense. In 2017, former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey suggested that the president's demands of loyalty from James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, amounted to "normal New York City conversation."
Last year, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a conservative Democrat who has often aligned himself with Mr. Trump, called the president's reported wish to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, "New York talk." (In fact, rare is the overheard Q train conversation from locals seeking to fire their special counsels or sic foreign powers on their enemies.)
On Wednesday, though, Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky set off on New York talk of another sort, convening in the city where, by happenstance, they had traveled this week for the United Nations General Assembly.
Speaking to reporters, hands folded on his lap, Mr. Trump allowed that his relationship with Mr. Zelensky had become at least somewhat reciprocal. "He's made me more famous," Mr. Trump said. "And I've made him more famous."
Mr. Zelensky affected a smile. "It's better to be on TV than by phone," he said.

Texto completo: A niche form of identity theft is sweeping Instagram.
There's a well-established agreement between brands and influencers: We send free products, you post about them on Instagram. Often it's a happy arrangement; influencer feeds fill with promotional material, followers click and merchandise sells. But sometimes the posts never appear.
When this happens, the brand's representatives may assume the "entitled" influencer has either kept the product or tossed it disapprovingly without so much as a "thank you." But now another possibility has emerged: The brand might have been defrauded by an impostor.
Scammers, using throwaway email accounts and fake websites, are pretending to be influencers (or their assistants), requesting free products in exchange for prominent billing on a highly trafficked Instagram feed. Some companies, unaware that the contact is a fraud, will send up to thousands of dollars worth of merchandise to a specified address. The deception comes at a cost to both the brand and the influencer.
Jeanne Grey, who posts about fashion and beauty as @TheGreyLayers, experienced this niche form of identity theft earlier this summer. "It has been made aware to my team and I that there is someone who is using my likeness and identity to reach out to brands," she wrote to her more than 461,000 followers via Instagram Stories in July. "I have received multiple emails from brands that I'm friends with and new brands of this, most of which have fallen for it and sent out products for free." (Ms. Grey declined, through her lawyer, to speak to The New York Times.)
Natalie Pinto, known on Instagram as @TheFashionablyBroke, was also impersonated this year. "A brand reached out to me and asked me when I planned to feature the item they had sent me," Ms. Pinto said in a phone interview. "I had never spoken to them before and asked them to forward me the email. I immediately realized that it was an impostor who made a similar email address to mine." She said that at least four more brands reached out over the next few months, all claiming the same thing.
Influencing is a full-time job that can yield big returns for influencers and the brands they choose to boost. Estée Lauder spent more than $ 900 million on influencer marketing efforts in the United States alone in 2017, and the entire influencer marketing industry is set to reach $ 15 billion by 2022, according to a research report by Business Insider Intelligence using data from MediaKix. Gifting efforts have become commonplace as the sector has grown, so much so that luxury brands like Christian Dior now distribute free merchandise in exchange for social media posts.
Influencers with between 50,000 and 500,000 are the most popular targets of impersonation schemes. If the influencer's following is any larger, the scam raises red flags; if it's any smaller, brands aren't as interested. Liraz Roxy, a beauty, fashion and travel influencer who has 146,000 followers on Instagram, said that she wasn't surprised when it happened to her.
"There's a lot of companies and brands reaching out to me on a daily basis to send me stuff, makeup, clothes," she said. "There's so much going on with influencer marketing these days. People are like, 'OMG these influencers get so much free stuff, why don't I get free stuff too?"' Ms. Roxy said that, in the wake of recent influencer scams, bigger brands like Fenty Beauty, Artis Brushes and Givenchy Beauty have begun to confirm her identity via direct message before doing business with her.
Most influencers, especially those who aren't well-known enough to have formal management or public relations teams, conduct the majority of their business over email and Instagram DM. But emails are easy to spoof. Some influencers found that impostors had replaced the l's in their email addresses with capital i's. Others discovered that phony Facebook pages and websites had been created in their likeness, funneling brands to bogus contact information.
One impostor was able to obtain an Airbnb stay, a room at the Peninsula Hotel in New York and a stream of products, all at no cost, by impersonating Kirsten Alana Larsson, a photographer and travel influencer with more than 213,000 followers on Instagram. She only learned what had happened when one of the brands reached out to her verified account to confirm her identity. Afterward, she got in touch with brands she had established relationships with to inform them of the circumstances. "It erodes people's trust," she said, adding that the fraud has done irreparable damage to her career.
It's easy to think that if brands simply did their homework, impostors would be easy to spot. But managing a deluge of gift requests and sponsorships requires resources that many small businesses simply don't have. Cameron Murphy, a founder of the organic skin care line 10 Degrees Cooler, said that one impostor reached out when his company was just two months old and still producing products in small batches.
"Literally every dollar was of paramount importance," Mr. Murphy said. "This woman with hundreds of thousands of followers comes out of nowhere and is expressing interest in our products and telling us all the wonderful things she'll do to promote them. I was absolutely into the idea." Shortly after, he realized it wasn't actually the influencer who was reaching out, but an impostor. He did not send the free product. "I feel fortunate that the idea of losing a few hundred bucks or a thousand wouldn't break us," Mr. Murphy said, "but it would have been a really bad blow at that point."
For brands and influencers who have been targeted, there's almost no legal recourse. Ms. Larsson submitted a crime report to the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York but never heard back. Local authorities told her and others they couldn't help since most cases span multiple jurisdictions. "Anyone can create a Gmail address that looks like an official influencer's email address and reach out to a brand and have them send it to a P.O. box," said James Nord, the founder of Fohr, an influencer marketing platform. "There's no way to track it."
Some impostors even go so far as to deliver on a post, just not from the handle they promised. After one clothing brand sent a package containing a beige blazer to a woman they believed to be Ms. Grey to post on @TheGreyLayers, another influencer with a much smaller following posed in pictures on her own account wearing the garment. @TheSpicyCocktail, as she is known on Instagram, was not someone the company had intended to work with, and the clothing company's I.T. department confirmed that no online orders were placed for the blazer in her area.
The leather goods company Lidia May also sent a handbag to a recipient it had been led to believe was @TheGreyLayers, only for @TheSpicyCocktail to post about the bag once it had been delivered. Other brands told Ms. Grey, after she discovered her identity had been stolen, that @TheSpicyCocktail had pretended to be her in order to receive many more free items, including an iPhone case.
When reached for comment via Instagram DM, @TheSpicyCocktail, who is a minor, said that it was all a misunderstanding, but would not provide proof that she'd ever negotiated with any of the brands featured on her Instagram. First she said a family member must have orchestrated the exchange, then she said a family friend was behind it. She could provide no explanation for why she used the products in her own posts.
Mr. Nord said he would not be surprised if some of these influencer impostors were young people seeking to become influencers themselves, or disgruntled and covetous fans. "There's a lot of hate and jealousy in this space, and that hate comes out in strange ways," he said.
Miriana Rexrode, a publicist who works with influencers, said that most of the people impersonating her clients are between 9 and 15 years old. "When you're in high school or middle school, you're changing and you're trying to find yourself," Ms. Rexrode said. The internet is a place where they can try on new identities and gain clout.
"I guess they're trying to get free product to have something to post on their account, to make it look more legit," she said.

Texto completo: Did Trump improperly pressure Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, as Democrats contend? A timeline of events that led to the release of a five-page summary of Trump and Zelensky's conversation.
July 24
Special counsel Robert Mueller testifies before two House committees about Russia's "sweeping and systematic" interference in the 2016 election. Mueller found numerous contacts between Russians and Donald Trump's presidential campaign but no conspiracy to influence election results.
July 25
President Trump calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to fight corruption and suggesting he investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business interests in Ukraine when his father was vice president and working closely with the Ukrainian government.
Aug. 12
A whistleblower reports an “urgent concern” to the inspector general for national intelligence, Michael Atkinson. The New York Times and The Washington Post say the Ukraine call and whistleblower complaint are related.
Aug. 26
After preliminary review, the inspector general finds the complaint credible and reports it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.
Sept. 9
The inspector general reports the complaint without its substance to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The inspector general says Maguire disagrees that the complaint merits “urgent concern,” which would have required reporting to congressional intelligence committees within seven days.
Three House chairmen – Schiff; Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. ; and Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. – announce a wide-ranging investigation into the dealings with Ukraine by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Sept. 17
The inspector general tells Schiff that Maguire and the Justice Department have told him not to report the substance of the complaint to Congress.
Sept. 19
The House Intelligence Committee meets behind closed doors with Atkinson, who doesn’t disclose details about the complaint.
Sept. 24
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announces that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump – the culmination of a months-long investigative battle between Democrats and the White House that came to a head over the president's efforts to press Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.
Sept. 25
The Department of Justice released a five-page summary of the 30-minute conversation between Trump and Zelensky.
Sept. 26
The whistleblower's complaint that has sparked an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump is released, revealing deep concern that the president "used the power of his office" to solicit foreign help to discredit one of his main political rivals during a July telephone call with the president of Ukraine.
The whistleblower, who has not been identified publicly, went on to detail efforts by senior White House officials to later "lock down" access to all records of the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged his counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, told the House Intelligence Committee that he delayed a whistleblower complaint from being passed along to Congress because of executive privilege to protect communications with President Donald Trump.
Oct. 3
House Democrats released text messages that further fueled speculation that the White House dangled military aid and a meeting with President Donald Trump as part of an effort to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden.
The messages between Trump's then-special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and other U. S. diplomats were sent before and after Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call for "a favor" to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, on charges of corruption.
The documents describe text messages exchanges between five people:
Kurt Volker: former U. S special envoy for Ukraine
Bill Taylor: the top American diplomat in Ukraine
Gordon Sondland: U. S. Ambassador to the European Union
Rudy Giuliani: Trump's personal lawyer
Andrey Yermak: advisor to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky
An excerpt from September 9:
Read a breakdown of some of the most important messages that Democrats released here.
Oct. 6
A second whistleblower "in connection to" the allegations surrounding the call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be coming forward, according to that person's attorney.
"I can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General," tweeted attorney Andrew Bajak, whose firm Compass Rose also represents the first whistleblower.
ABC News reported that the second whistleblower – "described as an intelligence official – has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint. "

The Rev. Alison Cheek, one of first women ordained as Episcopal priests, dies at 92

Texto completo: A year after she was one of 11 women ordained in Philadelphia to the Episcopalian priesthood, at a time when the denomination's hierarchy wouldn't officially recognize them as priests, the Rev. Alison Cheek took stock of the difference between public perception and her personal calling.
“Some people call me a rebel. Well, the truth is that I'm not rebelling against anything or anybody," she told the Globe in late September 1975.
“I'm living creatively — and at a high risk. I could lose my career and some golden friendships," she added. “But, in the final analysis, what does it matter? Right now I don't have a sense of belonging — so I'm living for the moment."
The Rev. Cheek, who was one of what became known as the Philadelphia 11 when they were ordained in 1974, and who later taught at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, died Sept. 1 in her Brevard, N.C., home. She was 92. Her son Timothy told The New York Times that the cause was congestive heart failure.
She and 10 other women made history on June 29, 1974, when they were ordained at the Church of the Advocate in Philadelphia in a ceremony not authorized by the Episcopal Church's leadership.
“The church dismisses the women's movement as only secular," she told a Knight Ridder reporter in 1980. “It fails to take into account the new lifestyles and aspirations of women."
Two years after the Philadelphia 11 were ordained, the church formally allowed the ordination of women as priests. By 1985 about 600 had been ordained. In 1989, Barbara Harris became the first female Episcopal bishop. But the initial reaction was hard to endure, the Rev. Cheek said in a 40th anniversary video made for the church in 2014.
“All the nastiness that happened right after the ordination would have been unbearable if we hadn't all stuck together," she said.
After being ordained, the Rev. Cheek initially maintained her practice as a pastoral psychotherapist, yet she recalled in the 1980 interview that she immediately became a public figure.
“Those were exciting, but very painful and unusual years," she said.
Alison Mary Western was born on April 11, 1927, in Adelaide, Australia, to Hedley Western and Dora Whiting. Her father was a fruit farmer; her mother a homemaker.
She graduated from the University of Adelaide in 1947 and married Bruce M. Cheek, her economics tutor there. In 1957, when he got a job at the World Bank, they settled in Washington.
The Rev. Cheek became a lay minister for several congregations and in 1963 was one of the first two women admitted to the Virginia Theological Seminary's master of divinity program. She graduated in 1969 and became a deacon in 1972.
Two years later, she received a life-changing telephone call from Nancy Wittig, who was helping to plan the groundbreaking ordination and would become one of the Philadelphia 11. It was a recruitment pitch.
“My heart was leaping up and shouting, 'Yes, oh, yes,' " the Rev. Cheek said in an account in “The Story of the Philadelphia Eleven," a 2014 book by Darlene O'Dell, but “my body was registering symptoms of panic; my head was beginning to calculate the risks."
Those included her ability to remain in the United States, where she was on a work visa. If she were deposed by the church — permanently excluded from any ministry — it could mean, she thought, the end of her private counseling practice, which had grown out of her church training.
But, she said, she experienced an odd sensation, one similar to her reaction to her grandfather's death when she was 12: She felt that an era had ended.
“Something deep inside me recognized the inevitability of it," she wrote.
Though the House of Bishops, a church governing body, declared the ordinations of the 11 invalid, the Rev. Cheek remained defiant. “I would invite the presiding bishop and the House of Bishops into a new age," she said in a sermon that August.
In late October 1974, she and two other members of the Philadelphia 11, the Rev. Carter Hayward and the Rev. Jeannette Ridlon Piccard, celebrated the Eucharist at the interdenominational Riverside Church in New York City before 1,500 people who burst into applause when the three walked to the altar.
In a statement at the time, the women responded to a declaration by the House of Bishops that affirmed the ordination of women “in principle" but that still did not endorse the Philadelphia ceremony. They wrote: “While we rejoice in this action, we must note that women do not exist merely 'in principle.' We are people and we are priests."
Weeks later, the Rev. Cheek celebrated the Eucharist at a Washington church, whose website records the event this way:
“On November 10, 1974, the Rev. Alison Cheek stood before the altar of St. Stephen and the Incarnation Church, said the words 'On the night before he died for us, our Lord Jesus Christ broke bread,' and thus launched the public ministry of Episcopal women priests in their own church."
The Rev. Cheek was not universally embraced there, however.
“Often there is clear-cut animosity at the Communion services at which I officiate," she told the Globe in 1975. “Some people — mostly men — won't come to the rail. And, yes, there are inevitable character assassinations behind your back."
In 1977, her husband died, at 51, of a heart attack.
“It really blew me away. I'm only just beginning to feel alive again," she said in the 1980 interview, adding that her spiritual and emotional relationships at church helped her through the loss.
She subsequently became codirector of a church fund-raising program in Philadelphia. In 1996, she graduated with a doctorate from the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, where she taught and directed the feminist liberation studies program. She later became a teacher at the Greenfire women's retreat in Tenants Harbor, Maine, before retiring in 2013.
In addition to her son Timothy, she leaves two other sons, Malcolm and Jonathan; a daughter, Bronwen Cheek; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Being part of the Philadelphia 11, the Rev. Cheek said, had opened her eyes to the obstacles faced by other groups that felt marginalized by the church.
“Quite a few oppressed groups of folk then reached out to us and wanted us to come and celebrate for them," she said in the 2014 video.
In 2004, for example, she and Carter Heyward officiated at the weddings of two lesbian couples. “I feel as though my consciousness was raised, but it certainly got raised a lot higher after the ordination," the Rev. Cheek said.
In the 1980 Knight Ridder interview, she said that “for me, the roots of my feminism came out of the church."
“That's where I heard that women and men are equal, in the preaching of the Gospel, not in the structure of the institution — it's a double message women get," the Rev. Cheek added. “At the height of the Gospel, Jesus is a feminist. He doesn't put down women."

Texto completo: Common denominator of hate — guns Recently a white gunman shot and killed 13 innocent Mexican people in El Paso, Texas, just because they were of Mexican nationality. Earlier a white person in New Zealand shot and killed about 50 Muslims because they had a different religion.
Sometime ago, a young white supremacist hating blacks killed nine black parishioners in Charleston, South Carolina. Soon after, a former black soldier went to Dallas, Texas, shot and killed five white policemen and wounded others because he did not like white people, especially white policemen. After that horrendous deed, 11 innocent Jewish people were shot and killed in a synagogue simply because they were Jewish.
Around that time a black individual hating Christians, especially black pastors traveled to Atlanta with a gun intending to kill Dr. Martin Luther King’s father, but was only able to kill Dr. King’s mother and another worshipper in the church.
In Florida, a young man of Middle East origins went to the Pulse night club intending to kill everyone inside with an AK-47 rifle to express dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in Iraq and Syria killing 49 innocent gay Latino boys, their sexual orientation was not involved. A man who hated Republicans intended to kill everyone at he Republican Annual Baseball Game, only able to severely wound Rep. Scalise. Because of dissatisfaction a student in Arizona shot Democrat Rep. Gifford, only paralyzing her, killing six others in her crowd. The U.S. government’s use of force at the Branch Davidian compound, three individuals bombed the Federal Building in Omaha, killing 169 people including 15 day care children.
Where do these hateful killers come from. All that someone needs to express anger is obtain a gun and kill a number of people. Restrictions must be placed on gun purchases for the protection of the American people.
Stewart E. Brekke Downers Grove Press is protection against corruption In a recent letter to the editor Mr. Laszlo Stephan all but accused the press of being traitors in their investigation of Donald Trump and his administration.
Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but to my way of thinking, they are the only ones who are keeping this country from becoming a dictatorship.
Perhaps Mr. Stephan should take an adult course in world history to fully comprehend the danger in threatening the freedom of the press.
If Donald Trump has much to fear from The New York Times and Washington Post, it’s his own doing. The corruption he brought to the White House has only been extended as our commander in chief.
People should pray that this president isn’t given four more years to undermine our nation’s greatness.

Spaying or neutering pets has reduced euthanasia

Texto completo: You know that sense of happiness and purpose you get when you are met with wags and wet kisses or purrs and head rubs from your best friend after a long day? That describes how I felt after reading a recent analysis by the New York Times.
After examining data from municipal shelters in the nation's 20 largest cities, the Times noted a sharp decline – 75 percent since 2009 – in pet euthanasia.
To everyone who views their pets as members of their family, this is as good as it gets. And the findings are especially sweet for those of us work in the animal community, because the analysis credits spaying and neutering for the decline in the number of unwanted animals put to sleep.
Spaying/neutering pets has become the norm for responsible pet owners in America, though not everyone is sold on the idea. Some think that desexing our dogs and cats is a bad thing or can be detrimental to our pets' health. They raise some interesting points that deserve to be explored.
Myth: Spay/neuter is bad for my pet's health. My experience proves the opposite: that spay/neuter could be the single best decision you make for your pet's health. Here's why: spay/neuter helps ward off cancer and other diseases. Spaying is the only way to completely prevent pyometra, a costly and possibly deadly uterine infection, and is the only way to reduce the likelihood of breast tumors that are malignant or cancerous in about half of dogs and 90 percent of cats. Studies have shown that pets who are spayed/neutered also live the longest. Although some will say there are studies that show their negative health effects for large dogs who are spayed/neutered as puppies, these studies cover a very small portion of purebred dogs and the link between the two is unclear at best.
Myth: Spay/neuter will change my pet's behavior. The truth is that spay/neuter will improve your pet's behavior in a good way. Dogs will be less inclined to mark their territory and cats will have less of an urge to spray. Part of the reduced lifespan of unaltered pets can be attributed to their increased urge to roam, exposing them to fights with other animals, getting struck by cars and other disasters.
Myth: I don't need to spay/neuter my pets until they are older. On the contrary, the benefits of spaying/neutering pets when they are young (about 3 months and as little as three pounds) is well documented. After all, puppies and kittens can reproduce as early as 4 months of age. What's more, one female cat and her offspring can produce more than 400,000 cats, and one female dog and her offspring can produce more than 60,000 puppies. And we know that spay/neuter in puppies and kittens is very safe; they are back to normal faster than their adult counterparts.
Myth: Spay/neuter is expensive. Taking care of your pets in this way does not have to break the bank. Altered Tails is just one example of a high-volume, high-quality clinic that makes spaying/neutering pets affordable. Thanks to funding from organizations such as PetSmart Charities, the Petco Foundation, Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust and others, we are fortunate to offer spay and neuter services for an average of 75 percent less than the usual cost. You can look for specials on spay/neuter by reputable organizations too.
Since 2003, Altered Tails has performed 200,000 spay and neuter surgeries at our Phoenix and Mesa clinics. We also are one of seven Valley animal welfare groups that participate in the innovative Fix.Adopt.Save. initiative designed to reduce intake and euthanasia in community shelters. Since the initiative launched in 2012, the intake of animals into shelters has declined by 40 percent and the euthanasia rate has plummeted by 86 percent.
The benefits are clear: spaying/neutering your pet is the right thing to do.
Dr. Nellie Goetz is executive director of Altered Tails, a non-profit organization that provides accessible and affordable high-quality spay/neuter services. For more information, visit www.alteredtails.org.

Republicans sticking with Trump amid Ukraine scandal

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.

Texto completo: Virginia invested considerable resources into marking the 400th anniversary of several milestones central to the evolution of the commonwealth and the nation - and has helped spark a historical renaissance as a result.
Events included the meeting of the first elected legislature, which was formally feted in July; the arrival of women in significant numbers to the colony, which will be recognized in October; and events surrounding the first Thanksgiving, which took place in Virginia
(not Massachusetts) some four centuries ago.
While each of these carries considerable historical weight and importance, none may be as moving as the events marking the arrival of the first Africans to Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula, the moment that forever changed the trajectory of the English settlement carved out along the banks of the James River.
And none may be as far reaching - as foundation shaking - as what attention to that date has given us and the ways it may shape the prism through which we view U.S. history. The anniversary has sparked a larger national conversation about the institution of slavery and the corrosive, invasive way it shaped the nation's evolution.
Start with the program itself, a series of events that took place in August at Fort Monroe, located on Old Point Comfort and the location of the first Africans' arrival.
Yes, the weekend involved moments of heartfelt solemnity and the requisite speeches by assorted dignitaries, but organizers made a point to emphasize scholarship focused on this pivotal event and its ramifications for the eventual founding of the American republic.
Then consider the groundbreaking work of The New York Times, which produced its compelling "1619 Project" to coincide with the commemoration events in Hampton. The newspaper devoted its Sunday magazine to a series of essays that reframed the American narrative in a way that more accurately confronts the shameful legacy of slavery.
The Times also included in that weekend's paper an education supplement, to help teach that aspect of U.S. history in a way that is more inclusive of the untold number of people brought to these shores against their will, those who suffered unspeakable barbarity as a result of slavery, and the millions of people who can trace their ancestry to the fields and the plantations.
What the many respected historians, journalists and thinkers involved in the 1619 Project sought was a more honest accounting of that experience and a more thorough
understanding of how it shaped this nation.
That is the same thinking behind the three-day "1619 Making of America Summit" scheduled to begin today at Norfolk State University, a conference aimed at putting scholarship in the spotlight and reexamining the way in which we talk about how the nation's founding and growth affected those of different cultures.
Beginning with a reception and the premier of a student-led film project this evening, the conference boasts two full days of panel discussions, roundtable discussions, arts performances and lectures aimed at giving voice to the experience of African Americans, Native Americans and other people of color.
Too often these stories have been overwhelmed by a historical narrative focused on largely white, mostly European settlers who came to the New World and established the English colonies that would become a free and independent nation.
The fact is, American history involves a broad diversity of perspectives and experiences. And the figures who play key roles in that story are incredibly complex, very nuanced characters, who may be brilliant orators, respected statesmen and exceptional tacticians as well as slaveholders who treated human beings as property.
Removing the gloss from the nation's history has not been warmly welcomed in all corners, of course. Plenty of Americans would rather the founders be remembered as infallible - and they would rather not think about slavery or its legacy at all.
But for this nation to move forward, it should be willing to honestly confront its past and to teach the ugliness as well as the country's triumphs. Conferences, such as the one beginning today at Norfolk State, are invaluable to doing so.
A version of this editorial appears in The Virginian-Pilot.

"It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Texto completo: Prosecutors said they were considering whether to insert themselves in a lawsuit that argues the president cannot be criminally investigated.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan told a judge Tuesday night that they are considering inserting themselves into a lawsuit filed last week by President Trump that argued he cannot be criminally investigated while in office.
The unusual court filing suggested that the president's own Justice Department could take a position on a sweeping constitutional argument by Mr. Trump and his lawyers that has not been tested in a court.
It could also put the department in the middle of a larger dispute between Mr. Trump and the Manhattan district attorney's office, which has issued a subpoena demanding eight years of the president's personal and corporate returns.
Last week, Mr. Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit seeking to block the subpoena, arguing that a sitting president cannot be criminally investigated and releasing his tax returns would cause "irreparable harm."
The federal prosecutors said in the three-page filing that they backed the president's request for a temporary delay on the subpoena so that they could decide whether the government would offer an opinion on the "weighty constitutional issues" raised by the president's lawyers.
"In view of those constitutional issues and the federal interests that they may implicate, the United States is currently considering whether to participate," the office wrote.
The prosecutor's office did not take a position on the merits of Mr. Trump's argument.
It was unclear why the government chose to weigh in so late on a case in which it has had no formal role. But any potential involvement by the United States government would normally be approved, if not initiated by, the Justice Department in Washington.
The filing came the night before the judge, Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, was scheduled to hear arguments in the case from Mr. Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney's office.
A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Marc L. Mukasey, declined to comment on the government's filing, as did a spokesman for Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan. A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
The United States Attorney's office said that it would inform the judge by next week whether it intended to participate in the case.
Mr. Trump's lawsuit was filed in response to a subpoena issued late last month by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA.
The subpoena seeks the president's personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011. State prosecutors are investigating the role that Mr. Trump and his family business played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.
Both Mr. Trump and the company reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, the president's former lawyer and fixer, for money that Mr. Cohen paid to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the affair.
The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen said in a court filing in July that they had "effectively concluded" their investigation into possible crimes committed by the president's company, the Trump Organization, or its executives. Neither the company nor any of its leaders were charged.
However, the office of Mr. Vance, a Democrat, is exploring whether the reimbursements violated any New York state laws.
A spokesman for Mr. Vance declined to comment on the filing by federal prosecutors.
The lawsuit was the latest effort by the president and his legal team to stymie multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he would make public but has since refused to disclose.
Mr. Trump's lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats and New York lawmakers to gain access to his tax returns and financial records. They also successfully challenged a California law requiring presidential primary candidates to release their tax returns.
It is an open question whether sitting presidents are immune from prosecution while in office. The Constitution does not explicitly address the issue, and the Supreme Court has never answered the question.
Federal prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a federal crime because the Justice Department -- in memos written during the Nixon and Clinton administrations -- has decided that presidents have temporary immunity while they are in office. The memos indicate that any wrongdoing should be addressed through impeachment, not the courts.
Those memos, however, do not bind the hands of state prosecutors, and presidents have been investigated by federal authorities while in office.
In trying to block the district attorney's subpoena, Mr. Trump's lawyers had argued that a sitting president cannot be "investigated, indicted or otherwise subjected to criminal process."
"Criminal investigations impose severe burdens on the president and distract him from his constitutional duties," the lawyers said.
They also argued that the district attorney's investigation was politically motivated, calling the subpoena "a bad-faith effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law."
Mr. Vance's office, in court papers, said Mr. Trump's claim that the prosecutors were intending to expose the president's personal financial information was "purely speculative -- and, frankly, outrageous."

Trump skips climate summit, focuses on religious freedom

Texto completo: President Trump was addressing a conference for world leaders at the United Nations, but he was talking to his political base Monday as he breezed by a major climate change summit and focused instead on religious persecution, an issue that resonates with evangelical supporters who want to see him reelected next year.
The climate summit was a centerpiece of this year's UN schedule. It was not on Trump's schedule but he stopped by for about 15 minutes to observe. As he left, he said: "I'm a big believer in clean air and clean water and all countries should get together and do that, and they should do it for themselves. Very, very important."
His main event, though, was a meeting on religious persecution. Trump said it was an "urgent moral duty" for world leaders to stop crimes against faith, release prisoners of conscience, and repeal laws restricting religious liberty.
Trump's speech on Monday extends a long-running focus on international religious freedom that speaks to a key priority of his evangelical base. His administration has hosted annual meetings on the topic in Washington, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced during this year's event that he would create an international alliance dedicated to the issue.

Trump says he is worthy of a Nobel Prize for 'lot of things'
President Trump claimed Monday that he deserves a Nobel Prize for "a lot of things" but complained that the committee that hands out the awards does so unfairly.
The comment came during a bilateral meeting in New York with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan after Trump said he was "ready, willing, and able" to mediate between India and Pakistan in a decades-old dispute over the territory of Kashmir.
"If you can solve this outstanding issue of Kashmir, very likely and definitely you'll be deserving a Nobel Prize," a Pakistani journalist told Trump.
"I think I'm going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don't," Trump said.
He also alluded to President Obama's 2009 Nobel Prize, which the Norwegian Nobel Committee said was in recognition of work on nuclear nonproliferation and creating a "new climate" in international relations.
"They gave one to Obama immediately after his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it," Trump told reporters in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump has suggested he should be considered for a Nobel for his efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
Washington Post
Weld: president committed 'treason, pure and simple'
Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging President Trump for the Republican nomination next year, on Monday accused him of "treason" for pressing the leader of Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
Weld's comments came in response to reports that Trump repeatedly brought up investigating Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic nomination, and his younger son, Hunter, in a July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a US election," Weld said during an appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." "It couldn't be clearer, and that's not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It's treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the US code is death. That's the only penalty."
"The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office, and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the president if he could work out a plea deal," added Weld, who appeared in a joint interview with two other Republicans challenging Trump, former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford, and former congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois.

November debate thresholds will imperil more campaigns
The Democratic National Committee revealed new qualification rules for the November debates Monday that could kick several more candidates off the stage, as party leaders continue to push for a smaller field in the presidential nomination fight.
Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey, former housing secretary Julián Castro, businessman Andrew Yang, and businessman Tom Steyer could all fail to qualify for the November debates if they do not improve their polling standing.
Under the new rules, candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from October. They will also have to meet a polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the national party, or by receiving 5 percent or more in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.
The polls must be released between Sept. 13 and one week before the date of the November debate, which has not yet been announced.
Castro has not received at least 3 percent in a party-sanctioned poll since late June. Booker's last poll at that level came in mid-August. Klobuchar hit 3 percent in an Iowa poll this weekend, her first since early August. Yang also regularly falls below the 3 percent threshold, though he notched 4 percent in a national September survey.

Times publisher warns of perils to a free press
PROVIDENCE — President Trump's anti-press rhetoric is undermining trust in American media and emboldening authoritarian leaders worldwide to crack down on reporters, New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger said at Brown University on Monday.
Sulzberger, who graduated from Brown in 2003 and first worked as a reporter at The Providence Journal, spoke to hundreds of people packed into a Brown auditorium delivering a speech titled “Free Press in Peril: The Growing Threats to Journalism Around the World."
US leaders have long understood that press freedom is one of the nation's “greatest exports," Sulzberger said.
“The current administration, however, has retreated from our country's historic role as defender of the free press," he said. “And seeing that, other countries are targeting their own journalists with a growing sense of impunity."
That isn't just a problem for reporters, he said.
“It's a problem for everyone , because this is how authoritarian leaders bury critical information, hide corruption, and even justify genocide," Sulzberger said. “As John McCain once warned, when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press."
Sulzberger said press freedom has been “an area of enduring consensus" among Americans from different political parties and ideologies.
He noted former president Reagan once said, “There is no more essential ingredient than a free, strong, and independent press to our continued success in what the founding fathers called our 'noble experiment' in self-government.' "

Ross Douthat: Does Trump want to be impeached?

Texto completo: When it comes to determining when it makes sense to impeach a president, congressional Democrats are working with 200 words in the Constitution, three significant historical precedents, the fervor of impeachment advocates, the anxieties of swing-state members of Congress and all the polling data that a modern political party can buy.
None of this, unfortunately, tells them what to do when the president in question actually wants them to impeach him.
That Donald Trump actually wants to be impeached is an argument that Ben Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist, has been making for some time — that the president isn’t stumbling backward toward impeachment, but is actually eager for the fight.
In his email newsletter Monday morning, Domenech cited the last few days of Ukraine-related agitation as vindication, arguing that the circus atmosphere of congressional hearings, scenes of Joe Biden talking about corruption instead of health care or the economy, and wavering House Democrats getting forced into an impeachment vote by their angry colleagues and constituents are all exactly what Trump wants.
For my own part I think wants is probably an overstatement, since it implies a strategic purpose, a permanent intention and a stable mental state, none of which should be assumed when analyzing the president of the United States. But let’s go this far with Domenech: A president who escapes unscathed from an investigation into his campaign’s collusion with a foreign government and then the day after Robert Mueller’s testimony is on the phone jawboning a foreign government to help out his presidential campaign — does that president seem like a man who’s particularly worried about being impeached? Who’s terribly concerned with avoiding having articles filed, a Senate trial, the works? I would say … not.
And why might Trump be so unconcerned? Maybe, as impeachment advocates insist, he just thinks Democrats are too gutless to defend the Constitution, too weak to oppose his lawlessness. But it’s also possible (and yes, now I’m going to assume his rationality, having just warned against that, sorry) that he might see four upsides to impeachment, four gifts to his presidency and perhaps his post-presidency that an impeachment and a trial might bring.
First, if the Democrats impeach him they will be doing something unpopular instead of something popular. Maybe the polls showing impeachment’s unpopularity will alter as the Ukraine story develops. Maybe public hearings will deliver a series of blows that persuades the large anti-Trump, anti-impeachment constituency that his expedited removal from office is desirable or necessary. But the current shape of public opinion is the boring, basic reason that Trump seems to want to be impeached more than Nancy Pelosi wants to impeach him: The Democratic agenda is more popular than the Republican agenda (whatever that is), the likely Democratic nominees are all more popular than Trump, and so anything that puts the Democrats on the wrong side of public opinion may look better, through Trump’s eyes, than the status quo.
Second, Trump is happy to pit his overt abuses of power against the soft corruption of his foes. This is an aspect of Trumpism that the president’s critics find particularly infuriating — the way he attacks his rivals for being corrupt swamp creatures while being so much more nakedly compromised himself. But whether the subject is the Clinton Foundation’s influence-peddling or now the Biden family’s variation on that theme, Trump has always sold himself as the candidate of a more honest form of graft — presenting his open cynicism as preferable to carefully legal self-dealing, exquisitely laundered self-enrichment, the spirit of “hey, it’s totally normal for the vice president’s son to get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the Ukrainians or the Chinese so long as every disclosure form gets filled out and his dad doesn’t talk to him about the business.”
In fact this sort of elite seaminess is bad, but what Trump offers isn’t preferable: Hypocrisy is better than naked vice, soft corruption is better than the more open sort, and what the president appears to have done in leaning on the Ukrainian government is much worse than Hunter Biden’s overseas arrangements. But no one should be surprised that some voters in our age of mistrust and fragmentation and despair prefer the honest graft — some in Trump’s base, and also some in the ranks of the alienated and aggrieved middle, the peculiar Obama-Trump constituency.
Indeed, history is replete with “boss”-style politicians who got away with corruption because they were seen as the rough, effective alternative to a smug, hypocritical elite. Trump’s crucial political weakness is that unlike those bosses, he hasn’t delivered that much to many of his voters. But that may make him all the more eager to return to the politics of comparative corruption, to have the argument again about whether he’s more ethically challenged than the swamp. He may not win it, but at least he’s playing a part that he knows well.
Third, an impeachment battle would give Trump a last chance to solidify his hold on the souls and reputations of his possible Republican successors. To understand what I mean, consider Jonathan V. Last’s explanation of why so few Republican elected officials are likely to break with Trump, no matter how Nixonian his straits become:
“One of the reasons Republicans were able to pressure Nixon to resign was that they knew Nixon cared about the institution of the Republican Party.
“Another reason is that they knew that Nixon would go away and keep quiet in a self-imposed exile after his presidency. He wasn’t going to spend his winter years taking shots at (Charles) Wiggins and Goldwater and Ford on Twitter 15 times a day.
“Neither of those assumptions are operable with Trump.”
This doesn’t just explain why Trump thinks he can survive an impeachment fight; it also explains why he might relish it. He knows that he could well lose the next election, but there’s no reason a mere general-election defeat will prevent him from wielding power over the Republican Party, via Twitter and other means, for many years to come. And what better way to consolidate that power (or at least the feeling of that power) in the last year of his administration than seeing all his would-be successors, all the bright younger men of the Senate especially, come down and kiss the ring one last time?
Come on down, Marco Rubio! Step right up, Ben Sasse! Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, the history books are watching: Tell us one more time, just one more time, how completely Donald Trump the Great owns your vote, your principles, your honor!
Which brings us to the last reason Trump might kind of like to be impeached: Because the circus is the part of politics that he fundamentally enjoys. Throughout the Mueller investigation my Twitter feed was alight with liberal and NeverTrump fantasies about how Trump must be bed-wetting, flop-sweat terrified by the tough G-man’s investigation. And maybe at times he was. But I’m pretty sure that when he ranted on Twitter about the “Twelve Angry Democrats” and “WITCH HUNT” and “NO COLLUSION,” he was more engaged, more alive, more fully his full self than at any point during the legislative battles over tax reform or Obamacare repeal.
And Robert Mueller’s was a legal investigation, with the power to actually put people in Trump’s inner circle in prison. A merely political trial, where the worst-case scenario is a political martyrdom that Sean Hannity will sing of ever after, seems to offer Trump a much lower-stress variation on that experience. Why, the nicknames for the impeachment managers alone will be a Trumpian banquet, a veritable feast!
None of this, I should stress, adds up to an airtight argument that the Democrats should not impeach. Nine months ago I made a case against impeachment, and many of the arguments in that essay might apply to this case — depending on how far it turns out Trump went in pressuring Ukraine. But politics is a contact sport, a field for combat as well as for maneuver, and just because someone wants a fight doesn’t mean that you should never, ever give him one. The dictum about wrestling a pig (you get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it) doesn’t hold up if the pig keeps punching you; the dictum that it’s better to beat Trump at the polls than lose a Senate vote probably doesn’t hold up if you talk yourself into looking permanently supine in the face of indubitable corruption.
Much of the Trump era has consisted of politicians of both parties waiting for someone else to give Trump a knockout blow. So there’s something to be said, at the level of spiritedness if not necessarily strategy, for House Democrats to take a swing themselves.
But my ultimate guess is that none of this matters quite as much as some impeachment arguers suppose. An impeachment effort could be both foredoomed and unlikely to influence the 2020 outcome all that much, so Nancy Pelosi might be wise to forestall one but also find herself with few regrets if one gets forced on her.
The nature of the Trump era is that yuge events recede far more rapidly than anyone expects. So it might be with impeachment: Have the vote or don’t have it, we’ll be arguing about something completely different by the time Americans are going to the polls.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – La Casa Blanca prevé entregar al Congreso de Estados Unidos una copia de la queja interna sobre la llamada del presidente Donald Trump con su homólogo ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, que ha provocado el inicio de un proceso de “impeachment”, según medios.
El Gobierno se había negado hasta ahora a dar este paso, pero según The New York Times y Politico, tras el inicio formal del proceso de juicio político la Casa Blanca cambió su estrategia.
De acuerdo a los planes descritos por fuentes conocedoras de la cuestión, se hará entrega de la copia de la queja a finales de semana, junto al informe que elaboró el receptor de la filtración: el inspector general de la Comunidad de Inteligencia, Michael Atkinson.
El rotativo neoyorquino, además, también indicó que el Gobierno sopesa permitir que el filtrador, cuya identidad no se ha revelado, pueda reunirse con los investigadores del Congreso.
Estos movimientos son una muestra de la seriedad con la que la Casa Blanca ha recibido el inicio de la investigación sobre un juicio político contra Trump.
Está previsto también que este miércoles la Casa Blanca divulgue la transcripción de la llamada que mantuvieron Trump y Zelensky el pasado 25 de julio, origen de todo este terremoto político.
En esa llamada, el presidente estadounidense pidió a Zelensky que investigase al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter por supuestos actos de corrupción en Ucrania.
Además, Trump supuestamente bloqueó cerca de 400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar para Ucrania con tal de coaccionar a su Gobierno para que abriese esa investigación, unos fondos que finalmente transfirieron el pasado 11 de septiembre.
La presidenta de la Cámara Baja de Estados Unidos, la demócrata Nancy Pelosi, anunció este martes que abrirá una investigación de juicio político contra Trump por haber “traicionado” la seguridad nacional y la Constitución.
Trump consideró esa decisión como una “basura” y una “caza de brujas”.
Más tarde, la Casa Blanca emitió un comunicado en el que afirmó que “lejos del trabajo y los resultados de este presidente, los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes han destruido cualquier posibilidad de avance legislativo para el pueblo al seguir centrando toda su energía en ataques políticos partidistas”.
“Sus ataques contra el presidente y su agenda no solo son partidistas y patéticos, sino que incumplen su deber constitucional”, añadió el comunicado.
------------
* Nancy Pelosi anuncia oficialmente la investigación para un juicio político contra Trump
* ¿Qué es un juicio político y qué podría pasar con Donald Trump?

DNC tightens presidential debate qualifications

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee on Monday released its latest rules for candidates qualifying for the November presidential debate, likely narrowing the field and putting pressure on Texans Beto O'Rourke and Julián Castro.
To qualify for the November debate, candidates must meet one of two polling requirements and reach 165,000 unique donors, with 600 unique donors in at least 20 states. Candidates can receive 3% support in at least four qualifying polls or 5% support in two polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. The polls must be released between Sept. 13 and seven days prior to the November debate. The debate date hasn't been announced.
Only 10 candidates qualified for the September debate, and the new rules are expected to winnow the number of candidates who make the stage in November. A New York Times analysis found that at least eight candidates have met the 165,000-donor threshold. Only three qualifying polls have been released since Sept. 13.
The new qualifications could squeeze Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and U.S. housing secretary, and O'Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso. The two have consistently polled in the low single digits, although O'Rourke seems to have a better chance of meeting the new qualifications.
O'Rourke hit 4% in a qualifying Fox News poll last week and a campaign spokesman said he's reached the DNC's new donor requirements.
Castro has yet to reach that polling threshold, often polling below 1%. His campaign did not return a request for comment.
Both Castro and O'Rourke have met the qualifications for the fourth debate in October at Otterbein University in Ohio, which required 130,000 unique donors and 2% support in polling, the same qualifications as this month's Houston debate.

Trump denies seeking probe

Texto completo: President Donald Trump denied Monday that he had offered military aid to the president of Ukraine only if the country launched a probe into former Vice President Joe Biden and his family, as the burgeoning controversy consumed the first day of Trump's visit to the United Nations General Assembly.
"No, I didn't," Trump said when asked whether he told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would obtain $250 million in stalled U.S. aid only if he agreed to investigate the Bidens. Slamming the former vice president for doing what he said was a "very, very bad thing," Trump added: "I didn't do it ... when you see the call (transcript), you're going to be very surprised."
Trump's comments came a day after he appeared to confirm that he mentioned Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the call with Zelenskiy. The call is part of a whistleblower's complaint, according to people familiar with the matter.
Democrats are ramping up pressure on the Trump administration to release documents related to the Ukraine controversy. On Monday afternoon, the chairmen of three House committees sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatening subpoenas if the administration does not turn over the materials.
"Seeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the president is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in the letter.
They argued that Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, "now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election."
Since spring, Giuliani has pushed the Ukrainians to investigate a gas tycoon who had Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma Holdings starting in 2014. According to The New York Times, Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 some months for his work.
The nonprofit government watchdog group Common Cause on Monday also filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice on the matter. The organization accused Trump and Giuliani of illegally soliciting a political contribution from Zelenskiy and Ukranian officials by allegedly urging them to investigate Biden.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., meanwhile, accused Democrats of politicizing the whistleblower complaint. He made no mention of Trump's alleged actions but argued the Senate Intelligence Committee should be allowed to deal with the matter "in a secure setting with adequate protections in a bipartisan fashion."
Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of impropriety on the part of Biden and his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that Trump pushed Zelenskiy to investigate, according to people familiar with the matter.
Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has been unwilling to turn over the whistleblower complaint to Congress, a refusal that has rankled Democrats and heightened calls to impeach Trump. The whistleblower, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, is said to be an intelligence official.
Questioned by reporters during a one-on-one meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda earlier Monday, Trump insisted that he "put no pressure on them whatsoever," as public scrutiny continued to mount on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy during which Trump purportedly pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens.
"I hope you get to see the call," Trump said, referring to a transcript of the conversation that he has faced pressure to release. "I did not make a statement that, 'You have to do this or I'm not going to give you A.' I wouldn't do that."
Still, Trump was noncommittal on whether the transcript of that call would be released, telling reporters that it would not set a good precedent. And he escalated his attacks on Biden, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
"If that ever happened, if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the electric chair right now," Trump said.
Earlier, he had questioned the patriotism of the whistleblower whose complaint about Trump had put the focus on the July 25 call.
"Also, who is this so-called 'whistleblower' who doesn't know the correct facts," Trump said in a tweet as he attended a United Nations gathering in New York. "Is he on our Country's side. Where does he come from."
Speaking to reporters as he arrived at the United Nations, Trump also appeared to acknowledge that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was part of the conversation.
"It's very important to talk about corruption," Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about the contents of the call. "If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country you think is corrupt? One of the reasons the new president got elected is he was going to stop corruption, so it's very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption."
Trump said that he is not worried about impeachment and that "the one who's got the problem is Biden."
Democrats say asking Ukraine to find damaging information on a potential 2020 rival could amount to another attempt to involve a foreign power in U.S. elections. Intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, a claim he denies.

Texto completo: The soldier, based in Fort Riley, Kan., discussed plans to attack a major news network and suggested targeting Beto O'Rourke, the authorities said.
Federal authorities have arrested a United States soldier who discussed plans to attack a major American news network, shared detailed instructions online about how to build explosives and suggested that Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic presidential candidate, could be a potential target, the authorities said.
The soldier, Jarrett William Smith, a specialist assigned to the First Infantry Division in Fort Riley, Kan., had also once expressed a desire to travel to Ukraine to fight with a far-right paramilitary group, the authorities said.
Specialist Smith, 24, was arrested over the weekend and charged in federal court in Topeka, Kan., on Monday. He faces one count of distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction, according to the United States Attorney's Office in Kansas.
If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.
Before enlisting in the Army, Specialist Smith talked about his desire to fight in Ukraine with a far-right paramilitary group, according to an F.B.I. affidavit in the case that cited his social media exchange with another man who traveled there to fight.
"If I cannot find a slot in Ukraine by October I'll be going into the Army," he wrote in a June 2016 exchange, according to the affidavit. "To fight is what I want to do."
He joined the Army the next year.
In recent months, Specialist Smith shared on social media specific instructions for how to make bombs, the authorities said. The comments came in group chats and in conversations with a confidential source and an undercover F.B.I. agent, according to the affidavit.
In August, he discussed a plan to lead an attack in the United States and said he was looking for other "radicals" like himself, the authorities said.
In one exchange, according to the affidavit, he talked about killing members of antifa, a coalition of activists that has surfaced in recent years to oppose fascist, racist and far-right groups. In another, he suggested attacking the headquarters of an unnamed "major news network" with a vehicle full of explosive materials.
As recently as Friday, the authorities said, he offered instructions to an undercover agent about how to build an explosive with household chemicals and other common equipment. "Making AK-47s out of expensive parts is cool," he said, according to the affidavit. But imagine, he said, "going to Walmart instead of gun store to buy weapons."
When the undercover agent suggested a desire to target a Texas politician, Specialist Smith suggested Mr. O'Rourke, the former congressman from El Paso who has made gun control a central platform in his bid for the presidency, according to excerpts from the conversation included in the affidavit.
"You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction and death?" the agent asked on an encrypted messaging service.
"Outside of Beto?" Specialist Smith said, according to the affidavit. "I don't know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died."
The F.B.I. arrested Specialist Smith the next day.
A spokesman said Monday that the Army was aware of the allegations against Specialist Smith and had cooperated with the F.B.I. on his arrest. "These allegations violate our Army values so we take them very seriously," the Army said in a statement.
Some watchdog groups have warned that the armed forces can serve as a training and recruiting ground for extremists and that some groups encourage their newer members to enlist to get weapons training. In February, the authorities arrested a Coast Guard lieutenant and self-described white nationalist who is accused of plotting to kill prominent journalists and Democratic politicians, according to court documents.
After he enlisted, Specialist Smith received training at Fort Benning, Ga., and was stationed at Fort Bliss, Tex., from late 2017 until he transferred to Fort Riley, Kan., this summer, according to the Army and court records.
He had not been deployed, the Army said.
In an interview with the F.B.I., the authorities said, Specialist Smith acknowledged that he routinely gave instructions on how to build explosives in online chat rooms, even when others said they planned to use the information to hurt people.
According to the affidavit, he said he did so to cause "chaos."

‘Legacy’ college admissions are Affirmative Action for rich white people

Texto completo: Conservatives rightfully criticize race-based Affirmative Action policies. But with a new report exposing the prevalence and injustice of athletic and legacy-based admissions at top universities like Harvard, it’s time we add legacy admissions as a target of our outrage, too.
An academic paper titled “Legacy and Athlete Preferences at Harvard” examined the prevalence and implications of legacy-based admissions. As Robert VerBruggen makes clear in his analysis of the paper for National Review, legacy admissions pose a bigger problem than we may have realized and they essentially amount to Affirmative Action for rich white people.
The paper categorized “ALDC” students as those who receive admission preferences “for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff.” Essentially, these students gain admission not on the basis of academic merit. Researchers found that roughly 3 in 4 of white ALDC students “would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDC,” and that ALDC status recipients were disproportionately white.
The unfairness on display in Harvard’s admissions policies is astounding. These students largely come from extremely privileged backgrounds, but admissions officers are handing them a golden ticket to the #1 university in the country on the basis of who their parents are, how much their parents can donate, or how well they can dribble a basketball.
Conservatives oppose Affirmative Action for its unfair tipping of the scales, but as VerBruggen notes, these kinds of legacy admissions are even worse. He writes:
These preferences exist not as an attempt, however misguided, to redress America’s reprehensible racial sins but merely to heap more donations on top of Harvard’s $37 billion endowment and to cultivate an amorphous sense of community based around sports teams and family members who attended the school decades ago.
And this isn’t some rare phenomena, just affecting a few students in and around the margins. According to VerBruggen’s calculations, “about 30% of students admitted to Harvard are ALDCs.” Think about that: If three in four of these are undeserving, that amounts to 22.5% of Harvard’s student body that wouldn't otherwise be admitted on academic merit. In what universe is that acceptable?
And that’s not even counting the university’s blatantly discriminatory, race-based Affirmative Action standards that currently cheat Asian Americans. Harvard consistently rates Asian-American applicants lower on “personality” measures, according to the New York Times, just as it once did decades ago in order to limit admittance of Jews. If Harvard had race-blind admissions, Asian Americans would constitute a significantly larger percentage of the student body, suggesting that they’re held to higher standards and possibly even restricted with an informal racial quota.
Unlike racial discrimination against Asians, legacy admissions are permissible at private institutions. Still, both practices are unfair, and both ought to be terminated.

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn't believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy - the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government - would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
"The Guardrails Hold," exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump's bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August of 2017. It has since become painfully clear Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Trump's transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Trump's bid to rig the census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Senate? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of "fake news." The New York Times reported that Trump committed "outright fraud" as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week's news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Trump from questioning over allegations of still-unrevealed misconduct. It seems Trump, who has a history of cavalier behavior with classified information - he once blurted intelligence secrets to Russians in the Oval Office - had an interaction with a foreign leader wherein he made an unspecified "promise" that so troubled one official it led to the filing of a formal whistleblower complaint.
As first reported by the Washington Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of "urgent concern." That's a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to provide that information to lawmakers.
It's important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Trump has long been at war with that state.
At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportedly were threatened with termination for contradicting Trump's claim - he tried to prove it by altering a map with a Sharpie - that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here's the acting DNI throwing his body between Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy's fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one - a government of, by and for the people - is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They'll be lucky if they can save themselves.

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
When Jo Ellen Pellman and her roommate searched for an apartment in New York City this summer, the two women dug deep into their pockets: They paid brokers a total of $ 1,200 in nonrefundable application fees, or $ 400 for each apartment they applied for.
But the roommates may get most of their money back, a rare happy outcome in today's costly real estate market, after state regulators declared last week that real estate brokers must abide by a recently enacted $ 20-limit on application fees.
"We got $ 800 back, which is very awesome," said Ms. Pellman, 23, an actor who moved to a two-bedroom apartment in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn this month.
Months after New York passed sweeping tenant protections, including the $ 20 ceiling on application fees, many real estate brokers across New York City continued to charge renters like Ms. Pellman hundreds of dollars to apply for an apartment.
The new laws said landlords could not charge more than $ 20, but it made no mention of brokers, who are often the go-betweens to secure an apartment in the city. The ambiguity led to months of confusion as renters forked over large fees, and lawmakers and real estate professionals blamed each other for the fiasco.
But on Sept. 13, a state agency finally stepped in to provide some clarity: Brokers acting on behalf of landlords cannot charge tenants more than $ 20 in application fees, which can only be used to cover background or credit checks.
So said a two-page guidance memo from the New York Department of State. It was a source of good news for the countless renters who found an apartment after the new cap passed in mid-June and may have been overcharged.
The memo did not specify whether renters illegally charged were entitled to a refund, but Ms. Pellman recently contacted two brokerage firms, Corcoran and Nooklyn, informing them of the new laws -- and got a rebate from each.
"I just think it's ridiculous the way brokers and landlords profit on tenants not knowing their rights," said Ms. Pellman, who shared on Instagram a template of the email she sent. "I don't like getting scammed and I don't want anyone else to get scammed."
She said Rentopia, the firm through which they secured their apartment, had not answered her emails requesting a refund and she's worried her landlord may penalize her for speaking up. Her broker at Rentopia did not respond to a request for comment.
But Ariel Dagan, a real estate broker for Compass, said that limiting application fees could be detrimental to agencies that relied heavily on them to make a profit.
"These fees are what keeps some brokerage firms in business," said Mr. Dagan, who also runs PreApproved Renter, a software platform that helps landlords process rental applications.
Mr. Dagan said there were other unintended consequences that could place brokers in a bind.
Under the new laws, landlords and brokers are required to provide tenants with an invoice and copy of any background or credit checks they conducted. But Mr. Dagan said that provision may be at odds with credit-reporting agency rules, which typically bar clients who use their services from sharing credit reports with others.
Representatives for TransUnion and Experian, two of the largest credit-reporting agencies in the country, said their rules do not prohibit landlords from sharing reports with consumers.
A prospective tenant can also waive an application fee if they provide the broker or landlord with a copy of a background or credit check conducted within the past 30 days. That, Mr. Dagan said, could lead to the submission of phony documents.
Brokers are facing additional pressure this year from the City Council, which is considering a bill that would limit brokers' fees to one month's rent. That would lower housing costs for tenants, while curbing a broker's earnings.
"I think it's ridiculous," Mr. Dagan said.
"It's not a glamorous job. It's a grind," he added about real estate agents. "It would cap middle-class workers' pay and this is a progressive city."
The cap on application fees applies statewide, and enforcement issues have reverberated far beyond the five boroughs.
Susan Segal recently helped her son, a student at Syracuse University, apply for an off-campus apartment, for which the management company charged $ 300 in application fees. She emailed the company to ask for a refund after she learned of the new laws, but has yet to hear back.
"I would be willing to bet that apartment owners in areas with high student populations might be particularly prone to ignoring the law, given that college students may not know or have the wherewithal to protest illegal practices," Ms. Segal said.
The memo from the state included additional guidance: It specified that a real estate agent paid by a renter to find an apartment is allowed to charge more than $ 20 in application fees and that brokers who violate the law may be disciplined by the Department of State, which regulates and licenses real estate brokers and agents.
But the memo left unanswered many other questions about the impact of the new rent laws, which were propelled by recently elected Democrats in the state Legislature to address skyrocketing housing costs.
It was not clear, for example, whether $ 20 is the maximum fee per application or per person. In response to questions from The New York Times, Department of State officials clarified on Wednesday that brokers were allowed to charge $ 20 per applicant, not application. For example, three roommates could each be charged $ 20, or a total of $ 60, to apply for an apartment.
Also in question is how the new limits on fees and security deposits (now capped at one month's rent) might inadvertently apply to the rental and sale of co-ops and condominiums, which typically involve hundreds to thousands of dollars in application fees.
In a statement to The Times, the Department of State said it does not regulate or license co-op and condo boards, so it could only dictate rules for brokers and agents.
It said that a broker cannot charge more than $ 20 on behalf of a co-op or condo board "when the particular apartment is owned by, and being leased by, that particular board." If the board is not the owner or shareholder of the apartment, then a broker is free to charge more than $ 20.
It is unclear whether property-management companies, which often handle leases and applications on behalf of condo and co-op boards, are free to charge more than $ 20 in fees. In interviews, real estate attorneys gave conflicting accounts on their reading of the law.
Carl Hum, the general counsel for the Real Estate Board of New York, an influential trade group, said property managers could continue to charge more than $ 20 in fees.
But some lawyers, like Jeffrey Schwartz, who advises co-op and condo boards, said he is recommending his clients err on the side of caution and abide by the $ 20 cap as a result of the ambiguity in the new laws.
"I think the issuance of the guidance is actually creating more confusion than clarifying," said Mr. Schwartz, who hopes the state will pass new legislation to exclude co-ops and condos from many of the new rent laws.
The lack of clarity has left some co-op applicants in limbo.
One co-op board in Manhattan recently charged an applicant an assortment of nonrefundable fees totaling about $ 1,350. The renter, Jeff, who preferred to use only his first name because he is still going through the co-op's interview process, said the large fees appeared to be against the law.
"But I don't want to argue fees with the co-op board because it's already so competitive to get here in the first place," he said. "I don't want to rock the boat."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: SAN JUAN - The giant protests are gone now from the streets of Puerto Rico, much like the old governor they ousted in what came to be known as "la revoluci�n de verano," the summer revolution.
What remains, besides flag murals and graffiti slogans, are more modest gatherings asking a more complicated question: What do Puerto Ricans want their future to look like?
"We want another Puerto Rico," said Jennifer Mota Castillo, 33, one of about 120 people who attended a recent "people's assembly" at a public square in San Juan, the capital. "And we don't want this to fall again into the hands of the government, which has failed us year after year."
Their hopes are as diverse as this island of 3.2 million people: finding adequate housing for tens of thousands of Hurricane Maria survivors still living under leaky tarps, protecting neighborhoods from new zoning that would allow big commercial developers to come in, and supporting local growers to reduce the reliance on imported food, which became scarce after the storm.
The people's assemblies are a new phenomenon that sprang up in the wake of this summer's protests. Puerto Rico has a long history of activism, but never had people outside of labor unions, political parties and other organized groups gathered with tailgate chairs and clipboards to discuss what they call "auto-gesti�n," or self-management.
"One has to dream," said Prixda Santos, 66, who is working to turn an abandoned school into a community center in the municipality of Cidra. "If we don't dream, we are badly off."
Few in Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, might have imagined two years ago that from the ruins of the Sept. 20, 2017, storm that wrecked almost every corner of the island would rise a grassroots movement mighty enough to unseat a governor and inspire a new wave of civic activism.
Former Gov. Ricardo Rossell� stepped down in August following a feverish popular uprising that lasted 15 days. Puerto Ricans still taking stock of the momentous power shift point to the deadly aftermath of Maria and the government's inability to provide for its citizens afterward as the driving forces behind the summer's unrest - along with continuing anger over widespread corruption.
"What Maria did was very important in political terms: It showed that the government of Puerto Rico was the equivalent of a failed state," said Emilio Pantojas Garc�a, a sociology professor at the University of Puerto Rico. "We survived Hurricane Maria because of solidarity among churches, community organizations, neighbors. The government never arrived."
The new governor, Wanda V�zquez, who used to be the secretary of justice, has managed to stay in office despite early signals from her own party that ambitious leaders might try to push her out. V�zquez has said she will not be a candidate in 2020 and has not nominated a secretary of state to serve as her lieutenant governor, a decision that could trigger internal machinations within the ruling New Progressive Party, which supports statehood for Puerto Rico. ago.

Texto completo: WAPAKONETA - Renewed calls for impeachment didn’t dampen the mood here on Sunday when President Donald Trump visited Wapakoneta’s Pratt Industries paper mill and corrugated box plant, a $500 million investment that will create up to 300 new jobs within the next several years.
Instead, President Trump took a victory lap on jobs and the economy, a message which the crowd of some 1,500 supporters was more than happy to hear.
“It’s good for Wapakoneta. Neil went to the moon and now we’ve got Australia coming to Wapak,” said Vicki Kuhn, a self-employed cleaner in Wapakoneta.
The $500 million investment from Pratt Industries to build a paper mill and box factory in Wapakoneta is a “very big thing” for the town of 10,000, according to Bryan Stombaugh, a production engineer for Pratt Industries in Wapakoneta.
“(They’re) bringing lots of well-paying jobs,” Stombaugh said. “It’s great for the community.”
Trump stuck to his script for much of the evening, avoiding mention of the rising chorus for impeachment from Democrats following reports that the president allegedly asked the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter’s business dealings.
The president spent much of the weekend tweeting about the incident and resumed tweeting shortly after leaving Wapakoneta.
Before departing Houston for Wapakoneta, Trump told reporters that his conversation was “largely congratulatory” and that “we don’t want our people like Vice President Joe Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,” according to the New York Times.
But Trump’s supporters are skeptical the latest calls for impeachment have merit.
“Leave it alone. The people voted him in. Let it go,” said Kuhn, who attended Sunday’s event at Pratt Industries. “That’s what the people wanted.”
“The constitution allows the impeachment process to be able to protect you and me from a president who is just rogue. They are just using it without any, he hasn’t done anything,” said David Aikin, of Sidney, Ohio. “The Mueller investigation is a really good example. That was the first time in American history that there was ever any kind of investigation when there wasn’t a crime. They opened the investigation to find the crime.
“They didn’t find a crime but then they tried to get him for obstruction. But if it wasn’t a crime, what was he obstructing? Nothing. I mean, it’s a who great big net of deception. He’s fighting it pretty well.”

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday he hasn't spoken to his son Hunter Biden about his overseas businesses while forcefully calling again for an investigation into President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president.
“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said. “Here’s what I know. Trump should be investigated. ”
“You should be looking at Trump," Biden told reporters in Des Moines shortly after arriving at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual Democratic fundraiser. “He’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum. And he’s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me . . . Ask the right questions. ”
The comments by the former vice president are the latest in a back-and-forth between Biden and Trump related to Trump's reported discussions with the Ukrainian president, a whistleblower complaint involving Trump, and Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.
Explaining the Trump, Biden, Ukraine story: What to know about the Trump-Congress standoff over a whistleblower complaint
Multiple news outlets reported this week that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing that community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader.
Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
Hunter Biden, however, told the New Yorker in an interview for an article published in July that he discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas producer, with his father in December 2015. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on Burisma‘s board of directors.
Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue with the Vice President, according to the article. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he and his father spoke about Burisma just once.
“‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing,” and I said, ‘I do,’ ” the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.
The Biden campaign declined to comment on the reported December 2015 conversation.
Before Biden's comments, Trump fired off several tweets Saturday morning, defending himself and his phone call with Zelensky as a "fine and routine conversation. "
"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster," Trump tweeted.
Biden briefly addressed supporters at a pre-steak fry rally Saturday and warned that Trump would try to murky the waters as the election cycle heats up.
“Be prepared for every lousy thing coming from him,” Biden said.
What has happened already
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.

Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Still, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.
“Look at Joe Biden … he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don’t you dare prosecute,'" Trump said in the interview. "'If you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — the prosecutor was after his son — then he said, ‘If you fire the prosecutor, you’ll be OK. And if you don’t fire the prosecutor, we’re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,’ or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?"

Texto completo: No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment. "These newest revelations are disturbing," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's "place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former vice president Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and "follow the evidence to wherever it leads." That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were "like an adrenaline shot" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to "get real." "We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'" Durbin said. "It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said "no."
Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could "restructure" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, "26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same." As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

Grassley let us down by forcing Kavanaugh vote

Texto completo: The U.S. House Judiciary Committee has, appropriately, opened an investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation last year, in the wake of evidence of a previously undisclosed allegation of sexual misconduct against him involving his college days. That information was reported over the weekend by New York Times reporters who found in the course of writing a book about Kavanaugh that the FBI was made aware of the incident before Kavanaugh's confirmation, but didn't investigate it.
At least six Democratic presidential candidates are calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment for lying on the witness stand. It's hard to imagine that happening under the current Republican-led Senate, whose majority continues to back the Trump presidency no matter what. Trump now tweets that Kavanaugh is the one being assaulted by fake news and lies about him, and should sue.
But it's not just Kavanaugh's conduct that deserves scrutiny here. Iowa's senior senator, Charles Grassley, also has some answering to do for why he rushed the Kavanaugh confirmation process through without properly vetting the nominee's past conduct toward women. Christine Blasey-Ford, the former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, had already told the committee he had pinned her to a bed at a party, groped her and tried to take off her clothes while covering her mouth. She said she feared he would unintentionally kill her.
"Ultimately, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, concluded, 'There is no corroboration of the allegations made by Dr. Ford or Ms. Ramirez,' " wrote the Times reporters. "Mr. Kavanaugh was confirmed on Oct. 6, 2018, by a vote of 50-48, the closest vote for a Supreme Court justice in more than 130 years."
Grassley stopped chairing the committee in January.
The latest Times piece centers on Deborah Ramirez, who was a Yale freshman at the same time as Kavanaugh in the early '80s and attended a drunken dorm party with some classmates at which he reportedly pulled down his pants and shoved his penis at her. In her attempt to push it away, the story said, she inadvertently touched it. But the previously untold story involved another dorm party and another unnamed woman who reportedly doesn't recall the incident in which friends allegedly pushed Kavanaugh's penis into her hand. The writers said they corroborated it with two officials. Former classmate Max Stier later reported it to the FBI and senators but wasn't contacted.
The FBI's failure to investigate either incident fully and the Senate Judiciary's drive to stop seeking the complete information are inexcusable. In Ramirez's case, the FBI was given at least 25 names of people who could potentially corroborate, and many tried unsuccessfully to contact the bureau themselves. But the agency didn't interview any. That's even though two FBI agents who interviewed Ramirez told her they found her "credible," but needed authorization to go any further, according to the Times.
And now it turns out Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware also had written FBI Director Christopher Wray during that time saying he had relevant information about Kavanaugh, but no one followed up with him. Coons wrote that several people had approached him with different allegations against Kavanaugh than those involving Blasey-Ford, one of whom might have corroborated Ramirez's account.
The Judiciary Committee's summary report said investigators spoke to 45 people and took 25 written statements relating to the various allegations, but "In neither the Committee's investigation nor in the supplemental background investigation conducted by the FBI was there any evidence to substantiate or corroborate any of the allegations."
In fact, Grassley's committee report suggests Blasey-Ford's tearful recollections were a needless and irritating distraction for a committee hell-bent on ramming through the president's nominee regardless. "Despite the Committee's best efforts to ensure a timely and thorough review," it said, "an eleventh hour news report released the day before a scheduled Committee vote on Justice Kavanaugh's nomination disrupted the Senate's exhaustive confirmation process."
"The revelation of last minute allegations tested the committee in many ways," it said. "But these investigative efforts rose to the occasion and were critical to helping us obtain the truth. This was a serious and thorough investigation that left no stone unturned in our pursuit of the facts."
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and committee member, disagreed. "I would view the Ramirez allegations as not having been even remotely investigated," he said in the Times piece.
Grassley spokesman Michael Zona said in an email that the senator never directed how the FBI should conduct its investigation, and had requested a supplemental background investigation following a bipartisan request from committee members. The resulting report, like the committee's own investigation, didn't substantiate any claims against Kavanaugh, he said: "Every allegation Sen. Grassley received was investigated and none were corroborated." Zona also said Democrats on the committee "issued no report and identified no evidence to substantiate these claims."
Sen. Kamala Harris, the California Democrat on the Judiciary Committee now seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote of Kavanaugh in a tweet calling for his impeachment: "He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined the call, tweeting Kavanaugh's nomination "was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him."
Other Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former H.U.D. Secretary Julian Castro and former Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke have made similar calls. O'Rourke alleged the FBI was pressured by the Senate and not given the time to perform its due diligence.
Faced with multiple credible allegations of abusive behavior toward women by their nominee to the nation's top court, the Senate's Republican majority chose to put party allegiance first, behaving as if this were a mere Democratic ploy to derail Kavanaugh. But this was a vetting process and when a man is credibly accused of using force or intimidation against a woman, drunk or not, it tells you he may be unfit to lead. Every bit of evidence should have been sought and unearthed before Kavanaugh's nomination was voted on. Grassley let us down by not doing so. Now, let's let the whole truth come out.

N.Y. BANS MOST FLAVORS OF E-CIGARETTES

Texto completo: New York state health officials voted Tuesday to carry out Gov. Andrew Cuomo's executive action to ban sales of most flavored e-cigarettes. This ban would stand for 90 days as a piece of emergency legislation. It would need to be renewed to continue.
The only two flavors customers will be able to buy are tobacco and menthol. New York state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said in the emergency meeting that officials would take a closer look at menthol to decide whether it should be banned as well.
Members of the Special Codes Committee of the Public Health and Health Planning Council, which is part of the New York State Department of Health, voted to recommend the flavor ban and the full council voted in favor of emergency adoption.
There needed to be "urgent action," Dr. Zucker said. The state could not wait for federal action or the state Legislature to come back into session.
The ban is aimed at cutting the number of children who vape. Dr. Zucker presented data to the council that showed New York state high school student use of tobacco products rose 160% from 2014 to 2018. Surveys showed that 40% of 12th grade students in New York state had used e-cigarettes.
As of Sept. 14, there are 74 confirmed cases of people who have serious lung illness after vaping in New York, Dr. Zucker said. Around the U.S., seven deaths have been linked to vaping-related illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The vote followed hours of passionate testimony, mostly from people arguing against the flavor ban.
Vape shop owners testified that the majority of their customers bought flavors. Lisa Talarico-Jaskula, who owns Exotic Vapors in Wheatfield, N.Y., said she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, but was healthier after she quit smoking with the help of flavored e-liquid.
"Never would I have stopped smoking without them," she said. She and other store owners warned that the decision would push citizens back to the products that would kill them and move people to the black market.
The state has taken other steps to limit children's access to e-cigarettes.
On Sept. 9, the state mandated stores post signage about the dangers of vaping illegal e-cigarette and e-liquid products. Three days later, an executive order mandated that all tobacco and prevention and cessation programs include e-cigarette prevention materials. The order also expanded school-based programs.
The state also ramped up state police action against retailers who sell to under-age vapers. The state will also put a 20% tax on e-cigarettes, Dr. Zucker said.
On Nov. 13, the state will raise the age at which people can buy tobacco and e-cigarette products from 18 to 21.
Michigan was the first state to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes last week. No flavors were exempt. The Trump administration also proposed a new policy that would require e-cigarette makers to take their flavored products off the market.
Some advocates testified they want the governor to go further with the ban and restrict menthol flavor as well.
Glen Martin said it is an important public health issue but that he was moved by the dozens of people who testified against the change.
As one of two council members voting against it, he said that passing the ban would be a "big public health experiment" that would likely destroy the industry during the three-month period and that "it makes sense to me to come up with a more comprehensive solution, because I am afraid of the unintended consequences."
"It is undeniable that vaping companies are deliberately using flavors like bubblegum, Captain Crunch and cotton candy to get young people hooked on e-cigarettes - it's a public health crisis and it ends today," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. "New York is not waiting for the federal government to act, and by banning flavored e-cigarettes we are safeguarding the public health and helping prevent countless young people from forming costly, unhealthy and potentially deadly lifelong habits."

Prospects for U.S.-China Trade Deal Stay on a Seesaw

Texto completo: SHANGHAI -- The combination on Friday of tough words from President Trump and the cancellation of a planned trip by Chinese agriculture officials to two farm states seemed to cast a cloud over prospects for a trade deal and caused a sell-off in New York stock trading.
But both sides moved on Saturday to indicate that the negotiations continue.
China's state-run Xinhua news agency said on Saturday that fairly senior negotiators had "conducted constructive discussions" in Washington in recent days and had "agreed to continue to maintain communication."
The tone of the Xinhua statement was matched by a separate statement from the United States trade representative in Washington. "These discussions were productive, and the United States looks forward to welcoming a delegation from China for principal-level meetings in October," the statement said.
Both sides' trade negotiators have continued to look for a resolution of their differences even as tensions ratcheted ever higher over the summer, several people familiar with the trade talks said. All insisted on anonymity, citing diplomatic sensitivities in the negotiations.
The delegation of Chinese agriculture officials that had planned to travel to Montana and Nebraska in the coming week didn't cancel the trip because of any new difficulty in the trade talks, two of these people said. Instead, the trip was canceled out of concern that it would turn into a media circus and give the misimpression that China was trying to meddle in American domestic politics, one of them said.
The Chinese government has long taken the position that countries should not interfere in each other's domestic affairs, a position developed partly in opposition to foreign criticisms of China's human rights record.
In recent weeks, the Chinese government and many Chinese internet users have also reacted angrily to calls by American officials for Beijing to show restraint in responding to increasingly violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. China's foreign ministry has repeatedly objected to what it describes as intervention in China's internal affairs over Hong Kong.
The question now is whether Vice Premier Liu He of China can make any progress when he comes to Washington for high-level talks next month. While the dates for those talks have not been confirmed, they look likely to be scheduled for Oct. 10 and 11, said two of the several people familiar with the trade talks.
The biggest obstacle facing negotiators may be agreeing on the scale and ambition of any deal they try to reach. Several people familiar with the trade talks said in interviews over the past two weeks that China wanted to reach a partial deal that would head off President Trump's planned increases in American tariffs on Chinese goods on Oct. 15 and Dec. 15.
China has become more wary in recent weeks of seeking any comprehensive resolution of the dozens of issues facing the two countries. Chinese negotiators have tried to focus the talks on issues that can be resolved through regulations that the country needs to issue by early January anyway in response to a new law on foreign investments the National People's Congress approved in March.
At the same time, Chinese trade negotiators have tried this week to exclude issues like data flows, the location of data and the setting of cybersecurity standards. These issues tend to infringe on the turf of China's feared internal security agencies, which have resisted any limits on their ability to conduct comprehensive surveillance within the country and are wary of allowing in American tech companies.
The United States has tried to persuade Beijing to adopt broad changes to Chinese laws to make the country more open to imports and to limit subsidies for industries, particularly advanced manufacturing industries that compete with American industries.
But President Trump objected on Friday to any partial deal.
"I'm looking for a complete deal, I'm not looking for a partial deal," Mr. Trump said on Friday during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia. "We're looking for the big deal."
There have nonetheless been some discussions between the two sides on reducing American tariffs that would only apply to Chinese goods worth $ 250 billion a year. That would be instead of the current tariffs on goods worth $ 360 billion a year, which are set to increase even further by mid-December, people familiar with the talks said.
The United States has been pressing China to buy more American food in exchange -- food that China may need as an epidemic of African swine fever has killed huge numbers of pigs in China.
The two sides have nonetheless undertaken a series of small, confidence-building trade measures in the past two weeks.

Texto completo: Correction: Special Projects agency: In the Sept. 22 Image section, photo captions with an article about the talent booking and creative content agency Special Projects said that the agency produced Best of Fashion's BoF West event and ran an In Goop Health event. The company did not produce the events. It booked Serena Williams to speak at the BoF event and to appear in a BoF print issue, and it provided speakers for the In Goop Health event. ..CX: Special Projects: Two photo captions in the Sept. 22 Image section incorrectly said the talent booking and creative content agency Special Projects produced Best of Fashion's BofF West event and an In Goop Health event. The company booked Serena Williams to speak at the former event and appear in a BoF print issue and provided speakers for the latter event.
On a recent evening at the Toronto International Film Festival, Andrea Oliveri and Nicole Vecchiarelli maneuvered their way through a bumping, shoulder-to-shoulder crowd at a premiere party for "Hustlers ." They chit-chatted with publicist Liz Mahoney, a partner in Narrative PR, which represents a range of celebrity clients from "Eighth Grade's" Elsie Fisher to Constance Wu and Richard Madden. Mahoney has known Oliveri and Vecchiarelli for over 15 years, largely in their former capacities as magazine editors at a range of publications including Teen Vogue, Details, InStyle and DuJour (where Vecchiarelli was founding editor).
But that night, in Toronto, the three women's conversation was not about the magazine trade -- not directly, anyway. It was about Oliveri and Vecchiarelli's new and thriving business. Together, they run Special Projects, which is best described as part integrated marketing consultancy, part partnerships advisory, part editorial bookings agency and part event planning SWAT team.
The energetic duo has made waves for producing conferences across the fashion, luxury, media and tech spaces in recent months, with high-profile clients including Business of Fashion's BoF West, a live event "that explores the powerful intersection of Hollywood and Silicon Valley's creative and technology-based businesses with fashion," for which Special Projects booked Serena Williams to appear on the cover of a BoF print issue as well as speak in person at the event. Other recent projects include Gwyneth Paltrow's In Goop Health and the Cut's How I Get It Done event. At Amazon's presentation of Rihanna's Fenty X Savage fashion show at New York Fashion Week earlier this month, Special Projects filled the front row with a range of in-demand showgoers, including model Ashley Graham, Chris Rock, Diplo, Lil Kim, Paris Hilton and country chanteuse Kacey Musgraves. Next month, they will orchestrate a W Magazine dinner introducing Sara Moonves' inaugural issue as editor in chief. Their list of regular clients includes the Wing, Edie Parker Flower and Kate Spade.

Editorial bookings also constitute a significant portion of Special Projects' business. The duo works closely with Kristina O'Neill, editor in chief of WSJ. Magazine on an ongoing basis to book celebrity covers. Up to and inclusive of the September 2019 cover, they also booked every celebrity cover for Town & Country this year.
The women also contribute to the magazines in other ways, such as proposing talent and photographers for special portfolios. In February of this year, for instance, WSJ. launched a "Talent & Legends" cover with Lucas Hedges.
"Andrea was instrumental in identifying not only what made sense for the editorial but also how to build it into a package. She helped us get Lucas on the cover but then also celebrated the issue with a dinner that Julia Roberts and I cohosted," said O'Neill. "They really see things in a 360[-degree] way -- it's not just the magazine but it's how to experience the magazine through an event. Celebrities are inundated with 'asks' these days, and what makes an opportunity with WSJ. so meaningful is that it's not just another echo chamber."
The bicoastal Special Projects began in September 2016 as an "editorially minded celebrity booking and creative content agency that elevates media, fashion and consumer brands through the unique use of celebrities and storytelling," as the company's web page puts it. Now that Special Projects has proven its chops in the media and live journalism conference space, creating cultural capital by handpicking the right celebrities and jigsaw-puzzling them together with the right media or the right conferences, Oliveri and Vecchiarelli see a new sector of their business emerging: the entertainment industry itself. This year, the two have produced premiere and tastemaker events for "Blinded by the Light" with Warner Bros., "What We Do in the Shadows" for FX and "Sweetbitter" for Starz.
With their growing roster of film and television projects, Oliveri and Vecchiarelli, both 43, now compete with the very same awards season Svengalis whose screenings and dinners they attended as magazine editors in years past.
The business of organizing premieres and parties to generate buzz around a film is a niche that requires deep social contacts and organizational skills -- specifically, the ability to fill a theater and then after-party with the right media and the right industry folk whose buzz will make or break a film's success. A small yet established crew of event planners has occupied this space for years, including Andrew Saffir, Darin Pfeiffer and, until recently, Peggy Siegal. In July, Variety reported that Annapurna, Disney-owned FX and Netflix were among the Hollywood companies to cut ties with Siegal after the Hollywood Reporter and the New York Times reported on her long-standing connections to controversial sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The 72-year-old publicist has long been a fixture in New York society, wielding her hefty Rolodex to organize exclusive screenings and parties to generate buzz, as well as awards season momentum, for her entertainment industry clients.
While Siegal's potential fall from grace might create more space on the playing field, Oliveri and Vecchiarelli have already made their mark and established their niche. As Variety put it, the two "are quickly gaining steam for their lists [and are part of] a new generation of event planners who can put together an intimate cocktail party for Town & Country but also spearhead Kanye West's album listening party in Jackson Hole."
Their age certainly does seem to be in their favor.
"They're younger than many of the other people in that space, and it gives them a different perspective," said Leslee Dart, founder and co-chief executive of public relations firm 42West. "Their editorial background helps them create the right mix. You don't want the same people at every event. The person who likes 'Joker' is not going to like 'Downton Abbey.' "
Oliveri and Vecchiarelli's strategy for creating the perfect guest list goes beyond inviting the same Rolodex of socialites over and over again -- something for which their predecessors in the event-planning space have drawn criticism. It involves comprehensive research, taking an editorial approach to curating a cross-section of who might be genuinely interested in a film.
"We have a foundational list that is very robust from our years at different magazines, but we customize everything we work on to feel really special," Vecchiarelli explained. "We draw on various communities we think the film would appeal to, and then fill in the blanks. We're not going to recycle the same list for every event we do."
A Special Projects guest list may include the usual roster of media and industry executives, but it might also include wellness buffs, or tech upstarts, or Gen Z skater dudes. For a screening last October of Jonah Hill's directorial debut, the skating-themed coming-of-age tale "Mid90s," the two spent hours on a deep dive through Instagram researching influential and in-the-know skateboarders they could invite. "We had the event at the West L.A. courthouse, and there were all these skater kids just hanging out and having the best time. It was so cool," said Oliveri.
Ultimately, Hill's team considered the event a success. "The industry is changing so much right now, and trying to do things the way they were done 25 years ago isn't realistic," said Mahoney, Hill's publicist. "There are a lot of premieres on Hollywood Boulevard where you have a red carpet at the same old place and an after-party next door, but these two always think about how to really make it an event and bring in people who are excited to be there."
And what it all comes down to, ultimately, is the guest list. Tailoring the list to each client and each project is crucial. "When you work from one list with a one-size-fits-all approach, that's when things are a little ordinary and obvious," said Oliveri.
After all, the ultimate goal is that elusive, nebulous Hollywood concept: buzz.
"Buzz starts when you hear about something from varied communities," said Oliveri. "It's our 20-something assistant mentioning something, then hearing an older client mention the same thing, then one of our parents is talking about it too."
Having the right mix of attendees at a tastemaker screening is not just about generating buzz, however. As awards season begins to shift into high gear, the pressure is on Special Projects to deliver the goods.

Texto completo: NARA, Japan -- Falling in love is the easiest thing in the world. But staying in love, we all know, can be one of the hardest. How do we keep the glow, the sense of unending discovery, alive once we've pledged ourselves to familiarity? And how to sustain the sense of anticipation that deliciously quickened the honeymoon? Put differently, how might we be enchanted by discovery's opposite -- routine -- and find in constancy a stimulation as rich as novelty provides? The story of every marriage, perhaps, is the story of what happens after the endless summer ends.
"To learn something new," the wise explorer John Burroughs noted, "take the path that you took yesterday." A knowing friend in New York sent me that line when he heard that I'd spent 26 years in the same anonymous suburb in western Japan, most of that time traveling no farther than my size 8 feet can carry me. I'd arrived in Kyoto, from Midtown Manhattan, just out of my 20s and alight with everything this wildly unfathomable place could teach me. I never dreamed that I'd come to find delight in everything that is everyday and seemingly without interest in my faraway neighborhood, nothing special.
Of course this has something to do with the eye of the beholder and the passing years: When we're young, we want to stand out, to leave our mark on the world, to be exceptional. As the seasons pass, we come to find that it's everything that's not extraordinary in us -- our ability to tend to a family, to keep ill health at bay, to hit a Ping-Pong ball -- and even in the world around us, that may be most memorable.
It's certainly what is unremarkable in us that allows us to keep going to the office, to find common ground with our neighbors, to have something to write about. Growing up, I thought a writer was obliged to write from strength and show off all the things that he could do with more authority than almost anyone else; as autumn draws on, I begin to think that anyone's strength is only what unites her or him to everyone else in shared experience, and often vulnerability.
But something other than that took me to Japan. Unlike in Britain, where I was born, and the United States, where I grew up, the citizens of my adopted home have been encouraged by their distinctive traditional culture to be quiet, to remain invisible, to try to look and sound like everyone else. The one thing others don't much need, they know, is the loud impress of personality. Since I'd been trained to babble, I thought, when choosing to move to Japan, that it might be a good thing to go somewhere where I could learn to listen. Since I'd been encouraged at school to try to be an individual, it didn't seem a terrible thing to learn to be quite typical. Becoming myself, I realized, might not involve anything more than becoming more like everyone around me.
When I met the woman who would become my wife in a Kyoto temple three weeks after I arrived in 1987, of course it was everything that I assumed to be distinctive, unique, even foreign in her that pulled me, much as she was surely drawn by the foreignness in me. But as we pass into a deeper season in our lives, we come to see that the season's special lesson is to cherish everything because it cannot last; from Vermont to Beijing, people relish autumn days precisely because they're reminders of how much we cannot afford to take for granted, and how much there is to celebrate right now, this shining late September afternoon.
I could have learned this anywhere, no doubt, but in Japan the seasons are treated with the sort of passion and reverence usually associated with religion. Every time the cherries begin to blossom, people flock into the parks because, in 10 days or so, the frothing pink flowers will be gone; and every time the maple leaves blaze in late November, my Japanese friends and family throng into temple gardens in much the same spirit that people of any faith may gather in temples or cathedrals. To be joined in a congregation; to be reminded of something larger than ourselves, keeping us in place; to catch moments of light in a season of mounting darkness.
I love the sunshine when I visit my mother in Southern California, but I can't say I love the fact that February and August are growing interchangeable. It's the end of things, Japan has taught me, that gives them their savor and their beauty. And it's the fact that my wife -- and I -- are always changing, even as we're shedding leaves and hair, that confers an urgency on my feelings toward her. Every year the autumn reminds me that progress doesn't move in a straight line and that I'm not necessarily wiser than I was last year -- or 30 years ago. Every year, autumn sings the same tune, but to a different audience.
My first year in Japan, I wrote a book about my enraptured discovery of a love, a life and a culture that I hoped would be mine forever. My publishers brought out my celebration of springtime romance in autumn. Now, 28 years on, I'm more enamored of the fall, if only because it has spring inside it, and memories, and the acute awareness that almost nothing lasts forever. Every day in autumn -- a cyclical sense of things reminds us -- brings us a little bit closer to the spring.

Striking workers remind us that they saved GM OP-ED

Texto completo: During the debate over whether the federal government should save the American auto industry in late 2008, a driver rammed into my old Saturn in a late-night accident while it was parked in front of my house. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but I needed a new car.
I strongly supported the rescue effort, so I felt an obligation to look to a Detroit-based car company organized by the United Auto Workers union for a replacement. I got a Chevy Malibu - my kids called it "Dad's Boo" - and remain happy that I did.
In organizing what critics called the "bailout" of GM and Chrysler, President Obama was defying popular sentiment. Yet what was in many ways the most radical step he took to revive an American economy in free fall turned out to be one of his most politically beneficial initiatives.
The effort was far closer to what could be called "socialism" than anything in Obama's health care plan, although he was, in fact, trying to keep the auto companies under private ownership. But socialism or not, the rescue was key to his success in 2012 in carrying Michigan and Ohio, states that would elude Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And it worked - witness GM's $35 billion in North American profits over the last three years. The taxpayers got most of their money back and, by certain measures, even turned a modest profit off the government's investment. Either way, a catastrophe was averted. It wasn't just two big companies that were saved. So were suppliers whose collapse would have devastated the Midwest.
My support for the bailout was rooted in practical economic concerns: Our economy was teetering and could not afford the damage an auto-sector implosion would inflict. But my passion for it came from a concern for the lives of the workers involved and a lifelong respect for the UAW.
Unions get knocked for being unconcerned about the health of the companies they organize. The UAW showed how untrue this is. It made sweeping concessions to management to persuade federal officials to undertake the investment of public money - and to keep the companies alive.
Among other gripes is the tiered wage system that Neal Boudette described well in The New York Times: "Workers hired before 2007 make about $31 an hour, and can retire with a lifelong pension. Those hired after them (now more than a third of the work force) start at about $17 an hour and can work their way up to about $29 an hour over eight years. They also have to rely on 401(k) retirement accounts instead of pensions. In addition, GM uses temporary workers (about 7% of the staff) who earn about $15 an hour, and do not have vision or dental benefits."
The rank-and-file don't like the idea of people doing the same labor at radically different pay levels. And then there are the plant closures that have slashed 14,000 North American jobs, as well as the announcement that the Chevy Blazer would be built in Mexico.
Symbolically and substantively, the closure earlier this year of the legendary GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that had produced Chevy Cruzes was an especially heavy blow - and it flew in the face of President Trump's promise in a 2017 speech in nearby Youngstown that factory jobs are "all coming back. They're all coming back." So confident was Trump that he told his supporters not to sell their homes.
The bottom line is that the strikers are fighting not only for greater fairness and a larger share of the company's success, but also for work itself. Too late to avert the strike, GM finally put an offer on the table to begin addressing some of these issues. But the rank-and-file are restive for more, and for good reason. Those of us who supported keeping GM alive a decade ago - and put our wallets where our mouths, pens and votes were - didn't do so to make it easier for management to outsource jobs or hold down pay and benefits forever. Every Democratic candidate for president should be joining the UAW's picket lines to drive that point home.
The cliché is singularly appropriate in this case: The struggle for employment, pay and benefits in the auto industry is where the rubber meets the road in our too often very abstract discussion of the challenges facing American wage earners in an economy undergoing rapid transformation. The battle at GM is a fight that unions and workers cannot afford to lose.

Texto completo: Rui Pinto ran a website called Football Leaks and won praise as a whistle-blower. Portugal's authorities consider him a criminal.
A computer hacker whose efforts revealed often troubling practices that shape the multi-billion-dollar global soccer industry was charged with 147 crimes this week by Portugal's national prosecutor.
For four years between 2015 and his arrest in Hungary in January, the hacker, Rui Pinto, a 30-year-old from Portugal, sowed anxiety in the soccer world by publishing hundreds of internal documents onto an internet platform he set up called Football Leaks. Pinto later collaborated with a European media consortium led by the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel to disseminate even more documents.
The information Football Leaks made public -- including player contracts, internal team financial documents and confidential emails -- pulled back the curtain on the murky world of soccer finance, led to criminal tax prosecutions of several top players and even helped prompt officials in the United States to reopen a sexual assault investigation involving the Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo.
Pinto's supporters and his legal team have sought to portray him as a whistle-blower, and he has expressed a willingness to cooperate with investigations in a number of countries. Yet even as his actions led to criminal referrals and investigations by soccer officials into some of the game's most-powerful clubs and agents, the Portuguese authorities continued to pursue him as a criminal. In March, Portuguese prosecutors won a ruling in Hungary that led to Pinto's extradition.
Most of the crimes Pinto is accused of in a 195-page indictment announced on Thursday are related to the unauthorized accessing of confidential data, but the most significant charge concerns what the authorities have labeled an attempt to extort a powerful sports agency. In that incident, the Portuguese prosecutors said Pinto sought as much as 1 million euros in return for deleting information belonging to the company, Doyen Sports.
Pinto's legal team released a statement on Friday in which they accused the Portuguese prosecutors of waging a campaign to "silence and destroy" their client and block his efforts to cooperate with investigators elsewhere.
"The team set up by the Public Prosecution to investigate criminality in the football world seems to be more dedicated to pursuing those who denounce it than investigating those who practice the crimes," said the statement from Pinto's lawyers, William Bourdon and Francisco Teixeira Da Mota.
Pinto has been in custody since March after Portugal successfully fought to have him extradited from Hungary, where he had been living for several years.
According to the indictment on Thursday, the case against Pinto is limited to his targeting of Portuguese entities, including the top-division soccer team Sporting Clube de Portugal, the national soccer federation, a well-known law firm and even the country's attorney general's office.
The indictment, reviewed by The New York Times, said Pinto accessed the email accounts of some of Sporting's most senior officials, including the club's president and coach, before extracting dozens of player agreements that he then published.
The indictment also detailed the hack of Doyen and a subsequent incident in which Pinto is accused of assuming the identity Artem Lobuzov as part of an extortion attempt and contacting the firm's chief executive, Nelio Lucas, in October 2015 to offer him the chance to prevent the release of the firm's documents in return for a "generous donation" of between 500,000 and 1 million euros.
Anibal Pinto, a lawyer hired by Rui Pinto to negotiate with Doyen officials, also has been charged in the case. The negotiations lasted about a month before breaking down; a cache of Doyen's documents started emerging on Football Leaks in early November 2015.
Pinto's actions in releasing information through Football Leaks have been championed by European anticorruption and transparency groups, and his case has been taken up by Bourdon, a French lawyer known for representing other high-profile individuals who leaked sensitive information into the public domain, including the former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
News of the charges against Pinto first leaked in the Portuguese news media early Thursday, hours before the prosecutor's office released its statement, and a day before indictment was sent to Pinto's lawyers.
"It really shows the dysfunction and media frenzy that whoever is behind the accusation against Pinto is trying to achieve," said Ana Gomes, a former Portuguese representative to the European Parliament, and one of Pinto's backers.
Gomes said she had visited Pinto twice during his imprisonment. She acknowledged that he might have committed crimes, but she said that any illegal behavior attributable to him should be outweighed by the crimes he had helped to expose.
Even with Pinto in prison, the repercussions of his efforts continue to roil the soccer industry. After Football Leaks disclosed Doyen's contracts, some clubs, like F.C. Twente of the Netherlands, were punished for breaching local licensing regulations related to third-party influence over players. And investigators from UEFA, European soccer's governing body, have recommended banning the English champion Manchester City from future editions of the Champions League after studying details, revealed by Football Leaks, of an apparent effort by City to circumvent financial rules.
The documents appeared to show that Manchester City had disguised sponsorship payments to evade those rules, and also detailed a system in which the club ran an off-the-books player recruitment fund.
While Pinto has become a hero of sorts for those demanding greater transparency in soccer, his past conduct has raised questions about his motivations. He reached an out-of-court settlement with the Caledonian Bank in 2014, for example, after being accused of hacking into its systems and transferring thousands of dollars from one of its client accounts.
Pinto has denied stealing any of the money, but citing a nondisclosure agreement, he has declined to provide additional details.

Texto completo: Colson Whitehead's novel "The Nickel Boys," based on the horrific history of a Florida reform school, was nominated for the National Book Award for fiction on Friday, three years after the writer won the prize for his book "The Underground Railroad."
He was the only author in the fiction category to have been previously nominated and joins nine other writers in an eclectic list, including five nominees making their fiction debut and a genre-bending speculative thriller.
Whitehead was joined by a few other literary heavyweights, among them Marlon James, who won the Booker Prize in 2015, and Laila Lalami, whose novel "The Moor's Account" was a 2015 Pulitzer Prize finalist. Among the first-time novelists, the poet Ocean Vuong was nominated for "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous," his epistolary novel about a Vietnamese immigrant family. The New York Times staff writer Taffy Brodesser-Akner was nominated for her tragicomic divorce saga, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," which chronicles the romantic antics and inner turmoil of a physician whose wife goes missing, leaving him to care for their kids. And Julia Phillips made the longlist for her widely acclaimed debut, "Disappearing Earth," a story about two sisters who are lured into a stranger's car and disappear in Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula.
Two debut short-story collections were nominated: Kali Fajardo-Anstine's collection "Sabrina & Corina," which explores the lives of Latinas of indigenous ancestry, and Kimberly King Parsons's "Black Light," a set of stories set in her home state of Texas, which has drawn comparisons to works by Karen Russell and Denis Johnson.
Also longlisted for fiction were Helen Phillips's "The Need," a provocative thriller about the agony and ecstasy of motherhood, and Susan Choi's "Trust Exercise," a book about students at a performing arts high school that explores the blurry line between fact and fiction.
On the nonfiction list, nominees included "Solitary," the memoir of Albert Woodfox, a man who served more than four decades in solitary confinement; Sarah M. Broom's memoir "The Yellow House"; and Hanif Abdurraqib's "Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest." The nominees for young people's literature included both rising stars like Akwaeke Emezi and beloved best-selling authors, among them Jason Reynolds, Kwame Alexander and Laurie Halse Anderson.
The shortlist of finalists in each category are scheduled to be announced on Oct. 8, and the winners on Nov. 20 at an awards ceremony in New York City.

U.S. Drone Strike in Libya Kills 8 at an ISIS Compound

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The United States military carried out an airstrike against Islamic State fighters in southern Libya on Thursday in a reminder of the terrorist group's continuing operations and resilience far from its main guerrilla strongholds in Iraq and Syria.
The Pentagon's Africa Command said in a statement on Friday that the strike -- which other officials said was carried out by an Air Force Reaper drone based in neighboring Niger -- killed eight militants in a compound in Murzuq, Libya, nearly 600 miles south of Tripoli, the capital.
It was the first American airstrike this year in Libya against Islamic State or Qaeda fighters, after the military conducted six aerial attacks last year, most recently in November 2018.
"We will not allow them to use the current conflict in Libya as protection," Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the head of the Africa Command, said in statement, noting that the strike was coordinated with the Libyan government in Tripoli.
Counterterrorism analysts inside and outside the government have pointed to recent signs of the Islamic State gathering new strength in Iraq and Syria, after American-backed campaigns recaptured territory that made up the group's religious state, or caliphate. The group's far-flung affiliates -- in places like West Africa, Libya and the Philippines -- have also demonstrated resilient insurgent operations.
"The strike serves to remind us that while ISIS and Al Qaeda are not at the forefront of the fighting in Libya these days, these groups still remain a threat to Libya, neighboring countries and the international community," said Bill Roggio, the editor of The Long War Journal, a website run by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that tracks military strikes against militant groups.
American counterterrorism operations in southern Libya entered a new phase when a military drone strike in March 2018 killed a top recruiter and logistics specialist for Al Qaeda's branch in northwest Africa. That attack killed two militants, including one identified by American officials as Musa Abu Dawud, a high-ranking official in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Until that strike, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north. Over several months in 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt to destroy the Islamic State's stronghold there.
Drones remain the weapon of choice to attack the militants in Libya. The military launches its MQ-9 Reaper drones from bases in Sicily and in Niamey, Niger's capital. It is also building a new $ 110 million drone base in Agadez, Niger, which is much closer to militant hotbeds in southern Libya than the base in Niamey. Initial operations started last month after several delays.
The C.I.A. is broadening its drone operations in the region, moving aircraft to northeastern Niger to hunt Islamist militants in southern Libya. Nigerien and American officials told The New York Times last summer that the C.I.A. had been flying drones on surveillance missions for several months from a corner of a small commercial airport in Dirkou.

Rep. Bradley Byrne: Stop the Democrat-media smear machine

Texto completo: What is happening in America today is deeply troubling. Members of the national left-wing news media, in cahoots with their allies in the Democratic Party, are pushing fake news hit pieces against upstanding individuals. The Democrat-media complex does this on a daily basis to President Trump. Now they have again set their sights on Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The media have given up any pretense of fairness regarding either Trump or Kavanaugh. Instead of acting in the necessary role as America’s “fourth estate,” much of the media is now unfortunately acting as nothing more than the public relations wing of the Democratic Party. Look no further than the latest New York Times piece regarding Justice Kavanaugh’s most recent “accuser.”
The Times published an article using baseless accusations and thin sourcing in an attempt to smear Justice Kavanaugh. Worst of all, the Times purposely left out of their initial piece the fact that the purported victim denied that the alleged event even took place.
Think about that. The victim told friends that she does not even recall such a thing happening. The Times knew that and didn’t appear to care.
You would think that any real journalist would have decided not to publish their story. Unfortunately, the Times stopped practicing journalism the moment Trump was elected. Not only did the paper move forward and print the story, they made the reprehensible decision to leave out vital exculpatory facts. It wasn’t until a conservative journalist pointed out the serious deficiencies that the New York Times’ leadership finally decided to update their story to note the exonerating evidence.
Of course, none of this mattered to the radical Democrats who immediately seized on the article and demanded the impeachment of Justice Kavanaugh, and it wasn’t just members of the far-left “squad” making that demand. Numerous top-tier Democrat presidential candidates jumped right on board as well, despite the fact that the credibility of the story had already crumbled.
This is the new Democrat playbook. They lose elections, and instead of accepting that the American people do not support their agenda, they resort to demanding the impeachment of conservatives like Trump and Kavanaugh. Impeachment, not helping Americans, is the main Democrat agenda these days.
The whole episode is infuriating to me, as it is to so many other citizens. The American people deserve fair and unbiased reporting. Yet again, the New York Times proved that far too many members of the mainstream media are more interested in launching political attacks than they are in actual reporting.
Radical Democrats, “the squad,” and the media are obsessed with sabotaging Trump and anything his administration touches. We need more leaders in Washington who will call out this nonsense and fight back against the liberal machine. That’s exactly why I’m running for United States Senate.
I was a strong supporter of Kavanaugh from the start. I never buckled in my support of him, even in face of the lies and smears coming from the Democrat-media complex. It disgusts me now to see what Democrats did to him and continue to do to him. To have one of my home state senators, Doug Jones, vote against Judge Kavanaugh and help fan the flames of impeachment makes me even angrier.
The people I represent in Alabama support Justice Kavanaugh, and they don’t want to see him used as a punching bag for the liberal left. When I’m serving Alabama in the Senate, I promise always to defend Justice Kavanaugh and our other qualified judicial nominees from these ridiculous attacks. I won’t just speak out against this nonsense, but I will fight back and demand accountability from the liberal media and their Democrat friends in Washington.
The American people have had enough of the unholy alliance between the left-wing media and their Democrat allies, and so have I. As Alabama’s next United States senator, I’ll stand side by side with Trump to fight back against the media’s lies and smears.

Texto completo: From 2050, a look back at our political evolution:
A crisis of legitimacy swept across American politics in the second decade of the 21st century. Many people had the general conviction that the old order was corrupt and incompetent. There was an inchoate desire for some radical transformation. This mood swept the Republican Party in 2016 as Donald Trump eviscerated the GOP establishment and it swept through the Democratic Party in 2020.
In the 2020 primary race Joe Biden stood as the candidate for linear change and Elizabeth Warren stood as the sharp break from the past. Biden was the front-runner, but fragile. Many of the strongest debate performers — Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bennet — couldn’t get any traction because Biden occupied the moderate lane. By the time he faded, it was too late.
Warren triumphed over the other progressive populist, Bernie Sanders, because she had what he lacked — self-awareness. She could run a campaign that mitigated her weaknesses. He could not.
Biden was holding on until Warren took Iowa and New Hampshire. He or some other moderate could have recovered, but the California primary had been moved up to March 3, Super Tuesday. When Warren dominated most of the states that day, it was over. The calendar ensured that the most progressive candidate would win.
Many pundits predicted that Warren was too much the progressive regulator-in-chief to win a general election. Indeed, her personal favorability remained low. But the election was about Trump — his personal disgraces but also the fact that he told a white ethnic national narrative that appealed only to a shrinking segment of the country.
Warren won convincingly. The Democrats built a bigger majority in the House, and to general surprise, won a slim Senate majority of 52-48.
After that election, the Republicans suffered a long, steady decline. Trump was instantly reviled by everyone — he had no loyal defenders. Only 8% of young people called themselves conservatives. Republican voters, mostly older, were dying out, and they weren’t making new ones. For the ensuing two decades the party didn’t resonate beyond its white rural base.
The American educated class celebrated the Warren victory with dance-in-the-street euphoria. In staffing her administration, she rejected the experienced Clinton-Obama holdovers and brought in a new cadre from the progressive left.
The euphoria ended when Warren tried to pass her legislative agenda. One by one, her proposals failed in the Senate: “Medicare for All,” free college, decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, even the wealth tax. Democratic senators from red states, she learned, were still from red states; embracing her agenda would have been suicidal. Warren and her aides didn’t help. Fired by their sense of moral superiority, they were good at condemnation, not coalition-building.
When the recession of 2021 hit, things got ugly. The failure of two consecutive presidencies had a devastating effect on American morale. It became evident that the nation had three political tendencies — conservative populism, progressive populism and moderate liberalism. None of them could put together a governing majority to get things done.
Before Warren, people thought of liberals and progressives as practically synonymous. After Warren, it was clear they were different, with different agendas and different national narratives.
Moderate liberals had a basic faith in American institutions and thought they just needed reform. They had basic faith in capitalism and the Constitution and revered the classical liberal philosophy embedded in America’s founding. They inherited Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass’ millennial nationalism, a sense that America has a special destiny as the last best hope of Earth.
Progressives had much less faith in American institutions — in capitalism, the Constitution, the founding. They called for more structural change to things like the Supreme Court, the Electoral College and the basic structures of the market. Trump’s victory in 2016 had served for them as proof that racism is the dominant note in American history — that the founding was 1619, not 1776. They were willing to step on procedural liberalism in order to get radical change.
With the Republicans powerless and irrelevant, the war within the Democratic Party grew vicious. Progressives detested moderate liberals even more than they did conservatives. The struggle came to a head with another set of Democratic primaries in 2024.
The moderate liberals triumphed easily. It turns out that the immigrant groups, by then a large and organized force in American politics, had not lost faith in the American dream, they had not lost faith in capitalism. They simply wanted more help so they could compete within it.
By 2030, progressive populism burned out as right-wing populism had. The Democrats became the nation’s majority party. This party ran on a one-word platform: unity. After decades of culture, class and demographic warfare, moderate liberals defined America as a universal nation, a pluralistic nation, embracing all and seeking opportunity for all.
In a wildly diverse nation, voters handed power to leaders who were coalition-builders not fighters. The whole tenor of American politics changed.

Mich. gets 1st election security specialist as the 2020 voting nears

Texto completo: LANSING – Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson says Michigan will get its first-ever full-time elections security specialist as she tries to ensure the integrity of the 2020 vote.
Ashiya Brown, an audit and database management expert in the Department of Health and Human Services, starts Monday, Benson said.
Election security is a major issue for 2020 after U.S. intelligence agencies determined that the Russian government was behind hacking and covert social media efforts intended to influence the 2016 election in favor of Republican President Donald Trump.
"The security of our elections in Michigan has always been of paramount importance to all of my predecessors, and you've not seen evidence of the types of potential threats that have impacted systems in other states," Benson, a Democrat, said in an interview.
"But that said, the threats to our elections did not end in 2016, and they will continue to evolve, and we must be prepared," she said.
Bureau of Elections spokesman Shawn Starkey said Brown's position is a new one "dedicated to coordinating Michigan's overall election security plan, and working with state and federal partners to assess, train and communicate with our local election officials on election security best practices."
He said Brown's "technical background in managing, assessing and auditing large-scale computer-based systems in the Department of Health and Human Services will ... help to keep Michigan well-positioned to anticipate and respond to potential security threats as we head into a critical election year."
The Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in July that election systems in all 50 states were targeted by Russia in 2016.
The New York Times reported in April 2018 that hackers breached election systems in Illinois, a county database in Arizona, a Tennessee state website and an information technology vendor in Florida.
Benson said she is not aware of even an unsuccessful attempt by agents of Russia — or anyone else — to hack into Michigan's Qualified Voter File, which is an electronic statewide voter registration and election management system.
Brown has a bachelor's degree in public relations from Central Michigan University and a master's of business administration from the University of Phoenix, according to her résumé.
She has held several audit, database, and systems management positions with the Department of Health and Human Services, and its predecessor, the Department of Community Health, where she has worked since 2011.
Brown's salary is about $87,600, Starkey said.

Texto completo: FRONT PAGE
An article on Sept. 13 about the Trump administration's plan to repeal a clean water regulation aimed at the use of chemicals near streams, wetlands and other water bodies misstated the scope of the 1972 Clean Water Act and the 2015 clean water regulation issued under President Obama. The Clean Water Act gave the federal government broad authority to limit pollution in major water bodies as well as smaller bodies that drain into them. It is not the case that the Obama administration extended federal authority to smaller bodies of water.
INTERNATIONAL
A picture caption with an article on Thursday about a French mayor who banned pesticides misattributed a quotation beneath a photo of Daniel Cueff, the mayor of Langouët. As the article correctly states, it was Bertrand Astic, the mayor of Boussières, not Mr. Cueff, who commented on dying trees and other signs of climate change.
An article on Wednesday about a Spanish court's refusal of a request from the United States to extradite Hugo Carvajal, the former intelligence chief of Venezuela, described incorrectly Juan Guaidó's claim to Venezuela's presidency. Mr. Guaidó called the last presidential election fraudulent, and as president of the legislature swore himself in as the head of an interim government. He did not claim to win a presidential election.
NATIONAL
An article on Thursday about Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager and climate activist, misstated the name of a television news program that interviewed her. It is "CBS This Morning," not "Good Morning."
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Sept. 12 about Frederic Pryor, who was jailed in East Germany on suspicion of espionage but later freed as part of a prisoner exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union, misidentified one of the cities connected by the Glienicke Bridge, where the exchange of the prisoners Francis Gary Powers and Rudolf Abel took place in 1962. It connected West Berlin with Potsdam, not East Berlin.
An obituary on Wednesday about the television reporter Sander Vanocur misstated the subject in which he received a degree from Northwestern University. It was communications, not political science. It also misstated part of the name of one of Mr. Vanocur's employers. It is the Public Broadcasting Service, not System. And it misstated the years of the movie "Dave," in which Mr. Vanocur played a newsman, and "The Kingdom and the Power," Gay Talese's book about The New York Times. The movie was released in 1993, not 1983; the book was published in 1969, not 1966.
An obituary on Wednesday about the musician, photographer, filmmaker and musicologist John Cohen incorrectly included a name on a list of musicians he photographed. He did not photograph the banjo player Charlie Poole. The obituary also referred incompletely to the 1959 film "Pull My Daisy," whose production Mr. Cohen photographed. It was directed by Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie, not just by Mr. Frank.

Texto completo: Our guide to dance performances happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
GERMAINE ACOGNY AND MIKAËL SERRE at the Ellen Stewart Theater at La MaMa (Sept. 26-28, 7 p.m.). Referred to as the "mother of contemporary African dance," Acogny has been a formidable force on that continent for decades, in particular through the establishment of an influential school in her native Senegal. She is also a commanding and mesmerizing presence onstage. In the coming week at French Institute Alliance Française's Crossing the Line Festival, Acogny, now in her 70s, presents a solo called "Somewhere at the Beginning," created with Serre, a theater director. The work weaves tropes from Greek tragedies into Acogny's personal journey from Africa to Europe and back, while tracing the arc of African history.

IVY BALDWIN at Manitoga, the Russel Wright Design Center, in Garrison, N.Y. (Sept. 21-22, 12:30 and 4:30 p.m.). About 50 miles north of New York City sits Manitoga, a lush, wooded estate that was owned by the industrial designer Russell Wright, who died in 1976, and whose minimalist, ecological home illustrates his views on living in harmony with nature. In her site-specific work, "Quarry," Baldwin takes inspiration from Wright's ideas and designs, as well as the landscape, to encourage audience members to reconsider and repair their relationship with the environment. She enlists seven performers in the effort, who dance among trees, on mossy roofs and in the titular quarry. Saturday's performances have sold out, but tickets are still available for Sunday.
visitmanitoga.org
MARIA BAUMAN-MORALES at the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance (Sept. 25, 27 and 28, 8 p.m.). Yards of taut string create a weblike installation that becomes something of a character in Bauman-Morales's new work "re(source)." Navigating that knotty set, which she created with the interdisciplinary artist Nontsikelelo Mutiti, and surrounded by the audience, Bauman-Morales sings, speaks and dances throughout the space, sharing the story of her own family as an entry point to an exploration of race relations in the United States during the Trump presidency. This performance is presented by the Chocolate Factory and the Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance.
718-482-7069, chocolatefactorytheater.org
JÉRÔME BEL at Florence Gould Hall (Sept. 25, 7:30 p.m.). Since 2004, Bel, an experimental choreographer, has created several biographical works based on the lives of living dancers. "Isadora Duncan," debuting in the United States at the Crossing the Line Festival on Wednesday, is his first dance portrait of a historical figure. Drawing from her autobiography, Bel explores Duncan's art, politics and persona. The work is performed by Catherine Gallant, a New York-based dancer and historian who has also researched Duncan extensively. Together they paint a moving, breathing picture of the free-spirited woman who paved the way for modern dance.
212-355-6160, fiaf.org
AYODELE CASEL AND ARTURO O'FARRILL at the Joyce Theater (Sept. 24-25, 7:30 p.m.; Sept. 26-28, 8 p.m.; through Sept. 29). O'Farrill, a jazz pianist and composer who has won multiple Grammys, is celebrated for his performances of, and contributions to, Afro-Latin music. Casel -- "a spectacular tap artist," according to The New York Times dance critic Gia Kourlas -- also draws from her African-American and Puerto Rican roots in her dancing. Given their shared cultural background and artistic focus, the two are a natural team. Their collaboration, which debuts at the Joyce on Tuesday and features live music and a squad of stellar dancers, explores the relationship between tap, jazz and Afro-Latin culture through various musical and dance styles.
212-242-0800, joyce.org
ANNE TERESA DE KEERSMAEKER at New York Live Arts (through Sept. 28, 7:30 p.m.). This choreographer became highly regarded for hypnotic minimalist works before Beyoncé borrowed her moves and well before she was tapped to choreograph a new "West Side Story" on Broadway this season. The first, in 1982, was "Fase, Four Movements to the Music of Steve Reich," which comes to New York Live Arts starting on Tuesday. Composed of three duets and a solo, "Fase" mimics the propulsive repetitions of Reich's score with simple gestures and small shifts in timing that, when amplified and multiplied, become complex and profound.

FLYAWAY PRODUCTIONS at Louis Engel Park in Ossining, N.Y. (Sept. 20, 8 p.m.; Sept. 21, 3 and 8 p.m.; Sept. 22, 3 p.m.). This San Francisco-based company, directed by Jo Kreiter, often uses bespoke apparatuses to take its dancing off the ground in imaginative ways, and does so in the service of addressing social issues. In "The Wait Room," the physical and emotional toll experienced by women with incarcerated loved ones is expressed by six performers swinging from a teetering contraption, trying to find a sense of balance. The production takes place, boldly and aptly, just outside the walls of the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison north of the city, and is presented by the Sing Sing Prison Museum.

GRAHAM DECONSTRUCTED at the Martha Graham Studio Theater (Sept. 24-25, 7 p.m.). In 1936, Martha Graham's company was invited to participate in the Olympic Games in Berlin, when Hitler was in power. She refused. That same year, she made "Steps in the Street," a prescient depiction of the devastation of war. The work then left the repertory for decades until a film of it was discovered in 1989 and it was revived. For this iteration of the Graham company's behind-the-scenes series, excerpts from the film will be shown alongside a demonstration of the reconstruction process, followed by a performance of the complete work.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET at the David H. Koch Theater (through Oct. 13). Performances of Balanchine's treasured triptych "Jewels" continue on Friday and Saturday, followed on Sunday and Tuesday by a program pairing Mr. B with the acclaimed British choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. Wednesday brings an all-Balanchine program of "Valse Fantaisie," "Kammermusik No. 2" and "Union Jack." On Thursday, City Ballet hosts its eighth Fall Fashion Gala, which features new works from the principal dancer Lauren Lovette and the former soloist Edwaard Liang, and costumes by Zac Posen and Anna Sui. Rounding out the evening is the Balanchine classic "Symphony in C."
212-496-0600, nycballet.com
MARY OVERLIE at Danspace Project (Sept. 23, 8 p.m.). Overlie has been a well-respected dancer and choreographer since the 1960s, though she may be best known for the Six Viewpoints, her philosophy positing that story, time, space, shape, movement and emotion are the building blocks of performance. She is also a founder of several influential performance institutions, including Danspace Project, which launches its 45th anniversary season with a one-off event called "Brain to Brain: A Celebration of the Life and Work of Mary Overlie." Overlie will be joined by a number of current and past collaborators. The show is sold out, but a wait list will begin at the door at 7:15 p.m.
866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org
ELIZABETH STREB AND ANNE BOGART at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University in Montclair, N.J. (Sept. 24-27, 7:30 p.m.; through Sept. 29). What do you get when you mix Bogart, an adventurous theater and opera director, and Streb, a daredevil dance maker, with the unpredictable playwright Charles Mee? "Falling and Loving," a new work co-produced by Peak Performances that premieres on Tuesday. Six actors from Bogart's SITI Company and six dancers from Streb Extreme Action share the stage, along with the Guck Machine, one of Streb's notorious, Seuss-like contraptions that propels both people and materials into the air. The mash-up of such quality ingredients should yield a good time.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Facing mounting criticism for blocking proposals to bolster election security, Senator Mitch McConnell on Thursday threw his weight behind a new infusion of $ 250 million to help states guard against outside interference in the 2020 voting.
Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has been under regular attack from both Democrats and a conservative group for refusing to allow the Senate to vote on various election security proposals, some of them bipartisan, despite dire warnings from the intelligence community that Russia is already trying to replicate the elaborate meddling campaign it carried out during the 2016 presidential contest.
The additional funding, Mr. McConnell said in announcing his support, "will bring our total allocation for election security -- listen to this -- to more than $ 600 million since fiscal 2018." The money was quickly approved by the Appropriations Committee later Thursday.
Though Mr. McConnell has embraced other seemingly derogatory nicknames over the years, he was incensed at being called "Moscow Mitch" by those who claimed his opposition showed he was willing to accept foreign election interference because it had benefited his own party by helping to elect President Trump, despite the senator's long record of taking a hard line against Russia.
Aides said that the criticism had not driven Mr. McConnell's decision to back the measure, and that he had always planned to support new money for state election offices as part of the annual spending bills now working their way through Congress. He and other Republicans, wary of too much federal intervention in state-run elections, preferred providing the new money without new federal requirements that could be added in legislation being pushed by Democrats, they said.
Still, Senate Republicans had previously opposed similar proposals. On Thursday, they said the increase was a way to reassure the public that the states would have the resources they needed to protect the integrity of their elections.
"While different states have used this money in different ways -- and some states frankly haven't used it all -- generally this money has moved the states toward much more security than they otherwise would have had," said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and the chairman of the Rules Committee.
Democrats and activist groups who favor more money have also pushed for sweeping election overhauls circulating in the House and the Senate. But they still welcomed what they painted as a sudden change of heart from Mr. McConnell.
"Leader McConnell kept saying we don't need the money," said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. "But now, thank God, he has seen the light."
"If Americans don't believe their elections are on the up-and-up, woe is us as a country and as a democracy," Mr. Schumer said. "It is not all the money we requested, and it doesn't include a single solitary reform that virtually everyone knows we need, but it's a start."
States would be allowed to use the money in various ways, but part of the federal effort is to make certain that all of them have a voting system in place that includes a way for results to be audited. The added money was included in a bipartisan proposal offered by the two leaders of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat, along with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware.
Other members of the panel hailed it as a potential breakthrough that could lead to more election security measures being advanced by Congress.
"Elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and Congress has a patriotic duty to protect them," said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire. "In addition to funding, there are many steps that Congress needs to take to make sure foreign adversaries don't have free rein to interfere in our democratic process."
In opposing the other election overhauls, Mr. McConnell has criticized them as Democratic attempts to gain a partisan advantage. He also argued that many new protections had already been put in place since 2016, and that the 2018 election showed that they were working.
"The Trump administration has made enormous strides to help states secure their elections without giving Washington new power to push the states around," Mr. McConnell said.
Still, the embrace of the new allocation showed that the attacks on Mr. McConnell and his Republican colleagues over election security were effective enough to shake loose a substantial amount of additional money, leaving open the possibility that the funding could even increase as the Senate enters final spending negotiations with the Democratically controlled House.

Not all roads lead to Roe

Texto completo: The decision by the New York Times to remove a key exculpatory fact from its recent article on Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh is such an incredible editing error that it raises the prospect that it might have been an ideological intervention.
What editor, looking to cut down an article containing a new allegation of collegiate penis exposure, would happen to remove the detail that the female object of said exposure has told friends she has no memory of it? Any sentient editor would realize that the section containing this accusation would attract intense scrutiny. Nearly every other sentence in the piece was a more likely candidate for excision.
But why would an ideologically motivated editor remove a fact that is contained in the book ("The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation") on which the article is based? This would be bias compounded by utter stupidity.
It has not helped that the Times responded to the controversy with all the transparency of an embezzling politician. At first, the Times said it was proud of the "well-reported and newsworthy" piece. Then the authors of the article (Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly) blamed their editors for the cut on national television. And that the whole thing was "just an oversight." And that the sentence was removed because it contained the name of the supposed victim.
The last explanation assumes utter stupidity on the part of readers. If it is the policy of the Times not to reveal the names of possible sexual assault victims, why not just remove the name of the victim (who does not recall being a victim)? Why remove the whole sentence containing news about her not having any memory of the event?
Whether the result of bias or incompetence, this is journalistic malpractice of the first order. And its happiest critic is President Trump.
Whatever the initial plausibility of the case against Kavanaugh, it has grown weaker over time. The "previously unreported story" of exposure in the Times article is based on the accusations of one witness whom the authors did not interview and the supposed victim, according to friends, does not recall the incident. Support for Deborah Ramirez's allegation of sexual exposure remains an unconvincing collection of partial memories and secondhand accounts.
And the reported portions of "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" do little to make Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of attempted sexual assault more credible. Ford's main character witness is her high school friend Leland Keyser. "We spoke multiple times to Keyser," write Pogrebin and Kelly, "who also said that she didn't recall that get-together or any others like it. In fact, she challenged Ford's accuracy. 'I don't have any confidence in the story,' she said."
All of this leaves many of us in exactly the same place as before. We should take charges such as these very seriously. But it should not be possible to destroy a person's reputation on evidence so thin.
Why does the campaign to discredit Kavanaugh continue with such intensity? Some critics might be concerned about his views on campaign finance reform or the unitary executive. But the matter that provokes the most passion is abortion.
"When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade ," Ford's lawyer Debra Katz has said, "we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important: It is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine." The goal, it seems, is to preemptively discredit an unfavorable court decision by putting what Katz describes as "an asterisk" next to Kavanaugh's name.
This strategy is one indicator of the unhealthy focus of our entire political system on Roe v. Wade . Because it touches on the deepest issues of autonomy and human dignity, the legal status of abortion is crucial. The problem comes when we see all politics through the lens of one issue.
Many on the right justify support for Trump because his corruption and dehumanization are less important than saving lives from abortion. But it is a theory without a limiting principle. It would justify voting for some pro-life politician who is a child molester. It would, quite literally, justify voting for a pro-life president who shot someone on Fifth Avenue.
Many on the left rationalize using Trump-like tactics against someone like Kavanaugh on the theory that preserving Roe justifies any means. If you can't control the Supreme Court, trash it. Call the legitimacy of rulings by the court into question. The politics of personal destruction have merged with the politics of institutional destruction.
But not all roads lead to Roe . And opposing it, or preserving it, does not justify every method.

The US shouldn't fight a war for Saudi oil

Texto completo: From Donald Trump's comments on the attack on a Saudi oil facility, allegedly by Iran, it's not clear whether he's itching for a fight, leery of a fight or willing to take part in a fight if his friends in Riyadh want him to. He alternates between talking tough, waxing conciliatory and sounding as though he has no idea what to do.
But the chance of U.S. military action can never be discounted, because, well, we're the United States and military action is our default option -- under presidents of both parties. We are never short of reasons to put our forces in harm's way.
The reason in this case would be that Iran is our enemy and stands accused of being responsible for a strike on a complex that normally puts out 5.7 million barrels of oil per day -- some 5% of the world supply. We would be coming to the aid of the Saudi rulers, who buy our weapons, get along with Trump and share our hostility toward Tehran.
They would be happy to hold our coat while we punch their foe. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates once told the French foreign minister that the Saudis would "fight the Iranians to the last American." But why Americans should take risky actions for their sake is hard to imagine.
Saudi Arabia is not a treaty ally. Its proxy war with Iran in Yemen has nothing to do with us. When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, the Saudis were unhelpful. In 2016, Trump himself said they were "the world's biggest funders of terrorism."
A measure of the regime's toxic character is that, as The New York Times reported, "the Islamic State adopted official Saudi textbooks for its schools until the extremist group could publish its own books in 2015." Saudi agents murdered a Washington Post journalist and dismembered him with a bone saw.
We have sometimes found the Saudis to be a useful partner. But just because their interests sometimes converge with ours is no reason to put American lives at risk over their troubles with Iran. The kingdom has the third-biggest military budget in the world, and its arsenal includes American-made F-15s. The Saudis can punish Iran if they choose.
It's worth wondering why Iran would lash out like this. It is suffering under U.S. economic sanctions -- which University of Michigan Middle East scholar Juan Cole describes as the most severe ever imposed on a country in peacetime. For domestic and geopolitical reasons, Iran apparently thinks it has to retaliate. Disrupting the supply of oil is a way of communicating that if Iran is going to suffer, others will also feel the pain.
The reason the Iranians are suffering is that Trump walked away from a deal that rolled back their nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. He then ratcheted up the sanctions, proving to Iranians the futility of compromising with Washington.
What can we do now? Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted, "It is now time for the U.S. to put on the table an attack on Iranian oil refineries." Punishing an attack that reduced oil supplies by mounting an attack to reduce them even more would be a bizarre tactic. It would compound the harm allegedly done by the Iranians rather than neutralize it.
Neutralizing it would not be so hard. The Riyadh regime says it can cover any shortfall from its inventory and restore full production shortly. Even if it can't, University of Notre Dame political scientist Rosemary Kelanic, author of the forthcoming book, "Black Gold and Blackmail: Oil and Great Power Politics," tells me, strategic petroleum reserves in the U.S. and our allies could fill the gap for nearly two years.
Any increase in prices would also stimulate output everywhere from Russia to West Texas, which would soon bring them back down. The United States, keep in mind, is now the world's biggest producer, pumping far more than Saudi Arabia.
The overall economic fallout of this episode is likely to be mild. A war with Iran, by contrast, would have brutal economic consequences around the world, not to mention the human carnage.
Maybe Trump should have thought of that before. He abandoned the nuclear deal in the belief that he could force Iran to beg for mercy -- a strategy that has only backfired. He is learning an old lesson: It's easier to get yourself into a fight than to get yourself out of one.

Texto completo: In a statement, Lujan Grisham called it "a game-changer for New Mexico" and said it would culminate in "improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and families and parents (and) a better trained and better compensated workforce."
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a plan Wednesday that would make New Mexico the second state to offer full college tuition to state residents.
The governor announced her plan at the state's Higher Education Summit at Central New Mexico Community College in Albuquerque. The proposal is for a "last dollar" program covering 100 percent of undergraduate tuition and fees not paid for by federal grants or the New Mexico Lottery Scholarship.
Branded the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship, the plan is estimated to benefit 55,000 New Mexico students at all 29 public higher education institutions in the state, beginning in the fall of 2020.
The scholarship, applicable to two- and four-year institutions, would be administered by the New Mexico Higher Education Department and available for New Mexico residents with a high school diploma or equivalency. A minimum grade-point average of 2.5 would be a requirement of the scholarship.
In a statement, Lujan Grisham called it "a game-changer for New Mexico" and said it would culminate in "improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and families and parents (and) a better trained and better compensated workforce."
Ultimately, her proposal would require approval in the state legislature.
Role of oil and gas industry The New York Times broke news of the governor's proposal Wednesday morning, stating that the governor "plans to use climbing revenues from oil production to pay for much of the costs" of the scholarship.
New Mexico Oil and Gas Association Executive Director Ryan Flynn issued a statement following the announcement.
"Big, bold ideas like this are the type the transformational opportunities New Mexico now has because of the success and growth of the oil and natural gas industry," Flynn said. "This is a great example of how the Governor can leverage increased oil and natural gas production to the benefit of all New Mexicans regardless of where they live, work, or go to school. Our state has enjoyed two consecutive billion-dollar budget surpluses on the strength oil and natural gas, and we're committed to continuing our role as the economic foundation of New Mexico while safely and responsibly producing the energy we need."
Flynn pointed to an industry study predicting the industry could attract $174 billion in infrastructure investments in the Permian Basin through 2030.
Presently, a boom in production and recent discovery of more supply in the Permian Basic has boosted general fund revenue fiscal year far exceeding the state's current $7 billion budget.
Executives of oil and gas companies attending an annual energy summit in Carlsbad last week expressed confidence in long-term production in the region.
However, prior to an upturn in revenue from the oil and gas industry in 2018, sagging tax revenues from the oil and gas sector in 2016 led to deep cuts in public K-12 education.
'It requires a commitment of priorities' In attendance at the higher education summit was Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard, who said he first heard rumors of the governor's proposal on Tuesday and likened it to the Apollo mission.
Her announcement to the summit did not include details, he said, but presented an objective Shepard likened to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to place an astronaut safely on the moon within that decade.
Lujan Grisham herself has frequently described her ambition for improving education in New Mexico as a "moonshot."
Shepard acknowledged the need to assess consistent revenue streams supporting the program.
"It requires a commitment of priorities — the moonshot, so to speak," Shepard said when reached by phone in Albuquerque. "Often we say, 'we don't have the budget for it,' but budget is about how we allocate resources."
He also said, to those who criticize New Mexico's economy for being overly reliant on revenue from the oil and gas industry, that increasing affordable access to higher education was essential for diversifying the state's economy.
Shepard said the plan's next step will be the New Mexico Higher Education Advisory Committee, which includes state cabinet secretaries for higher education, the department of workforce solutions, finance and administration, economic development, and the director of the legislative finance committee, or delegates.
Tribal colleges included in proposal The governor's office confirmed Wednesday that the tuition proposal would include New Mexico's four tribal colleges: Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and the Crownpoint and Shiprock campuses of Diné College.
Diné College President Charles "Monty" Roessel hailed the proposal, which follows legislation earlier this year opening lottery scholarships to students at tribal colleges in New Mexico.
"I think it's a great plan and I give the governor a lot of credit," Roessel said, adding, "I think it's a wonderful opportunity for all Native Americans."
Roessel was also in attendance at the summit.
A gift to Texas and Arizona? Gavin Clarkson, who taught at New Mexico State University's college of business prior to serving in the Trump Administration and is currently a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, criticized the proposal.
"Unfortunately, making public colleges free for even the wealthiest of families will be a big boon to workforce development — in Texas and Arizona," Clarkson said in a statement. "It does nothing to address the lack of high-quality jobs that would keep our college graduates here in New Mexico."
Clarkson added, "If we're going to subsidize higher education, we owe it to both students and taxpayers to target those resources towards empowering citizens with the kind of skills that will actually add value to New Mexico's economy."
Preparing for a 21st-century economy New Mexico State University Chancellor Dan Arvizu was also in attendance at Wednesday's summit.
In a statement, Arvizu wrote, "No matter what socioeconomic background our students arrive from, attaining a degree positions them to earn higher salaries, to live healthier lives and to achieve greater successes than someone without a degree. In turn, this helps their families and lifts the communities where they live. We are eager to see where this endeavor can lead our state. Right now, we are assessing what implications this announcement may have for the entire NMSU system."
Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley called the governor's proposal "brave" yet essential for helping new generations of New Mexico workers. He said that students who continue their education beyond secondary school with minimal student debt will have more options to explore job opportunities or establish themselves as entrepreneurs.
"Since 2008 and the great recession, over 95 percent of the new jobs that have been created in the country require more than a high school degree," McCamley said. "We're not just talking about bachelor's degrees, we're talking about associate's degrees and industry-specific certificates. The point of it is, you need more than a high school degree to make it in a 21st-century economy and that's why the governor's proposal is so important."

Texto completo: The New York Times, by its executive editor's own admission, is increasingly engaged in a project of reporting everything through the prism of white supremacy and critical race theory, in order to "teach" its readers to think in these crudely reductionist and racial terms. That's why the paper's 1619 Project on the legacy of slavery in America wasn't called, say, "special issue," but a "project." It's as much activism as journalism.
And that's the reason I'm dwelling on this a few weeks later. I'm constantly told that critical race theory is secluded on college campuses and has no impact outside of them . and yet the newspaper of record, in a dizzyingly short space of time, is now captive to it. Its magazine covers the legacy of slavery not with a variety of scholars or a diversity of views, but with critical race theory, espoused almost exclusively by black writers, as its sole interpretative mechanism.
Don't get me wrong. I think that view deserves to be heard. The idea that the core truth of human society is that it is composed of invisible systems of oppression based on race (sex, gender, etc.), and that liberal democracy is merely a mask to conceal this core truth, and that a liberal society must therefore be dismantled in order to secure racial/social justice is a legitimate worldview. (That view that "systems" determine human history and that the individual is a mere cog in those systems is what makes it neo-Marxist and anti-liberal.)
But I sure don't think it deserves to be incarnated as the only way to understand our collective history, let alone be presented as the authoritative truth in a newspaper people rely on for some gesture toward objectivity.
This is therefore, in its overreach, ideology masquerading as neutral scholarship.
Take a simple claim: No aspect of our society is unaffected by the legacy of slavery. Sure. Absolutely. Of course. But, when you consider this statement a little more, you realize this is either banal or meaningless. The complexity of history in a country of such size and diversity means that everything we do now has roots in many, many things that came before us.
You could say the same thing about the English common law, for example, or the use of the English language: No aspect of American life is untouched by it. You could say that about the Enlightenment. Or the climate. You could say that America's unique existence as a frontier country bordered by lawlessness is felt even today in every mass shooting. You could cite the death of countless millions of Native Americans - by violence and disease - as something that defines all of us in America today. And in a way it does.
But that would be to engage in a liberal inquiry into our past, teasing out the nuances and the balance of various forces throughout history, weighing each against each other along with the thoughts and actions of remarkable individuals - in the manner of, say, the excellent new history of the U.S., "These Truths" by Jill Lepore.
But The Times chose a neo-Marxist rather than liberal path to make a very specific claim: that slavery is not one of many things that describe America's founding and culture; it is the definitive one. Arguing that the "true founding" was the arrival of African slaves on the continent, period, is a bitter rebuke to the actual founders and Abraham Lincoln. America is not a messy, evolving, multicultural, religiously infused, Enlightenment-based, racist, liberating, wealth-generating kaleidoscope of a society. It's white supremacy, which started in 1619, and that's the key to understand all of it. America's only virtue, in this telling, belongs to those who have attempted and still attempt to end this malign manifestation of white supremacy.
I don't believe most African Americans believe this, outside the elites. They're much less doctrinaire than elite white leftists on a whole range of subjects. I don't buy it either - alongside, I suspect, most immigrants, including most immigrants of color. Who would ever want to immigrate to such a vile and oppressive place?
But it is extremely telling that this is not merely aired in the paper of record (as it should be), but that it is aggressively presented as objective reality. That's propaganda, directed, as we now know, from the very top - and now being marched through the entire educational system to achieve a specific end.
To present a truth as the truth is, in fact, a deception. And it is hard to trust a paper engaged in trying to deceive its readers in order for its radical reporters and weak editors to transform the world.

Anti-Semitic Slur by Trenton Official Provokes Outrage

Texto completo: At a closed meeting, the City Council president in Trenton, New Jersey's capital, used an anti-Semitic slur to describe the negotiation tactics of a Jewish city attorney.
"They were able to wait her out and jew her down," the president, Kathy McBride, said, according to a recording.
The comment, made at a session on Sept. 5, came to light on Friday, drew condemnations from state and local officials. On Tuesday, after not addressing the situation for days, Ms. McBride publicly apologized at the start of the Council meeting.
"In my position, you cannot make anyone feel insulted, or you cannot be insensitive to any ethnic backgrounds, so I am apologizing to the community at large," she said.
But that did not quell the controversy. On Wednesday, it spread to Washington, with all 12 members of New Jersey's House of Representatives delegation calling for public apologies or resignations from two Trenton lawmakers who had come to Ms. McBride's defense.
"Anti-Semitism is on the rise around the world and right here in New Jersey," the lawmakers said in a joint statement. "We must never accept bigotry or hatred in any form."
The city attorney, Peter Cohen, who was not at the meeting where the slur was used, said he was somewhat bewildered by the attention that Ms. McBride's remarks about him had generated. He said he did not believe Ms. McBride harbored anti-Semitic views.
Still, he called her comments "disappointing," saying they invoked a negative stereotype that was troubling in light of increasingly incendiary rhetoric used against racial, ethnic and religious groups.
The uproar over Ms. McBride's remarks comes amid a global resurgence of anti-Semitic attitudes. Experts have tracked a rising number of crimes against Jews worldwide, including violent and deadly attacks.
New Jersey, a state with a significant Jewish population, had the third-highest number of anti-Semitic incidents in the country in 2018, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Over the summer, two men believed to be harboring anti-Semitic views were arrested in separate cases after officers discovered they owned stockpiles of weapons and troves of white-supremacist material.
But several recent incidents where public officials used anti-Semitic rhetoric have also caused concern in Jewish communities. Last week, a councilman in Paterson, N.J., also used the phrase "jew us down" at a meeting. In August, the president of a local N.A.A.C.P. chapter was fired from his government job over anti-Semitic and anti-Latino comments he made on Facebook.
"It's showing that maybe people are more comfortable using language they didn't feel comfortable using previously," said Evan R. Bernstein, the Anti-Defamation League's regional director for New York and New Jersey.
In Trenton, a city of about 84,000, the controversy was as much about Ms. McBride's remark as it was about the two council members, Robin Vaughn and George Muschal, who seemed to play down the comments.
In the meeting on Sept. 5, lawmakers were discussing a lawsuit brought by a resident who had been seriously injured after tripping on a city sidewalk. The resident was set to receive about $ 22,000 in the settlement.
Both Ms. Vaughn and another councilman, Santiago Rodriguez, told The New York Times that Ms. McBride believed the injured woman deserved more money.
The meeting was held in executive session and was closed to the public. The city denied The Times's public-records request for a recording, saying it was protected by attorney-client privilege. But on Monday, The Trentonian posted a recording it had obtained of Ms. McBride's comments.
"I'm sad for her," Ms. McBride is heard saying. "They were able to wait her out and jew her down for $ 22,000 with pins in her knee that can never ever be repaired."
Ms. McBride did not respond to several requests for an interview. But Mr. Cohen said that he believed her comments were not made with malicious intent.
"I believe that was a phrase that she had heard a thousand times or more, and she did not actually believe that it was offensive," he said.
However, he added, the use of the phrase suggested "a level of sensitivity that needs to be addressed."
The use of "jew" as a verb meaning "to cheat" has been in English dictionaries for decades, with the Oxford English Dictionary citing its use as early as 1825, but it is considered offensive.
"This age-old stereotype needs to be put away," Mr. Bernstein said. "Not elevated, and certainly not elevated by elected officials."
After Trenton's mayor, Reed Gusciora, who oversees the city's Law Department, learned of Ms. McBride's remark, he emailed the entire Council, saying Mr. Cohen deserved an apology.
"Comments like that are just not helpful, and should not be part of the public discourse," Mr. Gusciora said in an interview.
Once the mayor's email became public, Ms. Vaughn and Mr. Muschal rose to Ms. McBride's defense.
On Facebook, Ms. Vaughn said on Sunday that the phrase was "a verb and is not anti-anything." Mr. Muschal, in an interview with New Jersey Globe, said that the expression had been used "millions of times" and was "just a statement of speech."
Mr. Muschal apologized privately to Mr. Cohen on Monday, both men said. In an email to The Times, Mr. Muschal added that he meant no harm by his remarks.
"If I offended anyone in the Jewish community, I hope they will accept my sincere apology," he wrote. "There was no malicious intent."
Mr. Muschal also said that Mr. Cohen told him that he "uses the phrase all the time," which Mr. Cohen disputed.
In an interview on Monday, Ms. Vaughn said that she understood that Ms. McBride's statement was inappropriate and that she did not condone it.
"I absolutely understand that it's derogatory, that the Jewish community would be offended by it, just like I would be offended by the n-word," said Ms. Vaughn, who is African-American.
Yet she disputed the characterization of Ms. McBride as anti-Semitic, saying the context of the remark was important.
But by Wednesday night, Ms. Vaughn decided to apologize.
"My comments were wrong," she said in a statement. "Never was it my intention to hurt, disrespect or demean anyone when I described a racial slur or its usage, as a verb."
She added about Ms. McBride: "I do not believe her to hate Jews nor harbor anti-Semitic feelings. Nonetheless, my defense of her behavior was an error of my judgment."
Mr. Cohen said he had not spoken with Ms. Vaughn but anticipated a future conversation.
In general, he said, he hoped the controversy might be a teachable opportunity for Trenton residents.
"Maybe we're all being confronted with this," Mr. Cohen said, "so we can undertake more of an effort to bring our communities together.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: At the inaugural DealBook DC Strategy Forum , sponsored by The New York Times, influential leaders in academia, business and politics gathered to discuss and debate provocative issues, and provide innovative solutions to some of our nation's top policy agenda challenges. Task forces developed recommendations for businesses and policymakers, identifying some central questions that will be driving conversations through the 2020 election.
______
Can Taxing the Wealthy Fix the Economy?
Taxing the rich is having a moment in American politics, even more than usual.
For decades, Democrats and Republicans in Washington have battled over how much money the highest-earning Americans should send to the federal government each year -- a fight that has mostly played out between a few percentage points of the top marginal rate of income taxes. President Bill Clinton raised that rate, George W. Bush lowered it, and Barack Obama raised it again. President Trump's 2017 tax cuts lowered it. It was the political equivalent of watching two football teams push the ball back and forth between the 40 yard lines.
As the 2020 election approaches, a new crop of Democratic candidates has opened a much larger field of play on the issue, cheered by voters who tell pollsters the economy is stacked against the working class and in favor of the rich. Those candidates are looking beyond the income tax -- which many of them would increase for the rich, to be clear -- and offering plans to tax wealth, investments and a variety of other hallmarks of the economic top 1 percent.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggests a tax on the 75,000 wealthiest American households, as well as a suite of increased investment and payroll taxes on high earners. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont wants to increase significantly the tax rate that heirs must pay when inheriting large estates, to raise the top income tax rate above 50 percent and to increase taxes for businesses and for wealthy investors who earn money from dividends and capital gains.
The flurry of proposals are entwined with questions of economic fairness, mobility and efficiency. JIM TANKERSLEY
Recommendations
CLOSE INHERITANCE LOOPHOLES The government should eliminate the so-called "step-up in basis" for assets that are passed on at death, which allows wealthy heirs to avoid taxes.
INCREASE TAX COMPLIANCE More funding should be allocated for tax enforcement to increase compliance and raise more tax revenue.
BETTER BENEFITS FOR WORKING FAMILIES The earned-income tax credit could be improved and expanded in ways that increase fairness and mobility.
Disputes
Some members of the panel, including James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, viewed the proposal of a wealth tax as simply punitive, arguing that it targeted the wealthy without accomplishing larger aims like fairness or social mobility. Other members, including Gene Sperling, a former economic adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, argued that this is an important moment in which the concept of fairness and economic dignity has become central to the larger debate around tax reform. Abigail Disney argued it was wrong for people like her, who inherit wealth, to pay lower taxes than people who work for their income.

How to Deal With Legal Weed
Cannabis legalization in the United States and Canada was promoted as a radical social experiment that would tame the illegal trade and usher in a new era of responsible drug use.
However, the results have been mixed.
Hundreds of illegal dispensaries in California continue to proliferate, and the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, recently ordered National Guard troops near the Mexican border to go after black market cannabis farms. And pot regulations have been unevenly applied. While major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco host cannabis retailers, 80 percent of California's nearly 500 municipalities do not.
In Canada, it has been nearly a year since the country became the first major world economy to legalize recreational cannabis -- a seminal moment akin to ending Prohibition in the United States. Yet a black market that has previously been estimated at 5.3 billion Canadian dollars continues to thrive, and legal sales are far below what proponents of legalization had hoped for.
Six months after Canada legalized pot for recreational use, more than 40 percent of Canadian cannabis users said they bought it from illegal sources, according to a recent report from Canada's national statistics office. Proponents of legalization argue that it is far too early to pass judgment; it took several years for legal sales in Colorado to surpass 70 percent, for example. DAN BILEFSKY
Recommendations
BETTER EDUCATION ABOUT RISKS Amid the notion that legalization has not been met by adequate education about risks of use, the industry should be required to fund a campaign to educate people on the risks of cannabis, but not be involved in writing the literature. Education should have a strong focus on youth to try and delay the onset of teen use.
CONNECT BANKS WITH LEGAL DISTRIBUTORS Pass the Safe Banking Act, which would destigmatize financial relations between banks and businesses that might have an ancillary relationship with cannabis companies.
Normalizing banking industry relations with cannabis companies, growers and retailers will help bring businesses out of the illicit market.
Disputes
Some members of the panel did not agree that cannabis should be legal, given its illegality at the federal level. While most people agreed with the necessity of some amnesty, as the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people from marginalized communities, there was little agreement on what decriminalization should look like.
______
What Will End the Student Debt Crisis?
Americans owe nearly $ 1.6 trillion on student loans. The debt has tripled in less than 15 years and eclipsed the amount due on credit cards, auto loans and all consumer debts outside of mortgages. For a generation of students -- and, in many families, their parents -- the cost of college has become a crisis. One in four adult Americans has student loan debt; the typical borrower owes more than $ 20,000.
The federal government is the primary lender for those who borrow for college, and the Education Department has effectively become one of the nation's biggest banks. It directly holds more than $ 1.2 trillion in loans owed by 34 million people.
There are signs that the burden is weighing on the broader economy. Homeownership rates among those under 32 dropped significantly over the last decade, which is partly attributable to their student loan debts, Federal Reserve researchers said in a recent report. The increase in debt has also hindered small business formation, reduced young adults' retirement savings and contributed to lower marriage rates, economists have found.
The issue has become a signature policy point for some 2020 presidential hopefuls. STACY COWLEY
Recommendations
EXPAND TARGETED DEBT RELIEF Most panelists agreed that some portion of the $ 1.6 trillion owed on student loans needed to be written off. The government's current income-based repayment plans on federal student loans (which can culminate in debt forgiveness) should be improved and may also need to be paired with outright debt elimination for some borrowers.
EXPAND FREE PUBLIC EDUCATION; ASK MORE OF STATES AND BUSINESSES Students are guaranteed a free education from kindergarten through high school, but that education is no longer sufficient for many jobs. Offering free higher education -- as more than a dozen states have done, to varying degrees -- can keep students out of debt and improve the nation's work force. But successful outcomes require a sustained and nuanced commitment from states and, ideally, from employers, too.
Disputes
The panel broadly agreed that student lending should be restructured to make the amount students repay for higher education more contingent on their post-college income. But there was strong disagreement about whether the approach should focus on improved income-based repayment options or should shift to income-share agreements, in which students agree to pay a portion of their future income to a financier in exchange for an education. Some panel participants said they wanted the federal government to exit student lending entirely.
Task Force Moderator: Rebecca Blumenstein, deputy managing editor, The New York Times. Participants: Mary Clare, policy analyst, The Heritage Foundation; Sheila Bair, director, Volcker Alliance; Sandy Baum, nonresident fellow, Urban Institute; Rachel Carlson, chief executive and co-founder, Guild Education; Seth Frotman, executive director, Student Borrower Protection Center; Ashley Harrington, senior policy counsel, Center for Responsible Lending; Drew Holler, senior vice president of associate experience, Walmart; Farnam Jahanian, president, Carnegie Mellon University; Geoff Lewis, founder and managing partner, Bedrock; Yvette Mozie-Ross, vice provost for enrollment management and planning, University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Gov.

Can Pricing Carbon Stall Climate Change?
Earlier this month, the 10 top-polling Democratic primary candidates took part in a CNN town hall event on climate change, the first prime-time televised forum devoted to the issue in a presidential campaign.
In perhaps the most significant development of that night, nine of the 10 candidates openly embraced the idea of putting a tax or fee on carbon dioxide pollution. While most economists agree it is the best way to cut emissions, it has drawn intense political opposition, such as from the so-called yellow-vest protesters in France last winter, when protests shut down the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.
And this year, even as the issue of climate change gained political prominence, progressive lawmakers did not include a carbon tax or price in the Green New Deal.
Still, recent scientific reports, which have concluded that the impacts of climate change -- stronger storms, droughts, heat waves, rising sea levels and flooding -- are already being felt, have also called more explicitly on governments to respond by pricing carbon.
Polls have shown that rising numbers of Democratic primary, millennial and independent voters see climate change as an increasingly important issue. But the political path for the promise of turning that pledge into legislation remains steep and tricky. CORAL DAVENPORT
Recommendations
NET ZERO EMISSIONS Although the panel could not reach consensus on how exactly we would get here, they agreed the federal government needs to place a limit on greenhouse gases with the goal of net zero emissions by no later than 2050, combined with carbon pricing.
REDIRECT FUNDS IN POSITIVE WAYS A portion of the revenue from carbon pricing should go toward underserved and low-income communities, supporting them in a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.
Disputes
Members of the panel were divided on whether trading a carbon tax in exchange for stripping away regulations would be the most effective way to lower emissions. While most members of the panel agreed with the necessity of a price on carbon in general, there was little agreement on how to make a price on carbon palatable to Republicans and businesses, or even whether appealing to them is an important element to consider.

How to Keep Private Data Private
New revelations seem to emerge every month or so about privacy violations by the internet's biggest platforms. With concerns over online privacy increasing, United States regulators and lawmakers are scrambling to create laws and regulations to protect internet users.
The result so far has amounted to a fractured and often dizzying regulatory landscape for businesses trying to navigate the limits of their ability to collect, share and protect user data.
It has been a striking turn of events for Silicon Valley, which Democrats and Republicans had for years sought to bolster by limiting laws that could curb the growth of America's brightest engine of economic growth. But with Europe's implementation last year of a privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation and issues like Facebook's mishandling of data harvested by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, the question for lawmakers is not whether to regulate, but how forcefully.
Members of Congress have promised a new comprehensive federal privacy law to keep in step with Europe's groundbreaking law. There are even state and federal proposals to put a price on the value of personal data, and internet companies would have to pay users in order to profit from their information. CECILIA KANG
Recommendations
PASS A COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL LAW The law would pre-empt (or nullify) one in California that is about to go into place, because the existence of state and federal laws creates a confusing regulatory landscape. This federal law must create baseline standards on the kind of data collection companies can pursue.
BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS A federal law should include greater enforcement abilities on the federal level, specifically at the Federal Trade Commission. The F.T.C. should be given more resources with a bigger budget from Congress, as well as rule-making authority. States should still be able to enforce a federal law.
Disputes
One member, Gabriel Weinberg, the founder and chief executive of DuckDuckGo, proposed a law called Do Not Track that would enable consumers to limit data tracking, giving them more control over their data and also solving a problem with competition in the tech industry, where Google and Facebook command the online advertising industry. Several members disagreed with Mr. Weinberg's proposal because they said it was too narrow and could defeat the broader goal of a comprehensive federal law.

Can Cyberattacks Be Prevented?
At the end of World War I, the airplane, invented to speed transport, suddenly looked fearsome. It had been turned into a weapon of war. It was still a matter of debate whether the aeroplane, as the British called it, could cause mass chaos or threaten entire cities. But that is what happened a quarter-century later.
The same debate now rages over cyberpower. Connectivity has changed our lives and made possible applications we never dreamed of decades ago -- with many more to come. But we are way past the moment when the biggest fear is spies using cyber for espionage, or thieves draining our bank accounts because we clicked on the wrong link in a phishing scam. Cyberattacks can range from election interference, to the manipulation of financial or medical data, to the physical destruction of equipment, whether nuclear centrifuges or entire power grids.
A series of ransomware attacks this summer has proved that for all the talk about major advances in protecting ourselves, small towns, school boards and water districts are wildly vulnerable to extortion. With a few exceptions, the best protected have spent tens of millions of dollars on detection and deterrence.
And now there is another concern: New high-speed 5G networks will create all kinds of new applications, but they will also allow attacks to move much more quickly and create new vulnerabilities. "We can't forget," said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, "that every better tool is also a better weapon." DAVID E. SANGER
Recommendations
BAN THE TERM "CYBERSECURITY" There are huge differences between the theft of intellectual property, the breach of a bank account, a disinformation campaign and a state-sponsored attack to shut down a power plant or a missile launch. And protecting against each attack involves a radically different approach. Grouping them all as "cybersecurity" problems makes solving them harder. Instead, focus on the kind of problem we are trying to solve and think of comprehensive ways to approach them -- some of which will involve cyber protections, but some of which won't.
NONDIGITAL BACKUPS FOR ELECTIONS Some functions are too important to trust to the vulnerabilities of electronic manipulation. There is no excuse for not having a forensic trail for elections that is nondigital, and thus not subject to digital attacks. And these systems need resilience. At a moment when the government is worried about "ransomware" attacks on states, cities and town voter registration databases, make sure the voter rolls are backed up and printed out.
Disputes
Vast amounts of information about vulnerabilities is classified by the government -- making it hard to discuss, much less protect against. Our experts disagreed on whether there could be a presumption that vulnerabilities are quickly, if not instantly, shared. The intelligence agencies fiercely want to protect their sources and methods, and the big users of this data say collecting it is useless if the government is going to spend weeks or months before sending up an alert.

Texto completo: In a head-spinning few days, Republicans have moved into a full offensive posture over the latest allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, leaving congressional Democrats in a defensive crouch as they try to change the subject.
Tuesday's dueling news conferences, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), perfectly captured the new dynamic.
After their respective policy lunches, McConnell devoted his entire opening remarks, more than three minutes, to the Kavanaugh issue, highlighting a clarification the New York Times added to an article about how an alleged victim did not recall an alleged incident of sexual misconduct during the justice's college days.
"I think it is truly outrageous. We had this investigation a year ago; we had this vote a year ago," McConnell told reporters.
That came after McConnell, opening the Senate floor Monday, devoted his entire remarks, more than five minutes, to the Kavanaugh issue with just as much indignation.
Schumer never mentioned the latest Kavanaugh imbroglio in Tuesday's opening comments and appeared exhausted when the topic came up as the very first question.
"Look, I've said this before, very simply. I never thought Kavanaugh should be on the bench, and I still don't today," he told reporters.
In Senate floor speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, Schumer covered the waterfront of pending issues: President Trump's ongoing demands for more money to build a barrier at the border, the overall government funding deadline of Sept. 30, potential gun-control legislation, a federal regulatory review of Chinese telecom firms, election security legislation, climate rules and a presidential nomination.
No Kavanaugh.
Since the first allegations emerged a year ago Monday, in a Washington Post article, the Kavanaugh saga has evolved in a familiar refrain.
Seemingly credible accusations get made; Democrats pounce and demand investigations. Republicans grow quiet, until some other allegation emerges that appears to go too far. Then Republicans go into full umbrage mode, pushing Democrats back until the nominee is confirmed (or, in this week's case, until Democrats change the subject).
Some Democrats acknowledged that the ground had completely shifted, telling reporters Republicans were enjoying this story.
"Well, they are," said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in leadership.
At that moment on Tuesday, a GOP senator was holding the floor and criticizing those Democrats who were calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment over the issue, including two senators running for the 2020 presidential nomination, Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).
Durbin lamented that so many jump to impeachment, whether of Trump or other administration officials. It is virtually impossible to get to a two-thirds majority for a conviction in the Senate - which means any impeachment would divert the Democratic-led House's energy from kitchen-table issues.
"You know, it's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. It's rare in American history," the Democratic whip said.
"I just don't believe that this is what we should be doing at this point. I mean, I voted against the man; I don't believe he should be on the Supreme Court," he added.
Senior House Democrats have also tried to sidestep the Kavanaugh matter, although their inquiry into Trump's 2016 campaign has the potential to turn into its own impeachment process.
"We are concentrating our resources on determining whether to impeach the president," Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told a New York radio station Monday.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), asked whether the House needed to look into the new allegation against Kavanaugh, said no.
As a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Durbin had a front-row seat for last September's epic clash over Kavanaugh. It played out in similar fashion, albeit in a longer, slower process than that of these past few days.
On Sept. 16, 2018, The Post story landed, with Christine Blasey Ford, a professor in Palo Alto who grew up in the Maryland suburbs at the same time as Kavanaugh, accusing him of pinning her to a bed during a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh denied the allegation.
Coming on the heels of the #MeToo movement, the claim knocked Republicans back on their heels. They agreed to hold a hearing with Ford and then Kavanaugh to address the issues, but Republicans were afraid to be seen even asking Ford or the nominee about the allegations, so they hired a female Arizona prosecutor to ask the questions.
As the hearing approached, more allegations surfaced against Kavanaugh, most prominently from high-profile attorney Michael Avenatti's client talking about gang rape parties.
When the hearing unfolded, Ford's testimony was poised and, to most senators, credible. Midway through questioning of Kavanaugh, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) started asking his own questions, latching on to the most fantastic allegations and asking the then-federal judge whether he had committed those crimes.
It conflated the stories and made the entire process look bad, which created a conservative rallying cry on behalf of Kavanaugh. He won confirmation, with 50 votes, on Oct. 6.
That clash helped galvanize conservative voters, who helped Republicans flip Senate seats in the red-leaning states of Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, adding to the GOP majority during a midterm election that was otherwise miserable for Trump's party.
Now, Democrats fear that this is deja vu, all over again.
The New York Times posted an article Saturday night by two reporters summarizing findings of their new book, which appeared to back up a claim of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh while at Yale University.
Such verification would raise the possibility that the justice lied to the Senate in his hearing last September, a potentially impeachable offense. Harris and Warren called for impeachment hearings. But the Times article included another allegation of similar behavior that drew most of the attention, until editors posted an update Sunday that included the alleged victim's failure to recall the incident.
Like Graham a year ago, Republicans jumped on this journalistic mishap to try to destroy the overall content of the book. "I'm distressed by the declining journalistic principles, so much on display," McConnell said Tuesday.
While Democrats tried to turn the focus back to gun legislation, the GOP leader signaled that he was happy to keep talking about the Supreme Court. In a fundraising appeal for McConnell's reelection, his campaign on Wednesday offered bumper stickers with the words, "I Stand with Kavanaugh."
"Make no mistake about it," McConnell said Tuesday, "Justice Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court as long as he chooses to serve."

Texto completo: Headnote Check It Out
When I was a child, two dates had patriotic significance to the American public - July 4 (1776) Independence Day, and Dec. 7 (1941) the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
During my adolescence, when Dec. 7 approached, I began to hear more about Japanese internment camps in the United States than I did about the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, and I also heard America committed crimes against humanity by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But I had a suspicion I wasn't told this for my enlightenment. It was told to diminish Dec. 7which I felt was unnecessary because narratives can co-exist without replacing each other.
Right before the 4th of July 2019, a Time Magazine essay stated, to some people, celebrations of American independence are reminders of the country's hypocrisy on the matter of freedom (therefore) alternative Fourth of July commemoratives across the United States often draw attention to a different side of that story with readings of the famous speech by Frederick Douglass: What to the slave is the 4th of July? But, what's really the priority of the alternative commemoratives, to draw attention to a different story or to diminish Independence Day?
In August the New York Times Magazine published the 1619 project. This project was to observe the 400th anniversary of 20 enslaved Africans that arrived at the British colony of Virginia, and the project's expressed aim was to reframe the country's history, to understand that 1619 was America's true founding, not July 4, 1776. (In the recent Democratic presidential debate this assertion was repeated by candidate Beto O'Rourke.)
In 2019 the alternative narrative of the American founding has gone mainstream.
Last week was the 18th anniversary of 9/11. In the 21st century 9/11 has replaced Dec. 7 in patriotic significance. 9/11 anniversaries always honor the heroic efforts of the first responders and celebrates the country coming together as one people during the aftermath. But I wondered, since 2019 is the year of the alternative narrative, were there gatherings of people listening to a reading that expressed a different 9/11 story? If so, what were they reading? Probably a section from Ta-Nehisi Coates' book, "Between the World and Me." Coates describes his 9/11 story. Coates wrote, "I suppose everyone who was in New York that day has a story. Here's mine. I stood on the roof of an apartment building... taking in the sight - great plumes of smoke covered Manhattan Island. Everyone knew someone who knew someone who was missing. But looking out upon the ruins of America, my heart was cold...The officer who killed Prince Jones (a college classmate of Coates that was killed by the police), like all the officers who regard us so warily, was the sword of the American citizenry...I was out of sync with the city. I kept thinking about how southern Manhattan had always been Ground Zero for us. They auctioned our bodies down there, in that same devastated, and rightly named, financial district... Bin Laden was not the first man to bring terror to that section of the city. I never forgot that. Neither should you. In the days after, I watched the ridiculous pageantry of flags, the machismo of firemen, the overwrought slogans. Damn it all. Prince Jones was dead. And hell upon those who tell us to be twice as good and shoot us no matter...I could see no difference between the officers who killed Prince Jones and the police who died, or the firefighters who died. They were not human to me. Black, White, or whatever, they were the menaces of nature; they were the fire, the comet, the storm, which could - with no justification - shatter my body."
If these alternative 9/11 gatherings exist, they're not mainstream, but the section from Coates' book already is. What does that mean? Nothing - yet.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON -
Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there's too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan's Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced that he's running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That'll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford - an itinerant stranger in his own strange land - going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump's other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford's announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you'd have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don't know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that's about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump's most fervent supporters doesn't?
Further to Sanford's coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing in the New York Times, he's a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld - a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will - Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump's anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford's congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he'd be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford's governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True," about it. While you're browsing, by all means pick up "The Speechwriter," by Barton Swaim, Sanford's speechwriter for the latter part of his administration. It's hilariously funny and a poignant memoir of a tenure of absurdity.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans' last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the Statehouse to make his point about - get it? - pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don't care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv's" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It's not the economy, it's character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford's well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: Rep. Ayanna Pressley said she intends to introduce a resolution to open an impeachment inquiry against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following a since-corrected New York Times article that detailed a new sexual misconduct allegation against him.
"I believe Christine Blasey Ford," the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement to the Hill. "I believe Deborah Ramirez. It is our responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors."
"Sexual predators do not deserve a seat on the nation’s highest court and Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process set a dangerous precedent. We must demand justice for survivors and hold Kavanaugh accountable for his actions," she added.
The resolution would authorize affidavits and subpoenas in connection with the impeachment inquiry. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation.
After the initial publication of the story, the New York Times later issued an editor's note to their article because they "did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
Within a day of the story's release, many of the Democratic presidential candidates have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment. Other members of "the squad" also voiced their support for impeachment.

Democrats reveal just how low they'll go to take down Trump

Texto completo: Democrats can't lay a finger on President Trump, and their efforts to revive the smear campaign against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh show they’re getting ever more desperate.
The New York Times recently published a report detailing an allegation made by one of Kavanaugh’s former classmates at Yale University involving an incident of sexual misconduct during a college dorm party. Specifically, the report claimed that Kavanaugh’s friends “pushed his penis into the hand of a female student” who also attended the event.
Democrats, grasping at straws for another weak reason to attack Trump, wasted little time before calling for Kavanaugh’s immediate impeachment, even though the story was riddled with inconsistencies that made it just as implausible as the unsubstantiated accusations that Democrats leveled at Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.
Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory “Spartacus” Booker of New Jersey both demanded Kavanaugh’s impeachment in response to the article. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren went so far as to tie the issue to Democratic efforts to impeach Trump, arguing that “Kavanaugh should be impeached” just like “the man who appointed him.”
As so often happens, the Democratic outrage turned out to be premature. Just hours after publishing the original story, the New York Times admitted that the alleged victim of the sexual assault did not corroborate the reporting and even told her friends that she doesn’t remember the incident.
In other words, the New York Times presented secondhand gossip as “news,” and some of the highest-profile Democrats in the country treated it as grounds for impeaching a Supreme Court justice.
I almost feel sorry for desperate Democrats, because nothing has gone their way in recent months. The Mueller investigation, which they fully expected to destroy Trump’s presidency, ended up being the biggest waste of time in our country’s history. Trump’s pro-growth policies continue to fuel a strong and growing economy that is improving the lives of people at every income level. And perhaps more importantly, the public is still as deeply opposed to impeachment as the Democrats are determined to pursue that lost cause.
Time and time again, Democrats have failed to take down Trump with their dirty smears, so now they’re turning their attention to other conservative targets, such as Kavanaugh and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
But this strategy is also destined to fail because Trump won’t allow the liberal machine to steamroll innocent conservatives.
Tweet
As despicable as the smears against Kavanaugh are, they also clearly demonstrate that Democrats are scrounging for crumbs. When an uncorroborated New York Times report about a college party that took place more than three decades ago becomes a priority for the 2020 Democrats, it’s obvious that they know just how bad their prospects are in the upcoming presidential election.

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski proves to be an uncooperative witness for House Democrats in hearing

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Democrats resumed Tuesday what they call an impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump and immediately ran into a roadblock as his former campaign manger, Corey Lewandowski, largely refused to answer lawmakers' questions and two other Trump aides refused to appear at all.
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Lewandowski to describe what special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation concluded were attempts to thwart the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Investigators said Trump instructed Lewandowski to pass on an order to limit the scope of the Russia investigation to prevent meddling in elections, but he never delivered it.
The combative campaign operative, who remains friendly with Trump, instantly proved an uncooperative witness for Democrats trying to shine a spotlight on Trump's conduct during the investigation that clouded the first two years of his presidency. Lewandowski quarreled with Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , and refused to answer a succession of questions about his interactions with Trump.
“Mr. Lewandowski, when you refuse to answer these questions, you are obstructing the work of our committee,” Nadler said. “The president is intent on obstructing our legitimate oversight. You are aiding in that obstruction. ”
Lewandowski, who was flanked by White House lawyers during the hearing despite never working for the executive branch, told lawmakers that he would not answer questions about conversations with the president if they strayed beyond the special counsel's report, and sometimes ducked questions about what was in it, too. And while he largely acknowledged that the report's depiction of him was accurate, he declined even to read portions of it aloud.
Instead, throughout more than five hours of questioning, lawmakers traded insults and accusations with him and one another. Lewandowski said Democrats were pursuing their investigation of Trump because "they hate this president more than they love their country. " And in the midst of the hearing, he tweeted a link to a website promoting his potential Senate campaign in New Hampshire.
The committee also summoned two former White House aides, Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter, but they were instructed by the White House not to show up at the hearing.
Lewandowski said in his opening statement that it was “very unfair” that committee Democrats unilaterally changed the rules a week ago to make the hearing part of an impeachment proceeding. “We as a nation would be better served if elected officials like you concentrated your efforts to combat the true crises facing our country as opposed to going down rabbit holes like this hearing,” Lewandowski’s statement said.
Trump tweeted praise for Lewandowski's "beautiful Opening Statement. "
The hearing opened with feisty exchanges. Lewandowski stalled at Nadler's first questions, saying he hadn't brought a copy of the Mueller report to the hearing, to refresh his memory. Republicans accused Nadler of violating House rules by taking more than his allotted five minutes, but the committee voted 19-13 to allow Nadler to continue. The top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, moved to adjourn the hearing but was defeated on a 19-12 vote.
When questioning resumed, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and Lewandowski spoke over each other repeatedly as she asked whether the president turned to him after others such as former White House counsel Don McGahn refused to hinder Mueller's inquiry.
“He calls you in to do his dirty work," Jackson Lee said.
But Lewandowski declined to speak about his conversations with Trump or even say how many times he had spoken with the president in office.
Lewandowski was introduced as a sworn law enforcement officer in New Hampshire. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. , asked whether it concerned him that Trump asked him to do something illegal.
"I didn't think the president asked me to do anything illegal," Lewandowski said.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the committee in a letter Monday that the White House directed Lewandowski not to speak about any communications with Trump beyond what is already in Mueller's report, citing "long-settled principles protecting Executive Branch confidentiality interests. " Cipollone argued that the protections extended to people like Lewandowski, who spoke to the president but did not work for the government.
Nadler sent a letter Tuesday to Cipollone saying such restrictions would “eviscerate this Committee’s oversight powers. ” He called claims of “’absolute immunity’ as entirely without merit. ” Nadler said no court decision entitled the president to confidentiality for communications with private political operatives such as Lewandowski.
“Together, these letters reflect a brazen effort by the Department of Justice and the White House to block all meaningful inquiry by this Committee into the President’s possible violation of federal criminal law and other relevant misconduct,” Nadler said.
Former communications director Hope Hicks earlier refused to answer dozens of questions about her service in the administration and McGahn defied a subpoena for his testimony and documents. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas he contends represent Democratic harassment of his administration.
The hearing is the latest developing as House Democrats investigate Trump and his administration, to decide whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president for possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power or unconstitutionally profiting from his namesake business while in office. The Judiciary Committee voted Sept. 10 to set rules for the investigation, such as allowing staffers to question witnesses.
Neither the committee nor the full House has adopted articles of impeachment accusing the president of wrongdoing, but Democrats say they are investigating to build a case. But Republican lawmakers have criticized the inquiry as “impeachment in drag,” in the phrase of Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, for being all dressed up with nowhere to go. Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, called the effort a "faux impeachment" and a "charade" during a committee meeting to set rules for the inquiry. "I double-dog dare you to do it," Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif. , said of voting on articles of impeachment.
According to Mueller's final report, Trump met one-on-one in the Oval Office in June 2017 with Lewandowski, a trusted adviser outside the government, and dictated a message to deliver to Sessions. Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation because he worked for Trump's campaign. But the president said he wanted his attorney general to declare that the investigation was "very unfair," that Trump had done nothing wrong and that Mueller should "move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections. "
The next month, Trump asked Lewandowski about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the investigation, according to the Mueller report. Lewandowski told the president that the message would be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, Trump criticized Sessions in an interview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that Sessions' job was in jeopardy.
Lewandowski did not want to deliver Trump's message personally, so he asked Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions, according to the Mueller report. Dearborn, former deputy chief of staff for policy, was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through, the report said.
Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga. , said questioning Lewandowski was "like a fish being cleaned with a spoon – it's very hard to get an answer out of you. " But he asked whether Lewandowski was squeamish about delivering the message.
"You chickened out," Johnson said.
“I went on vacation," Lewandowski said to laughter. “I took my kids to the beach. That was my priority. "

Texto completo: What's on TV
BACHELOR IN PARADISE 8 p.m. on ABC. Summer is officially over, which means it's time for "Bachelor in Paradise" to come to an end. In the three-hour finale the remaining four couples will go to the fantasy suites to have serious discussions about their futures. In the end, who will leave paradise in love? Who will be engaged? Who will go home heartbroken? The episode wraps up with the cast coming together to discuss the highs and lows of the season. The host, Chris Harrison, promises "an explosive reunion show" with confrontations that were left unresolved on the beach in Mexico. Also stay tuned until the end when Harrison announces the next Bachelor.
BRING THE FUNNY 10 p.m. on NBC. The final contestants of the comedy show hosted by Amanda Seales ("Insecure") will find out who won the competition. Last week, the judges, Kenan Thompson, Chrissy Teigen and Jeff Foxworthy, gave their feedback to the last five acts. But the final decision was up to America to vote on -- deciding which comedy act deserves to win the $ 250,000 prize and the opportunity to perform at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal.
HAIL, CAESAR! (2016) 10:40 p.m. on HBO. George Clooney plays a hammy mid-20th-century movie star who gets kidnapped in this Coen Brothers film, which sees those sibling filmmakers lovingly poking fun at old-time Hollywood. The ensemble cast also brings together Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum. "It's a typically sly, off-center comedy," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "Some of it is familiar and satisfyingly funny," she added, "even if there are laughs and bits that seem as if they were written to amuse only the Coens and the Turner Classic Movies crowd."
What's Streaming
THE LAST KIDS ON EARTH Stream on Netflix. Jack Sullivan (Nick Wolfhard) and his friends loved playing video games, eating candy and hanging out in their treehouse. But when they suddenly find themselves in a post-apocalyptic world, the crew is thrown into a real-life video game where they have to stick together to defeat monsters and zombies. The show, based off a book series by Max Brallier, features Mark Hamill, Rosario Dawson and Keith David.
TALL GIRL Stream on Netflix. Like most teenage girls, Jodi (Ava Michelle) is not comfortable in her own skin. The only difference for Jodi is that at 6-foot-1, she towers over every person in her high school. But when a male Swedish exchange student, who happens to be taller than her, transfers to her school, she is overcome with shyness and insecurity. With the help of her best friend (Anjelika Washington), sister (Sabrina Carpenter) and mother (Angela Kinsey), Jodi works to overcome her fears and finds herself in a love triangle. In her review for The Times, Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote: "Instead of a John Hughes-style satire of class and social divides -- not that acute here, to begin with -- we get an uncritical depiction of homogeneous entitlement."

Mr. Trump, at a rally in New Mexico, a border state with the highest Hispanic population in the country, said that he has great support among Latino Americans because of his hard line on stopping migrants and drugs from crossing illegally into the United States.
"The Hispanic Americans, they understand," he said as supporters waved preprinted "Latinos for Trump" signs at Santa Ana Star Center in Rio Rancho, near Albuquerque. "They don't want criminals coming across the border. They don't want people taking their jobs. They want to have that security. And they want the wall. They want the wall."
Mr. Trump flavored his typical campaign speech with repeated references to Hispanics, boasting that unemployment among Hispanics was at a record low, calling attention to the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month and asserting that Hispanics love him. He asked how many in the arena were Hispanic, and a sizable share of the audience cheered in response.
He singled out a longtime supporter, Steve Cortes, a CNN commentator, who was present. "He happens to be Hispanic, but I've never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do," Mr. Trump said.
Shouting across the arena to Mr. Cortes, the president said: "Nobody loves the Hispanics more. Who do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?"
Mr. Cortes cupped his hands and shouted a reply that was hard to hear.
"He says the country," Mr. Trump interpreted for him. "I don't know, I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest with you. We got a lot of Hispanics. We love our Hispanics. Get out and vote."
He even boasted of support from Hispanics in Florida. "The Venezuelans and the Cubans, they're all for Trump," he said.
The notion of choosing loyalty between Hispanics and the country drew immediate condemnation from Democrats. "Tonight Trump said, 'Who do you love more, the country or the Hispanics?"' Representative Ben Ray Luján, who is running for Senate in New Mexico, wrote on Twitter during the rally. "I don't even know where to begin with that question. Hispanics are proud Americans. We are part of this country, just like you @realdonaldtrump. Do better."
Mr. Trump has the support of about one-quarter of Hispanic voters, according to polls. His approval rating among Hispanics in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll stands at 25 percent, significantly below that among the American population as a whole. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner, leads Mr. Trump among Hispanics by 71 percent to 26 percent, according to combined Post-ABC polls.
New Mexico, whose population is about 49 percent Hispanic, according to the census, would be a tough state for the president to flip. Mr. Trump lost it in 2016 by eight percentage points, and in 2018, Republicans lost the governor's mansion and a House seat, making the state's entire congressional delegation Democratic.
In his speech, Mr. Trump sounded many of the themes that usually animate his rallies, promoting his record on the economy, border security and military spending while lashing out at Democrats, the news media and "the elite."
He focused on the latest accusation of youthful sexual misconduct against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, detailed in The New York Times in an excerpt from a new book on his confirmation. The excerpt reported that a Yale University classmate recalled seeing the future justice with his pants down at a drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student.
The woman declined to be interviewed, and friends said she did not recall the episode, a fact not originally mentioned in the excerpt and later added to it. Several Democratic presidential candidates have called for Justice Kavanaugh to be impeached.
"Look at what they are doing today to Justice Kavanaugh," Mr. Trump said. "Look at what they are doing. The woman said, I don't remember that. And they still want him to be impeached."
He assailed The Times. "I called for the resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in this," he said. "They have taken the old Gray Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation."
Mr. Trump's visit to New Mexico was his first since becoming president, and he vowed to make it competitive next year. "We are here because we really think we're going to turn a state and make it a Republican state," he said.
In his build-the-wall fervor, Mr. Trump has repeatedly used racially inflammatory language. He opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by denouncing Mexican "rapists" coming across the border (although, he said, some immigrants "I assume are good people") and later claimed an American-born judge could not fairly handle a lawsuit against him because he was "Mexican." The president has also denounced caravans of migrants heading for the border as "invaders" and gang members as "animals."
But Mr. Trump and his allies maintain that his tough words apply only to criminals or bad actors, not to Hispanics as a whole. Hispanics whose families came to the United States legally, they argue, do not approve of others breaking the law to enter the country. And they add that many Hispanics share Mr. Trump's views on regulation, taxes and social issues.
In his speech on Monday night, Mr. Trump rejected the accusation that his policies and language played to racial stereotypes and promoted animosity. "I'm the least racist person in this room," he said.
"We are working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunities for our nation's Hispanic-American citizens," he said, "including millions and millions of extraordinary Mexican-Americans who enrich our society, and strengthen our country, serve in our military, and contribute immensely to other shared American family."
New Mexico Democrats, who held a unity and diversity rally to counter Mr. Trump, argued that the president was actually harming the people he said he was helping, noting that he had diverted money from military construction projects to finance his border wall without permission from Congress, including an unmanned aerial training facility at Holloman Air Force Base.
"President Trump says he's building his wall, but it's New Mexico's service members who are paying the price," the state's Democratic Party tweeted. "We don't need an expensive and ineffective vanity project, we need commonsense reforms to address the humanitarian crisis at our border."
From here, Mr. Trump will travel to California for fund-raising events on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Texto completo: New York state prosecutors have subpoenaed President Trump’s accounting firm for eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns.
The Manhattan district attorney's office delivered the subpoena last month to the accounting firm Mazars USA after the district attorney opened a criminal investigation into a hush-money payment Trump made to porn star Stormy Daniels, according to the New York Times.
The subpoena demands the firm turn over federal and state tax returns dating back to 2011. The Manhattan district attorney's office is focused mainly on the $130,000 payment between Trump and Daniels, facilitated by Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen.
Cohen was sentenced last year to three years in federal prison for breaking federal campaign finance laws.
Trump's own legal team has fought off and delayed attempts by Democrats to access his tax returns. He sued to block a New York law, passed this year, that would have empowered state lawmakers to seize his tax returns.
Trump delay tactics have proven effective at likely putting off the public release of his tax returns until after the 2020 election.

Leana Wen exposes Planned Parenthood's hypocrisy

Texto completo: Just months after being pushed out as Planned Parenthood's president, Leana Wen is accusing the abortion giant of hypocrisy and attempted intimidation.

Wen was fired in July after leading Planned Parenthood for less than a year. In a 1,400-word bombshell letter to Planned Parenthood’s board of directors, Wen accused the executives of holding her severance and health insurance “ransom” in exchange for a confidentiality agreement.

“No amount of money can ever buy my integrity and my commitment to the patients I serve,” Dr. Wen wrote in the letter, obtained by the New York Times.
Planned Parenthood has claimed that Wen’s exit was the result of disagreements over her management style, but Wen has long held that a “vocal minority,” many of whom sit on the board of directors, “prefer a stridently political, abortion-first philosophy,” and didn’t like Wen’s decision to place the emphasis instead on women's healthcare.
Putting abortion on the back burner “is the best way to protect it,” Wen said. The board disagreed and fired her, and the result has been a long, contentious negotiation that exposes Planned Parenthood for what it is: a manipulative organization whose main business is abortion and abortion advocacy, which only pretends to be a champion for women’s health.

“It is deeply hypocritical [that Planned Parenthood] would attempt to enforce a gag order on its immediate past President/CEO while fighting the Trump administration’s gag rule on Title X providers,” Wen wrote. She was referring to Planned Parenthood’s recent exit from the Title X family planning program, which awards federal family planning funding only to organizations that do not perform or refer abortions.
Wen is right. If the goal is actually health-related, then pushing an aggressive and radical pro-choice agenda down Americans’ throats is not a winning strategy. Already, more than 61% of Americans support restrictions on abortions, with even larger majorities wanting to ban third-trimester abortions. And 48% of voters support legislation to withhold taxpayer funds from Planned Parenthood as long as it continues to provide abortions.
The culture is changing, and so is the political infrastructure. The Trump administration has already removed one of Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer-funded crutches by giving the organization an ultimatum: stop servicing abortions or exit Title X. Planned Parenthood chose to exit the program, demonstrating where its real goals lie.
Planned Parenthood has claimed the government’s ultimatum was a deliberate attack on women’s rights. But Planned Parenthood doesn’t care about women’s rights, and it certainly doesn’t care about women. After all, this is the same organization withholding healthcare and salary benefits from its former female president, who suffered a miscarriage right before her exit, and is now expecting a child.

Wen knew that Planned Parenthood was in trouble. She attempted to rehabilitate its image and make healthcare its priority. But healthcare has never been Planned Parenthood’s priority. It’s just a tool Planned Parenthood uses to get what it wants, whether that’s federal funding or Wen’s silence. But the Trump administration isn’t going to give in, and neither will Wen.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – One of Sen. Susan Collins' prominent challengers is slamming the Maine Republican for her vote in 2018 to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following a new sexual misconduct allegation against him that surfaced over the weekend.
And in a statement provided to USA TODAY Monday evening, a spokesperson for Collins hit back against the recent reporting by the New York Times that has led to the blowback against Collins, saying "The news stories today are not adding anything to what has already been reported" and adding that "The only new part of the story was an alleged incident . . . but this is an accusation that lacks an accuser. "
Sara Gideon, speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, took to Twitter Sunday to criticize Collins' decision last year and to fundraise following the new revelation. Collins, a Republican, is up for re-election in 2020.
"I’m tired of hoping that Susan Collins does the right thing when she has shown time and time again that she puts Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers," Gideon wrote in a tweet.
The New York Times published an essay Saturday evening with new information about a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh that also included evidence supporting a previously unreported claim.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations against him. President Donald Trump and a number of Republicans have come to Kavanaugh's defense since the recent publication of the essay by the Times.
The essay is an adaptation from a forthcoming book about Kavanaugh written by two Times reporters. Collins spokesperson Annie Clark raised doubts about the book in a statement provided to USA TODAY Monday.
"The news stories today are not adding anything to what has already been reported. In fact, the NYT's own review of the book says that, 'In the end they [the authors] turn up no smoking gun, no secret confession, no friend who comes forth to say Kavanaugh was lying all this time,'" Clark said.
Clark continued: "The only new part of the story was an alleged incident reported by former Clinton aide Max Stier -- but this is an accusation that lacks an accuser. In fact, the New York Times corrected its own story to note that not only did the student in question not recall any such incident, she also declined to be interviewed for the book. "
And the president has aggressively come to Kavanaugh's defense, also suggesting doubts about the Times' reporting. "Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue," Trump wrote in a tweet Sunday. "The lies being told about him are unbelievable. "
And Trump tweeted again Monday. "The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh," Trump posted. "Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems. "
More: Trump says Kavanaugh is the one 'actually being assaulted' after new allegation of sexual assault
Since the essay's publication, some Democrats have called for Kavanaugh to be impeached.
More: Democrats are calling for Brett Kavanaugh to be impeached. How would that work?
Gideon, a Democrat, has repeatedly criticized Collins for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Gideon is a part of a handful of challengers who announced they were going to run against Collins due to her decision to vote for Kavanaugh.
Ahead of Kavanaugh's confirmation vote last year, Collins gave a nearly 45-minute speech on the Senate floor detailing why she decided to support his nomination to the Supreme Court. Prior to that, it was unclear whether Collins would support Kavanaugh's confirmation.
More: Democratic presidential candidates want Kavanaugh impeached after newly surfaced sexual misconduct accusation
Several weeks ago, Collins said that she was that 'sad' that her vote for Kavanaugh may have cost her voters in next year's election.
“Have I lost some votes because of my decision to support Justice Kavanaugh? Yes, I have,” she said in an interview with Politico. “And I’m sad about that because I explained in great depth my decision-making. ”

Through the looking glass of Mark Sanford

Texto completo: Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there's too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan's Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he's running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That'll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford -- an itinerant stranger in his own strange land -- going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump's other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford's announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you'd have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don't know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that's about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump's most fervent supporters doesn't?
Further to Sanford's coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he's a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld -- a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will -- Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump's anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford's congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he'd be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford's governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it. While you're browsing, by all means pick up "The Speechwriter," by Barton Swaim, Sanford's speechwriter for the latter part of his administration. It's hilariously funny and a poignant memoir of a tenure of absurdity.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans' last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about -- get it? -- pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don't care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv's" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It's not the economy, it's character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford's well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidates on Sunday demanded that Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh be investigated or impeached in response to a new allegation that he exposed himself to a female classmate at a drunken dorm party years ago at Yale University.
The allegation surfaced Saturday night in a New York Times report. A classmate, Max Stier, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at the party, where friends pushed Kavanaugh's penis into the young woman's hand, the Times reported. Stier notified senators and the FBI before Kavanaugh's confirmation, but the FBI did not investigate, the Times reported.
The Washington Post last year confirmed that two intermediaries had relayed such a claim to lawmakers and the FBI. The Post did not publish a story in part because the intermediaries declined to identify the alleged witness and because the woman who was said to be involved declined to comment. The Times article, drawing from reporting for a forthcoming book, is based on interviews with "two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier."
Stier, the chief executive of a nonpartisan group in Washington, declined to comment Sunday. A court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment. The woman did not return a call seeking comment.
The political fallout from the new allegation suggested the divisions surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination last year will continue to be felt in the 2020 campaign. Republicans denounced the Times report as an effort by the media to smear Kavanaugh. Some seized on the fact that the story - labeled as a news analysis - did not mention that, according to the book, the woman involved in the alleged incident has told friends she does not recall it.
On Sunday morning, President Trump tweeted that Kavanaugh should "start suing people, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue."
"The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!" Trump tweeted.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wrote that the "far left's willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year's confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate."
Impeachment calls came from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.) and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro, all presidential candidates.
"He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice," Harris said in a tweet. "He must be impeached."
Warren tweeted: "Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Former vice president Joe Biden released a statement calling for further investigation. "We need to get to the bottom of whether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the FBI to ignore evidence or prevented them from following up on leads," it said.
Kavanaugh's bitter confirmation hearing captivated and divided the nation last fall. The hearings were dominated by Christine Blasey Ford's account, first reported by The Post, that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were high school students in the 1980s. Kavanaugh strenuously denied Ford's claim, calling it an "orchestrated political hit."
The new claim echoes an allegation made by a different female Yale student, Deborah Ramirez, during Kavanaugh's confirmation process. Kavanaugh has denied that allegation.
Shortly before the scheduled vote on his nomination, the Trump administration asked the FBI to investigate those allegations, though the inquiry was restricted in scope. The FBI interviewed fewer than a dozen people - most of them from Kavanaugh's high school days. They interviewed Ramirez.
As the FBI was wrapping up its investigation, the intermediaries working on behalf of Stier delivered his account to agency officials. The intermediaries told The Post last year they had relayed that a classmate of Kavanaugh had witnessed the incident while taking a study break at Yale's Lawrance Hall. They declined to give The Post the classmate's name.
No one from the FBI called the classmate to follow up on the account, they said.
The Post could not independently corroborate the allegation. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the witness had not authorized them to use their names.
The Times on Saturday identified the witness as Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. The Times story was based on research for a book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation," by two of its reporters. According to the book, at least two senators on the Judiciary Committee learned of Stier's allegations.
Last fall, the intermediaries told The Post they shared the account with a veteran FBI agent, who assured them it would be passed on to officials directly responsible for Kavanaugh's background check. They said the witness also shared his account with a Senate Judiciary Committee member who offered assurance that it would be passed on directly to officials responsible for the background check.
Mike Davis, who was chief counsel for Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) during the Kavanaugh nomination process, said that to the best of his knowledge, Grassley's office has no record of Stier reaching out with his allegation.
"Even if we did receive an allegation from Mr. Stier as described by the New York Times reporting, it is difficult to see how this unsubstantiated hearsay, 'corroborated' by anonymous sources, involving an alleged victim who other unnamed sources said does not even remember the event, would have changed the outcome of the confirmation vote," said Davis, who now leads the Article III Project, an advocacy group that promotes Trump's judicial picks.
Even before Stier's account was made public, the background check had drawn criticism from some quarters for its highly curtailed scope. Agents did not interview Ford, a professor in California who alleged Kavanaugh assaulted her decades ago in Maryland.
The account attributed to Stier bears similarities to the claims made by Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis in her face at a drunken party, causing her to touch it without her consent. Ramirez's representatives provided agents with the names of over 20 people they said may have information relevant to her claims. During the background check, Ramirez's team had no indication that the bureau had interviewed any of them.
Ramirez's account was first published by the New Yorker last year. The magazine said that Ramirez in their initial conversations was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh's role in the incident, but that she grew more confident after assessing her memories and consulting with an attorney.
In their Saturday article, the Times reporters said they spoke with at least seven people who supported Ramirez's account, including two classmates who heard about the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred. Ramirez's mother told the reporters she had heard about the Yale incident long before Kavanaugh was a federal judge. The other people whose accounts supported Ramirez were not identified in the Times story.
An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Sunday on the Kavanaugh background investigation.
At a Senate hearing later that year, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended his agency's handling of the issue. "As is standard, the investigation was very specific in scope, limited in scope, and that is the usual process," he said, adding that "my folks have assured me that the usual process was followed."

Drawing distinctions among dueling Democrats

Texto completo: At heart, Democrats are of one mind on health care policy
The front-page Sept. 13 headline “Together on stage, sharply divided," referencing the Democratic debate on health care, is fundamentally misleading.
All the Democrats on stage Thursday night support universal health care, but differ on tactics. The arguments were even more narrow, as to whether programs should be opt in or opt out.
The sharp divide is with Republicans, who for years have sought to repeal Obamacare without a replacement, something that would cause many Americans to lose health care coverage.
Intraparty debates are designed to draw contrasts, but after-the-fact analysis requires context. The news here is that Democrats are largely united in advancing a goal important to Americans. You'd be hard pressed to understand that reality from the Globe's front page.

One voting bloc she wants to hear from
With the exception, perhaps, of Andrew Yang, I think any of the Democratic candidates in Thursday night's debate would make an excellent president.
Here's what I wish the Globe would do: find a good sample of Republicans who want not to vote for Donald Trump, and ask them which of the Democratic candidates they could get behind. That's the person I would vote for.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump ha salido este domingo en defensa de Brett Kavanaugh, el juez la Corte Suprema señalado por conducta sexual indebida . Trump ha animado a Kavanaugh a demandar por injurias y asegura que, en caso contrario, el Departamento de Justicia puede salir en defensa del juez.
Tras una investigación de The New York Times que vio la luz este sábado, varios precandidatos demócratas han pedido un juicio político para Kavanaugh . El reportaje de The Times es el borrador de un libro que publicarán en breve periodistas del diario neoyorquino y que asegura confirmar los argumentos de Deborah Ramirez , compañera de universidad del actual juez.
Ramirez afirma que Kavanaugh le mostró el pene durante una fiesta con alcohol cuando ambos eran estudiantes . Al menos siete personas, entre ellas la madre de Ramirez, aseguraron a los periodistas que habían oído hablar de dicha conducta indebida de Kavanaugh antes de que este se convirtiera en juez. El juez negó las acusaciones durante su audiencia de confirmación en el Senado el pasado otoño.
La nota de The Times también revela una cuenta que se hace eco de la historia de Ramirez. El también antiguo compañero del juez en la Universidad de Yale describe cómo Kavanaugh empujaba durante una fiesta sus partes privadas hacia las manos de una compañera . Según el diario, el hombre informó sobre el incidente a senadores y al FBI pero la agencia no investigó.
Algunos d emócratas que se enfrentan a Donald Trump en las elecciones de 2020 dieron su opinión sobre la investigación.
“Las revelaciones de hoy confirman lo que ya sabíamos: durante su audiencia, Kavanaugh enfrentó acusaciones creíbles y probablemente mintió al Congreso”, dijo el senador Bernie Sanders .
The revelations today confirm what we already knew: During his hearing, Kavanaugh faced credible accusations and likely lied to Congress. I support any appropriate constitutional mechanism to hold him accountable.
— Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 15, 2019
“Brett Kavanaugh mintió al Senado de Estados Unidos y, lo que es más importante, al pueblo estadounidense. Debe someterse a un juicio político”, sentenció Kamala Harris , miembro del Comité Judicial.
I sat through those hearings. Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people. He was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice.
He must be impeached.
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) September 15, 2019
“Confirmación no es exoneración. Y estas nuevas revelaciones son inquietantes. Igual que el hombre que lo nombró, Kavanaugh debería enfrentar un juicio político”, dijo la senadora Elizabeth Warren también en Twitter”.
Last year the Kavanaugh nomination was rammed through the Senate without a thorough examination of the allegations against him. Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 15, 2019
Otros candidatos demócratas como Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar o Julián Castro también se pronunciaron al respecto. A todos ellos, el presidente Trump les contestó llamándoles “demócratas de izquierda radical” y culpándoles (junto a los “medios ineptos”) de perseguir a Kavanaugh. “¡Solo quieren asustarlo para que se vuelva liberal!”, sentenció.
Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can’t let that happen!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2019

1. "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The feminist dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985) gets a sequel at long last. Atwood says of the book, "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "'The Testaments' is worthy of the literary classic it continues."
2. "The Institute" by Stephen King (Scribner, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: Twelve-year-old genius Luke Ellis is whisked away in the middle of the night and taken to the Institute, where psychic kids are being held captive to save the world.
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "King leans into the theme of 'great events' happening with the smallest of decisions as well as the world-changing power of togetherness. And in that case, it's a frequent lesson he extols that never gets old."
3. "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" by James Poniewozik (Liveright, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The New York Times TV critic examines the history of television and American media to explain how Trump mastered the medium to win his base and become our 45th president.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base."
4. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power (Dey Street, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American diplomat and human rights advocate traces her journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official in a revealing memoir.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "Power's vibrant prose, exuberant storytelling, and deep insights into human nature make for a page-turning memoir."
5. "After the Flood" by Kassandra Montag (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: In this dystopian adventure novel set in a water-logged world altered by climate change, a mother embarks on a perilous voyage to rescue her kidnapped daughter.
The buzz: "Anchored by a complicated, compelling heroine, this gripping, speculative, high-seas adventure is impossible to put down," says Booklist.

Texto completo: The New York Times deleted a tweet claiming that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "thrust" his penis in the face of a fellow Yale student and insinuating that such an incident could be considered "harmless fun."
"Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun," the original tweet read. "But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn't belong at Yale in the first place."
The Times then deleted the tweet after it received intense backlash on social media, saying it was "poorly phrased." However, their explanation tweet appears to have also been deleted.
NYT deletes Kavanaugh tweet
In the original tweet, the Times linked to their Saturday exposé, which centered around Kavanaugh accuser Ramirez, who accused the Supreme Court justice of thrusting his penis into her face at a dormitory party during their time together as students at Yale University.
In the report, a new allegation also emerged from a male classmate, who recalled an incident involving Kavanaugh that echoes Ramirez's story. Max Stier told the outlet he "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
The latest accusation follows several other sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court justice, including that of Christine Blasey Ford, who testified during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings that he had attempted to force himself on her at a high school party in the 1980s.

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?

Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.
Late summer gazpacho aka best gazpacho Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.

Texto completo: The third face-off of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders pulled in 14 million viewers on ABC and Univision on Thursday, making it the fourth most watched Democratic primary debate ever.
Moderated by ABC News anchors George Stephanopoulos and David Muir, ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, the three-hour debate had an average audience of 12.9 million viewers on ABC and 1.1 milllion on Univision, according to Nielsen data.
The collective number puts it behind the 18.1 million viewer record set by the second round of the first 2020 primary debate on NBC, Telemundo and MSNBC on June 27, the 15.5 million who watched the first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential cycle on CNN in Oct. 2015, and the 15.3 million for round one of NBC's simulcast on June 26.

The event held at Texas Southern University in Houston was highly anticipated as it was the first time front-runner former Vice President Joe Biden and his closest rivals in the polls, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, shared a debate stage.
Only 10 of the 20-plus candidates for the Democratic nomination qualified for the debate stage based on polling and fundraising criteria. They included Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro.
The major fireworks of Thursday matchup were generated by Castro, who used a lack of clarity in one of Biden's answers about his healthcare plan to suggest the former vice president did not have the mental acuity to be president.
The previous two primary debates of the 2020 campaign cycle were extended over two nights to accommodate more candidates. The unwieldy format could also be used in the next Democratic primary debate in Ohio on Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16, which will air on CNN. The New York Times is co-hosting the event.
The lack of appeal of the two-night setup -- which leads to major contenders appearing on different nights -- is reflected in the fact that NBC and CBS were not interested in producing the event, according to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to comment. The networks have expressed a preference for carrying debates with fewer candidates.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul this week said he would reject a settlement with opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma under its reported current terms.
In April, Raoul’s office filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of the opioid OxyContin and defendant in thousands of other lawsuits from local municipalities and states affected by the opioid epidemic.
Raoul’s suit alleged the company "dispatched sales representatives to Illinois hundreds of thousands of times" between 2008 and 2017 and "funded third-party publications under the guise of educational materials to promote opioids and downplay their risks."
Raoul alleged these tactics more than tripled prescriptions of Purdue’s opioids in Illinois. In a news release, he pointed to Illinois Department of Public Health statistics that showed more than 2,000 fatal overdoses in Illinois in 2017 involved opioids. The state health department also reported instances of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which can be caused by opioid exposure, increased by 64 percent from 2011 to 2017.
In August, Raoul expanded the suit to include members of the Sackler family, which founded and operates Purdue Pharma.
"The Sackler family knowingly misled the public and continued pushing Purdue’s addictive opioids without care or consideration of the death and destruction their product caused," Raoul said in a statement Wednesday.
Raoul’s statement was in response to media reports that detailed a tentative settlement between Purdue and thousands of municipal governments and more than 20 states.
The New York Times reported the deal, for which final details are still being negotiated, would compel Purdue to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and dissolve. A new company would be formed that could continue selling OxyContin and other medicines, but its profits would be used to pay the plaintiffs in the suit, which was reported to be worth $12 billion.
Purdue would also be required to donate drugs for addiction and overdose treatment, and the Sackler family would donate $3 billion in cash over seven years but would not be forced to admit any wrongdoing.
Raoul, however, was among at least 20 attorneys general who told NBC News they had not agreed to the deal.
"My office is prepared to hold the Sacklers accountable, regardless of whether or not Purdue declares bankruptcy, and I am pleased that a majority of states will continue to fight," he said in a statement.
According to the news release, Raoul’s expanded suit asks the court to "prohibit Purdue and the Sacklers’ deceptive conduct" to ensure "it does not happen again in the future," and to assess penalties against the defendants. Raoul is also asking the court to require the defendants to pay to help remediate the opioid problem and forfeit profits resulting from the alleged misconduct.
"I reject in the strongest terms, any agreement that does not adequately hold the Sackler family accountable for the irreparable harm their actions caused to families in Illinois and across the country," Raoul said in the statement.
"My office expanded our lawsuit against Purdue Pharma to include the Sacklers because as the family behind Purdue, their ruthless pursuit of profits destroyed other families and communities throughout Illinois and the nation."
Raoul filed a similar lawsuit Tuesday against 16 other opioid manufacturers, alleging they "carried out unfair and deceptive marketing campaigns that prioritized profits over public health."

Raina Telgemeier knows growing up takes intestinal fortitude

Texto completo: In the late 1980s, young Raina Telgemeier tried to deliver a report in front of her grade-school class in San Francisco. Before she could finish, she bolted for the restroom, gripped by the symptoms of her intense anxiety.
On Labor Day weekend last month, Telgemeier, now a celebrated 42-year-old graphic novelist, strode onto the main stage at the National Book Festival in Washington before a thrumming crowd of about 4,000 fans. Radiating confidence, she smiled broadly as she shared her story of nerves and nausea. It is a message of empathy and reassurance that encourages young listeners to talk about what scares them.
"I'm proud to tell you at this moment," Telgemeier said, "I don't have a stomachache."
There was laughter among her ponytailed legions. Over the past decade, the accidental memoirist has grown into a YA rock star by becoming an open book. Telgemeier's largely autobiographical stories are so accessible and emotionally resonant that there are 13.5 million copies of them in print, as she's tapped into a largely overlooked comics-loving female readership.
Now, because her fans kept asking, she is getting more personal than ever. The Eisner Award-winning author who launched her publishing empire with 2010's "Smile," about her years-long dental adventures as a kid, is prepared to bare new parts of her interior world with "Guts," available Tuesday, which centers on how fear affected her body.
"This is the reality of my life," Telgemeier told her fans. She quickly got to the heart and GI tract of the matter: "I was subject to panic attacks and [was] worrying that something was really wrong with me."
A young girl in a bright fuchsia shirt soon asked which of Telgemeier's books was the author's favorite - from a shelf that includes not only "Smile" but also such other New York Times bestsellers as "Sisters," "Drama" and "Ghosts." The author nodded to a few titles before replying: "I like 'Guts' because it's so personal and because people are really getting to know me, the person, when they read 'Guts.' "
On one level, she said in an interview the previous day, the book is about how her anxiety manifested itself. Beginning in fourth grade, she developed a fear of vomit (termed "emetophobia") and of how her "guts" acted up, which in turn triggered fear about her food choices. On another level, the title refers to mustering the courage to receive treatment and share one's honest vulnerabilities with people who care about you. (Seven percent of Americans age 3 to 17 - more than 4 million young people - have been diagnosed with anxiety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)
Unlike previous Telgemeier books that were dedicated to people close to her, "Guts" is dedicated to "anyone who feels afraid." That signals the approachable tone of the memoir, which tries to help destigmatize mental illness and therapy and provide paths to discussion among young readers.
Telgemeier notes in the "Guts" afterword that she has employed various therapies and meditation apps and has taken anxiety medication, writing: "They've all helped, but I've realized that my phobias and worries are just part of who I am. I do my best to manage them!"
It is that kind of comforting honesty that especially appeals to millions of students.
"Kids today are reading more comic books and graphic novels than ever, and Raina is a big reason why," said Gene Luen Yang, the acclaimed graphic novelist ("American Born Chinese") and past Library of Congress ambassador for young people's literature. "She's a true comics superstar who essentially created a brand-new category of comics in the American market: middle-grade graphic memoir.
"I still remember hearing discussions in the '90s about whether or not girls would read comics - ridiculous, of course, but Raina's work has proven just how ridiculous," continued Yang, a longtime schoolteacher. "Not to say that only girls read Raina's work."
During a photo op at the recent festival, Telgemeier's fans lined up by the hundreds while clutching her pastel-color-covered books, hungry to know more about how she once coped with irritating siblings and bullying classmates and a changing mind and body. She draws her life stories, and they feel seen.
One young festivalgoer asked Telgemeier how she finds inspiration for her stories. The author replied that she sometimes asks herself: "What was the weirdest thing that I experienced in middle school?"
It took Telgemeier many years before she was ready to share from her own experience. Between ages 11 and 25, she kept a diary created in comics format. She was inspired by such strips as "For Better or for Worse" and "Calvin and Hobbes," as well as the book series "The Baby-Sitters Club."
In 2002, shortly before graduation from the School of Visual Arts in New York, she created a short comic about the power of reading the Hiroshima graphic novel "Barefoot Gen" - a gift from her father when she was 9. It caught the attention of the publisher Scholastic, which soon hired her to illustrate "The Baby-Sitters Club." It wasn't long before Telgemeier pitched her own story to Scholastic editors.
Telgemeier said some people had doubted whether a memoir about her braces could be popular. But her breakthrough "Smile" is not just about her nearly five-year saga of facial reconstruction after accidentally smashing her front teeth in 1989 but also about the fragile nature of friendship and stirring insecurities in middle school. Students read; critics raved.
Even after the success of "Smile," though, it was a long personal journey to "Guts," her third memoir. "I don't think I was ready to come out of the gate and just start writing about poop," she said with a laugh. Besides, there was some personal work to be done.
Five years ago, she began cognitive behavioral therapy because anxiety "was starting to impede my life," she said. But, "When I went to tackle the thing in my life, I started to see the story in it and started to tell the story - because when you go into a therapist's office, they want to know why you're there, and where you are. They want to see how it all connects."
Telgemeier was already 80 pages into a different story at the time. But then she developed writer's block. While she was stuck, a friend asked about the author's passing anecdote about anxiety - that "stomach story." Telgemeier had never written it down, but the friend's question immediately sparked inspiration.
"I said: 'You know what? I've got to go!' " she recounted. "I just sat down, and 11 hours later I had the first couple of chapters sketched out. So it was all in there."
The Bay Area-based author set out to write the kind of book about phobias and anxieties that she wishes had been available to her as a kid. "Reading is where you find your common ground with others," Telgemeier said. As a child, "Sometimes you might not know another kid who's in therapy or tackling a really heavy thing in their life, but you might read a book about it and find yourself."
This year, Telgemeier published the creative guidebook "Share Your Smile" to prompt her fans to write and draw their own tales. Now, as she goes on tour in support of "Guts" - which has already charted as an Amazon top-10 bestseller - she continues to encourage her readers to express their feelings: "You can't connect unless you open up."
Telgemeier hears from adults whose children identify with young Raina on the page and see Telgemeier now as a peer to their parents. Such connections spark healthy family conversations. "I think," she said, "we could all stand to be emotionally healthier."
The author believes in addressing many aspects of grade school head-on, including LGBT representation. Her book "Drama," inspired by her high school theater club experience, features a gay character whose sibling is coming to terms with his sexual identity. The graphic novel won a Stonewall Book Award while also being banned multiple times in Texas.
So will Telgemeier end her memoir series as a trilogy? "I feel like three is a really good number," she said at the festival.
She then noted playfully: "But I have one or two more stories from my childhood that I might want to tell. So maybe I will."

Texto completo: After a week of interviews in Beijing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, I’ve come away with some strong feelings about the United States-China trade dispute. There are two battlefronts: One is the negotiation to eliminate the barriers to American companies competing in China, and the other is what to do about Huawei, China’s enormous telecom networking company that Beijing sees as a crown jewel of national innovation and the Trump team sees as a giant global espionage device.
Get to know that name — Huawei . The issues it represents are as important as all the rest of the trade talks combined.
On the pure trade battlefront, I left China feeling that there’s a decent chance a limited deal — rolling back some U.S. tariffs in exchange for a resumption of certain Chinese purchases, particularly of agricultural products, from the United States — can be reached in the near term. Both sides could use such a deal.
I also left feeling, though, that President Xi Jinping is less likely to sign on to the kind of grand bargain, and broad concessions, that Trump is demanding. That’s in part because Xi would get too much pushback from his state-owned industries and Communist Party hard-liners. But it’s also because months of impulsive Trump threats, tariffs, praises and then more threats have clearly led a lot of Chinese officials to conclude that Trump is an unstable character who always has to be seen to “win” and humiliate the other side, and therefore can’t be counted on for a big win-win deal — or even stick to it if one were agreed on. Better to let the talks drag on.
Looming over all of this, though, is how to deal with Huawei — the world’s largest manufacturer of 5G networking equipment and the second-largest smartphone-maker in the world, after Samsung and ahead of Apple.
Depending on whom you believe, Huawei is either a scrappy telecom that fought its way to the top since its founding in 1987 with over $100 billion in sales today, a cowboy capitalist that made its way up by stealing the technology of others, or a giant worldwide listening device for Chinese intelligence that needs to be blocked from ever installing equipment in the United States and uprooted from our allies.
Imagine China telling Apple that it can never make or sell another phone in China or in any of China’s Asian trading partners, which is the rough equivalent of what Trump has told Huawei in America. I don’t know if it is justified or not — I would need access to U.S. intelligence — but I do know it’s worth an effort to defuse the Huawei crisis. Otherwise we’re heading for a two-technology world, with a Chinese zone and an American zone, and a digital Berlin Wall running right down the middle.
That is why I was happy to accept the invitation of Huawei’s founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei, to come to his company’s headquarters in Shenzhen for a rare interview, which he used to — for the first time — propose negotiations with the Justice Department to try to resolve all the outstanding issues between Washington and Huawei.
Ren told me: “If the U.S. reaches out to us in good faith and promises to change their irrational approach to Huawei, then we are open to a dialogue. The U.S. shouldn’t try to destroy Huawei over something trivial. If the U.S. feels we have done something wrong, then we can discuss it in good faith and find a reasonable solution. I think we can accept that approach."
He added for emphasis, “There are no restrictions on what we would be willing to discuss with the Department of Justice.”
And if the United States — which has no indigenous 5G networking manufacturer — still does not trust Huawei to install its equipment across America at scale, added Ren, then he is also ready, for the first time, to license the entire Huawei 5G platform to any American company that wants to manufacturer it and install it and operate it, completely independent of Huawei. (The only other 5G major suppliers are Nokia and Ericsson, European companies whose products are far more expensive than Huawei’s.)
Huawei, Ren said, is “open to sharing our 5G technologies and techniques with U.S. companies, so that they can build up their own 5G industry. That would create a balanced situation between China, the U.S. and Europe.” But, he added, “the U.S. side has to accept us at some level for that to happen.” American companies “can also modify our 5G technologies to meet their security requirements.” They can even “change the software code. In that case, the U.S. will be assured of information security.”
This is clearly an olive branch, and for a reason: Huawei burst into American consciousness when its chief financial officer — and Ren’s daughter — Meng Wanzhou was put under house arrest in December 2018 by Canadian authorities while on a trip there, after the Justice Department sought her extradition because of alleged violations by Huawei of U.S. sanctions on Iran. She has denied the charges.
(While she has been awaiting extradition to the United States in a Vancouver mansion, though, China has detained two Canadians, in solitary accommodations and under brutal conditions, so as to force an exchange. Canada has stood with the United States and refused.)
In January, U.S. prosecutors gained the indictment of Meng and Huawei on 23 counts, ranging from wire fraud to conspiracy to defraud the United States to stealing trade secrets. Then in May, the Department of Commerce put Huawei and 70 of its affiliates on its “Entity List,” or blacklist, which means no American company can sell them hardware, chips, software or services without special permission.
The export blacklist is to take full effect on Nov. 19, which will mean that Google, whose Android operating system sits on every Huawei phone; Microsoft, whose Windows operating system sits on every Huawei computer; and Intel, whose chips run Huawei’s 5G networks, can no longer do business with China’s biggest phone equipment company. And even foreign companies that depend on American technology are being pressured by Trump not to deploy Huawei products.
U.S. officials believe that Huawei, in addition to violating sanctions on Iran, can install “back doors” in its equipment that Chinese intelligence can exploit, although no one has yet found any — or at least none have been publicly reported.
Which is why the Trump team is now facing challenges not only from Huawei, but also from some of the company’s biggest American suppliers, which stand to lose a huge chunk of business. Microsoft President Brad Smith told Bloomberg Businessweek on Monday that when his company pressed regulators to explain their Huawei ban, “oftentimes, what we get in response is, ‘Well, if you knew what we knew, you would agree with us.’ And our answer is, ‘Great, show us what you know, so we can decide for ourselves. That’s the way this country works.’”
I have no idea who is telling the truth in this story. If Huawei really is a bad actor, let’s get the proof out there and blacklist the hell out of it. If it’s not so clear, the Trump team should at least explore Ren’s offer to see if there is a pathway for Huawei to assure U.S. intelligence experts and demonstrate good behavior. Because Huawei is the tip of a huge iceberg.
For the first 30 years of United States-China trade, Chinese companies mostly sold us what I would call “shallow’’ or “surface” goods — clothes we wore on our backs, shoes we wore on our feet and electronics we put in our ears. But now that China is becoming a technological powerhouse of its own, it wants to sell us “deep technologies” — like 5G networking that gets embedded deep into our basements, bedrooms, factories and communications infrastructures.
That’s why U.S. officials are asking: How can we let Huawei place its 5G technology in our cities and homes? Can’t it be used by China to spy on us or turn off our electricity in a war? And China asks the same about us.
Either the United States and China develop whole new frameworks of trust to manage trade in deep technologies or, as my colleague Raymond Zhong put it in this paper on July 18, going forward every purchase of telecommunications equipment will be transformed “from a business decision into a geopolitical one — a test of national allegiances to Washington or to Beijing.”
That will be a more fractured, less prosperous and less peaceful world.

Nicholas Kristof: Our children deserve better

Texto completo: When a 2-year-old Guatemalan boy had trouble staying silent in an immigration courtroom, the judge pointed his finger at him.
“I have a very big dog in my office, and if you don’t be quiet, he will come out and bite you,” the judge, V. Stuart Couch, a former Marine, yelled at the toddler in a 2016 hearing, according to a formal complaint shared by the Charlotte Center for Legal Advocacy and first reported this week by Mother Jones.
“Do you want him to bite you?” Couch asked.
The boy, his mom and their advocate were all soon sobbing. Couch later acknowledged that he “did not handle the situation properly,” according to the judge who investigated the complaint, Deepali Nadkarni.
Clearly, Couch didn’t have a child’s well-being in mind on that day. But ignoring the welfare of our young is a day-to-day problem in America, where our children are falling behind those in other wealthy countries.
On Thursday, 10 Democratic presidential candidates will debate. It would be a natural opportunity to provoke a national conversation on the subject. But a question about child poverty hasn’t been asked at a presidential debate in 20 years, not since a Republican primary debate in 1999, according to the Children’s Defense Fund.
Presidential candidates have been asked about the World Series, about cursing in movies, even about flag lapel pins more recently than they have been questioned about child poverty. We’ve had 147 presidential debates in a row without a single question on the topic. I hope Thursday’s debate won’t be the 148th.
UNICEF says the U.S. ranks No. 37 among countries in well-being of children, and Save the Children puts the United States at No. 36. European countries dominate the top places.
American infants at last count were 76% more likely to die in their first year than children in other advanced countries, according to an article last year in the journal Health Affairs. We would save the lives of 20,000 American children each year if we could just achieve the same child mortality rates as the rest of the rich world.
Half a million American kids also suffer lead poisoning each year, and the youth suicide rate is at its highest level on record.
These problems have been magnified under President Donald Trump, though U.S. policy has shortchanged children as a whole for decades. The Census Bureau reported this week that the number of uninsured children increased by 425,000 last year.
Trump also gave the green light to a pesticide that I call Dow Chemical’s Nerve Gas Pesticide. Formally called chlorpyrifos, it is associated with brain damage among young children. Over the objections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Trump administration claims it’s safe. So when will we see it sprayed in the White House to handle cockroaches?
James Heckman, a Nobel laureate in economics at the University of Chicago, calculates that investments in early childhood programs for at-risk kids have an astronomical return, because of improved productivity and reduced spending on police forces, courts, jails, special education and health care.
Heckman has a new paper on a North Carolina early childhood program that began in the 1970s, the Abecedarian project, finding an annual return on investment of almost 14%. In another recent paper, he found that the Perry preschool program in Michigan in the 1960s benefited not only the children involved but also, a generation later, their children.
Likewise, one study found that each dollar invested in reducing lead poisoning among children pays for itself at least 17 times over.
Here’s a suggestion for the candidates: Embrace a landmark report this year from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that outlines how to reduce child poverty by half over 10 years. This can be done: Britain under Tony Blair halved child poverty in less than a decade.
The national academies calculate that a combination of job programs and child allowances could cut child poverty in half in the United States at a cost of about $100 billion a year. Yes, that’s a lot of money. But child poverty has an economic cost in crime, lost productivity and other expenses that is at least $800 billion a year, the academies report. The real question isn’t whether we can afford to act, but whether we can afford not to.
We don’t lack the tools to help or the resources. The challenge is just that in our political system, children don’t count — and never get mentioned in presidential debates.
“Kids don’t vote,” notes Nadine Burke Harris, the surgeon general of California and an expert on the lifelong costs of childhood trauma. “They require us to speak for them.”

Detroit becomes SheTown for women-centric film festival

Texto completo: Picture a music video with Rosa Parks, Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart and Joan of Arc. Then picture a documentary about the dogs left behind after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Then picture a contemporary descendant of slaves confronting a member of the family that enslaved her ancestors.
If you picture yourself wanting to see these heartfelt, challenging, unexpected films, the 2019 Detroit SheTown Film Festival is just the ticket. Running Thursday through Sunday, it will feature more than 120 short films — many of them are having their world, U.S. or Michigan premiere.
The women-centric event, now in its second year, has a global reach. After a solid debut in 2018, the event drew submissions for 2019 from 25 countries. About 48 filmmakers and counting are expected to come to Detroit this weekend and participate in panel discussions and post-movie Q&A sessions.
The festival launches Thursday with an opening night party at the Detroit Shipping Company. The screenings themselves start Friday, with 24 hours of programming broken up into 12 two-hour blocks.
The term SheTown dates back to the early decades of the auto industry, according to the festival's website, when male factory workers grumbled about seeing women alongside them on the assembly line. A labor journalist of that bygone era called Detroit the new "she-town," a label that local filmmakers Mandy Looney and Mike Madigan decided to use for their celebration of content by and about women.
"I found personally ... your typical festivals we had gone to were not very inclusive, (with) not a lot of diversity. I found myself on Q&As being the only woman and finding the films I was seeing weren't representative of the population of the world," says Looney. After attending the Female Eye Film Festival in Toronto, she was inspired to bring the same sense of camaraderie to Detroit.
SheTown accepts films in a variety of categories, from animation and comedy to drama, documentary, thriller and more. In order to qualify, entries must have at least one woman in the role of lead actress, director, cinematographer, screenwriter, editor, producer or co-producer, or have a female-centric narrative or real-life story.
Looney says the short-film format appeals to today's YouTube-consuming audiences. "I feel the short form in today's ADD world, people kind of prefer to watch their content in a shorter span." Festival films run from a minimum of two minutes to a maximum of 25.
This year, SheTown is mixing its content up by offering more eclectic programming blocks. Although there will be themed screenings — like the thrillers scheduled for Friday the 13th — the bulk of blocks will put animation next to dramas next to comedies and so on.
"I feel like the programming this year is a great representation of all the stories women want to tell," says Looney.
Among the myriad films is "Earth Mother," a music video from director Kelly Riot that has actors playing civil rights icon Rosa Parks, artist Frida Kahlo, pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart and Joan of Arc. Actor and producer Maria Robles, who portrays Kahlo, will be at Friday night's Taste of SheTown screening.
Another offering, "Fallout Dogs," by director Julia Oldham, screens Saturday. Arriving on the heels of the compelling HBO miniseries "Chernobyl," it looks at the stray dogs living in the exclusion zone of the 1986 Chernobyl Power Plant's nuclear disaster and the people who care for new generations of them.
"(Oldham) was there in the thick of it, captured this amazing footage of all these dogs and all these puppies. ... It definitely pulls at your heartstrings, because these dogs can't be removed, but somebody has to take care of them," says Looney.
"Descendants," by director Paisley Sutton, screens Saturday and follows the young black filmmaker as she goes to England for a face-to-face encounter with a descendant of the man who enslaved her family in Barbados. The subject resonates with the in-depth 1619 Project done by the New York Times (and similarly-themed work from other publications) that marks the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to America 400 years ago.
Says Looney, "There's a style to it that's so genuine and so real. You're following her through her thoughts and what she wants to say and then, when she's done, what she should have said."
Looney describes the festival as a chance for general audiences to see unique short films, and an inspiring gathering, in particular, for women who want to work in film.
"There's a lot of confidence that comes from seeing another women filmmaker doing her thing and killing it and maybe believing you can do it yourself."

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The feminist dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985) gets a sequel at long last. Atwood says of the book, "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "'The Testaments' is worthy of the literary classic it continues."
2. "The Institute" by Stephen King (Scribner, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: Twelve-year-old genius Luke Ellis is whisked away in the middle of the night and taken to the Institute, where psychic kids are being held captive to save the world.
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "King leans into the theme of 'great events' happening with the smallest of decisions as well as the world-changing power of togetherness. And in that case, it's a frequent lesson he extols that never gets old."
3. "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" by James Poniewozik (Liveright, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The New York Times TV critic examines the history of television and American media to explain how Trump mastered the medium to win his base and become our 45th president.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base."
4. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power (Dey Street, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American diplomat and human rights advocate traces her journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official in a revealing memoir.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "Power's vibrant prose, exuberant storytelling, and deep insights into human nature make for a page-turning memoir."
5. "After the Flood" by Kassandra Montag (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: In this dystopian adventure novel set in a water-logged world altered by climate change, a mother embarks on a perilous voyage to rescue her kidnapped daughter.
The buzz: "Anchored by a complicated, compelling heroine, this gripping, speculative, high-seas adventure is impossible to put down," says Booklist.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- One immigrant went to California as a child to participate in a drug study that has helped Americans survive with a rare genetic disease. Another, an adolescent girl from Spain, was told by a cardiologist that she must remain in Boston to receive critical care for which her family borrowed thousands of dollars. A teenage boy with cystic fibrosis arrived in the United States "literally dying," he said, but now has a new lease on life.
On Wednesday, the immigrants told a House Oversight subcommittee why it was imperative that they remain in the country, despite the Trump administration's abrupt elimination of a program that had enabled them to receive lifesaving medical care without the fear of deportation.
The fate of the immigrants, who all came to the United States legally, remains unclear more than a month after they were first informed by letter that they would have to leave -- only to be told early this month that the government would reconsider.
"If I'm sent back, I will die," Maria Isabel Bueso, 24, of Guatemala, told lawmakers on Wednesday. At three feet tall, sitting in a wheelchair, she was a sympathetic witness.
The unannounced termination on Aug. 7 of the so-called deferred action program, except for military personnel, generated public outrage and drew sharp rebuke from the medical establishment. The New York Times revealed that Ms. Bueso had been ordered to leave the country in 33 days or face deportation.
Ms. Bueso came to the United States when she was 7 to participate in a clinical trial for a drug to treat Mucopolysaccharidosis Type 6, known as MPS 6, an enzyme disease that causes dwarfism, cardiac arrest and blindness, among other ailments. The drug, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, has helped extend by a decade the lives of people like her. She continues to receive weekly drug treatment and participate in medical studies.
Last month, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, without public notice, began sending letters to immigrants like her telling them that it was no longer accepting requests for "deferred action," renewable every two years. On Labor Day, the agency backtracked and announced that cases pending on Aug. 7 would be reconsidered. It also said that deportation proceedings had not been initiated against anyone who had received the letter.
However, it has not yet said whether the government will continue to grant immigrants the opportunity to stay in the country. It has also not clarified how applicants who need to file extensions must proceed.
In response, Democrats called an emergency hearing, seeking answers about the origin, rationale and revision of the program. They received little information.
"I have clients with sick children now who need access to the program but can't apply," said Anthony Marino, an immigration lawyer who represents children receiving treatment for cancer, cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy.
"What is going to happen to people who fell on the wrong side of Aug. 7? We haven't received a denial or anything about new procedures in place. We just don't know," said Mr. Marino, who is the director of the Irish International Immigrant Center in Boston, which has 19 clients who require deferred action to survive.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and Lawyers for Civil Rights on Sept. 5 filed a lawsuit challenging the termination of the policy on behalf of the center.
According to the lawsuit, the elimination of the policy without public comment or standard regulatory procedures violated the Administrative Procedure Act as well as the guarantee of equal protection in the Constitution.
Absent from Wednesday's hearing was Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting chief of Citizenship and Immigration Services, whose recent initiatives include efforts to speed up asylum screenings and to make it harder for children of some active service members born abroad to secure citizenship.
Instead, a career official, Daniel Renaud, the associate director for field operations, appeared to take questions, which he largely declined to answer, citing the continuing litigation.
"You cannot answer the genesis of this policy?" Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked after failing to elicit responses to her questions.
"I am an operator; I am not a policymaker," Mr. Renaud said at one point.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, apologized to the witnesses "on behalf of the United States of America for the dehumanizing policies that" had brought them before the House panel.
Mr. Renaud said the agency received 1,000 applications annually for deferred action. About 424 cases had been reopened since the government decided to reconsider the policy, he added. He could not answer what would happen to those who have needed to file requests for extensions or apply after Aug. 7.
For those caught in the middle, the stakes are high. "It's a relatively small program but for the individual who receives deferred action, it is lifesaving protection," said Shoba Wadhia, an immigration scholar at Penn State Law, who testified and wrote a book on the history of deferred action.
In August, Citizenship and Immigration Services had said that any decisions going forward would have to be made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security agency responsible for deporting immigrants. ICE officials then told The Times that it was not their agency's role to offer deferred action relief and that they had not been consulted about taking on such a role.
Normally, ICE considers requests for deferrals from deportation only for people who have already been ordered removed from the country, Timothy Robbins, the acting executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations at ICE, said at the hearing.
But he said that his agency was in talks with the Department of Homeland Security about the "path going forward for deferred action," adding that "those are internal discussions we are not prepared to discuss."
Ms. Bueso is among the immigrants who have received a letter in recent days saying that their cases will be reopened but not whether they need to take any action.
"Our future is still in question with no further communication or direction," Ms. Bueso said.
Serena Badia, 14, who first came to the United States from Barcelona in 2010 to receive care for a rare heart defect, said that her family never intended to live here. She underwent several surgeries over several trips, and ultimately her doctors at Boston Children's Hospital advised her parents that she must stay in the United States because of her frail health.
"Our plans to go back to Spain fell apart," she said. "I needed to stay here to stay alive."
Jonathan Sanchez, a 16-year-old Honduran, said that his older sister, the first born, had died of cystic fibrosis when she was 6 months old. When he was 12, his parents came to America legally to seek better care for him, which he receives to this day, because, he said, his cystic fibrosis meant that "I could not do anything that an average person could do."
"I could not walk too much," he said. "I could not run, jump, eat or sleep the way other people do, and even going to the bathroom was complicated."
"My mother and father are so afraid for me that they have asked an American friend of ours if she will adopt me, if it comes to that, so that I can keep getting treatment," he said.

FOR SOME, CREATING CHAOS IS THE GOAL; PAUL FANLUND

Texto completo: I'm frequently astonished at how contemporary American politics feels so far removed from what I learned in school or experienced through most of my adulthood.
Sure, we had the upheavals of the Vietnam War and Watergate and 9/11 and the cynical exploitation of racial divisions. We had Republicans preaching the virtues of trickle-down economics and Democrats countering that government could be a vehicle for positive change.
But there were basic norms, appreciation of expertise, even some respect for those with whom we disagreed.
That was then.
Now there appears to be a substantial subset of Americans for whom fomenting chaos is the goal. They exist on both sides, although, evidenced by Donald Trump, they are far more common on the right.
At the recent annual convention of the American Political Science Association, the winner of the best paper in political psychology focused on the "need for chaos."
The three political scientists who wrote it maintain that the growth of vitriolic conspiracy theories on social media has enabled those who are deeply disenchanted to revel in creating upheaval for upheaval's sake.
Such people are more against everything than for anybody, concluded Michael Bang Petersen and Mathias Osmundsen, political scientists at Aarhus University in Demark, and Kevin Arceneaux, a political scientist at Temple University.
Their summary: "We show that this extreme discontent is associated with motivations to share hostile political rumors, not because such rumors are viewed to be true but because they are believed to mobilize the audience against disliked elites."
The authors measured this "need for chaos" among those they describe as frustrated status seekers: "We show that chaotic motivations are surprisingly widespread within advanced democracies, having some hold in up to 40 percent of the American national population."
Americans polled answered questions like these: "I think society should be burned to the ground." Twenty-four percent said yes.
Or, "When I think about our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking, 'Just let them all burn.' " Forty percent concurred.
Or, "We cannot fix the problems in our social Paul Fanlund is editor and publisher of The Capital Times institutions, we need to tear them down and start over." Also 40 percent.
The authors termed those results "staggering."
They also write: "We suggest that these chaotic motivations go beyond traditional forms of democratic discontent such as political cynicism and populism. Instead, they are potentially more akin to precursors of the sentiments associated with radicalism."
Well, that's reassuring.
In his latest New York Times column about the chaos study, Thomas B. Edsall writes about how Trump has exploited "chaos-inducing issues like racial hostility, authoritarianism and white identity politics." Edsall's headline: "The Trump voters whose 'need for chaos' obliterates everything else."
Citing the chaos study, Edsall writes that a segment of the American citizenry "that was once peripheral is drawn to 'chaos incitement' and has gained influence by connecting with the like-minded via the internet."
The professors caution they are not saying hordes of Americans are ready to take it to the streets. But they write that "the study provides insights into the kinds of thoughts and behaviors that people are motivated to entertain when they sit alone (and lonely) in front of the computer, answering surveys or surfing social media platforms."
The political mood that lifted Trump in 2016 was fertile ground for fear-mongering. The sense of a growing economic and social divide exacerbated by the loss of manufacturing jobs to automation and the global information economy was a big part of it, but so was the perceived threat to the superior status of being white in America.
Petersen, one of the political scientists, told Edsall that support for Bernie Sanders in 2016 also correlated to this quest for chaos.
Petersen wrote that preliminary examination of the data shows "that the 'need for chaos' correlates positively with sympathy for Trump but also although less strongly with sympathy for Sanders. It correlates negatively with sympathy for Hillary Clinton."
No kidding. The chaos crowd wanted no part of Clinton, an accomplished traditional politician.
A recent column in The Economist described a subset of Sanders' supporters in much the same way, saying he has "an almost cult-like hold on a small but meaningful minority of the Democratic electorate," the kind not seen since Eugene McCarthy's Democratic presidential campaign in 1968.
"Sanders' erstwhile success appears to have owed less to his left-wing proposals than a vaguer appetite for disruption," argued the columnist.
The fact that 12 percent of Sanders' disappointed supporters voted for Trump over Clinton in 2016 illustrates what could happen again, the column said.
"Those who care mostly about health care or education policy seem to have shifted to (Elizabeth) Warren. The remaining diehards seem more energized by anti-establishment grievance."
"The burn-down-the-house iconoclasm of his base" will not be easy to mollify even if a Democratic presidential nominee adopts many of Sanders' far-left positions, opined the column.
"Elizabeth Warren can kiss my ass," was what one socialist for Sanders told The Economist. Another Sanders backer dismissed former Vice President Joe Biden as a "moderate Republican."
The column suggests a Democratic nominee other than Sanders could fail to attract some of his supporters, possibly helping Trump get re-elected. That would be similar to 1968, when disappointed McCarthy supporters refused to fully back Democrat Hubert Humphrey, boosting Richard Nixon.
Now, before I stir up the next round of outrage about my disrespect for Sanders, this column isn't about him.
It's about a profound sadness that a country that was once far more united than divided is now anything but.

After a summer surge, Elizabeth Warren could be a target in Thursday's debate

Texto completo: AUSTIN, Texas — As golden evening light reflected in glassy skyscrapers behind her, Elizabeth Warren took the stage before a crowd packed elbow-to-elbow and jammed into rows of folding chairs at a grassy waterfront park here.
It's a scene the Massachusetts senator has grown accustomed to this summer: a sea of people like the more than 5,000 at this event Tuesday night. Some pumped their fists, some waved signs, some beamed up at her as they awaited her folksy personal story and plain-spoken promise of progressive reform backed by a bevy of detailed policy plans.
As summer nights turn chilly, the Democratic presidential primary is also entering a new season. For the first time Thursday night, all the candidates in a shrinking field will appear in one debate, meaning Warren will share the stage for the first time with front-runner Joe Biden. After drawing huge crowds and surging in the polls this summer, she will arrive with momentum on her side and a bulls-eye on her back.
Biden and other candidates have taken thinly veiled shots at her in recent days, saying the party's nominee must have more than just ambitious plans. Analysts said Warren needs to avoid getting distracted by attacks and just continue to make the case for bold change that has fueled her rise. She said that's what she plans to do.
“This is a big chance to be able to talk about what's broken in this country, how we fix it and how I'm building a grassroots movement to get that done," Warren told reporters after the Austin event.
Biden is still ahead in most national polls, although Warren has steadily risen and is jockeying with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for second. A national poll this week by The Economist/YouGov showed Warren and Biden tied. Similar polls in late August and early September give Biden a lead of between seven and 16 percentage points -- a much smaller margin than earlier this year.
Because Warren is on the rise, she should stay positive during the debate and stick to her message, analysts said, because clearly it is working.
“Warren can simply assert her position in the race, which is 'Just getting rid of Trump is not enough, we need big changes,' " said Steve Murphy, a Democratic strategist who has worked on Democratic presidential campaigns since the 1970s.
Warren can expect jabs on stage from lower-tier candidates, as they become more desperate for attention. But she should resist jabbing back, said Erin O'Brien, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
“Let the minions fire some shots while she just continues to be the policy person and making tough claims against Trump," O'Brien said.
With many Democratic voters apoplectic about Trump, a focus in the primary so far has been on choosing the candidate with the best chance of beating Trump.
Polls show most voters think that is Biden, the former vice president. Warren, however, is on a more nuanced mission. She's trying to convince voters that she is electable while at the same time ushering in major progressive reforms that go farther than anything Biden is proposing and echo ideas brought into the mainstream by her liberal rival Sanders.
Some worry her calls for “big structural change" in the debates and on the campaign trail risk alienating more moderate voters who could help deliver a victory over Trump. But political experts say Warren's momentum heading into the debate indicates that many voters want more than just a Democrat in the White House. And if Warren can win several early voting states, qualms about her electability will evaporate, they said.
“She just needs to stay on course," said Murphy. “I think the swing voters are going to look at this the same way the most of the Democrats do, which is getting rid of Trump just isn't good enough."
To win the nomination, Warren will need to use the debates to help siphon off Sanders supporters, who are among the most loyal, and more moderate Biden voters, who shy away from ideas like government-backed healthcare and free public college.
Warren should focus her debate efforts on winning over Sanders supporters, said Jeffrey Berry, a political science professor at Tufts University. If those voters switch, she would overwhelm Biden.
“There is more pressure on Bernie Thursday night than there is on Warren" he said. “If she can, she should try to position herself in a positive way in contrast to Sanders."
When dealing with Biden at the debate, she should emphasize words like pragmatic, doable, and bipartisan, Berry said.
“She wants to appear to be a little more moderate while not driving away the true blue lefties in the party," he said.
But Warren could find herself under fire Thursday night from Biden, based on some of his recent comments.
“You have to have plans, but you have to be able to execute those plans," Biden said at a fundraiser last week.
After the Austin event, reporters asked Warren about Biden's criticism.
“Well I think that we start with a plan, and then we get out there and fight for it," she said. “To me, that's what being president is all about. It's about laying those plans out and showing the direction for this country and then getting in the fight."
Although the debate stage will put Warren on primetime television, her best work seems to come at smaller events like the town hall in Austin, a liberal enclave in this largely Republican state.
She energized the crowd with her now-familiar story about her father who got sick, her mother who got a minimum-wage job at Sears Roebuck to make ends meet, her Aunt Bee who provided impromptu childcare, and her non-linear path to her dream job as a public school teacher and later a Harvard law professor.
Those experiences, she said, are what fueled her to make plans for more affordable health insurance, jobs that pay liveable wages, universal childcare, free public college, and cancelling student loan debt. She explained her proposed tax on the ultra-rich, which she plans to use to pay for all those things.
Her calls for “big structural change" were met with whoops and applause. People waved signs with what has become her slogan: “Dream Big, Fight Hard." At the end of the night, the line to take a photo with Warren stretched far into the darkness.
“Hearing her story, and what it is that motivates her when she's making her plans, that's very interesting," said Jeff Scruggs, 59, from Austin.
Until six years ago, Scruggs voted Republican. He went by the old saying “what's good for business is good for America." But then he started to re-think that mantra. And on Tuesday, what Warren said made sense to him.

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO -- Uber laid off 435 workers in its product and engineering teams on Tuesday, the company's second round of cuts in recent months as it struggles to make money.
The cuts, which total about 8 percent of Uber's global product and engineering group, follow 400 layoffs in July from the marketing team. In a message to employees about the layoffs on Tuesday that was viewed by The New York Times, Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said the company had gone off course as it grew and must streamline to regain its competitive edge.
"In the past, we grew our teams rapidly and in a decentralized way. This made sense as we worked to scale the business globally and find product-market fit," Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote in the email, which echoed what he said in July with the previous layoffs. "But at a certain point, bigger teams do not mean better results. It's critical we get our edge back and continually push ourselves to do better."
Uber has been under pressure this year over its long-term viability. The company had a troubled initial public offering in May as investors questioned its ride-hailing business, which is expensive to operate. Uber's stock slid below its offering price on its first day of trading and continues to struggle. In August, it reported a record quarterly loss of $ 5.2 billion and its slowest-ever revenue growth. Uber's shares rose about 4 percent on Tuesday.
In response, Mr. Khosrowshahi has shaken up Uber's top ranks and tried to cut costs. After cutting jobs in the marketing team in July, he instituted a monthlong hiring freeze and instructed executives to re-evaluate the size of their teams. In addition, he pushed out top executives, including his chief operating officer and chief marketing officer. Uber's board has also undergone some turnover.
"Everybody knows that Uber can't lose billions of dollars a quarter forever, but it's always been a question of when the money might run out," said Harry Campbell, a ride-hailing driver and founder of the industry website The Rideshare Guy. "We've seen Uber institute a number of cost-cutting measures at the driver and rider level and now the cuts are coming to the corporate side of the business in order to move towards profitability."
In his email, Mr. Khosrowshahi said he was not making job cuts to appease investors. "We are not doing this for Wall Street. We are doing this for Uber," he wrote.
Uber faces other labor problems. California's state Legislature is set to vote this week on a bill that would force Uber to reclassify its drivers as employees rather than as independent contractors. Uber relies on independent contractors as drivers, as their freelance status helps keep costs down by allowing the company to not provide full-time benefits or pay. Uber and other gig economy companies worked for months to cut a deal with labor groups to carve out ride-hailing drivers from the bill, but those negotiations failed. The bill is widely expected to pass.
Uber employs more than 27,000 people globally, nearly half in the United States, a company spokesman said. The new layoffs were earlier reported by TechCrunch.

Texto completo: New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to bring an impeachment vote in Congress for Republicans to go on the record for or against impeaching President Trump.
The freshman Democratic lawmaker made the challenge while speaking to reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill.
"I want to see every Republican go on the record and knowingly vote against impeachment of this president, knowing his corruption, having it on the record," Ocasio-Cortez said. "This is outrageous to protect the amount of lawlessness."
Ocasio-Cortez and 128 other representatives, more than half of the Democratic caucus in the House, support impeaching Trump. One independent lawmaker, Justin Amash of Michigan, also supports impeachment. No Republicans are on the record supporting impeaching Trump, according to the New York Times count.iFrame Object

Colorado Springs writer finds success with Amish romance novels

Texto completo: There exists a collective of readers who long for escape to a place where the women walk barefoot on wooden floors as they cook homemade meals, and their men are strong, steady and hardworking providers.
This is the surprisingly popular world of Amish romance fiction, or “bonnet rippers,” as they’re known, where fans are typically evangelical Christian women over 40, according to a 2015 Newsweek story. Two of the genre’s most successful authors, Beverly Lewis and Wanda Brunstetter, were close to selling more than 30 million books combined in 2015, Newsweek reported .
New York Times best-selling author and Colorado Springs resident Shelley Shepard Gray has earned her own seat at the proverbial table. She’s written dozens of novels in the Christian romance subgenre, including her latest, the Walnut Creek Series. “The Loyal One,” No. 2 in the series, was released in August, following the April release of “The Patient One.” The series follows a group of seven people who reunite after the suicide of one of their friends.
“... This is a pleasing story about recovering from grief and a solid beginning for a new series,” wrote a reviewer for the website Publishers Weekly.
Amish romance covers are a far cry from those of iconic Harlequin books, with their bare-chested, swashbuckling male protagonist wrapping his bulky arms around an impossibly tiny-waisted, long-haired woman.
Instead, imagine demure and playful-looking women in long, plain cape dresses, aprons and white head coverings, standing withing touching distance of men in overalls and wide-brimmed hats.
Excerpt
From Shelley Shepard Gray's 2019 Amish romance novel "The Loyal One"
"Her gaze flickered to his lips. She didn't say a word, only smiled.
Leaning in, he placed his free hand around the back of her neck, glancing at her to make sure she wasn't unsure.
Her eyes were bright. Her lips were slightly parted.
He needed no more encouragement. Very gently and carefully, he brushed his lips against hers. She yielded against him and fluttered her eyes closed.
And then she kissed him back.
When he at last pulled away, Katie was wearing a stunned look. Her lips were a little swollen — like she'd just been thoroughly kissed."
What attracts readers to the genre is the same thing that attracts Gray: a sense of hope and the feeling of being transported to another world, one populated not only with the simple-living, plain-dressing and technology-eschewing Amish, but also Mennonites, who differ in their use of technology, among other issues, and Englishers, or non-Amish people. And as you might suspect, this subgenre of books features zero sex and zero questionable language.
“It’s nice spending my days writing about people who are basically positive and caring,” said Gray, who relocated from Cincinnati to the Springs with her husband late last year. “I feel like they’re my next-door neighbors because I know them so well.”
The former sixth-grade teacher, who lived in Denver and taught in the Douglas County School District in the ‘90s, didn’t set out to write Amish romance. Her writing career began one day during a lunch break, when she realized she’d forgotten to bring one of her beloved romance novels to pass the time.
“It was either make something up or grade papers,” she said. “I always thought maybe I could do it. I decided to take up writing the way some people might take up running or quilting. It would be my little hobby I did for fun.”
Three years and multiple manuscripts later, she sold her third book, and made real her lifelong dream of becoming a Harlequin romance writer.
“They were short,” she said. “I read fast and they had happy endings.”
After writing a dozen books for Harlequin’s American Romance and Heartwarming lines under the pen name Shelley Galloway, the Lutheran woman found herself naturally gravitating toward inspirational books where her characters wound up with causes and storylines about saving people. Her editors tried to reel her back in, telling her she was getting off the “boy meets girl” track, but Gray’s agent encouraged her new direction.
She went on to write a big historical Western set after the Civil War, in which everyone found redemption. Though it received almost two dozen rejections, an editor at Harper Collins noticed her writing ability and where she lived — southern Ohio, which is home to Holmes County, where about 40,000 Amish folks live — and asked her to come up with a story about them.
“Hidden,” about a woman who flees an abusive relationship by stowing away in an Amish bed and breakfast, was released in 2008.
“I wasn’t sure about it, but I lived an hour from the Amish community, so I’d already been going over there to get the cinnamon rolls,” said Gray with a laugh.
Researching the simple-living and plain-dressing people has been a yearslong process. It started with books and websites and reading the canon of authors such as Lewis and Brunstetter, and extended into visiting Amish communities around the country. In doing so, she’s made good friends, including Clara, an Old Order Amish friend who, if they were neighbors, “would be gossiping every morning,” said Gray. She’s able to ask her questions and seek advice, and always sends her one of the first copies of each new Amish romance she writes.
Nowadays she writes two Amish books every year, in addition to other projects, including the Bridgeport Social Club series, noninspirational, non-Amish, contemporary romances with a ballroom dancing theme.
“I love writing about people who are faith-driven, and not worried about their computer, the news, all the outside noise, cellphones, their Facebook,” Gray said. “They’re more interested in their friends next door.”

Texto completo: Struggling ride-hailing giant Uber gave layoff notices to over 400 employees Tuesday.
The company cites nearly 100 million users of its app but hasn't been able to turn a profit and in August reported a quarterly loss of $5. 2 billion.
"It’s critical we get our edge back and continually push ourselves to do better," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a company e-mail, which was obtained by the New York Times.
Tuesday's cuts were in product and engineering, while July saw another 400 cuts from the Uber marketing team.
According to TechCrunch, Uber is laying off about 8% of the company, with 170 people from product, and 265 from engineering. Most of the layoffs were for U. S. -based employees.

Uber confirmed the layoffs and released a statement to TechCrunch. “Our hope with these changes is to reset and improve how we work day to day – ruthlessly prioritizing, and always holding ourselves accountable to a high bar of performance and agility. While certainly painful in the moment, especially for those directly affected, we believe that this will result in a much stronger technical organization, which going forward will continue to hire some of the very best talent around the world. ”
Uber went public in May but hasn't had a successful go of it on Wall Street. The stock opened at $41. 57 but has since fallen to $33. 51 a share.

Resumen: [...]The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media.

Texto completo: Political tribalism keeps getting worse. The demand for unthinking and uncompromising loyalty keeps getting louder. Individuals or institutions that try to maintain a sense of fairness and balance, that don’t want to choose sides in our Uncivil War, are branded as weak-kneed, fainthearted heretics. Two recent events highlight this dangerous development. First, Fox News was excoriated by President Donald Trump for daring to interview a Democratic Party official. And second, The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants.
The parallels, of course, are imprecise. Trump has been eviscerating the press as a campaign strategy for years. But the similarities are still striking.
The president and his leftist critics share an instinct for intolerance: a deep disdain for anyone who strays from the party line, a demand for purity combined with a towering self-righteousness. You have to be on the Red Team or the Blue Team, a Loyalist or a Resister. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. We belong to no tribe, root for no team. And if that sounds musty and old-fashioned, well, so does the Constitution, which not only protects a free press but defines it as essential to a healthy democracy.
Over on the left, the latest brouhaha was trigged by a Times headline over a story about a Trump speech that read, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." The words were technically accurate, but not nuanced or skeptical enough, and Times editors acknowledged the problem and changed it after the first edition. But that was not nearly enough to quell the bombastic blowback.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the headline served as "a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by — and often relies upon — the cowardice of mainstream institutions."
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. They see a racist liar in the White House, and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar."
At a meeting of New York Times staffers, one told editor Dean Baquet that the paper was "actively misleading" readers by being too soft on Trump. But Baquet, hit back. "Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden," he told the staff meeting. "They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president. And our job is to figure out why, and how, and to hold the administration to account. If you’re independent, that’s what you do."
Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses. But Baquet — the first African American editor of the Times — is determined to resist their pressure. "Our role is not to be the leader of the resistance," he insists.
We believe deeply in the traditions that Cavuto and Baquet are defending. No news organization is perfect, but at their best, they don’t work for the right or the left — for Trump or his rivals, for the Reds or the Blues. They are not Loyalists or Resisters.
They are simply journalists — fact-finders, truth-tellers — and more valuable than ever.

North Carolina native Fantasia broke onto the scene in 2004 as the season three winner of Fox's American Idol. Later that year, she released her platinum-selling debut album "Free Yourself" and became the first artist in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 chart to debut at #1 with her first single, "I Believe."
The singer released her sophomore effort in 2006, featuring the #1 R&B single "When I See U," which reached gold status. In 2010, Fantasia earned her first ever Grammy Award for the hit single "Bittersweet," off her critically acclaimed third album "Back to Me." "Side Effects of You" followed in 2013, debuting at #1 on the Billboard R&B Albums Chart and #2 on the Billboard Top 200. On July 29, 2016, Fantasia released her fifth studio album, "The Definition Of....," which became her third consecutive #1 R&B album debut, her fourth top ten debut on the Billboard 200, and earned her another Grammy nomination for Best Traditional R&B Performance.

Texto completo: So I missed the eclipse. It turned out that in early July something equally cosmic would be happening -- likewise accompanied by crying, laughing, drinking and a last-minute, nail-biting weather watch -- albeit something more local and hopefully far more lasting. I performed a wedding.
In all, I've witnessed eight total solar eclipses, from 35 seconds of noonday darkness on a soccer field in Siberia to seven minutes of coronal magic -- time enough to drink an entire bottle of Corona and shoot a whole roll of film -- on a beach in La Paz, Mexico. The eclipse on July 2 in Chile would have been my ninth. I'd long planned on dragging my family and friends down to the Atacama Desert, where the moon's shadow would pass directly over some of the world's leading observatories.
But when our old friends Tony and Millicent announced last fall that they would be getting married on July 6, just four days after the eclipse, my personal calendar stones shifted.
I had taken a paternal interest in their relationship ever since the couple met, at a party at our house on election night in 2012. Tony, a professional juggler and teacher at the New England Center for Circus Arts, had tagged along with another friend. Millicent, one of my wife Nancy's oldest friends, is de facto godmother to our daughter, Mira.
[ Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar .]
One happy outcome was that Mira learned to juggle. Another was one of those unlikely romances you wouldn't have dared to predict or arrange.
So I couldn't miss the wedding. Moreover, they planned to marry at the Ashokan Center, a center of music, arts and crafts near Woodstock, N.Y., where I once lived for a dozen years writing books. I quickly rented a big house where a large group of us could stay for the Fourth of July weekend and the event.
A few weeks before the wedding, Millicent and Tony asked us to stand by for an important phone call. I grew briefly worried: Had they changed their minds and were calling it off? Or maybe they just wanted Mira to be in the ceremony. But it was me they wanted, to officiate.
I'm not particularly religious, although I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, in a typical Scandinavian upbringing that included being dragged to a Lutheran church on the occasional Sunday. The only time I use the word "God" is when I'm quoting Einstein, who used it as a metaphor for the mysteries of nature.
Then again, I've been know to digress on the subjects of free will and the death of the universe, perhaps earning myself a reputation for gravitas, at least on paper. Also I am, shall we say, seasoned.
"You are on the older side among our friends," Millicent wrote in an email, when I asked why me. "And are a very good as well as successful writer. You even have white hair! (kidding)."
Also, their first choice, an old friend of Tony's, had politely declined.
I am not an accomplished nor even a happy public speaker, but I will agree to anything if it is far enough in the future. And I knew it could be done. I've attended weddings presided over by ministers ordained online by the Universal Life Church and even stranger-sounding outfits -- Dudeism, anybody? Such ceremonies are entirely legitimate, documented in the Sunday weddings section of this very newspaper.
The Universal Life Church website was easy to find. (Their slogan: "We are all children of the same universe." Who could argue with that?) Completing my ordination as a minister took all of 15 minutes, and was free. For $ 39.99, I ordered the Classic Wedding Package, which soon arrived in the mail: a booklet about weddings, sample wedding certificates, name tags, bumper stickers and windshield placards proclaiming me a member of the clergy. I could now perform baptisms and funerals and start my own church.
The pamphlet advised that my job was to make sure all this was legal in the eyes of local county and city ordinances. So I went to the City Clerk's office in Manhattan, where Tony and Millie had obtained their marriage license. After sitting in a lobby for several hours, watching couples and their friends come and go in wedding dresses and formal attire, I was assured by a clerk that my signature on the license would be fine.
Now I had to think of something to say. The material was familiar, I soon realized. My day job largely involves writing about things that are dark, deadly, vast and doomed, and reminding readers of the many ways that humanity, Earth and even the universe could die.
A black hole could swallow us. An asteroid could fall crashing from the sky. The Higgs field, which permeates space and determines the properties of elementary particles, could sigh and shudder, causing us and the cosmos as we know it to flicker out like a dream.
But the other half of my job consists of reminding people of all the wondrous, even miraculous, things that atoms and elementary particles can do: form stars, planets, cat videos, the aurora borealis, us.
Just because these things are not permanent doesn't mean they aren't worthy of our awe and love.
I quoted Einstein only once, on the illusory nature of time: "For those of us who believe in physics, this separation between past, present and future is only an illusion, however tenacious." We live on borrowed energy that will be repaid one way or another. All we have is now.
Early July is prime gardening season in the Hudson Valley, when Edens bloom behind eight-foot-high deer fences and my Siberian irises would blaze in deep blue glory. The flowers will be gone by fall, but we don't feel defeated by that. We plant and nurture them anyway, for their transcendent, transient and fragile beauty.
Naturally, as I was about to pronounce the couple man and wife, it rained. The moisture killed my microphone, so I had to shout out the last words. The photographer made a point of taking a close-up of the raindrops on my eyeglasses.
And so it went for that complex, ecologically compromised and very delicate bloom called marriage, a hopeful flutter in the local cosmos. Life and love are to be nourished, and I was happy to hold a watering can.

Texto completo: What's on TV
MR. MERCEDES 10 p.m. on Audience Network. Stephen King's writing continues to find a second life onscreen. "It Chapter Two" hit theaters last week, and this crime show, based on King's Bill Hodges trilogy, is back for a third season. The new episodes draw from "Finders Keepers," the second book in King's series. Detective Hodges (Brendan Gleeson) and his accomplices (played by Justine Lupe and Jharrel Jerome) are investigating the murder of a beloved local author whose unpublished novels were stolen from his home. (Spoiler alert!) While the killer of the title is no longer in the picture, his influence lingers on. Mike Hale, in his review for The New York Times, wrote that the show "may lack King's intensity, but it holds on to a measure of the author's dark humor."
RODMAN: FOR BETTER OR WORSE (2019) 9 p.m. on ESPN. For better or worse, Dennis Rodman is the type of figure whose life is ripe for the documentary treatment. The retired N.B.A. star is considered one of the strongest rebounders and defenders in the history of basketball. But he has also developed a reputation as an outrageous, attention-seeking bad boy. This new film, part of ESPN's 30 for 30 series, tries to peel back the curtain on the athlete's difficult childhood, his rise to the Basketball Hall of Fame and his friendship with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
GHOSTED: LOVE GONE MISSING 9 p.m. on MTV. Perhaps banking off the success of its series "Catfish: The TV Show," about people who have fallen for strangers online only to find out they were being fooled all along, MTV has created this similar series. The hosts, Rachel Lindsay and Travis Mills, crisscross the country helping heartbroken people find former flings or lovers who have cut them out of their lives. Each episode leads to a dramatic face-to-face meeting where the forlorn confront their "ghosts" and ask that aching question: Why?
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
HOTEL MUMBAI (2019) Stream on Hulu. In 2008, members of the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba killed more than 160 people in coordinated terrorist attacks across Mumbai. One of their targets was the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel. With roughly 1,500 people trapped inside, members of the hotel staff risked their lives to keep their guests safe. This nail-biter of a thriller recreates that violence with unflinching, often unsettling detail. Armie Hammer plays an American guest trying to protect his wife and newborn, while Dev Patel plays a heroic Sikh waiter. Some critics have said the film exploits the horrific event, while others praised it for putting the courageous service workers in the spotlight.
SHAMELESS Stream on Netflix. The ninth season of this long-running comedy, about the reckless Gallagher family in Chicago's South Side, lands on Netflix, giving fans plenty of time to recap before Season 10 debuts on Showtime on Nov. 3.

Texto completo: "It feels like the Town Board wants to move forward with this."
Elayne Armaniaco
Greenbush Neighborhood Coalition chairwoman
BLAUVELT — On a summer day in 1972, Paul Olsen and a friend trudged into a densely wooded area between Route 303 and Greenbush Road in search of fossils.
Some time later, Olsen, a Yale University paleontology student at the time, made a historic discovery: dinosaur footprints outlined in purplish mudstone in a hillside.
"The tracks were filled with white sandstone, so they stood out," Olsen recalled recently.
What the two men found were three-toed tracks of what turned out to be the Atreipus, a plant-eating dinosaur-like creature about the size of a large dog, from the Triassic Period some 215 million years ago.
It was big news at the time. "Dinosaurs roamed Route 303" read the front-page headline in The Journal News on July 27, 1972. A subsequent New York Times article hailed the find as the "first discovery of evidence that dinosaurs once lived in New York State."
Some of the tracks were removed and sent to the New York State Museum in Albany, where they remain on display.
But several footprints are still where the prehistoric creatures left them. They, and other fossils that might be in the vicinity, are now an issue in a very modern conflict over development. Residents concerned about a proposal to build condos near the Atreipus' former stomping grounds are pointing to Olsen's nearly 50-year-old finding as one reason for the town to back off.
Building on history Olsen, now a paleontologist and professor at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, recently recounted his discovery and its significance during a PowerPoint presentation at an Orangetown Town Board hearing.
Orangetown officials are weighing whether to rezone 17 acres that include the spot where Olsen found the footprints. The rezoning would allow a developer to seek approvals for 68 townhouse-style two-bedroom condominiums on about 8 acres.
Another 8 acres — including the woods where the tracks are located — would be donated to the town as parkland. The developer has also agreed to preserve and move any footprints discovered during excavation, even though they are not under historical protection.
The property straddles a residential and commercial area near the town line in West Nyack. At present most of the acreage is zoned for single-family homes; the rest can accommodate light industrial uses.
The public hearing on the request during which Olsen spoke attracted a crowd to Town Hall and will be continued on Oct. 1. The Town Board could vote on the request that night.
If the zone change is approved, the Patriot's Crossing condos proposed by developer William Brodsky's Ryserson Farms LLC would have to go through the normal process of satisfying planning, zoning and drainage requirements, and potentially of receiving input from Clarkstown.
The condos would be in the $450,000 to $500,000 range, targeted at young families and empty nesters looking to downsize, Supervisor Chris Day said.
"I wouldn't say I'm in favor of if, I would say I'm open to it being considered," Day said Wednesday. The supervisor said each of the uses now permitted on the two parcels presented risks.
"The question ends up being what's the best option that has the least risk," Day said.
Fran Oldenburger, who lives about a mile and a half from the property, opposes the development because of the loss of open space, as well as concerns about preserving the footprints "because they're irreplaceable."
Saving the footprints fits in perfectly with the town's motto — "rich in history" — she said.
Familiar footsteps For Elayne Armaniaco, who has lived several houses away from the property since 1988, the specter of development creeping into the neighborhood is nothing new.
In 2000, she was part of the Greenbush Road Coalition, which successfully sued to keep a car dealership from being parked on the same stretch of land.
John Palladino, who owned the land at that time, sold it to Rathmagurry Realty in 2016 for $850,000, according to the deed on file with the county clerk.
Armaniaco, now chairwoman of the 100-member Greenbush Neighborhood Coalition, contends Brodsky's proposal is too dense, and she wants the number of units scaled back but would prefer the single-family zoning be retained. She also wants the exposed bedrock where other footprints may be discovered to be protected from excavation.
"At first I was excited that it was a residential proposal and I was excited to see that the developer wanted to leave some of the property as open space," she said. "But the more you look at the proposal you see that it's way too dense ... the density is frightening."
Armaniaco said coalition members have diverging opinions, with some wanting the land to remain as open space, others preferring the zoning to remain unchanged, and still others who are amenable to compromise.
She said the state has no criteria to protect dinosaur fossils but urged the town to see if the entire parcel can be preserved through a purchase by the Open Space Institute.
However, Armaniaco said it sounded like Day and other officials had made up their minds.
"It feels like the Town Board wants to move forward with this," she said.
Fossils fuel controversy Locating the fossils Olsen discovered would present a stiff challenge; the area is overgrown and he said the impressions are only visible when the light is optimal. Wooden stakes with notices about the public hearing now border the parcel, which ends near the Fesco Fence property.
Olsen, now 66 years old and a member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, doesn't have an opinion about whether condo owners should be living alongside the prehistoric artifacts.
"I'm sympathetic to the people who want open space and I'm sympathetic to the landowner who wants to do something with it," he said. "Both sides have valid ideas for what should be done with the land."
But Olsen said Brodsky's plans showed "a first-class effort to preserve the footprints."
He added: "I would work with the contractor and I would visit the site. When I would visit the site I would keep track of what is pulled out. I have every confidence we'd see some interesting things."
The paleontologist said that having the fossils surface once again in the crosshairs of a development controversy was "deja vu all over again, it definitely is. I kind of expect it. This is not an easy parcel to develop."

Texto completo: President Trump may be the only member of his family to win major elected office, but his campaign manager for the 2020 re-election effort is already envisioning a family political dynasty that will outlast his time in the White House.
The comments by Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, on Saturday were instantly scrutinized for clues as to whether the president's children, some of whom have been seen by friends and supporters as potential candidates for office, were planning their own political futures.
Mr. Parscale made the remarks at a California Republican convention in Indian Wells, in a speech that touched on the party and the presidency. "The Trumps will be a dynasty that lasts for decades," Mr. Parscale said.
Asked to explain what that meant, he told reporters in California that he views the Trump family as people with "amazing capabilities."
"I think you see that from Don Jr. I think you see that from Ivanka. You see it from Jared. You see it from all," he said, referring to the president's eldest son, eldest daughter and son-in-law.
Mr. Parscale declined to comment to The New York Times. But a campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and without official authorization to discuss the speech, said that Mr. Parscale was referring less to possible candidacies in the future and more to activities such as political speeches and fund-raising.
The president and his family have worked aggressively to marginalize or mute whatever anti-Trump sentiment has remained within the national Republican Party. Whether that influence remains once he is out of office -- and whether the party reverts to its former shape or adopts a new one -- remains an open question.
Longtime supporters of Mr. Trump noted that he and some in his family tended to crave flattery, particularly in public settings, and they chalked up the "dynasty" remark from Mr. Parscale to puffery.
Privately, some Republicans -- who did not want to publicly fight with the president's campaign manager -- dismissed Mr. Parscale's choice of words, noting that the concept of dynastic politics was harmful to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and that it is not a concept historically favored by populists.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's elder son and the member of the family who is most naturally fluent in the language of the Republican base, has frequently been mentioned as a possible candidate for office.
In an interview with The New York Times last fall, as he barnstormed for Republican candidates in the midterm elections, the younger Mr. Trump said of a possible campaign down the road: "Right now, I'm focused on other things, but you never know. I love the intensity of campaigning. I love aspects of the fight. I don't know how much I would love aspects of the actual job yet."
A person close to the younger Mr. Trump said he "currently has zero interest in running for office" and that his sole political focus is his father's campaign next year. Still, the person added that while the younger Mr. Trump does not expect to be a candidate himself, he anticipates being involved in Republican politics "for many years to come."
Ivanka Trump, the president's elder daughter, is also seen by West Wing aides and people who have worked with the family as harboring ambitions of her own for elected office. People close to her insist that she has never discussed it, although some of her friends, in private conversations, have been open about the prospect that they see her as a future presidential candidate.
"If she ever wanted to run for president," Mr. Trump told The Atlantic in a recent interview, "I think she'd be very, very hard to beat."
Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, who is actively involved in his re-election campaign, is also mentioned as a possible candidate by some close to the family.
Such comments make clear that the Trump family hopes to extend its influence into the future. And the remarks touched on two lingering questions about the future of the Trumps: Will any of the president's children run for office, and will he fade quietly if he loses in 2020, or finishes a second term in 2024?
Even if no other Trump tries to run a campaign, advisers to Mr. Trump believe he will remain active -- on his Twitter feed, in television interviews and potentially at political events of his own.
Few believe he is going to cede the spotlight easily, or follow previous presidents in laying low after leaving office.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Headnote 23 relatives of actor Sidney Poitier feared missing in the Bahamas
In the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, which left the Bahamas splintered and overcome with flooding, one prominent family with extensive connections in the islands has spent a week trying to account for missing relatives - and to maintain hope.
More than 500 Bahamians belong to the extended family of Sidney Poitier, the acclaimed actor who was born in Miami of Bahamian parents and was raised in the islands, according to Jeffrey Poitier, a nephew.
Jeffrey Poitier said that at least 23 relatives were still unaccounted for on Thursday, including his sister Barbara and her grown children in Freeport.
"We haven't been able to find any of them, nor have we heard from any of them," Poitier, 66, said in a phone interview from the Bahamas on Thursday. "We are still looking and hoping that they surface as soon as possible. It's got us all worried."
The storm, which was moving up the East Coast of the United States on Thursday, made landfall in the islands last Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane, one of the most powerful ever recorded. And then it lingered for days, turning houses into matchsticks and damaging airports and a public hospital. At least 30 people in the islands have been confirmed dead.
Jeffery Poitier, who is also an actor and who splits his time between New Orleans and Cat Island in the Bahamas, said that he had tried calling his sister repeatedly without an answer. He hoped to fly to the Freeport area by helicopter later on Thursday to search for her himself.
"It's been very discouraging, very disappointing and very stressful," he said.
He said he would have to return to Nassau by Friday for the planned funeral of another uncle, Reginald Poitier, a family patriarch who died last month in his late 90s. "We are all here to support one another in both tragedies," he said.
The Poitier family's roots in the Bahamas go back generations. Sidney Poitier, 92, grew up on Cat Island and later rose to fame as a boundary-breaking leading man on Broadway and in Hollywood. He was the first Black actor to win an Academy Award for best actor for "Lilies of the Field" (1963).
Another relative, Kimberly Poitier, said she had been searching for family members from her home in Tampa, Florida, and had sent out a group message hoping to account for relatives in the Bahamas.
She said she had gotten in touch with a family of cousins who had escaped by boat from flooding in Freeport, including a woman named Barbara. For a brief moment, the family tried to figure out whether that could be Jeffrey Poitier's sister.
But after seeing a photo, Jeffery Poitier said in a text message that his sister was still unaccounted for. "It's someone different," he said.

LUNG-DISEASE SURGE BLOWS SMOKE ON SAFETY OF E-CIGARETTES

Texto completo: Tobacco ads have been banned from TV for about 50 years. But not e-cigarette products, which can still be marketed as a "safe tobacco alternative."
The surge in cases of vaping-related lung illness demands that the ban should be extended to e-cigarettes. California and the nation should also follow the lead of Contra Costa, Santa Clara, San Francisco and San Mateo counties and ban flavored e-cigarettes and consider outlawing vaping altogether.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it is investigating 450 cases of vaping-related lung illnesses in 33 states, including at leastfour deaths. The doctor who is leading the CDC's investigation, Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman, told The New York Times, "While this investigation is ongoing, people should consider not using e-cigarette products."
No kidding.
Federal officials remain perplexed by what is causing the illnesses, although Meaney-Delman said the CDC believes that a chemical of some kind is involved. E-cigarettes emit as many as 10 toxins.
Doctors are dismayed that the median age of patients afflicted with vaping-related lung diseases in Illinois and Wisconsin is 19. The Illinois Department of Public Health noted that a majority of those cases involve users who had vaped a product containing THC, the primary ingredient of marijuana.
E-cigarette firms continue to claim that they do not market their products to minors. We would be more inclined to believe them if some didn't continue to offer fruity and sweet-flavored products in stores. The bottom line is young children and teenagers are picking up the habit in increasing numbers.
The surgeon general reports that across the nation, 1 in every 5 high school students and 1 in every 20 middle school students use e-cigarettes. The California Public Health Department notes that 84% of high school students using tobacco do so by smoking flavored tobacco products.
A recent study of Santa Clara County teens found that nearly 1 in 3 31.6% say that they have used an e-cigarette at least once. It's especially notable that more than 2 in 5 teens 45.4% reported purchasing their own e-cigarettes, with over a quarter of this group saying they buy them directly from a local store.
The survey said that among those who purchased e-cigarettes in a local store, 62.5% purchased them at a vape shop. That's illegal in California. The state prohibited the sale of e-cigarettes to minors in 2010.
State Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, introduced a bill in the Legislature earlier this year that would have outlawed the sale of flavored tobacco products in California stores and vending machines. But intense lobbying by the tobacco industry forced Hill to withdraw his bill rather than accept amendments that would have made the legislation ineffective.
More than 20 countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, the Philippines and Indonesia, already ban vaping. Australia, Japan and India all have some form of restrictions on the sale of e-cigarettes. The recent outbreak of lung diseases related to vaping demands that state and federal officials restrict advertising of e-cigarette products and consider a total ban of their sale.

Seditious conspiracy and other Obama administration parlor games

Texto completo: The trickle of information just now beginning to be made public by the Inspector General of the Justice Department, Michael Horowitz, provides a glimpse into the mind of former FBI Director James Comey and the methods he used to further a seditious conspiracy among Obama administration holdovers and other deep-state actors.
“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”
The IG’s report is no bombshell reading, but it is an important first step in unraveling the most serious political criminal acts, which are ongoing to this day, in American history. This trickle should become a deluge as the IG finishes and releases the next report outlining abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and court procedures used by the Obama administration’s DOJ/FBI, which illegally surveilled American citizens for the clear purpose of undermining a political opponent, and when that failed, attempted to depose a duly elected president.
Watergate does not even rise to kindergarten level compared to this cabal.
Despite Comey’s self-imposed halo, the IG’s investigators found many egregiously dishonest actions taken by Comey during the period of January through April in 2017. This period was the narrow focus of their investigation; the production of memorandums “memorializing” his meetings with president-elect, and then (after inauguration) President Trump, the leaking of certain memos to outside persons, the concealment/retention of same, and once they were discovered at his residence, the specious declaration that these memos were his personal property.
The press release by the Inspector General’s Office outlines the findings in greatly simplified terms. “As described in today’s report, the OIG concluded that the memos were official FBI records. The OIG determined that Comey violated applicable policies and his FBI Employment Agreement by providing one of the unclassified memos that contained official FBI information, including sensitive investigative information, to his friend with instructions for the friend to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.
“Additionally, the OIG determined that Comey, while FBI Director, kept copies of four of the seven memos in a personal safe at his home and, after his removal as FBI Director, violated FBI policies and his FBI Employment Agreement by failing to notify the FBI that he had retained them, or to seek authorization to retain them. Comey likewise violated applicable policies and his FBI Employment Agreement by providing copies, following his removal as FBI Director, of the four memos he had kept in his home to his three private attorneys without FBI authorization. Comey also failed to fulfill his obligation to immediately alert the FBI about his disclosures to his private attorneys once he became aware that the FBI, after Comey’s removal, had determined that one of the memos included several words, the names of foreign countries being discussed by the President, that were classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level.”
The report itself is quite useful as one can easily see the self-serving CYA efforts made by all these FBI and DOJ apparatchiks in answering the questions that must have put before them by the IG’s investigators. They turn into pretzels trying to recall who had what memo copies when, where they put them or sent them, or even who had them to start with. Recognize a few here? Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, James Rybicki, E.W. Priestap, Sally Yates, Andrew McCabe. They all (and many more) had their hands on copies of the memos being investigated, mostly it seems by way of figuring out ways of disseminating the self-serving opinions of James Comey found therein to others within their orbit.
National Security Adviser Susan Rice, in her last 15 minutes in the White House on Jan. 20, 2017, thoughtfully memorialized a Jan. 5 meeting by emailing herself a memo (“reminding” herself) that along with her, the following people attended the meeting with President Obama; FBI Director James Comey, NSA director Michael Rogers, CIA Director John Brennan, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Vice President Joe Biden, and Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.
President Obama asked Rice, Comey and Yates to stay after the others left, ostensibly to tell these DOJ/FBI grandees that they were to handle this Russian collusion “investigation” into the Trump administration “by the book.”
If there has ever been a more transparent example of covering-your-ass for the future it has not been exposed yet.
It took Acting AG Sally Yates less than two weeks to make claims that the new National Security Adviser General Mike Flynn was “compromised” by the Russians. This was on the basis that she had knowledge of an illegally leaked transcript of an NSA/CIA phone call intercept in which Flynn, following protocol for a new administration, was speaking with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador.
This in a way started the Russia-hoax ball rolling, culminating in Comey having a nightmare that woke him up in the middle of the night with the intuition that in order to save the “nation” he must leak a memo to the New York Times.
Two years later we are just beginning to see who the real criminals are, and they are mostly at the top levels of the deep-state.

Texto completo: TAIPEI, Taiwan - If the United States gets embroiled in a war with China, it may begin with the lights going out here in Taipei.
Tensions are rising across the Taiwan Strait, and there's a growing concern among some security experts that Chinese President Xi Jinping might act recklessly toward Taiwan in the next few years, drawing the United States into a conflict.
Xi's hard line toward Hong Kong is alarming Taiwanese and further reducing the chance, if there ever was any, of a peaceful unification of China. China seems to be abandoning its effort to win hearts and minds on Taiwan, and it has steadily improved military capabilities - thus prompting the fear that Xi might eventually use them.
"We are very concerned," Taiwan's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, told me. He said that one concern was that a slowing economy and other troubles in China might lead Xi to make trouble for Taiwan as a distraction. "This is the scenario that is constantly playing in the minds of the key decision-makers" on Taiwan, he said.
The main worry of military planners here isn't so much a full-scale amphibious invasion. Rather, they fear the mainland sowing chaos and disrupting the economy as a way of trying to bring Taiwan to heel.
Hence the concern about a cyberattack that would take out Taipei's electric grid. Or sabotage of the underwater cables that bring data and internet to Taiwan. Or interference in the South China Sea with tankers carrying oil to Taiwan.
Wu added that China could also step up military pressure by increasing patrols in the area, or by holding military exercises. Even a partial blockade would have a substantial impact if it raised insurance costs and damaged confidence in the island's future.
Government officials in Taiwan were cagey about how they would respond to provocations in cyber and other realms, but Wu said that military officials "are planning for defense and offense." Another senior government official said that retaliation could include airstrikes on China's Fujian province.
That fits with the belief that Taiwan would promptly escalate to bring the war to China. If that happens, no one knows quite what the U.S. would do, including the U.S. itself. A 1979 American law suggests that the United States is committed to Taiwan's defense, but the law is ambiguous about just how committed.
China has been vastly improving its military capabilities, including its ability to strike aircraft carriers. I'm told that in 18 of the last 18 Pentagon war games involving China in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. lost. Still, that can be misleading, because the war games are much more limited than real life would be. For example, the United States could interrupt China's oil supplies from the gulf.
Beijing has also been nibbling away at Taiwan's international presence, blocking it from participating in the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies, and even barring Taiwanese from taking tours of the U.N. and Taiwanese journalists from getting U.N. accreditation.
President Donald Trump has generally been more supportive of Taiwan than his predecessors, and that's worked well so far. But this has to be done very carefully. While Taiwan and China may know each other's red lines, I worry that American politicians may try to help Taiwan in ways that increase the risk of triggering a crisis. Nothing can be so dangerous as a well-meaning American.
Aside from its efforts to isolate Taiwan, China also appears to be borrowing from the Russian playbook and using Facebook and other platforms to interfere with Taiwan's democracy in the run-up to crucial elections in January.
"China is trying to discredit and dismantle Taiwan democracy," said Ketty Chen of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.
A war between the United States and China over Taiwan would be a cataclysm. But it would also be a catastrophe if Taiwan were blockaded or squashed into submission, because it is a pillar of technology (the source of more than 90% of the most advanced computer chips), a pillar of democracy and an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" standing in the way of any Chinese projection into the Pacific or toward, say, Okinawa.
There are steps the U.S. can take that might reduce the risk of a crisis. Washington can emphasize to Beijing that Taiwan will not take any unilateral action, such as declaring itself an independent country - unless China makes a military move, in which case it will do so at once. The U.S. can also caution Beijing that if the electricity goes out in Taipei, the same may happen in Shanghai, and that if Taiwan-bound ships are harassed, they may be reflagged as American vessels.
But that means thinking through what might happen in the next few years and making clear to Xi that he will pay an extremely high price if he messes with Taiwan's freedom.

Texto completo: In prisoner swap, Russia and Ukraine fly 35 each to freedom
MOSCOW -- Russia and Ukraine conducted a major prisoner exchange that freed 35 people detained in each country and flew them to the other, a deal that could help advance Russia-Ukraine relations and end five years of fighting in Ukraine's east.
The trade involved some of the highest-profile prisoners caught up in a bitter standoff between Ukraine and Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy greeted the freed prisoners as they stepped down from the airplane that had brought them from Moscow to Kyiv's Boryspil airport. Relatives waiting on the tarmac surged forward to hug their loved ones.
Among those Russia returned was Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, whose conviction for preparing terrorist attacks was denounced abroad, and 24 Ukrainian sailors taken with a ship the Russian navy seized last year.
"Hell has ended; everyone is alive and that is the main thing," Vyacheslav Zinchenko, 30, one of the released sailors, said.
The prisoners released by Ukraine included Volodymyr Tsemakh, who commanded a separatist rebel air defense unit in the area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysian airliner was shot down in 2014, killing 298 people aboard.
Critics saw freeing Tsemakh as an act of submissiveness to Russia, but the exchange "allows Zelenskiy to fulfill one of his main pre-election promises," Ukrainian analyst Vadim Karasev told The Associated Press.
Zelenskiy has promised new initiatives to resolve the war in eastern Ukraine between government troops and the separatist rebels.

Director of MIT's Media Lab steps down over Epstein ties
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The director of a prestigious research lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology resigned Saturday following uproar over his financial ties with financier Jeffrey Epstein, The New York Times reported Saturday.
Ito's resignation comes after The New Yorker reported that the Media Lab tried to conceal the extent of its fundraising relationship with Epstein.
Rafael Reif, MIT's president, said last month that the university took $800,000 from Epstein over 20 years. Epstein also reportedly arranged $7.5 million in donations.
On Saturday, Reif ordered an independent probe. Two researchers had resigned over news the lab and Ito took money from Epstein after he did time a decade ago for sex offenses with young girls.
Epstein killed himself last month while awaiting his sex trafficking trial.

In new blow, Cabinet minister quits Johnson's government
LONDON -- A British Cabinet minister has quit Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, saying she disagrees with his Brexit strategy.
Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd's resignation comes days after the prime minister's brother Jo Johnson also quit the government over Brexit.
Rudd said she could not "stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled."
Just last week Johnson kicked 21 lawmakers out of the Conservative group in Parliament after they sided with the opposition to pass a law designed to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a divorce deal.
Rudd told the Sunday Times she will sit as an independent.
Johnson says Britain must leave the EU Oct. 31 even if there is no deal.

Hundreds march against first Bosnian LGBT pride parade
SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Several hundred people marched in Bosnia's capital Saturday to show their disapproval of a weekend LGBT pride parade that will be the country's first.
A pride parade is scheduled for Sunday in Sarajevo, the only capital city in the Balkans that hasn't hosted one yet. U.S. and European Union officials working in Bosnia have expressed support.
Participants in the protest march said they wanted to promote what conservatives call "traditional family values."
They held banners and balloons, and the march ended without requiring police attention.
But Bosnian police have called for reinforcements at Sunday's parade. They worry Muslim and soccer hooligan groups with strong anti-gay views may try to disrupt the event.

Trump says he killed secret meeting with Taliban
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had canceled a previously-undisclosed summit at Camp David with Taliban leadership and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani after the Taliban took responsibility for an attack last week that killed a U.S. soldier.
The abrupt disclosure appeared to deal a significant blow to the ongoing peace talks between the United States and the Taliban, as Trump said in tweets Saturday evening that he has "called off peace negotiations" and accused the Taliban of perpetrating the attacks to strengthen their negotiating hand.
The Thursday morning car bombing that the Taliban claimed responsibility for came just days after the top U.S. negotiator in the ongoing peace talks with the Taliban had announced that he had reached a deal "in principle."

Hong Kong police manage to thwart airport protest
HONG KONG -- Hong Kong police thwarted another disruption at the airport by pro-democracy activists but had to battle protesters at subway stations Saturday, as the months-long unrest showed no signs of abating even after the government offered a concession days earlier.
Police mounted road checks and inspected passengers on trains and buses heading to the airport to weed out protesters.
Hong Kong's airport, the world's eighth busiest, has been a frequent target during a summer of protests sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced Wednesday that her government would withdraw the bill, but that failed to appease protesters.

In Zimbabwe: Former Presient Robert Mugabe will be buried at a hilltop shrine reserved exclusively for Zimbabwe's ruling elite, an official said Saturday, as the southern African nation began several days of official mourning.
Mugabe, who was 95 when he died Friday in Singapore, will be laid to rest in Harare at the National Heroes Acre, which has been set aside for Zimbabweans who have made huge sacrifices during the war against white-minority rule and who dedicated themselves to the nation, which emerged from the ashes of colonial Rhodesia.
Leo Mugabe, a nephew of Robert Mugabe, said the date of the funeral and other details weren't yet available.

Texto completo: When other car manufacturers said a low cost, high volume vehicle couldn't be made, Henry Ford asked what conditions would need to change in order for that to actually happen.
For decades, transportation experts and city planners who studied traffic congestion in major cities came to the conclusion that not much could be done to improve gridlock.
Based on available street widths, speed limits and other constraints, they were correct.
But Elon Musk approached the problem in a completely different manner.
Instead of reaching a dead end through traditional thinking, he asked a different question: What would need to happen to solve urban traffic?
Rather than looking at the world in the way it currently existed, he chose to examine the necessary conditions needed to reach the desired outcome.
This approach led to The Boring Company, a business Musk founded that creates massive underground transportation tunnels with the aim of eradicating the traffic problem that bedevils millions of us each day.
Musk refused to accept that something couldn't be done, focusing his attention instead on what would need to happen to actually do it.
The same thinking has led to nearly every major breakthrough, from the toaster oven to the connected computer.
When other car manufacturers said a low cost, high volume vehicle couldn't be made, Henry Ford asked what conditions would need to change in order for that to actually happen. That exact question led to his assembly line breakthrough.
Refuse to accept limitations While most people accept limitations as fixed and immovable, history makers take the opposite approach.
The only thing they view as fixed is the desired outcome — from launching groundbreaking companies to curing disease to solving desperately needed humanitarian challenges.
With their goal in sight, they next ask an incredibly powerful question: What conditions would need to occur in order to win?
The same logic can apply to each of us on a smaller scale.
Instead of saying the quarterly sales target is impossible, why not ask the same powerful question: What conditions would need to change in order to achieve it? Maybe you'd need to add sales people, run additional marketing, or offer customer discounts. Let's leave the goal in place and then reverse-engineer how to conquer it.
Each of us can make history in our own way by leveraging the approach of legends. Instead of defaulting to NO or CAN'T, challenge yourself and your team to ask what would need to happen to make the impossible possible.
As you hunt down challenges and seize opportunities, reject traditional limitations and deploy your curiosity instead. "What would need to happen to make it so?" can be your secret weapon to achieve where others have fallen short.
If you're willing to get creative, you'll find a way to succeed where most people stumble.

Texto completo: The beautiful woman in a Vogue advertisement looks at the camera with a steady smile. What's unusual about the picture is that the model is middle-aged, and her hair is silver.
The smile - and the hair - belong to Lillian Marcuson Rekas, who became one of the top high fashion models in her teens and then had a second act, modeling into her 70s.
Lillian Marcuson Rekas, a resident of West Hartford, died May 24 of complications of dementia. She was 90.
Rekas was the daughter of Anna and Arvid Marcuson, both born in Sweden, who owned the Viking Bakery in West Hartford, which was known for its Swedish limpa bread, flavored with orange and anise.
After boarding school in Rochester, N.Y., Lillian was searching for work. Quarrels with her mother made her expand her job search to New York City, where she was considering working as a door-to-door salesperson for the Fuller Brush Co. Instead, in a New York repeat of the discovery of Lana Turner at a Hollywood soda fountain, Rekas was spotted on the street by Jerry Ford, co-owner of the renowned Ford Modeling Agency. He asked her to come in and be photographed. She was 18.
Rekas obliged, and after a short stint with another agency, she ended up as a Ford model. Tall - 5 feet 7 - 110 pounds, blue eyed, with brunette hair, she was said to look like Grace Kelly, who had gone from movie stardom to royalty in the tiny kingdom of Monaco. (Predictably, Rekas was told to lose 20 pounds.) Though terrified of Eileen Ford, the agency's co-owner, she preferred Ford because they paid more and took better care of their models.
Soon, Rekas was on her way to Paris, in the first wave of American models to show off designer Christian Dior's "New Look." It featured tiny pinched-in waists and long flowing skirts, reflecting the fashion world's resurgence after wartime fabric shortages, and a return of elegance and fine fabrics. Her picture appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine. It was 1949.
"Lillian went as a model, but came back as a star," said Patty Sicular, who became her Ford agent and now owns the modeling agency "Iconic Focus."
Rekas was soon sought after not only by designers and fashion magazines, but by advertisers, including Revlon, Coty, Pepsodent, Brooks Brothers and Knickerbocker beer. She was on the cover of Life Magazine three times and appeared on covers of Vogue, Charm, Bride, Cosmopolitan and Look. She lived in an apartment with a cousin, who was also a model, but she occasionally lived with the Fords, along with other models. The rules were strict, and young men were carefully scrutinized. "She was a mother hen," Rekas told the New York Times after Eileen Ford died.
Hollywood came calling, but Rekas' response was negative. The producer/director David O. Selznick flew her to California to give her a screen test, but he kept her waiting, and Rekas walked out on him. Nevertheless, "she had dozens of movie offers and turned them all down - said she couldn't remember lines," said her daughter Patty Hafey.
One morning when Rekas was back in West Hartford, she ate at A.C. Peterson's, and the busboy spotted the beautiful young woman. Joe Rekas was smitten and told his friend that he planned to marry her. He eventually did, and enthusiastically supported her lucrative modeling career, even moving to New York to care for their first-born child while she worked.
Rekas would go on "go-sees" with all the famous fashion photographers of the era: Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Irving Penn, Milton Greene, Horst P. Horst. They would look her over and see if she fit their concept of the shoot. "She was easy to work with. She knew how to move. She was nice," said Sicular. On a shoot, Rekas would do her own hair and makeup.
"She enjoyed the money and the fame," said her daughter, who recalls that her mother's annual income at its peak was $25,000 - a considerable amount 70 years ago. A day's work paid $1,500, with 10 percent going to the agency.
The arrival of a second child ended Rekas' career - for the next few decades. The family settled in West Hartford, where Joe Rekas owned an office supply store. Lillian's life revolved around her family and her three children. She dressed simply and wore no makeup unless she was going out. She did love clothes, however. "She would go on a shopping spree and come home, and my father would say, 'Lil, we can't afford it.' And she would return it, and return and say, 'I just saved so much money," said Hafey.
After her three children were grown, Rekas decided she would try to re-enter the profession she had left 25 years earlier. She was 52, too old for many modeling agencies. But Ford had decided to enter the "older" modeling universe, and Sicular, who was a vice president at Ford, became Rekas' agent.
Ford wanted to ramp up its stable of older models, which was "a mish mosh," Sicular said. "No one wanted to be there. It was less money, little respect ... a dumping ground for girlfriends. Ford wanted their older models to have the same cachet as younger ones and held out for good assignments. Rekas became one of 14 models over 35 in Ford's Classic Women division. "With my older models, they never played characters; they were fashion and beauty, not Mrs. Santa Claus."
Rekas' first job on her return to work was an assignment for Viking Cruise lines, where they also hired her husband. After that, she continued to model. (She was asked to lose 7 pounds, according to a news article, and was a perfect size 8.) She was turned down for a few jobs: Advertisers thought her "too sophisticated" to be shown mopping the floor of a boat - to which she responded: They should see me wash my kitchen floor. She lost another job advertising dental adhesives because she was "too pretty." She continued to model into her 70s. "She aged beautifully. No plastic surgery," said Sicular. "She was beautiful because she was happy."
Different fashion assignments came her way, and she appeared in television and was on the cover of Newsweek, but there was still a reluctance to use older women in high fashion shoots. "We still haven't broken the barrier," she told the Christian Science Monitor in 1983.
She played small roles in "Ghostbusters" and "Cotton Club," and in several soap operas, "One Life to Live" and "As the World Turns," but her indifference to acting had not changed, and she turned down other offers. Her husband died in 1991, and a brief marriage to Conrad Kronholm ended in divorce.
Rekas is survived by her daughter, Patricia Hafey, her sons, Gary and Robert, five grandchildren, one great-grandchild, and a brother, Paul Marcuson.

Texto completo: A few months ago, I met someone who did not have an Instagram account but who nevertheless snaps smartphone photos of every meal he eats in a restaurant.
"I use it like a diary. It's like a little screenshot of my life," he told me, swiping through images of bygone falafels and fillets. "Sometimes I also use it to remember a dish I liked someplace so I can order it again ... if they still make it. But a lot of places change too fast for that to work."
Often, reinvention is a good thing, especially when it takes the form of an intentional, seasonal response to whatever local producers unload at a restaurant's back door. This works best when the chef in question has a firm sense of concept and direction for the restaurant, reinterpreting that theme with fresh ingredients.
Other times, change chooses you. You might not even be aware it is happening - like that friend who moves into a house with a group of Australians, then makes you cringe when he can't stop referring to everyone as "mate."
Both species of change are afoot at Gather.
Now 7 years old, the Yarmouth restaurant remains committed to its goal of sourcing the lion's share of its food locally.
"We shoot for two-thirds of our kitchen dollars to be spent within a day's drive," head chef Colin Kelly said. "So we have to build a new menu four or five times a year. All the staff sits down with Matt (Chappell, Gather's owner), and it's pretty cooperative."
Late summer is when seasonal reinvention should be easiest. Not only are nearby farms erupting with produce, but Gather even allows locals to bring in surplus from their home gardens to swap it for credit at the restaurant. August and September should be the restaurant's farm-to-table victory lap.
And a few dishes do capture the essence of this time of year, at least in their conception. The frilly watercress and fennel salad ($15) is a peppery, powerfully herby, vegan take on a Green Goddess salad. Shelled peas, slick shavings of fennel bulb and toasted hazelnuts lend texture to this bountiful tangle of green on green on green. In the background - probably a bit too far in the background - a vinaigrette of olive oil, English mustard powder, thyme and tarragon dances.
In another, Kelly's team liberates charred kernels of Maine corn from their cobs, blending them with cheddar cheese and cornmeal to form a dense hush puppy batter. However, because sugar gets replaced by Maine maple syrup, Gather's hush puppies ($9) brown beautifully but do not remain crisp. Diners are left with a choice: Either eat them when their interior is hotter than magma or learn to love soggy hush puppies.
In a three-and-a-half-star review of Gather five years ago, our then-critic described being charmed by the converted Masonic lodge's rustic dÃ©cor and its most prominent feature: an 18-seat communal table that extends down the equator of the dining room. Then, as today, the homey, inviting space was among the restaurant's biggest assets.
In 2014, Gather had also recently been granted a full liquor license. Five years on, its wine and cocktail menus, both overseen by bar and front-of-house manager Dylan Suagee, are eclectic and whimsical. With several well-executed Mexican and Southwestern-influenced cocktails like the tequila-and-Campari-fueled Ruby Dee ($12), a honey margarita ($12) and an espresso-and-horchata martini ($12), the bar signals its confidence clearly, even if it is a bit disconnected from the rest of the restaurant.
Give it time, though. If recent shifts are any indication, the two might yet converge.
That's because another creeping change underfoot at Gather is a shift in its culinary focus. Glance at one of the early menus put together by former chef Chad Conley (Rose Foods, Palace Diner), and you might be tempted to describe Gather as a Maine reboot of California cuisine: an acutely seasonal restaurant that draws inspiration from classic European (mainly French and Italian) cooking.
After a few dozen seasonal menu rewrites, however, Gather's North Star seems to have taken a detour in the night sky. It's not a complete overhaul, but today, you're just as likely to walk in to find an old friend eating a bowl of Maine seafood bouillabaisse ($24) as tucking into a "banh mi" pizza ($14).
"I don't know if you'd call it eclecticism," Chappell said. "That might be possible, but it's not conscious. It rolls more in flavor profiles than anything else. Sometimes we'll go off in more of an Italian direction; sometimes it's a little more Asian. But I like to let the kitchen be creative and try new things. It's the lifeblood of the kitchen; without that, you're going to get pretty bored."
Casco Bay fish tacos ($17) certainly spice things up, literally and figuratively. The crisp-fried local haddock chunks are a great match for a fiery Sriracha mayo that made my dinner guest's eyes widen in surprise as he finished his first bite. Or he may have been reacting to the flat-top-toasted Tortilleria Pachanga corn tortilla which had gone so stiff and stale, I could have played it at 45 rpm.
Contrast that with the consistency of the unpleasantly runny horchata custard ($9), a (barely) cornstarch-thickened, gluten-and-dairy-free pudding that tasted mostly of sugar and looked like a hazelnut-topped medical sample.
But nothing prepared me for the Maine lobster ramen. At $29, it was one of the most expensive entrÃ©es on the menu, a dish our genial, yet absent-minded server described as "like nothing I've ever tasted." Make that two of us. Once an apprentice to a Southern Italian chef who taught him to make pasta, Kelly knows his way around a house-made noodle. Thanks to a home-brewed bicarbonate concoction, his whole-wheat ramen are bouncy and curled, precisely as they should be.
Other components look the part, from a rose fashioned from strips of pickled carrot to a jammy-yolked hard-boiled egg marinated in soy and mirin.
Yet once the duo of stocks - dashi and a bizarre lobster stock made pho-style with charred ginger and garlic - hits a smear of soy-lime tare on the bottom of the bowl, things go sideways in a hurry. The resulting broth is too acidic, with tarry overtones from the singed aromatics and almost none of the savory, umami richness of a classic ramen soup.
"Sorry, no chopsticks left," my server announced when she set the bowl down in front of me. "Do you need a fork, or is that (soup) spoon OK?" I silently wondered if she had ever eaten ramen before, then agreed to take a fork. With it, I fished out the still-chilly lobster claw and knuckle meat, a few forkfuls of the noodles, and forlornly left the majority of my $29 in the bowl.
What I did then will come as no surprise to anyone who has tasted Gather's pizza. I reached into the doggy bag containing the Tns of my appetizer order of cauliflower and mushroom pizza ($14) and pulled out a still-warm slice to tide me over.
Pizzas have quietly turned into Gather's signature dish, regardless of occasional stumbles elsewhere when its kitchen ventures into territory it is not equipped to navigate.
Before he came to the restaurant as a line cook in 2013, Kelly was trained on the wood-fired pizza ovens of Bonobo in Portland's West End. In Yarmouth, with a less temperamental deck oven set to "Inferno," he creates a fantastically blistered, chewy crust that can withstand wet toppings like dollops of mascarpone drizzled with orange juice and truffle oil, as well as dry ones like par-cooked cauliflower and roasted North Spore maitake and king trumpet mushrooms.
Did I mention they're gorgeous, too? I snapped a photo of the fragrant pie the second our server set it down (and retreated to bring us the silverware she forgot). But I didn't post it on social media. I'll hang on to this one to help jog my memory the next time I visit Yarmouth.

What a home is worth

Texto completo: For the Valley News
One of my consistent pleasures through the years has been to meander through the Valley News real estate section on Saturday. It’s been a way to follow the market and also dream of what might have been: There I am, atop a tractor, like a country squire on my 25 delightful acres in Thetford. Or hermiting like Henry David Thoreau in a cute and cozy cabin in Canaan, where I can think deep thoughts about truth, beauty and the Red Sox.
After three-plus decades in the Upper Valley, I have put aside dreams of country life and recognized that our little West Lebanon bungalow suits us perfectly fine. We have friendly neighbors with whom we regularly communicate face to face, not via text or through lawyers. For many years I commuted two miles to work. Two miles! A traffic jam was when someone held me up for 30 seconds taking a left into Dunkin’ Donuts.
Of late I have been taking notice of the proliferation of million-dollar homes in the Saturday ads. There are usually a couple each week, and sometimes four or five. They look fabulous, but I reveal my pedestrian outlook when I think, That’s a lot of house to clean!
On a real estate website this week I spied these asking prices: $1.75 million in Sharon, $2.5 million in Lebanon, $2.95 million in Barnard, $4.9 million in Hanover, a cool $5.5 million in Woodstock. Allow me to make this observation: Yowza!
Years ago you had to buy the Sunday New York Times to glimpse such offerings. I assumed the ads were aimed at titans of industry or other holders of old money.
Now million-dollar homes are in our own backyards. Not my particular backyard, next to the rusty metal shed that holds our snow tires and an impressive backup supply of lawn chairs. I could sell my home for a million bucks only if the sale included $750,000 in gold bullion. For fun, I would bury it in the yard, perhaps near the tires — which I would toss in for free.
Curiously, I’ve seen several Upper Valley homes recently listed for $995,000. I can’t help but think, C'mon, throw in a nearly-rust-free 2008 Toyota Corolla with 129,000 miles in that six-bay garage and make it a million. But I suppose people who live in million-dollar homes drive Camrys at a minimum. I bet they spring for heated seats, too. Chilly cheeks are so proletarian.
The wave of million-dollar homes hit other markets long before it reached here. San Francisco is rotten with them; reportedly four in five homes in the City by the Bay are worth that much. There are million-dollar mobile homes in Malibu, Calif. — location, location, location.
According to a USA Today story that ran late last year, “The number of U.S. homes valued at $1 million or more increased by 400,702 this year, the largest annual rise since the housing price recovery began in 2012.”
The real estate research firm Trulia has reported that the share of homes valued at more than $1 million has increased four-fold since 2002. The share of homes valued at $5 million or more has increased five-fold.
You may have heard something about income inequality in America. Here’s a summary: It’s growing.
Trulia further reported that the homes at the top of the heap increasingly have more bathrooms than bedrooms. (Insert your own wisecrack about trickle-down economics here.)
But seriously, I think back to the lower-middle-class home where I grew up among five children, two adults and one bathroom and the times we kids yelled “Hurry up, HURRY UP!” to siblings in desperation and I remember the painful and cruel slow passage of time and the agony of almost bursting. I see the point of American bathroom expansionism. There was a time when I would have paid dearly for one more.
That I cannot now join the million-dollar club is perhaps my own fault, owing to all those years when I concentrated on short-term things — food, fuel, taxes, Christmas presents for my children — rather than capital accumulation. But we have managed to add a second bathroom to our home, so there are three bedrooms and two full baths at the Mackie compound in West Lebanon. It is not palatial, really, but I think back to the desperate hours of my youth and I appreciate the improvement in the odds.
Our house has not astronomically increased in value, but it has increased in comfort and memories. We raised our children here, a thought that turns sunny and golden on weeks like this one, when we see school buses back on their rounds, and the posting of first-day-of-school photos of young ones with jack-o-lantern smiles. So many of our stories begin and end with this place, this home.
How do you set a value on that?

Texto completo: Today is Saturday, Sept. 7, the 250th day of 2019. There are 115 days left in the year.
Today's Highlight in History:
On Sept. 7, 1977, the Panama Canal treaties, calling for the U.S. to eventually turn over control of the waterway to Panama, were signed in Washington by President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos (toh-REE'-hohs).
On this date:
In 1892, James J. Corbett knocked out John L. Sullivan to win the world heavyweight crown in New Orleans in a fight conducted under the Marquess of Queensberry rules.
In 1901, the Peace of Beijing ended the Boxer Rebellion in China.
In 1936, rock-and-roll legend Buddy Holly was born Charles Hardin Holley in Lubbock, Texas.
In 1940, Nazi Germany began its eight-month blitz of Britain during World War II with the first air attack on London.
In 1963, the National Professional Football Hall of Fame was dedicated in Canton, Ohio.
In 1972, the International Olympic Committee banned Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett of the U.S. from further competition for talking to each other on the victory stand in Munich during the playing of the "Star-Spangled Banner" after winning the gold and silver medals in the 400-meter run.
In 1990, Kimberly Bergalis of Fort Pierce, Florida, came forward to identify herself as the young woman who had been infected with AIDS, allegedly by her late dentist. (Bergalis died the following year.)
In 1996, rapper Tupac Shakur was shot and mortally wounded on the Las Vegas Strip; he died six days later.
In 2005, police and soldiers went house to house in New Orleans to try to coax the last stubborn holdouts into leaving the storm-shattered city. President George W. Bush led the nation in a final tribute to William H. Rehnquist, remembering the late chief justice as the Supreme Court's steady leader and a man of lifetime integrity.
In 2007, Osama bin Laden appeared in a video for the first time in three years, telling Americans they should convert to Islam if they wanted the war in Iraq to end.
In 2008, troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in government conservatorship.
In 2017, more than a half million people were ordered to leave South Florida as Hurricane Irma approached; Georgia's governor ordered nearly 540,000 coastal residents to move inland. One of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded in Mexico struck off the country's southern coast, toppling hundreds of buildings and killing at least 90 people. (A deadlier quake would strike central Mexico nearly two weeks later.)
Ten years ago: Addressing a Labor Day picnic in Cincinnati, President Barack Obama declared that modern benefits like paid leave, minimum wage and Social Security "all bear the union label" as he appealed to organized labor to help him win the health care fight in Congress. Three British Muslims were convicted in London of plotting to murder thousands by downing at least seven airliners bound for the U.S. and Canada. The Pittsburgh Pirates were assured of a record-breaking 17th straight losing season as they fell to the Chicago Cubs 4-2. (The Pirates would go on to have three more consecutive losing seasons before breaking the streak in 2013.)
Five years ago: The head of the Arab League, Nabil Elaraby, urged members to confront Islamic State extremists "militarily and politically." A star-studded funeral was held in New York for comedian Joan Rivers, who had died three days earlier at age 81. Serena Williams won her third consecutive U.S. Open championship and 18th major title overall, taking 75 minutes to beat good friend Caroline Wozniacki 6-3, 6-3.
One year ago: President Donald Trump, citing national security, called on the Justice Department to investigate and unmask the author of a critical New York Times opinion piece purportedly written by a member of an administration "resistance" movement. In a speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, former President Barack Obama blasted his successor's policies and his pattern of pressuring the Justice Department. Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian intermediaries. Starbucks opened its first store in Italy, including a 22-foot bronze cask that was part of the roasting process.
Today's Birthdays: Jazz musician Sonny Rollins is 89. Singer Gloria Gaynor is 76. Singer Alfa Anderson (Chic) is 73. Actress Susan Blakely is 71. Rock musician Dennis Thompson (MC5) is 71. Actress Julie Kavner is 69. Rock singer Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders) is 68. Rock musician Benmont Tench (Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers) is 66. Actor Corbin Bernsen is 65.

Thought for Today: "The theory seems to be that as long as a man is a failure he is one of God's children, but that as soon as he succeeds he is taken over by the devil." -- H.L. Mencken, American journalist-author (1880-1956).

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo el sábado que canceló las reuniones secretas con los líderes talibanes y el presidente de Afganistán Ashraf Ghani, que se realizarían el domingo en Camp David y suspendió las negociaciones de paz en curso, después de que los talibanes admitieran la responsabilidad de un reciente ataque en el que murió un soldado estadounidense.
Trump dijo enojado que “para construir una influencia falsa”, los talibanes habían admitido un ataque suicida con coche bomba que había matado a un soldado estadounidense y a otras 11 personas en la capital de Kabul.
En una serie de tuits, Trump dijo que tenía previsto reunirse con líderes talibanes en Camp David este domingo.
Sin embargo , canceló la reunión y suspendió las negociaciones. El negociador estadounidense Zalmay Khalilzad había anunciado un acuerdo de paz “en principio” con los talibanes el lunes.
“Sin que lo supieran casi todos, los principales líderes talibanes y, por separado, el presidente de Afganistán, se reunirían conmigo en secreto en Camp David el domingo. Iban a estar en Estados Unidos esta noche”, tuiteó Trump.
“Desafortunadamente, para construir una influencia falsa, admitieron un ataque en Kabul que mató a uno de nuestros grandes grandes soldados y a otras 11 personas. Inmediatamente cancelé la reunión y suspendí las negociaciones de paz. ¿Qué tipo de gente mataría a tantos con el fin de fortalecer aparentemente su posición de negociación?”
Trump continuó: “¡No lo hicieron, solo lo empeoraron! Si no pueden aceptar un alto el fuego durante estas conversaciones de paz muy importantes, e incluso matarían a 12 personas inocentes, entonces probablemente no tengan el poder de negociar un acuerdo significativo de todos modos. ¿Cuántas décadas más están dispuestos a luchar?”
Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019
….only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2019
Un ataque con coche bomba en Kabul el jueves mató al sargento de Primera Clase Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, de 34 años, de Puerto Rico.
Un miembro del servicio rumano también murió en el ataque, al igual que al menos 10 ciudadanos afganos. Fue el segundo ataque talibán en Kabul en menos de una semana. Los talibanes lanzaron delitos militares en tres provincias la semana pasada.
Los talibanes afirmaron que el aumento en los ataques está justificado para darles una posición más fuerte en las negociaciones , informó el viernes Charlie D’Agata de CBS News.
Al menos 16 miembros del ejército de EEUU han muerto en Afganistán este año, según el Departamento de Defensa.
Estados Unidos espera que su acuerdo con los talibanes lleve al grupo militante a la mesa para que comiencen las conversaciones dentro de Afganistán, antes de las elecciones presidenciales del 28 de septiembre, una reunión que el presidente Ghani insistió en que debe celebrarse a tiempo, y no ser modificada después por un gobierno interino.
Un alto funcionario de la administración dijo a The New York Times que la reunión se había planeado para el lunes, solo dos días antes del aniversario de los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, que fueron planeados desde Afganistán y condujeron a la invasión de Estados Unidos al país.
Pocos detalles han surgido de las nueve rondas de conversaciones entre Estados Unidos y los talibanes durante casi un año.
Zalmay Khalilzad, el enviado de Trump a Afganistán, dijo que los primeros 5,000 soldados estadounidenses se retirarían de cinco bases en Afganistán dentro de los primeros 135 días de un acuerdo final. Entre 14,000 y 13,000 tropas están actualmente en el país.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump dijo el sábado que canceló las reuniones secretas con los líderes talibanes y el presidente de Afganistán Ashraf Ghani, que se realizarían el domingo en Camp David y suspendió las negociaciones de paz en curso, después de que los talibanes admitieran la responsabilidad de un reciente ataque en el que murió un soldado estadounidense.
Trump dijo enojado que “para construir una influencia falsa”, los talibanes habían admitido un ataque suicida con coche bomba que había matado a un soldado estadounidense y a otras 11 personas en la capital de Kabul.
En una serie de tuits, Trump dijo que tenía previsto reunirse con líderes talibanes en Camp David este domingo.
Sin embargo , canceló la reunión y suspendió las negociaciones. El negociador estadounidense Zalmay Khalilzad había anunciado un acuerdo de paz “en principio” con los talibanes el lunes.
“Sin que lo supieran casi todos, los principales líderes talibanes y, por separado, el presidente de Afganistán, se reunirían conmigo en secreto en Camp David el domingo. Iban a estar en Estados Unidos esta noche”, tuiteó Trump.
“Desafortunadamente, para construir una influencia falsa, admitieron un ataque en Kabul que mató a uno de nuestros grandes grandes soldados y a otras 11 personas. Inmediatamente cancelé la reunión y suspendí las negociaciones de paz. ¿Qué tipo de gente mataría a tantos con el fin de fortalecer aparentemente su posición de negociación?”
Trump continuó: “¡No lo hicieron, solo lo empeoraron! Si no pueden aceptar un alto el fuego durante estas conversaciones de paz muy importantes, e incluso matarían a 12 personas inocentes, entonces probablemente no tengan el poder de negociar un acuerdo significativo de todos modos. ¿Cuántas décadas más están dispuestos a luchar?”
Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to..

Texto completo: The embattled head of the MIT Media Lab abruptly resigned Saturday afternoon, less than a day after an explosive new report in The New Yorker detailed close ties between the research center and financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide last month in a New York prison.
Joi Ito, the Media Lab's director since 2011, resigned by e-mail hours after the Friday night publication of an article by investigative reporter Ronan Farrow that alleged Ito and Peter Cohen, the Media Lab's former director of development and strategy, worked to keep Epstein's donations anonymous and to omit his name when reporting gifts Epstein solicited from philanthropists on the lab's behalf.
Some staff members in Ito's office called Epstein “Voldemort" or “he who must not be named" in reference to the efforts to conceal his connections to the lab, Farrow reported.
Acting as an intermediary, Epstein secured major donations for the lab, including $5.5 million from investor Leon Black, founder of one of the world's largest private-equity firms, and $2 million from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, in addition to his own beneficence, Farrow reported.
MIT had previously disclosed only $800,000 in contributions to the university over a 20-year span from foundations Epstein controlled. On Wednesday, Ito told attendees at a meeting to address the scandal that Epstein had contributed $525,000 to the Media Lab and $1.2 million to investment funds Ito controlled, according to Farrow and the New York Times.
Ito publicly apologized last month for accepting donations from Epstein, the disgraced financier who died while facing federal charges of sex trafficking of underage girls. Since then, the director of the lab's Center for Civic Media and a visiting scholar at the lab have announced plans to sever their ties.
Ito, a Japanese-born entrepreneur who became the head of the Media Lab at 44, said in his apology last month that he will raise the equivalent to what Epstein gave the Media Lab and donate it to nonprofits that work with survivors of trafficking. He will also return the money Epstein invested in his funds, Ito said.
Also last month, MIT President L. Rafael Reif pledged to commit a monetary amount equal to the funds MIT received from Epstein's foundations to a charity that benefits Epstein's victims or other victims of sexual abuse.
The New Yorker article details several ways Ito and his staff worked to hide or downplay connections to Epstein, including listing the financier by his initials on Ito's calendar, recording his direct contributions as anonymous gifts, and omitting his efforts when recording gifts he solicited for the Media Lab.
Screenshots of e-mail exchanges show Ito contacting Epstein to ask for $100,000 to extend a researcher's contract, Epstein responding simply, “yes," and Ito and Cohen then issuing instructions that the donation be logged anonymously. “Make sure this gets accounted for as anonymous," Ito says in one message, to which Cohen responds, “Jeffrey money, needs to be anonymous. Thanks."
When Gates donated $2 million to the Media Lab at Epstein's request, Ito notified Cohen, who said in his response that “we will not be mentioning Jeffrey's name as the impetus for this gift."
Signe Swenson, a former alumni coordinator and development associate at the Media Lab, told Farrow that when the issue of accepting Epstein's money arose, Ito told her, “We can take small gifts anonymously."

Republicans may cancel 2020 presidential primaries to back Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Republican officials in multiple states are considering canceling their 2020 primary contests, a move that would be a show of support for President Donald Trump, as a few GOP challengers have stepped forward to contest the party's presidential nomination.
Trump is officially facing GOP primary challenges from former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who announced his White House bid in April, as well as from former Rep. Joe Walsh, who announced his candidacy in August.
The state Republican parties in South Carolina, Kansas, Nevada and Arizona could nix their primaries and caucuses.
State political parties set their own rules for primaries and caucuses, and one consideration when an incumbent president is seeking re-election is the costs that the state parties must bear to put on an intraparty contest when the likely outcome appears relatively clear.
Arizona primary: Republican Party prepares to scrap 2020 presidential preference election in Arizona
Leaders in South Carolina and Nevada will meet Saturday to reach a decision, while the Arizona GOP Executive Committee will discuss the issue at a Sept. 14 meeting.
Kansas Republicans are also considering the option, according to Politico.
It is not an unusual move for state parties to forego primary contests when a strong incumbent is running for re-election as president.
For example, the South Carolina and Arizona Republican parties did not hold primaries in 1984 and 2004 when Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, respectively, were seeking re-election, according to the Associated Press.
In 2012, Democrats canceled 10 presidential preference contests, according to the New York Times.
“These are decisions made entirely by state parties and there are volumes of historical precedents to support them. Nevertheless, President Trump will dominate and prevail in whatever contest is placed before him,” Trump campaign communication director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement provided to USA TODAY of the possibility that the intra-GOP contests in the four states could be canceled.
'What are we going to do Mike?': Trump's victory posed problems for Pence and his wife, new book says
Drew McKissick, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, also told the Times: “There is strong precedent on the part of both parties to not hold a primary when they control the White House. ”
In Arizona, the effort has been afoot since at least April, when state party chair Kelli Ward began circulating a GOP executive committee resolution to GOP state lawmakers to support opting out of the state's presidential preference election.
That resolution, obtained in May by The Arizona Republic, acknowledges that the party has the option of not holding a presidential preference election.
"Arizona Republicans are fired up to re-elect President Trump to a second term and will continue to work together to keep America — and Arizona — great," Ward said in a statement issued Friday.
GOP fundraising: Trump calls out small 2020 GOP primary field including Joe Walsh, Bill Weld and potential challenger Mark Sanford
The ABC News affiliate in Wichita, Kansas, reported that the Kansas Republican Party will not organize a caucus for the 2020 primary season, and that the decision follows a standard that goes back to President Abraham Lincoln's re-election.
“Every time an elected incumbent Republican has run for re-election, except in 1912, the Kansas GOP state convention adopted a resolution instructing all delegates to vote for the elected incumbent,” the TV station reported, adding that "The Kansas GOP estimates organizing a caucus would cost the party $250,000. "
In Nevada, a spokesman on Friday confirmed the party’s central committee plans to vote this weekend on a rule change that would short-circuit a pair of long-shot campaigns for the Silver State’s Republican caucus delegates.
Nevada's primary: Nevada GOP could vote to cancel upcoming caucus, smoothing Trump's path to renomination
The RNC has already thrown its support behind Trump, signing a pledge in January to give “undivided support” before he’s the party’s official nominee.
"The members just wanted to underscore, underline, highlight that we are here to reelect President Trump and Republicans up and down the ballot," the RNC's national press secretary, Cassie Smedile, said at the time.
In response to reports about the state parties' plans, GOPUnrigged. com, a project of Defending Democracy Together, is pushing to keep the primaries.
Sarah Longwell, executive director of Defending Democracy Together, in a statement, suggested the four GOP state parties are trying to protect Trump by considering cancellation of their primaries and caucuses,
"Depriving Republicans of a chance to participate in choosing their party's nominee is shameful, weak, and cowardly," she also said. “Let the people vote. Give them their options. Let the best candidate win. "

Tish joins anti-trust probe of Facebook; Prosecutors focus on 'industry dominance'

Texto completo: New York Attorney General Letitia James is teaming up with other state prosecutors to investigate whether Facebook violated antitrust laws, her office confirmed Friday.
The probe comes as the social media giant has undergone greater scrutiny for its acquisition of other tech companies - Instagram and Whatsapp among them - in what critics view as attempts to squelch competition.
The multi-state probe is expected to cover "Facebook's dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance," James' office announced.
"Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers," James said in a written statement released Friday morning. "We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook's actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, or increased the price of advertising."
Perhaps the most damning criticism yet of Facebook's dominance came from one of its co-founders. Chris Hughes, who left the company in 2007, called for the company's dismantling in May with a New York Times editorial titled "It's Time to Break up Facebook."
In July, members of Congress questioned honchos from Facebook - as well as Google, Amazon and Apple - during a hearing called as part of an investigation into tech companies' market dominance.
Friday's probe announcement isn't the first time James has gone after the online behemoth. In April, she announced a separate investigation into what she described as the company's "unauthorized collection" of 1.5 million users' email contact databases.
"Facebook has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of respect for consumer information while at the same time profiting from mining that data," she said at the time on Twitter.
That announcement came just days after Facebook claimed it had unintentionally culled information from 1.5 million user email address books without gaining their permission.
Attorneys general in Washington D.C., Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska and Tennessee will also take part in the investigation, according to James' office.
Facebook said it will "work constructively" with prosecutors.
"We understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform," Facebook policy VP Will Castleberry said. "This underscores the competition we face, not only in the U.S. but around the globe."

Texto completo: Gertrude Stein Has Arrived
By Roy Morris Jr.
Johns Hopkins, 252 pages, $24.95
More people have likely read about Gertrude Stein than have actually finished one of her books. Stein's prose, with its reiterative cadences and distinctive mingling of the straightforward and the complicated, requires a certain acclimation before it is possible to go too far, and some readers never sign on to the journey. But Stein herself was the sort of character around whom legends will form: As in the cases of Ernest Hemingway, Sylvia Plath and Dorothy Parker, Stein's life makes an engrossing story in itself, and the books about her continue to proliferate.
Roy Morris Jr. has now told part of that story in his new book, "Gertrude Stein Has Arrived: The Homecoming of a Literary Legend." It is the sort of literary biography that used to be enormously popular, a sympathetic narrative in the manner of Van Wyck Brooks's anecdotal volumes on the 19th-century New England authors or Nancy Milford's "Zelda," aimed at a general audience but welcoming to all but the highest brow.
Mr. Morris's book is essentially a day-to-day timeline of Stein's return to the United States in 1934 after a 30-year absence. She was suddenly famous, through her collaboration with composer Virgil Thomson on the nonpareil opera "Four Saints in Three Acts" (which, to everybody's amazement, ran for a while on Broadway) and through "The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas," her most accessible book. Both titles are misnomers: There are many more than four saints in the opera's four acts, and Stein wrote the supposed Toklas autobiography herself, admitting as much on the final page.
Toklas (according to Thomson, she pronounced her name "TOCK-less") had been Stein's constant companion since shortly after they met in 1907, and the two of them lived for almost 40 years together in a grand Paris house at 27 rue de Fleurus. There they surrounded themselves with a fabled collection of modern paintings -- and sometimes with the artists themselves (Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso were regular visitors, as were the authors Sherwood Anderson, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Paul Bowles and, for a time, the young Hemingway). It was, as the author James R. Mellow titled his 1974 study of the Stein salon, "a charmed circle."
Before the word "lesbian" would have been understood by even a tiny percentage of Americans, Stein and Toklas were obviously a couple, but their precise relationship was never specified to the public. Instead, they were treated as merely different -- as a pair of "maiden aunts," perhaps -- and permitted the leeway that had traditionally been the due of the wealthy and creative. As with vaudeville's "female impersonator" Bert Savoy in the 1910s and '20s, and later on with the fantastic success of Liberace, the United States was long willing to accept manifestations of homosexuality most comfortably when there was no hint of sexual activity.
"I used to say I would not go to America until I was a real lion a real celebrity," Stein wrote in her unpunctuated building-block prose. "At that time of course I did not really think I was going to be one. But now we were coming and I was going to be one." Celebrities indeed -- the two were coaxed back to the U.S. for a lucrative and well-publicized tour. They would cross the country over the space of seven months, making appearances in 37 cities in 23 states. According to Mr. Morris, "not until Timothy Leary's psychedelic caravan in the 1960s would another speaker rival Gertrude Stein's reception on American campuses."
"The trip would be great fun," Mr. Morris observes, "not merely for Gertrude and Alice but for thousands of literally depressed Americans who would find some much-needed diversion in the unpredictable antics of a pair of eccentric, accessible, uninhibited women who were apt at any given time to say or do anything. The headline crawl on the New York Times Building in Times Square -- 'Gertrude Stein Has Arrived . . . Gertrude Stein Has Arrived . . . Gertrude Stein Has Arrived' -- was both literally and figuratively true."
This is a fair sampling of Mr. Morris's style: His writing is brisk and breezy, and he seems eager to tell his stories in as entertaining a manner as possible. For the most part the trip was great fun for Stein, and she was surprised by the affection she felt for her homeland. "Chicago too was good to look at," she said. "I had not seen winter for many years and Alice Toklas had never seen it. . . . They told us that the modern high buildings had been invented in Chicago and not in New York. It is interesting that it should have been done where there was plenty of land to build on and not in New York where it is narrow and so must be high of necessity. Choice is always more pleasing than anything necessary."
"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived" is not necessarily a book for the Stein scholar. There is little original research here and no new theories are advanced. Mr. Morris seems content to take us through the trip chronologically, relying closely upon the press coverage of the time (which, to his credit, he magnifies and makes new, vignette after vignette). Stein once expressed regret that the general public was more interested in her life than in her creations. "Gertrude Stein Has Arrived" may not change the situation, but one may hope that some readers find spark in this lively book and investigate further.

Texto completo: MAPUTO, Mozambique - Ye ung men and women wearing the words "Pope Francis" on their backs and "Catholic Youth" on their sleeves packed the bleachers of a stadium in Mozambique on Thursday and listened to Francis tell them, "You are important!
"You need to believe it," Francis said to the raucous crowd at the Maxaquene Pavilion, in the capital, Maputo, where young Africans regaled him with songs and skits. "Not only are you the future of Mozambique, or of the church and of humanity. You are their present!"
In the stands, Francisco Alfeu Chixango, 23, nodded and said that just seeing Francis would give the entire African church a shot in the arm.
"The pope being here," he said, "will help the church to grow."
The continent has already become the globe's most fertile ground for the faithful and priests who are disappearing from Catholicism's historic centers in Europe. The Roman Catholic Church continues to expand in Africa, even as it faces competition from increasingly popular Pentecostal and Evangelical movements.
The pope's six-day visit to Africa, with stops in Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius, is an opportunity for him to come face to face with the future of his church.
By opening to Africa and appointing more of its bishops as candinals who will pick his successor, Francis has shown that he sees the traditional "peripheries" of the church as central to its future and its universality.
Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI, who preferred a small but concentrated church, Francis is willing to be more inclusive to be more relevant. And Africa, where about 60% of the population is under the age of 25, offers his church room for growth.
"Africa is the most rapidly growing part of the Church," said Sean Callahan, president of Catholic Relief Services, the humanitarian arm of the Catholic church in the United States. It is also providing what he called a "reverse evangelization."
"In the past it was Europe sending priests to Africa," he noted. "Now it's Africa sending priests to Europe."
On Thursday, Francis visited the Animators Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, where he told the country's bishops, priests, nuns and seminarians to look forward.
"The promised land is before us, not behind us," he said, while encouraging them to inspire, not browbeat, their people. "Instead of proclaiming good news, we announce a dreary message that attracts no one and sets no one's heart afire."
A study by Pew Research Center, published in 2017, estimated that 40% of Christians will live in Africa by 2060. Another Pew study, from 2018, noted that Africans are especially active in their churches, with more than 60% saying they attend church at least once a week.
The population is booming across the continent and so is Catholicism. According to the Vatican's Book of Statistics, the Catholic church - which now has 1.3 billion people - owes its global growth in recent years to Africa and Asia.
While Europe lost 240,000 faithful between 2016 and 2018, Africa registered the most growth, with 6.3 million more Catholics. The same survey found that the total number of priests in the church decreased by a few hundred to 415,000, with the major erosion also in Europe, which lost about 2,500 priests in those years. But Africa, with 1,200 new priests, and Asia, with 1,300, picked up the slack.
Antonio Juliasse, auxiliary bishop of Maputo said that the church in Mozambique, like the country, is poor and often lacked the funds to provide services without outside help.
At the same time he said, it had strength in numbers and fervor, and the packed seminaries and young people at the churches suggested a bright future.
Juliasse attributed that faith to a lack of distractions from material wealth, allowing Africans to focus on faith. But he said that evangelicals, Pentecostals and others with new rituals designed "for their own profit" were increasingly competing for their attention.
Catholic leaders have planned meetings on how to address the crowded religious marketplace, he said. "We are aware of this situation, and we need to deal with it."
Since 1970, the percentage of African Protestants has doubled to nearly 30% of the population, or about 340 million people, according to Pew. That compares with about 170 million Catholics in sub-Saharan African, according to Pew.
In an email, Paul Gifford, author of the book "Christianity, Development and Modernity in Africa," attributed that sharp rise in Protestants in part to Pentecostals adapting better to African cultures and addressing the need for explicitly spiritual rituals.
The Catholic church, he wrote, "frowns on" such adaptation and has a habit of emphasizing aid over transcendence. The church in Africa, he said, "has turned itself into a massive NGO."
But there did not seem to be a lack of spirituality or enthusiasm in Maputo. Teenagers in blue "Volunteers for Pope Francis" shirts ran beside his motorcade, and tens of thousands of people, many calling the pope's name, lined the streets.
Some church officials said that Africa's receptiveness to Catholicism is increasing because government corruption has eroded faith in secular institutions and created a thirst for something, and something absolute, to believe in.
In Africa, "there is more willingness, even in traditional religions, there is more readiness to accept the absolute," said Bernardo Suerte, a priest from Mozambique who works in Radio Vatican's Portuguese section. "That still exists in Africa."

Texto completo: Albuterol is used in horses that have disease of the lungs allowing the horse to breathe easier under resting conditions.
"It causes an increase in heart rate, relaxation of the muscles in the small airways in the lungs, and that relaxation causes those airways to become bigger allowing air to move more freely in and out of the lungs. There are a number of other, short term effects that you would associate with adrenaline. They prepare the body for flight, to run away from a predator. Those in general are the effects."
Dr. Richard Sams, Ph.D.,
a veterinary pharmacologist and an independent consultant
Ruidoso-based horse trainer Trey Wood was scheduled to face allegations of doping a horse with Albuterol in a hearing before the New Mexico Racing Commission on Aug. 18.
Hearings before the Racing Commission are public but a new hearing date has yet to be posted to the organization's website after Wood's lawyer Johnny Mac Hayes and the Racing Commission "verbally agreed" to postpone it until after Labor Day, Hayes said.
The New Mexico Racing Commission did not return calls by the Ruidoso News for confirmation on a new hearing date.
Wood was suspended from the sport in July after testing revealed a horse in his training program, Gold Heart Eagle V, had traces of Albuterol in its system.
Wood has been a trainer for many years and has faced similar allegations during his career. In April 2018, he was "summarily suspended" by New Mexico Racing Commission stewards after a horse tested positive for a "Class B" drug.
Woods and Valeriano Stables, LLC, owners of Gold Heart Eagle V, did not respond to requests for comment by the Ruidoso News.
Doping horses Dr. Richard Sams, Ph.D., a veterinary pharmacologist and an independent consultant, who began his career in 1976, said "doping horses" may result in severe consequences for the animal.
He said different levels of illegal substances are used to "enhance" a horse's performance on the track as defined by racing commissions.
The American Racing Commission classifies drugs as Class 1 through Class 5 according to the drug's pharmacology and recommended penalties. Those substances that are in "Class 1" have the greatest potential to affect performance with no therapeutic use in the horse.
Other classes of drugs have a greater clinical use in the horse and less potential to affect outcome.
Class 3 drugs, which include a large number of substances such as Albuterol and Clenbuterol, are used therapeutically in horses, Sams said, and also have greater potential to affect performance than those in Class 4 that include substances like Fenilbutazona and Flunixin.
Sams said the American Quarter Horse Association has asked for zero tolerance for Albuterol use.
Sams said Albuterol is used in horses which have disease of the lungs allowing the horse to breathe easier under resting conditions.
"It causes an increase in heart rate, relaxation of the muscles in the small airways in the lungs, and that relaxation causes those airways to become bigger allowing air to move more freely in and out of the lungs. There are a number of other, short term effects that you would associate with adrenaline. They prepare the body for flight, to run away from a predator. Those in general are the effects," he said.
Clenbuterol causes a "repartitioning effect" meaning a maturing animal develops more muscle than fat when used in higher doses than those recommended for clinical use.
Various skeletal muscle fiber types called "slow twitch and fast twitch" are found in horses. Slow twitch fibers are used in long distance running and endurance events. Fast twitch fibers are used in sprints and rapid movement.
Some substances have the ability to cause fiber types to change in the body from "slow twitch to fast twitch," Sams said, providing a horse an advantage in certain competitions.
"It is clear to me that Albuterol, until the time that its use was severely restricted, was used very widely in Quarter Horse racing and I think there is no dispute that is was being used in an attempt to produce a repartitioning effect," Sams said.
"I do not know that anyone has actually done a scientific study that would prove that it makes horses race faster, but given all of the evidence, you can see why someone would choose to use Clenbuterol if they were interested in making the horse run faster."
Sams said there is "virtually no proof" that environmental contaminants can result in a positive test for the substances, though Hayes has used that reasoning in defense of Woods.
According to Sams, the long term effects of doping on horses is unknown.
A hair test is used to screen horses, as the affect of certain drugs persist longer than can be detected via blood and urine. Tests are typically conducted twice a year.
How does mandatory testing work? Hair samples are taken from the stable and a sample from the mane, according to Dr. Sams. Any finding of illegal substances renders a horse ineligible for future races.
The New Mexico Racing Commission increased its use of "out of competition" testing. The collector goes where a horse is being stabled, without announcement, and collects blood samples which are submitted to a laboratory for testing.
Post-race testing typically involves a blood and urine sample.
Sams said the New Mexico Racing Commission has allowed therapeutic use of substances in horses, as long as they are withdrawn sufficiently ahead of any competition. These "14 day threshold" rules are being reviewed in many states.
"The levels of testing used by labs have advanced their methods so far that the labs are reporting 'positives' which are irrefutably irrelevant to the performance of the horse. This level of testing sensitivity is causing a calamity of accusations, suspensions and character damage," Hayes said.
"The problem is merely compounded when the State issues a summary suspension without basic due process or confirmation testing."
Horse doping a continuing problem U.S. Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) announced the Racehorse Doping Ban Act initiated this year which would establish consistent medication rules across the industry and strict doping penalties for horse races already governed by federal law. Congress considered banning drugs in horse racing in the 1980s, but left that decision up to individual states.
A recent New York Times report stated that the U.S. racehorse fatality rate is up to five times greater than in other countries with nearly 10 horses dying weekly.
However, between 700 and 800 racehorses are injured and die every year, with a national average of about two breakdowns for every 1,000 starts, according to PETA.
The Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database reported that nearly 10 horses died every week at American racetracks in 2018.
Executive Director Ismael Trejo, with the New Mexico Racing Commission, declined to comment until after the hearing.

Texto completo: Some crusading journalists write with a scalpel, others with a scythe. Molly Ivins, who famously called President George W. Bush "Shrub," used both. She was funny and mean, clever and sincere; most of all she was political to the bone or at least that's how she reads on the page and came across in talks. (She died in 2007.) Samples of each are scattered like acid-dipped chocolate nuggets throughout the hagiographic documentary "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins."
Whether you chuckle or snort will likely depend on your political persuasion, though it's clear that the filmmakers aren't aiming to seduce conservatives. This is a loving, at times fawning portrait aimed at the Ivins faithful -- her "beloveds," as she addressed her readers -- who read her syndicated columns and best-selling books or showed up for her speeches. And while cuddling up to the adored one is a familiar biographical tactic, some critical distance might have made for a deeper, stronger movie.
The director Janice Engel gives "Raise Hell" such momentum -- it's a whoosh of a movie -- that you are quickly swept up in its sights and sounds. There's a lot to take in. (Engel clearly spent a heroic amount of time piecing the movie together with her editor and co-writer, Monique Zavistovski; to judge from the pace, they might be coffee lovers.) Using the chronology of Ivins's life as a narrative spine, Engel delivers the up-close and personal, deploying archival material and interviews to fill in a picture of a bookish child turned freethinker.
The movie follows Ivins's professional and political evolutions, adding piquant details, quotes and testimonials along the way. Born in 1944, Mary Tyler Ivins grew up in a wealthy Houston suburb. Her father, Jim Ivins, was a conservative oil and gas executive who explained his choice of her first name by saying "if it's good enough for the mother of God, it's good enough for my daughter." The movie makes it clear that he cast a large shadow over his daughter, who opted to call herself Molly. By contrast her mother, Margaret, scarcely registers. (The Wikipedia entry on Ivins doesn't even mention the mom.)
As "Raise Hell" hits the milestones -- from Smith College to journalism, including a memorable stretch at The New York Times -- it colors in Ivins's emergence as a professional Texas contrarian. It's a fascinating metamorphosis, one that Ivins elliptically addressed in a taxonomy of Texan culture ("all rotten for women") in her 1991 collection "Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?" Like a ticked-off anthropologist, she wrote of "the pervasive good-ol'-boyism of the Redneckus texenis, that remarkable tribe that has made the pickup truck with the gun rack across the back window and the beer cans flying out the window a synonym for Texans worldwide."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ivins wrote that these "strains lead to a form of sexism so deeply ingrained in the culture that it's often difficult to distinguish the disgusting from the outrageous or the offensive from the amusing." At the same time, she drew power from those she opposed, much as she'd drawn strength from standing up to her father. In the same article she wrote that it is the "virulence of Texas sexism that accounts for the strength of Texas women." Take Texas out of that clause and you get a fine description of what powers a lot of feminists, which makes you yearn for a movie with more dialectical engagement with feminism.
It can be exhausting goring bulls. Ivins can seem like a blast, but she also seems awfully lonely and sometimes more sad than mad. She obviously enjoyed fighting -- and writing -- the good fight, and exulted in the persona she cultivated. But all those battles seemed to take a toll as did other issues. There are a lot of beer cans in "Raise Hell," something you notice before her onscreen beloveds gently address her struggles with alcohol. Ivins kept smoking and drinking after she learned that she had cancer. Her hair fell out, her tongue stayed sharp. And the Molly Ivins that she invented keeps on giving in a legacy that engulfs this movie.

Texto completo: An increasing number of brands are bucking the long-held trend of keeping their distance from hot-button political and social issues, instead choosing to embrace sustainability, LGBT rights, gun control, and more, regardless of what the consequences from customers may be.
“This is a major shift that we’re seeing, in that companies are realizing that they can have a substantial impact on the political environment,” said Daniel Korschun, an associate professor of marketing at Drexel University. “What’s really notable is that they’re doing it in such an open way compared to how they were involved in past years.”
Companies previously engaged in the political process through lobbying and other closed-door methods, providing a layer of secrecy in which the average consumer may not know the stances or policies brands were advocating for behind the scenes.
But now, companies are “adding to this very public element where they're calling on consumers and employees to join executives in having a political impact,” Korschun said.
In May, for example, Gillette released an ad that featured a father teaching his transgender son how to shave. The ad was the latest from the razor company that sought to challenge the traditional definition of masculinity, and was met with praise and condemnation.
Driving the shift among brands to publicly take a stand on political or social issues is the collision of two trends, Korschun said. First, the United States has become more polarized, leaving companies in a position where it is difficult to remain neutral, and second, younger customers are examining not only the quality of the company’s product or service, but also what its values are.
“As companies are asked to show their values more and simultaneously consumers are becoming more politically polarized, companies are being forced to respond to this shift, and they’re increasingly forced to take a side,” Korschun said. “It’s becoming increasingly difficult to keep everyone happy by staying in the middle. If you sit in the middle of the train tracks, you get run over.”
A 2018 study from Global Strategy Group found that an increasing number of Americans want companies to come off the sidelines and effect social change. Eighty-one percent agree that corporations should take action to address important issues facing society, and 77% believe they have a responsibility to do so. Seventy-six percent of Americans, meanwhile, believe corporations should stand up for what they believe politically regardless of whether its controversial, according to the survey.
But for some industries, the desire to please politically aware consumers and investors can create tension. Luxury brands, for example, have come under pressure to lessen their environmental impact, while manufacturers eat up natural resources.
To push the fashion industry to become more aware of its environmental footprint, French President Emmanuel Macron selected Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault, whose company owns Gucci, to lead a sustainability drive. Macron and Pinault announced a new plan on the eve of the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, that focuses on climate, biodiversity, and oceans. Thirty-two fashion and textile companies, including Adidas, Chanel, Burberry, and Hermes, signed on to the Fashion Pact, which was presented at this year’s gathering of world leaders.
Korschun cautioned that while there can be conflicts between sustainability and the luxury goods industry, there are areas where they can be compatible.
“The starting point is sustainability is part of a brand, and it needs to make sense within people’s understanding of that brand,” he said. “If it’s consistent with the brand, it can reinforce and strengthen aspects, but if it’s inconsistent, it can confuse or lead to skepticism about the company’s true motives.”
“The problem occurs when companies are trying to tout things that either don’t provide a benefit or seem to be contradictory to it,” Korschun said.
In addition to the current political climate, in which the country seems more polarized than ever before, social media has also made it easier for consumers to amplify their criticisms or the indiscretions of companies.
“Because of social media, because what happens within the company is more transparent and more accessible, they really can’t escape politics at this point,” said Jerry Davis, professor of management and organizations at the University of Michigan. “Even if they wanted to keep their heads down, it’s really hard not to be held accountable.”
In a world where brands “can’t escape from being labeled political, then you might as well do it consciously” and think about how it aligns with business objectives, he added.
One of the most outspoken voices on political and issues, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, said his company believes "companies and CEOs have to be activists."
"We’re moving into a world of stakeholders. It’s not just about shareholders," he told the New York Times last year. "Your employees are stakeholders, so are your customers, your partners, the communities that you’re in, the homeless that are nearby, your public schools. A company like ours can’t be successful in an unsuccessful economy or in an unsuccessful environment or where the school system doesn’t work. We have to take responsibility for all of those things."
Further demonstrating the shift among brands to take a stand on social issues, Business Roundtable, which represents the country’s top companies, redefined how it views the role of corporations in American society. In a revised “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation,” signed by 181 CEOs, the group urged corporations to move away from solely focusing on maximizing profits for shareholders and instead focus on “all stakeholders” when making decisions.
Corporations, the amended statement says, should be committed to investing in employees, dealing “fairly and ethically” with suppliers, supporting the broader communities in which they work, and delivering value to consumers.
The statement from Business Roundtable, which didn’t completely reject maximizing profits for shareholders, has “given real legitimacy to the idea that the purpose of a company goes beyond profit maximization,” Korschun said.
“We’re already seeing some separation from companies where they would all be clumped in the middle in this neutral territory,” he added, “and they’re finding the neutral territory is not as easy to maintain as they used to think.”

Resumen: Ed Murphy, president and CEO of Colorado-based Empower Retirement, the nation’s second-largest retirement plan provider, said temporary signage will be in place at the stadium for the Broncos’ home opener against the Bears in Week 2. Celtics’ Tatum hurt at World Cup: SHANGHAI — U.S. forward Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics will miss at least the Americans’ next two games at the FIBA Basketball World Cup because of a sprained left ankle. The Clinton LumberKings put at least one runner on base in every inning against the Kane County Cougars pitching staff in their 7-3 playoff opening win Wednesday night at Nelson Corp Field.

Texto completo: New name for Mile High: ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — The Denver Broncos have partnered with Empower Retirement on a 21-year deal to name their stadium "Empower Field at Mile High." The Metropolitan Football Stadium District will meet later this week to sign off on the agreement that runs through 2039 and ends a three-year span without a title sponsor for the stadium that opened in 2001. Ed Murphy, president and CEO of Colorado-based Empower Retirement, the nation’s second-largest retirement plan provider, said temporary signage will be in place at the stadium for the Broncos’ home opener against the Bears in Week 2.
Packers great Dillon dies at 89: TEMPLE, Texas — Bobby Dillon, the Green Bay Packers’ career leader in interceptions who lost his left eye following two childhood accidents, died Aug. 22. He was 89. The New York Times reported that Dillon’s daughter, Karen Gooch, said the cause was complications of dementia. Dillon played safety for Green Bay from 1952 to 1959, setting the franchise record for interceptions with 52, including four against the Lions on Thanksgiving Day in 1953. Dillon returned five interceptions for touchdowns and led the league in interception return yards in 1956 with 244. Dillon led the Packers in interceptions in seven of his eight seasons, including three years with nine: 1953, ‘55 and ‘57. Irv Comp set Green Bay’s single-season record for interceptions with 10 in 1943.
Attorney says city must admit guilt: MILWAUKEE — An attorney for Bucks guard Sterling Brown says Milwaukee’s $400,000 offer to settle Brown’s lawsuit against the city over his arrest last year is insufficient because it doesn’t include an admission of guilt. Attorney Mark Thomsen said Wednesday that any settlement would have to include such an admission. The city’s Common Council has given Brown 14 days to accept or decline the settlement offer. Brown contends in his lawsuit that police used excessive force and targeted him because he is black when they confronted him for parking illegally in a handicapped-accessible spot in January 2018. He was talking with officers while waiting for his citation when the situation escalated. Officers took him down and used a stun gun because he didn’t immediately remove his hands from his pockets, as ordered.
Celtics’ Tatum hurt at World Cup: SHANGHAI — U.S. forward Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics will miss at least the Americans’ next two games at the FIBA Basketball World Cup because of a sprained left ankle. Tatum will not play against Japan today or in the Americans’ first second-round game on Saturday. He will be re-evaluated Monday, the same day the Americans play their final second-round matchup. Tatum — one of many heroes for the U.S. in its dramatic 93-92 overtime win over Turkey on Tuesday — got hurt on the Americans’ final possession of the game, twisting his ankle on a drive into the lane. Tests performed Wednesday confirmed the sprain.
Coyotes sign leading scorer: GLENDALE, Ariz. — The Arizona Coyotes have locked up forward Clayton Keller through the 2027-28 season, signing him to an eight-year contract extension. The deal announced Wednesday has an average annual salary of $7.15 million. The 21-year-old Keller led the Coyotes in scoring last season with 14 goals and 33 assists in 82 games.
Bettman in the U.S. Hall of Fame: COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman headlines the 2019 class of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Bettman, former Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas, longtime NHL forward Brian Gionta, Washington youth hockey staple Neal Henderson and U.S. women’s star Krissy Wendell will be inducted at a ceremony Dec. 12. Bettman was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto last year.
Cougars drop playoff opener: The Clinton LumberKings put at least one runner on base in every inning against the Kane County Cougars pitching staff in their 7-3 playoff opening win Wednesday night at Nelson Corp Field. The Cougars are on the brink of elimination and need to win out in the final two games of the series to keep their season alive. Neither team scored through the first four innings of the ballgame, but the lack of offense came in very different ways. Clinton stranded two runners in each of the first four frames, while the Cougars had one scoring threat with the bases loaded in the third. Despite walking 5, Cougars starter Levi Kelly battled for 3 innings, giving up no runs. Clinton first struck in the bottom of the fifth when Bubba Hollins belted a 3-run homer off reliever Andy Toelken with 2 outs. Today’s Game 2 is a must win for the Cougars and they’ll send out right-hander Matt Tabor (5-4, 2.93) to the mound against Clinton’s Jake Walters (7-4, 2.35).

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: The dishonest fakers at the Amazon Washington Post and the failing New York Times are again attacking your favorite president, this time for playing golf while a Category 5 hurricane took aim at the United States.
Bad people! Everybody knows the best way to prepare for a hurricane is by playing golf.
Beating a Category 5 is nothing if you can birdie a par five (the 590-yard 12th hole on Trump National Golf Club's Championship Course is "monstrous"). Though recent hurricanes have been some of "the wettest we've ever seen, from the standpoint of water," they are less intimidating after you've survived the eighth hole of the Riverview Course: not one but two merciless water hazards blocking your approach.
Hurricanes are best weathered from bunkers, and you can bet President Trump spent time in those this weekend with his sand wedge. Think high winds are a threat during hurricanes? They're even more hazardous to your handicap; it wouldn't surprise me if, in true emergencies, Trump has resorted to a 2-iron to reduce loft. And not even a meteorologist studies rotation as closely as a golfer; just one slice and all models project you'll make landfall in the deep rough.
Essentially, Trump was on the fairways doing exactly what we'd want our president to be do during a natural disaster - with a few minor revisions:
The president canceled a trip to Poland for the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II, allowing him to give his undivided attention to Hurricane Dorian play rounds of golf both Saturday and Monday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia.
In his place, he sent the vice president to Europe to renew the enduring trans-Atlantic bond stay at the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel in Doonbeg, Ireland. The president also delivered a somber message chipper greeting to Poles on the anniversary of the Nazi invasion, recalling the death and suffering of millions of Poles saying: "I just want to congratulate Poland."
At a briefing before last year's hurricane season, the president honed a sophisticated knowledge of tropical storms spoke aimlessly about catapults on aircraft carriers. Three other Category 5 storms had already occurred during his presidency, which meant that he was well-prepared to respond to such a storm didn't stop him Sunday from declaring, again, that "I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of the Category 5."
His director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and his secretary of homeland security were both seasoned veterans serving in temporary, "acting" capacities, and his head of the Coast Guard provided him storm updates packed with sophisticated government data that "you can pretty much get ... on television."
On Friday, when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Bahamas, the president announced that he would spare no expense in aiding relief efforts "the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President, me!" He expressed confidence that Florida Mar-a-Lago could withstand the storm. After learning during an intelligence briefing Friday that Iran had an unsuccessful rocket launch, the president coordinated a response with allies trolled Iran by including in a tweet an image that may have revealed covert U.S. activities.
On Saturday, when the hurricane center warned of Dorian's "life-threatening storm surge and devastating winds," the president spent the day overseeing emergency preparations attacking former FBI director James Comey, celebrating his success on "The Apprentice," responding to a now-former aide's claim that he disapproves of his daughter's weight ("I love Tiffany, doing great!") and playing golf. The president had said he would "not have time to play golf in office" has played 213 rounds of golf while in office.
On Monday, as storm warnings widened, the president spent hours on the phone with emergency management officials playing golf again and checking on pre-positioning of relief supplies attacking the AFL-CIO chief, economist Paul Krugman, the "Fake News Media" and four nonwhite congresswomen.
On Tuesday, the hurricane center said Dorian would soon "move dangerously close" to Florida, then Georgia and the Carolinas; the president prayerfully summoned the nation's resolve attacked the Federal Reserve, the mayor of London, former President Barack Obama and "the whole Witch Hunt against me."
And, all across this great land, Americans rallied to the cause wondered: Do hurricanes give mulligans?

Texto completo: In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more from this series here.
The anonymous note was secretly tucked into an envelope, behind an official letter from a government agency denying our reporter's request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act.
It apparently came from someone deep in the agency's FOIA bureaucracy. The request sought government documents related to the president's business interests. Typed in large-font print on plain paper, the inserted note said: "The processing of the request was highly irregular. The withholding was entirely unjustified ... The document was probably withheld for political reasons."
I had never seen such a whistle-blower note before, but it brought into sharp focus what we face every day in The New York Times's legal department as we continue to push against government secrecy through the use of FOIA. Whether it is helping our reporters as they go after documents in Washington and the Virgin Islands related to Jeffrey Epstein, or suing the C.I.A. over its refusal to release information about the United States' war efforts in Syria, we have made FOIA a centerpiece of our legal work at The Times.
Since its inception, FOIA has rightly been denounced as a weak and ineffective law, but The Times continues to aggressively pursue documents through the statute, doing what we have done repeatedly over the past 15 years: going to court to challenge the government's refusal to release materials that the public should see. The Times has brought more FOIA suits over the last decade than any other mainstream media organization in the country.
A study by the nonprofit group TRAC found that The Times had filed 31 FOIA lawsuits during the Obama years. Our peer news organizations around the country -- the major newspapers, wire services and broadcasters -- filed 10, collectively. A subsequent TRAC study found that The Times continued to be the leading filer among media organizations over the first year and a half of the Trump administration. The Times has now filed 27 FOIA lawsuits in the Trump years. (A handful of public interest groups and newer media outlets, in particular BuzzFeed and the Center for Public Integrity, have also been out front in pursuing litigation.)
So why do we devote so much time to trying to make a deeply flawed law work?
It's not because it's easy. Our FOIA litigation is done in house by our now three-lawyer team, with our First Amendment Fellow Al-Amyn Sumar playing the pivotal role. We have been helped in several cases by a FOIA clinic at Yale Law School. We spend hundreds of hours each year filing the suits, writing briefs, negotiating with government lawyers and going to court. We know better than anyone that FOIA cases are frustrating; the deck is stacked against us, and the lawsuits drag on for months and years.
But one part of our motivation is pretty simple: We manage to win documents. Between successful court decisions, and settlements in which the agencies agree to reverse course and give us documents, we regularly make a small dent in governmental secrecy.
In the past year, we have assisted our reporters in unlocking documents on topics ranging from gun control and herbicides to foreign lobbyists and federal land disputes in the West. In June, The Times published a report about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's efforts to include her relatives in meetings during an official trip to China in October of 2017. Emails obtained through a FOIA lawsuit showed that the trip had been canceled after ethics concerns were raised with officials in the State and Transportation Departments.
This week, a federal appeals court will hear arguments in our case seeking documents about the C.I.A.'s role in funding Syrian rebels. The very existence of that program, the C.I.A. insists, remains a secret -- even though it was the subject of a very public tweet by the president in 2017.
We also press against secrecy at state agencies. With the assistance of our outside lawyers in North Carolina, we recently won the release of documents about the risky surgery practices at a public hospital, leading to both an important investigative story and the payment of our legal fees by the state. In Indiana, our in-house legal team helped obtain documents about Lamekia Dockery, a 36-year-old woman who died of sepsis within days of arriving at a work-release facility in Elkhart County. The records showed that Ms. Dockery had repeatedly pleaded for medical help from the facility's staff. Instead of giving that help, they placed her in solitary confinement and shackled her to her bed.
There is, though, another factor in why we persist in our efforts, and it springs from the basic operation of FOIA. The process always starts the same way: A citizen puts in a request, and a FOIA officer decides whether any documents can be released. If the request is denied, a second FOIA officer hears an appeal. Because the law around FOIA has grown so complex, the officers are often forced not just to apply the law but also to interpret it. And no matter how conscientious the individual officers may be (or how many secret notes they write to us), the leaders of agencies have every incentive to withhold documents. (Trust me: An agency doesn't need a FOIA request to release apple-polishing information about itself.)
If requesters always shrug and walk away at that point, it means we are leaving it to federal bureaucrats to decide just how secret our government is going to be. That was never part of the plan for democracy.

Texto completo: A federal jury found Gregory B. Craig not guilty of lying to the Justice Department, acquitting the Democratic former White House counsel on Wednesday of concealing media contacts in 2012 related to his work for the Ukrainian government.
Jurors deliberated less than five hours before vindicating Craig, 74, a former top legal adviser to both President Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton. Craig thanked jurors after the verdict.
His defense team, which said the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan had declined to pursue Craig, called the Trump Justice Department's decision to move ahead with a prosecution in Washington "a disgrace."
"The question you need to ask isn't why this jury acquitted Craig, but why the Department of Justice brought this case against an innocent man in the first place," Craig attorney William Taylor said, adding, "It's a tragedy. It's a disgrace; I'm glad it's over."
Craig was the first prominent Democrat charged in an investigation spun off from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe, and his defenders have long complained he was prosecuted after blunt attacks by President Trump and his supporters that the Justice Department was unduly targeting Republicans.
But Justice Department officials have emphasized in recent years they are stepping up enforcement of a long-neglected foreign lobbying disclosure law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which requires Americans who are being paid by foreign governments or politicians to influence U.S. policy or opinion to register with the Justice Department.
In March, a prosecutor who had been detailed to the Mueller team was tapped to lead the department's FARA enforcement unit, and the department's "zero-tolerance" crackdown toward nondisclosure has triggered a 30 percent increase in registrations.
Spokesmen for the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The acquittal marks a setback for the Justice Department's crackdown on foreign lobbying in the United States, exposing flaws in a difficult prosecution of events from 2012 that was handed off among several investigative offices before Craig's April indictment.
"While I am sure the government is not happy with the outcome given all of its work, it was a tough case to prove beyond a reasonable doubt," said Thomas J. Spulak, a partner at the law firm King & Spalding who advises on lobbying compliance. But, he said, prosecutors put forward a strong case, adding, "Who would want to go through what Mr. Craig has experienced? And it may cause Congress to examine the statute and, where necessary, make changes to promote compliance."
Before Craig's trial began, a judge dismissed a charge alleging that Craig made false statements under FARA, citing a lack of clarity in the law. She allowed his trial to proceed on a general false statements charge.
Several Washington attorneys representing foreign governments and former Justice Department officials cautioned that even a slam-dunk acquittal did not mean the government acted recklessly or in bad faith - or that it would lead to a passive stance.
How those forces will play out remains to be seen.
In other work involving longtime political players, the Justice Department also has been investigating - but has not charged - Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta and former Republican congressman Vin Weber for their work alongside Craig in Ukraine.
Neither Weber or Podesta responded to requests for comment on the Craig verdict. Representatives for both men have said in the past that the two cooperated with authorities investigating possible FARA violations and that both took pains to make sure they were following the rules mandating disclosure of their lobbying.
Craig's trial revealed the involvement of a half-dozen powerful Washington public relations, lobbying, consulting and law firms in the project to rehabilitate Ukraine's battered image in the West.
With the direct FARA charge dropped, Craig was left facing one felony count of making false statements to investigators trying to determine whether he and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, should have registered under the law. The central issue was Craig's outreach on Dec. 11, 2012, to the New York Times regarding coverage of the law firm's upcoming report reviewing the jailing of Yulia Tymoshenko, a political rival to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
The report was commissioned by the Ukrainian government in a project led by Paul Manafort, a political adviser to Yanukovych. A wealthy Ukrainian businessman, Viktor Pinchuk, secretly paid Skadden $4.15 million for work on the report, testimony showed.
The charge against Craig turned on whether Craig was a knowing and willful participant in the public relations effort directed by Manafort - a onetime chairman for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and longtime consultant - and tried to hide that from investigators.
Craig took the stand in his own defense, saying he did not lie to investigators because he had reached out to Times journalist David Sanger to try to push back against what Craig saw as Ukraine's misleading spin on the Skadden report. Craig said that because he was pushing back against the Ukrainian government's take, he didn't regard himself as working in public relations on its behalf and hence did not need to register.
Ukraine's spin was suggesting the Skadden report exonerated Ukraine's treatment of Tymoshenko, Craig told jurors, which he could not abide.
Prosecutors asserted that Craig did not want to register because disclosure of his work with Ukraine could cast doubt on his and Skadden's independence and impede the ability of him and his colleagues to quickly return to government service.
Two members of Craig's jury said in interviews after the verdict that although a few jurors were "deeply disturbed" that Craig was not completely forthright in his actions and statements, the jury unanimously concluded there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction. They could not reach a conviction, according to the two jurors, because jury instructions limited them to consider only actions Craig took near the end of the FARA unit's investigation, after Oct. 3, 2013, 10 months after Skadden issued its report.
Those actions came down to a letter written by Craig to the Justice Department's FARA unit on Oct. 11, 2013, summarizing a 45-minute meeting - for which no notes exist, jurors were told - at which the government alleged Craig lied or omitted facts in successfully persuading FARA officials to reverse their position that he was required to register.
"There were several people who were very disturbed by his behavior prior to October 3, but there were a number of jurors, including several of the older jurors, who understand that life is a complicated thing," said juror Michael G. Meyer, 60, who works with a federal contractor that supports medical and vaccine trials.
Meyer said he personally found Craig "a very credible witness," and that while he never discussed the sentiment with others, he was "infuriated" that the government spent its resources prosecuting Craig instead of others scrutinized in the Mueller report.
However, juror Willie Wilson, 28, a commodities broker, said he initially thought Craig was guilty. "I was not of the opinion that he's a bad person, but he walked up to the line and very well may have crossed it."
Skadden in January reached a settlement with the Justice Department, admitting it should have registered for its work in 2012 and 2013, and agreed to turn over $4.6 million it made for its work with Ukraine in exchange for facing no criminal charges. In its settlement, Skadden agreed that an initial finding by the Justice Department in 2014 that the firm did not need to register came after the agency relied on "false and misleading oral and written statements" made by Craig.

Texto completo: The academic year is just around the corner for Wicomico County Public Schools, and Aug. 29's staff kickoff event allowed teachers the opportunity to get prepared.
At the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury, teachers from throughout the county were celebrated and spoken to about the importance of their jobs.
From kindergarten to high school, officials wanted to ensure each teacher felt appreciated.
Along with motivational videos, attempted dances from school resource officers and the presentation of a new 2020 Chevy Equinox to 2019-20 Teacher of the Year Shane Morton, one particular guest speaker highlighted the event.
Ron Clark, who has been dubbed "America's Educator" due to his dedication to the improvement of education, discussed his experiences with teaching youth throughout the country.
Clark is a New York Times best-selling author, subject of a television movie and founder of the The Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta. He has also been featured on "Oprah" and was most recently a contestant on the television show, "Survivor."
"This generous support from our community will ultimately benefit Wicomico schools, students, families and businesses. We are very fortunate to have the community's support to bring Ron Clark of The Ron Clark Academy here to speak to our entire school system," said Donna Hanlin, superintendent of schools, in a news release.
"We're excited about all of the good things that are going to come out of putting Ron Clark's inspiration into play in our schools, and we're appreciative of the Wicomico County Education Foundation and all of the sponsors that are making this happen. It's going to be an amazing morning, and an incredible school year."
Clark preached the importance of challenging kids and never shying away from an opportunity to enhance a student's knowledge.
The 2019-20 school year starts Tuesday, Sept. 3.

Texto completo: Mirone's Italian Hoagies has a familiar vibe. It's a little bit Northeastern and a little Italian, a reflection of its owners, Bobby and Stephanie Casale.
For their first restaurant, the couple have brought together bits of their adopted hometown of Philadelphia, pairing it was tastes of their Sicilian heritage, all in one small eatery on Pine Island Road in Cape Coral.
The Casales are originally from the East Coast of Florida, which is where they met. They spent 10 years living outside of Philly. Bobby worked in breweries and bars. Stephanie started out in restaurants before going to school to become a nurse. In 2011 the couple moved to Southwest Florida. Stephanie got her nursing license and started at Gulf Coast Hospital, while Bobby took time off to figure out his next step.
While he was deciding, the couple noticed an empty storefront in the same plaza as Stevie Tomato's and Thai Nawa, near the Carrabba's on the south side of Pine Island Road.
"It kept catching our eye," Stephanie said, "and we said to each other, 'That would be such a great place.'"
When their youngest son started kindergarten, they made the decision to launch their own hoagie shop. Mirone's opened in December.
"We wanted to get away from the late nights of the restaurant business and do our own thing," Stephanie said.
"We're closed on Sundays because we needed one day home with our boys. That was really important to us."
When it came time to name their new place, they chose Mirone's for Bobby's side of the family. "Mirone" is his mother's maiden name, and both of his grandparents were from Catania, Sicily. This Italian heritage is important to the Casales, even if, Stephanie admits, she married into it.
"My grandparents died when I was young, so when Bobby and I got together I adopted his grandparents," she said.
"We love to travel to Italy every year with our sons, and we love the atmosphere over there. That's how our hoagie shop is — people are talking to each other when you walk in."
The Casales have incorporated several sentimental pieces and souvenirs from their Sicilian trips into Mirone's. Even the olive oil and vinegar bottles are labeled with a photo of Bobby's grandparents on their wedding day.
Mirone's features a classic hoagie-shop menu. Cold-sub favorites include the Italian, the roast beef and Swiss, and a Caprese made with mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil and balsamic. Customers can also build their own subs from an array of meats and cheeses.
There's only one hot sub on the menu and it's piled with homemade meatballs in marinara. Mirone's also offers salads and a soup of the day. Its family dinners come with a pound of pasta, those same house meatballs, marinara sauce, garlic bread and salad (just be sure to order before 2 p.m.). The shop also offers a catering menu with hoagie platters and more pastas.
Something on the Mirone's menu that diners won't find many other places: the pickle hoagie. It's a giant-sized pickle cut in half and hollowed out in the center. It's filled with the usual hoagie fixings — meats, cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes, onions.
"We sell them all the time," Stephanie said.
"Of course, it's messy. You need some napkins close by when you're eating it."
Stephanie still has her job as a nurse, though she helps out in the shop when she can, and the Casales' two boys help out, too, sweeping floors and doing chores.
"Even though it's still work," Stephanie said, "we're doing it together as a family."

Upward Mobility: Dave Chappelle Is Stuck in the '80s

Texto completo: I had three major takeaways from comic Dave Chappelle's most recent Netflix special. The first was that his comedy has lost something. The flourishes are still there but less frequent. The observations are still amusing but less reliably insightful. Mr. Chappelle has made a career out of pushing the envelope, but his Michael Jackson pedophile bits aren't edgy. They're just icky.
A second takeaway was that black offense at use of the N-word is so much playacting. Mr. Chappelle spends an hour incessantly and gratuitously ramming it into our ears. Which is nothing new among black comics, of course. Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy also performed famously vulgar routines. What's changed is the debate surrounding use of the N-word outside comedy clubs.
The founder of the Papa John's pizza chain resigned as chairman following complaints that he used the word during a media-training session on race relations. A middle-school teacher in Wisconsin quit her job under pressure for citing the word as an example of inappropriate language. Princeton canceled a course on hate speech last year after students complained that a professor used the word during a discussion of offensive terms. Undoubtedly, there are some blacks who cringe at hearing the N-word in any context, but we can be fairly certain that none of them are undergraduates at Princeton.
White people are led to believe that a word that has permeated the most popular forms of comedy and music in the country for decades somehow sends black people into conniptions when they hear it in any other context. But the first time I recall hearing the word as a child, it was spoken by other blacks, and my experience is far from unique. Even today, blacks are far more likely than whites to use the term in public. And the selective outrage over its use has grown tiresome.
My third reaction to Mr. Chappelle's show was how little black comedy seems to have evolved in recent decades. Racial themes still dominate. Harping on the otherworldliness of the black experience in America still wins laughs even as our neighborhoods and schools and workplaces become more diverse and integrated. Before Bill Cosby's monstrous offstage behavior caught up with him, his career offered evidence of a huge appetite for nonracial humor from a black comedian. But Mr. Cosby continues to be the exception. Two decades into the 21st century, much of black stand-up seems stuck in the 1980s. The jokes have been updated, but the nature of the humor hasn't really changed.
Mr. Chappelle and fellow black comedian Chris Rock are still the best at what they do, but Mr. Rock's work strikes me as more subversive. While others obsess over what white people are doing, many of Mr. Rock's most memorable routines zero in on black attitudes toward education, parenting and law enforcement. His sensibilities can be as shocking as his language, especially in a political environment where personal responsibility is passe and calling attention to counterproductive behavior is a no-no. Drug companies are to blame for the opioid crisis. The gun lobby is to blame for mass shootings. Racism is to blame for racial disparities.
Last month the New York Times marked the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first black slaves to America. Slavery was a global evil dating back thousands of years, but it's often discussed only in terms of Africans being enslaved by Europeans in the Western Hemisphere. The "legacy of slavery" is regularly invoked to explain black-white differences today in everything from homeownership to single parenting. But as far back as the late 1960s, U.S. census data show black immigrants from the Caribbean, which also has a legacy of slavery, far out-earning American blacks. And second-generation black West Indians were earning more than the U.S. average for all groups.
In 1907 Booker T. Washington, the educator and former slave, published a book detailing the economic progress of blacks since emancipation. He reported that between 1860 and 1900 black homeownership rates grew from infinitesimal to more than 20%, and that among homeowners a higher percentage of blacks than whites completely owned their residences. "I am unaware that history records such an example of substantial growth in civilization in a time so short," wrote Washington. A hundred years ago, black marriage rates exceeded those of whites, and most black children were raised in two-parent homes. Today, that's no longer true and slavery can't explain the retrogression.
Liberals want to harp on how blacks have been treated, but a focus on how they progressed in earlier eras notwithstanding that treatment would be of far greater use to today's black underclass. The black experience in America is much more than a history of what whites have done to blacks, even if our politicians, commentators and comedians often find it expedient to pretend otherwise.

End the Media's Campaign Privilege

Texto completo: The Trump era has seen an erosion of the distinction between journalism and partisan politics, with much of the mainstream media in open opposition to the president. "Balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator . . . to announce his candidacy," New York Times columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote in August 2016.
Three years later, the holiday continues. Slate last month published a leaked transcript of a staff "town hall" at the Times. "We built our newsroom to cover one story," executive editor Dean Baquet told employees, explaining that the paper's narrative "went from being a story about whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia and obstruction of justice to being a more head-on story about the president's character." The new story, he said, "requires deep investigation into people who peddle hatred."
Mr. Baquet makes the Times sound like an advocacy organization working against Mr. Trump's re-election. Such organizations are regulated by campaign-finance statutes. So are other corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, that engage in electioneering speech. But those laws exempt media organizations, provided they are not owned by a political party, committee or candidate.
The justification for this favored treatment is the media's "unique" role in public discourse and debate. But that has changed -- and not only because the media have become more partisan. "With the advent of the Internet and the decline of print and broadcast media," the Supreme Court observed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), "the line between the media and others who wish to comment on political and social issues becomes far more blurred."
Like the prerevolutionary French aristocracy, media institutions enjoy legal privileges whose rationale expired long ago. As a result, their exemption from campaign-finance law is vulnerable to constitutional challenge. "We have consistently rejected the proposition that the institutional press has any constitutional privilege beyond that of other speakers," the Citizens United court declared.
The justices also indicated that a statutory privilege would be difficult to uphold. "The Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers," they wrote. "The First Amendment protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each."
The court could resolve the problem by declaring the exemption unconstitutional and applying campaign-finance laws to media organizations. But that would make journalism untenable.
Consider the ban on "coordinated communications." Under current law, corporations and other independent organizations have the right to speak for or against a candidate, but they are forbidden to develop messages "in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party committee or its agents."
After the Times town-hall transcript was published last month, lawyer and author James Hasson noted that, in emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee in 2016, "major journalists were revealed to be explicitly coordinating with the [Hillary] Clinton campaign." Among them was a Times writer who "told HRC aide Jennifer Palmieri she could 'veto whatever [she] didn't want,'" then "cut parts she objected to" from a story about Mrs. Clinton. A Politico reporter sent the DNC an entire story before publication.
News executives would argue that it is their role, not the government's, to police such ethical transgressions. They'd be right. But the rule against coordinated communication would prohibit a vast amount of ordinary journalistic behavior, too -- from interviewing candidates and campaign staffers to editing and publishing opinion articles under their bylines.
Moreover, any justification for that rule -- such as the fear of promoting corruption -- is equally applicable to media and nonmedia speakers, and becomes very weak when pure speech, such as news and commentary, is the issue.
The justices could protect everyone's right to speak and gather news by declaring the coordination rule unconstitutional as applied against anyone, as they invalidated the rule against independent corporate campaign expenditures in Citizens United. Most newspapers -- The Wall Street Journal is a notable exception -- editorialized in bitter opposition to that ruling. They may end up grateful they didn't get what they wished for.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
WU-TANG: AN AMERICAN SAGA Stream on Hulu. By the end of this year, audiences will have had two major chances to see the conception of the hip-hop collective the Wu-Tang Clan onscreen. "Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men," a multipart Showtime documentary that aired in May, told the group's story through archival footage and interviews with its members. The scripted mini-series "An American Saga" offers a factually looser version. It casts a group of actors (including Ashton Sanders, of "Moonlight" and the more recent "Native Son") as the Wu-Tang Clan's founding members, telling an embellished take on the story of their formation in New York City during the early 1990s. "The Wu-Tang story is vast and you really couldn't contain it in a two or three hour movie," the rapper RZA, who is one of the group's founding members and a creator of the series, recently told The Associated Press. "Now, in a serial form, we can take our time and tell our story."
OUR HOUSE (2017) Stream on Mubi. This perturbing Japanese drama -- the feature debut of Yui Kiyohara -- had its North American premiere at the New Directors/New Films festival in New York last year. Its setting is a modest house in a small, coastal Japanese town. The home has two sets of occupants: a mother-daughter duo and a woman paired with an amnesiac stranger. The kicker? Neither pair is aware of the other's existence. While the film has something of a horror movie premise, "it's more disquieting than terrifying," A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times last year. "Its texture is delicately emotional and boldly, eccentrically philosophical. How do we recognize the reality of other people? How can we be sure that we ourselves are real?"
CARRIE (1976) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Stephen King was still a high school English teacher when he started writing his first novel, "Carrie," about a teenage misfit who goes on a telekinetic rampage after being doused in pig's blood at a school prom. (The plot makes for an attention-grabbing elevator pitch.) The original film adaptation, directed by Brian De Palma, stars Sissy Spacek in the title role. "It's really a simple story," King told The Times in 2016. "And people saw Carrie as an extreme case of what they went through in high school."
What's on TV
I LOVE YOU PHILLIP MORRIS (2010) 7:20 p.m. on HBO Signature. "Who's going to give us money to shoot a gay con-man prison-escape love story?" The question was posed by the filmmaker Glenn Ficarra in a 2010 interview with The Times, in reference to this dark comedy. Written and directed by Ficarra and John Requa (and based on a true story), the film stars Jim Carrey as a middle-aged man who comes out, becomes a grifter and, while serving multiple stints in prison, strikes up a romance with a cellmate played by Ewan McGregor. In his review for The Times, Stephen Holden referred to the movie's general attitude as "gleefully blasé."

Texto completo: Tax scams are the tribute policy vice pays to policy virtue.
A few days ago, The Times reported on widespread abuse of a provision in the 2017 Trump tax cut that was supposed to help struggling urban workers. The provision created a tax break for investment in so-called “opportunity zones,” which would supposedly help create jobs in low-income areas. In reality the tax break has been used to support high-end hotels and apartment buildings, warehouses that employ hardly any people and so on. And it has made a handful of wealthy, well-connected investors — including the family of Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law — even wealthier.
It’s quite a story. But it should be seen in a broader context, as a symptom of the Republican Party’s unwillingness to perform the basic functions of government.
First of all, the opportunity-zone debacle isn’t the only example of abuse enabled by the Trump tax cut, which is full of destructive loopholes. That is, after all, what’s bound to happen when you ram a multitrillion-dollar bill through Congress without a single hearing, presumably out of fear that it would have been rejected if anyone had had time to figure out what was in it. The bill’s drafting was so rushed that many provisions were actually written in by hand at the last minute.
Among other things, the bum’s rush meant that much of the bill was drafted by lobbyists on behalf of their clients. Given that, it shouldn’t be a surprise that a provision sold as a policy to help the poor has actually ended up being a giveaway to hedge funds and real estate developers.
Beyond that, however, the opportunity-zone affair reflects the reality that Republicans are no longer willing to spend public money in the public interest.
I don’t mean that the GOP is committed to limited government, which would at any rate be coherent. If Republicans were willing to say, “We don’t care about the poor,” or even, “We care about the poor, but don’t consider fighting poverty an appropriate role for government,” at least they’d have the virtue of intellectual consistency.
In fact, however, the modern GOP pretends to share traditionally liberal goals, like poverty reduction or expanded health coverage. But it refuses to spend money on these goals, trying instead to bribe private investors into serving those goals by offering targeted tax breaks.
You can see this syndrome in many areas. Take, for example, the problem of America’s crumbling infrastructure, which Donald Trump claimed he would fix, and is one area in which he might have expected bipartisan support. Why hasn’t anything happened on that front? Why has “infrastructure week” become a punch line for political jokes?
A large part of the reason is that neither the Trump administration nor Republicans in Congress have been willing even to consider the idea of building infrastructure by, you know, building infrastructure.
You might think that right now there’s an overwhelming case for engaging in old-fashioned public works spending. After all, the need for new spending is obvious, and the government’s financing costs are extremely low. (Inflation-protected 10-year bonds are actually paying negative interest.) Why not just borrow some money and get to work on those bridges?
But that’s not how modern Republicans do things. The closest thing we’ve seen to an actual Trump infrastructure plan was a proposal, not for public spending, but for huge tax credits to private developers. And in practice the plan would have been more about privatizing public assets than about promoting new investment.
As far as I can tell, the last time Republicans were willing to spend serious amounts of public money for the public good was 1997, when they agreed to the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which was, by the way, highly successful. Since then it has all been about policy by tax break — which consistently fails, for at least three reasons.
First, such policies rarely trickle down to the people they’re supposedly intended to benefit. Opportunity zones aren’t the only part of the 2017 tax cut that is notably failing to deliver; remember how slashing corporate tax rates was going to lead to a surge in ordinary workers’ wages?
Second, the main beneficiaries of targeted tax cuts tend, consistently, to be a small group of wealthy individuals. Another provision of the 2017 law was a provision supposedly intended to help small businesses; in fact, 61% of the provision’s benefits are flowing to the top 1% of households.
Finally, selective tax breaks often end up mainly providing new and improved ways to dodge taxes. Rich people with smart accountants don’t have a hard time pretending to be small-business owners, developers serving poor communities or whatever else the creators of those tax breaks are ostensibly trying to promote.
The point, again, is that you shouldn’t think of the opportunity-zone fiasco as an isolated mistake. Things like this are inevitable when one of our two major political parties has basically turned its back on the very idea of productive public spending.

Texto completo: The open carry of firearms is primarily performance. Whether the performer's goal is to dramatize extreme gun rights, intimidate others, trigger the libs or cast oneself as the avenging hero in a miniseries of the mind, the practice is not just an assault on public safety. It's a theater of the absurd.
There is no evidence that open carry makes any corner of society safer. There is, on the contrary, impressive evidence that carrying firearms increases aggression and gun violence. Open carry forces people in public thoroughfares to evaluate the mental state, physical demeanor and emotional intent of every armed person they see. How exactly does one differentiate open carry from homicidal carry?
When open-carry enthusiasts in Texas began organized public performances several years ago, they went to comic lengths to pretend that marching down the street with an AR-15 was perfectly normal behavior. "A rifle on our back is part of our everyday life, just like a cellphone is part of our everyday life," one performer told The New York Times.
When other Texans declined to indulge the charade, fleeing instead, the group took extra precautions. They gave advance warning to patrons and employees at restaurants before entering. Because that's what you do at restaurants when your behavior is totally normal and healthy and not-at-all alarming.
Like civilians, law-enforcement officers must become critics of the performance, deciphering whether the performer appears threatening only because of the presence of a lethal weapon or whether the performance includes additional signals of aggression. How much symbolic aggression makes the performance unlawful? When does a performance cross the line from inherently dangerous to functionally dangerous?
Two episodes in Missouri in recent weeks reveal that the open-carry regime has no answers to such questions.
In Kansas City this month, two armed men at a Walmart caused a panic. According to an eyewitness, shoppers fled the store after seeing the men walking with pistols in their waists. Police arrived. An officer jumped out of his car with a shotgun at the ready.
The police questioned the men. Since walking around with guns is legal in Missouri, as in the vast majority of states, they were released.
Just a few days earlier, in a different part of the state, another man induced terror among Walmart shoppers. Yet the results, based entirely on the staging and reviews of his performance, were very different.
Dmitriy Andreychenko, 20, was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol when he entered a Walmart in Springfield, Mo. Mr. Andreychenko wore tactical gear and recorded himself on a cellphone as he walked the aisles. A store employee pulled an alarm, and shoppers fled.
Unlike the two men in Kansas City, Mr. Andreychenko was arrested and held on terrorism-related charges. "Missouri protects the right of people to open carry a firearm, but that does not allow an individual to act in a reckless and criminal manner endangering other citizens," a local prosecutor said in announcing the criminal charge.
Why did Mr. Andreychenko, who subsequently said he had been testing his Second Amendment rights, end up charged with a felony while the Kansas City pair walked free? What made Mr. Andreychenko's performance illegal?
It seems Mr. Andreychenko crossed a psychic border from good-guy-with-a-gun to bad-guy-facing-a-felony-charge when he donned militaristic gear and used a cellphone to record his performance. These elements apparently tipped Mr. Andreychenko's performance over an undefined, and undefinable, line.
Patrons of the Springfield Walmart were not sent fleeing for their lives at the sight of a tan vest with abundant pockets. They ran for the same reason shoppers fled the Walmart in Kansas City: They saw a man with a gun, which every American recognizes is the overture to a shooting.
Flight from men carrying guns is eminently sensible. On the other hand, requiring citizens and law-enforcement officers to guess correctly whether the men are staging a gun-culture rite or mass homicide is nothing short of deranged. In the theater world, bad reviews can kill a show. In open-carry drama, performers are empowered to murder anyone in the theater. Periodically, they do.

Should Lawrence ODonnell even be hosting a show?

Texto completo: There's a two-word phrase that will stick with MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell for some time, if not his entire career. He invoked it over and over on his Tuesday night program in reference to Donald Trump's dealings with Deutsche Bank.
"I may have some information in this next hour which would add a great deal to their understanding of that, if true, and I'll be discussing it here in the beginning of the show, O'Donnell said at the outset of his opinion program, during the handoff from colleague Rachel Maddow.
He went to the wishing well again: "I want to get your reaction to what it could mean, if true, and I stress if true,' because this is a single source.
And again: "That would explain, it seems to me, every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin, if true, and I stress the if true' part of this.
And again: "If true, that would explain every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin - if true. If true, that would be a significant factor in Vladimir Putin's publicly stated preference for presidential candidate Donald Trump over presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
And again: "Stress if true.
And ad nauseam: "If true. The key words of this opening discussion tonight are if true.'
Actually, no: The key words of the opening discussion were the uncorroborated, wish-fulfillment garbage that O'Donnell presented to his viewers: Namely that, according to his "single source, loan documents from Deutsche Bank involving Trump "show that he has co-signers. That's how he was able to obtain those loans. And that the co-signers are Russian oligarchs.
John Heilemann, an MSNBC national affairs analyst, regurgitated the cautionary phrase of the moment and then proclaimed how big a story this could be: "Got to stress if true, but if true, the reporting that you have ... it's the skeleton key, right, that opens - picks the lock on so many fundamental mysteries of the Trump era.
Well, guess what: Those fundamental mysteries are going to remain in the shadows going into the Labor Day weekend. Because, after engaging in pathological emphasis of the "if true dimension of his "reporting, O'Donnell on Wednesday was forced to retract the story on Twitter.
"Last night I made an error in judgment by reporting an item about the president's finances that didn't go through our rigorous verification and standards process. I shouldn't have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air. I will address the issue on my show tonight.
On his show, O'Donnell fessed up:
"Last night on this show, I discussed information that wasn't ready for reporting. I repeated statements a single source told me about the president's finances and loan documents with Deutsche Bank, saying if true' as I discussed the information was simply not good enough. I did not go through the rigorous verification and standards process here at MSNBC before repeating what I heard from my source.
"Had it gone through that process, I would not have been permitted to report it. I should not have said it on air or posted it on Twitter. I was wrong to do so.
"This afternoon, attorneys for the president sent us a letter asserting the story is false. They also demanded a retraction.
"Tonight, we are retracting the story. We don't know whether the information is inaccurate. But the fact is, we do know it wasn't ready for broadcast, and for that I apologize.
It raised a question: What, precisely, is the "rigorous verification and standards process to which O'Donnell's usual stories are submitted? We asked MSNBC about this gantlet, and got this back: "We're declining comment.
Deutsche Bank is a logical locus for shoddy reporting from an anti-Trump cable-news host. The outfit has distinguished itself for two decades as "the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to do business with Mr. Trump, as David Enrich of The New York Times put it. Doing business with Trump has proven to be a liability for the bank, as the House of Representatives is now seeking records that Trump won't cough up. In court documents filed this week, Deutsche Bank declared that it has tax returns related to Trump, his family or his business.
There's more: The New York Times reported in June that "federal authorities are investigating the bank's compliance with anti-money laundering statutes. "The investigation includes a review of Deutsche Bank's handling of so-called suspicious activity reports that its employees prepared about possibly problematic transactions, including some linked to President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, according to people close to the bank and others familiar with the matter, noted The New York Times report.
Another embarrassment: Deutsche Bank's private-banking operation had "several dozen accounts for Jeffrey Epstein and his businesses, also according to The New York Times. The bank alerted U.S. authorities to Epstein's moving money out of the country.
On Wednesday, Charles J. Harder of Harder LLP, a personal attorney for Trump, warned top legal officials at NBC Universal, "These statements are false and defamatory, and extremely damaging. The only borrowers under these loans are Trump entities, and Mr. Trump is the only guarantor. Numerous documents for each of these loans are also recorded, publicly available and searchable online. Thus, actual malice can easily be proven based on your reckless disregard of the truth and unreasonable reliance on an alleged source' who you will not even identify in your story and likely is seeking to mislead you and the public for political reasons or other ulterior motives.
"Actual malice is the legal standard that public figures like Trump must meet when they sue for defamation. It requires proving that the news outlet had knowledge of a damaging falsity when it published it, or that it acted with "reckless disregard of the truth. Although O'Donnell's actions are clearly reckless in layman's terms, the law adopts an even more exacting test, as this blog explained in this post. Mere failure to seek out those "publicly available records wouldn't be enough to condemn the MSNBC host as a practitioner of "reckless disregard.
Capacious and loving First Amendment protections, though, do nothing to mitigate the failings of O'Donnell. With his repeated "if true caveats, O'Donnell was mocking the core idea of journalism - which is to say, the verification of stray tips and rumors.
Reporters and TV hosts mess up all the time, broadcasting scoops that turn out to be flimsy or just plain untrue. The mistakes stem from poor execution, misunderstandings, uncooperative subjects, stupidity, groupthink - and any number of other considerations that fall short of warranting disciplinary action.
Here, the catastrophe appears to flow from one man's conclusion that having Russian oligarchs on Trump loan documents is a story that's too good to check. When we asked an MSNBC spokesperson whether O'Donnell did indeed check with someone in the Trump orbit before his report, we received another decline-to-comment response.
Is such a fellow fit to host an MSNBC program?

Muskie faced death threats in ’72 campaign

Texto completo: FBI records released to the Sun Journal on Friday show details of several investigations into claims the Democratic senator would be shot or bombed.
FBI records: Maine senator targeted during presidential bid

Federal Bureau of Investigation records released Friday show that three times in early 1972 federal investigators probed threats to kill U.S. Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, at the time a leading contender within the Democratic Party for president.
It doesn’t appear from the 1,038 pages of material released to the Sun Journal that the FBI ever tracked down two of the culprits. Federal prosecutors opted not to charge the other, a mentally ill man quickly found by agents.
The information, sought via a Freedom of Information request for anything in FBI files related to Muskie, contained little about the former senator himself. Muskie was a former Maine governor, Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1968 and U.S. secretary of state during the final year of President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
One memorandum shows that Carter notified the FBI on April 30, 1980, that he intended to nominate Muskie to replace his current secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. Field offices were told to expedite efforts to probe the Rumford, Maine, native’s background.
Agents quickly fanned out to talk with friends and family members and look at Muskie’s military records from World War II, among other things.
The memo to agents said that Muskie “will be required to make decisions concerning policy and personnel matters; therefore, during interviews, determine if appointee has expressed or manifested any bias or prejudice against any class of citizen, or any religious, racial or ethnic group. Also determine if appointee uses illegal drugs or abuses alcohol.”
Only one negative thing turned up, records show: On Dec. 28, 1965, in the tiny town of Centreville on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, Muskie was issued a criminal summons at Broadwater Farms for “attempting to take migratory water fowl with the aid of bait.”
Muskie paid the $25 fine and $2.50 administrative charge before having a guilty verdict entered on the charge in 1966. It was the only charge against Muskie that investigators unearthed and didn’t have any impact on his appointment.
Muskie was confirmed for the diplomatic post by a vote of 96-2 in the U.S. Senate on May 8, 1980.
Muskie had long been in the public eye by then, especially from the time he ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 1968 through his failed presidential bid in 1972, a period when he pushed through both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
That national attention no doubt played a role in the decision by an unknown letter writer in Bryantown, Maryland, to include him among four prominent Democrats who would allegedly be blown to bits in their Capitol Hill offices on May 4, 1972.
Bomb threats were taken seriously even in those less security-conscious days. A major blast in 1971 in the Capitol had caused serious damage, though no injuries.
Handwritten letters were dropped into a post office box addressed to Muskie and fellow U.S. Sens. George McGovern of South Dakota and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. The notes to each said they were slated to die along with U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert.
The letter to Muskie, opened the morning of May 4 in his office, told him the men would be killed “in your own offices.”
“The bomb is supposed to be dynamite, with a contact fuse,” the writer claimed in the note to Muskie. “It is pre-planned & the bomb is to be placed under chairs.”
“We hope this is not going to happen, but we really hope you will check,” the letter said, claiming it had been dictated by the Ouija Board.
The FBI managed to pull a couple of fingerprints off the envelope but could not match them with anyone. There is no indication in the file that agents ever found who sent the letters, who may have also sent threatening notes months earlier to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon, The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
In January 1972, letters signed by a G.C. Carlton in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, told Muskie, Kennedy and U.S. Sen. Edward Brooks of Massachusetts they should be shot.
In the note to Muskie, the writer said, after offering an uncharitable view of the senator’s wife, that the lawmaker “should be deported to Poland or Rome.”
“Somebody should fill you and the bastard harp Kennedy full of lead,” the letter read before it turned even more profane, ending with the insistence that both Kennedy and Muskie should “rot in hell.”
The FBI managed to find a few aliases from the same writer — his language was a dead giveaway — but appears to have had no success in determining his real identity.
The investigation ceased after an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia ruled on Feb. 24, 1972, that the letter to Muskie “does not constitute a threat within the meaning and intent” of the relevant federal statute.
That same month, a caller who phoned a number of media outlets, including United Press International in the wee hours of the morning, claimed both Muskie and Alabama Gov. George Wallace had been targeted by something called the Black Underground Military for Justice, a group that authorities knew nothing about.
Agents soon tracked him down, discovering he was someone they’d spoken with before who had a mental illness and had provided useless information in other incidents. In person, he admitted he made it all up so the matter was dropped.
Muskie died in 1996 at the age of 81.

A Lovely View From His Streets

Texto completo: The reason Bill Cunningham's photographs for The New York Times quickly morphed from occasional small street fashion or society-affair feature into an enormously popular weekly visual column called On the Street was simple.
He had an unerring eye for catching every fashion wave well before anyone else, and doing so not just on runways (though he loved designer fashion shows), but out there on the pavement of good old gritty Gotham.
Say what you will about this unfair city, the parade here never stops, and no one understood that better than a Bostonian named William J. Cunningham. Starting in the 1970s for The Times, he created a singular image of himself by visually chronicling what people (overwhelmingly New Yorkers, but also Parisians) were wearing as they went about their business. Which was often trying to get Bill to photograph them.
As Bill's features began to appear more regularly, each would showcase a fashion theme, and it was eventually decided that rather than just captions beneath the pictures, a short essay tying everything together was a better idea.
At first the essays were supplied by Bill, who would sit next to Alex Palmer, the Style department's editorial assistant and a woman of boundless charm and good humor who was a better speller and typist than he was, and dictate. The result was 50 or so words that usually, as they say, needed a little work. Often, I was the copy editor chosen to perform the procedure.
Certainly I was no fashion authority, and whatever else I spun these miniature stories into, it was not to be mistaken for gold. But apparently it was printable and I genuinely enjoyed the connection with Bill, whose enthusiasm for what he was doing was irresistible, whether one cared about fashion or not.
He would come rushing into the office with photographs, recently developed at his local pharmacy, as if they were the Rosetta stone, assuring all of us, whom he referred to as "kids" or "child," that this was the next big thing. Which inevitably it turned out to be.
Then came the essential part of the process: choosing the pictures for the layout. Bill and Nancy Newhouse, then the Style editor, would do this together. Ms. Newhouse recalled that Bill inevitably had double or triple the number that could fit in the allotted space, and passionately argued to cram in as many as possible.
"I loved going through those pictures with Bill, and always felt bad having to insist on fewer rather than more," she said recently, "but he was always a good sport."
He never gave up trying, however. After the copy was edited and the photos carefully winnowed, Bill was free to run back outside, hop on his bicycle and pedal up to Midtown to see what else he could find.
This habit did not please everyone in our department. In that Paleolithic era, designing pages was a cumbersome process, and substituting different photos as deadlines loomed (and the Style pages were among those that had to close early), could create instant migraines for our editors and art director.
A particular sufferer was Morton D. Stone. Over the years, Bill worked with a number of talented photo editors. Tiina Loite, who edited "Bill Cunningham: On the Street," the new book from Clarkson Potter from which these images were chosen, was the Style photo editor in the 1990s and 2000s, which could be described as his breakout period.
But during my stint in that department the photo editor was Mort Stone. Mort possessed both skill and taste. He was also unflappable, as long as you drop the first syllable off that word. At the sight of Bill returning to the newsroom and the clock ticking, the color would drain from Mort's face. "Oh my God," he'd moan. "He's back!"
Those days inevitably ended at the upstairs bar at Sardi's, the famed theater district restaurant where Mort sought solace. Loathing the thought of a man drinking alone, I usually felt the least I could do was join him. By the second Scotch, Mort would volunteer that while Bill's late additions may have created some peptic havoc, they made the feature better.
Mort was a pro, and like all of us, a genuine admirer of Bill's work. It was simply impossible not to be. If Vincent Sardi had known that Bill was responsible for some of his best customers, he would have been an admirer, too.
Thinking back on those days, it is difficult to imagine two more different personalities than Bill and Mort. It's also difficult to think of two other Timespeople for whom I felt more utter devotion, and I was not alone there. The difference was that Mort became an open, personal friend to a number of us, while Bill had a genius for elusivene
Much has been made of his dedication to his work and his spartan life style. At the same time he seemed endlessly upbeat and brimming with enthusiasm. "Hey there, Alex, young fella," he would greet the not-so-young me in the Times cafeteria years after we had stopped working together. After a few quick pleasantries, he was suddenly off. "Gotta get snappin' and crackin'," he'd say, "lots going on out there and I don't want to miss it."
Not many of us really knew a lot about Bill until the documentary "Bill Cunningham New York" was released in 2010. It showed the snappin' and crackin' on the street, all right, but also his monastic digs in Carnegie Hall, where he slept on a pallet balanced on two of an almost uncountable number of file cabinets that held his life's considerable work, and used what seemed to be a public bathroom down the hall.
The film delved into his childhood and time in the Army and offered up an excruciating moment when the subject of his sexuality left him totally frozen.
All those cabinets came back into focus a year and a half ago when serious research began on the book that goes on sale this week. If there is a key to who Bill was, it is crammed into the folders that are crammed into them.
And what an amazing treasure they hold. Hundreds of thousands of contact sheets and prints, many of which have detailed notes and drawings from couture shows in Paris and New York appended to them. There are scores of magazines, notebooks, invitations, thank-you notes, programs from shows. Your first question is, did he ever sleep?
The answer, apparently, is not much, if at all. Enid Nemy, a longtime Style reporter who frequently worked with Bill, confirmed what became his stripped-down lifestyle. "He didn't care about food or drink -- believe me, I went to his apartment on several occasions and I'll tell you, the only thing in his refrigerator was film," she said.
Ms. Nemy also recalled Bill's strong reluctance to ever accept favors, large or small, which Anna Wintour confirms in a warm essay in the new book, recalling numerous offers of a ride, which he accepted only once, when he could not budge his bicycle in a snowstorm. When she dropped him off at the Times building, she writes, he jumped out of the car so quickly that she hardly had time to say goodbye.
A man who prized his independence, Bill for years insisted on working as a freelancer for The Times. He relented in the early 1980s, when one day, Nancy Newhouse recalled, he shyly indicated that he would like to go on staff, the advantages and security of benefits having become clear to him.
But, she said, "It took a while for him to ask me where to pick up his paycheck. He found the subject embarrassing." The arrangement didn't last long, and Bill returned to freelancing until 1993, when he suffered serious injuries in a bicycle accident and quickly came back to the fold.
According to Enid Nemy, "Bill had three main interests: fashion shows, big charity parties and, most enduringly, what people were wearing on the street. And he became enormously influential in all three.
"For one thing, his knowledge of the history of fashion was simply more developed than anyone else's," she said. "He would look at a Dior design at a show and immediately be able to trace its lineage and influences. As for parties, his presence at them meant everything. The general feeling was that if Bill didn't show up to photograph a big event, well, it simply didn't really happen.
"And he loved to be out on the street because he didn't like to miss anything," she added. "People were aware of him, knew where he'd be near Bergdorf's, so that's where they'd be. And they'd talk about how many times they made Bill's column. His impact was phenomenal."
Bill preferred to call himself a fashion historian or, more modestly, a reporter, and he certainly fit those descriptions. As Ms. Loite points out in her preface to the book, he was reluctant to call himself a photographer. To which I want to say, "Oh please, Bill, give me a break."
So what would Bill Cunningham, the reporter-historian-nonphotographer photographer think of this book? I'm pretty sure I know what he'd say, which is something along the lines of "Well, child, it's just a collection of stuff that helped fill space in the paper."
And, you know something? He'd be right. But as far as stuff goes, kids, it's not too bad.

Texto completo: An American soldier was killed in combat in Afghanistan, according to the U.S. Department of Defense.
Sgt. 1st Class Dustin B. Ard, 31, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, died Aug. 29, 2019, after sustaining wounds in the Zabul Province, Afghanistan.
The New York Times reported Dustin Ard died after disembarking a helicopter at the start of a joint mission with Afghan commandos, though the exact circumstances of his death remain unclear.
Bruce Ard confirmed the his son’s death on the Facebook page of Idaho state Sen. Rob Furniss, saying, “My heart has a hole so big I can hardly stand it. He was the finest young man I have ever known.”
Bruce Ard — who is the former mayor of Ammon, Idaho — went on to say Dustin Ard was “A great son, brother, father, and husband. He loved his country and was the kind of person we should all be.”
According to Post Register, Dustin Ard left behind his wife, Mary, and a 3-year-old daughter, Reagan. The couple also is expecting a son.
Born in Idaho Falls, Idaho, on October 4, 1987, Dustin Ard enlisted in the Army in Hyde Park, Utah, in 2011 as a Special Forces candidate. He had served two tours in Afghanistan and had participated in Joint Combined Exchange Training exercises in Indonesia.
“Sgt. 1st Class Ard’s loss is felt across our 1st Special Forces group family,” said Col. Owen G. Ray, commander of 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne). “Our priority now is to take care of his family and our soldiers and provide the best possible care that we can during this incredible time of need.”
Dustin Ard is the third American soldier to die this week. Last week, two Special Forces soldiers were killed in Faryab Province. According to The New York Times, his death brings the number of American troops killed in combat so far this year to 15, the highest number of losses in a year since 2014, when the Pentagon announced the end of combat operations in Afghanistan. Thirteen troops were killed in 2018, and 11 in 2017.
The Salt Lake Tribune will add more to this story as it develops.

Texto completo: Tensions between the White House and Fox News ratcheted up this week after President Trump declared that the network was letting his supporters down and two on-air personalities said they "don't work" for him.
The back-and-forth began Wednesday when Mr. Trump took to Twitter to rebuke the network for airing an interview with Xochitl Hinojosa, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Trump said Ms. Hinojosa was "heavily promoting" Democratic candidates with "zero pushback" from the anchor, Sandra Smith.
"They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win," he wrote.
Referring to the network as "the new Fox News," he continued by saying the network "is letting millions of GREAT people down!"
"We have to start looking for a new News Outlet," he added. "Fox isn't working for us anymore!"
This was not the first time that Mr. Trump had expressed frustration with Fox News, but it was eye-opening. The president has good relationships with many of Fox's on-air personalities, including the hosts of "Fox & Friends," Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Laura Ingraham. His former spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, signed on as a Fox News contributor last week.
But whether this is a sign of genuine deterioration in relations between the president and his preferred cable channel or a short-lived dust-up will be closely watched by news executives and throughout the Beltway.
On Thursday, two on-air personalities responded to Mr. Trump's tweets.
Neil Cavuto, an anchor for Fox News and Fox Business Network who has been critical of Mr. Trump in the past, said on the air: "Mr. President, we don't work for you. I don't work for you. My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you. Just report on you -- to call balls and strikes on you. My job, Mr. President -- our job here -- is to keep score, not settle scores."
"You're entitled to your point of view, Mr. President," he continued. "But you're not entitled to your own set of facts."
Brit Hume, a senior political analyst for Fox News, echoed Mr. Cavuto's comments and tweeted, "Fox News isn't supposed to work for you."
"We have tried to be fair to him in our news coverage," Mr. Hume said in another tweet responding to someone who had asked why Mr. Trump thought Fox worked for him. "Best example: we didn't fall for the Russia conspiracy theory that ended in such a fiasco for other outlets. Plus, some of our opinion hosts support Trump. (Others don't.)"
Fox News declined to comment for this article. The White House declined to comment on Mr. Trump's complaints about Fox News or Mr. Cavuto's retort, preferring to leave the sparring to the president himself.
While in office, Mr. Trump has reserved his most cantankerous barbs for other news outlets. This week alone, he has attacked The New York Times, The Washington Post, Axios and NBC.
But the president has increased his criticism of Fox News in recent months. On Sunday, he said the network was "not what it used to be" when he expressed unhappiness with a poll. He has also attacked the Fox News contributor Donna Brazile, the anchors Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace, and the Fox analyst Juan Williams.
Early this month, Mr. Trump said that "watching Fake News CNN" was better than watching Mr. Smith's show and that "whenever possible" he turned to the One America News Network. When Mr. Wallace interviewed the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg in May, Mr. Trump said Fox News was "moving more and more to the losing side."
By Friday afternoon, it appeared that Mr. Trump had other targets on his mind.
Over the course of two hours, he had tweeted four videos on the Justice Department's critical inspector general report regarding the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey. All four clips featured guests criticizing Mr. Comey, and all four clips were from Fox News.

'Factory' offers peek at Obamas' mission

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

David Brooks: The man Trump wishes he were

Texto completo: In the first few months of his presidency, Donald Trump surrounded himself with a certain sort of ramrod military man: John Kelly, Michael Flynn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. These men had or appeared to have the kind of manly virtues and bearing that Trump likes to see in himself: courage, toughness, combativeness.
But when you look at how someone like, say, Jim Mattis forged his character, you realize that he is actually the exact opposite of Trump. Mattis built strengths and virtues through the steady application of intense effort over decades. Trump is a man who has been progressively hollowed out by the acid of his own self-regard.
Mattis is a man who is intensely loyal to others and attracts loyalty among those around him. Trump is disloyal to others and attracts disloyalty in return.
The contrast between how these two men were forged is so stark that it throws into relief how character is and isn’t formed.
Mattis was a mediocre college student. He partied too much and was jailed for underage drinking. But then he discovered the Marine Corps. His new book, “Call Sign Chaos,” which he wrote with Bing West and which will be released next week, is purportedly about leadership but really it is a portrait of Mattis’ life-defining love for the Marine Corps.
His prose sings when he describes those times when he was out on some battlefield exercise with front-line Marines. When he is stuck away inside the Pentagon or high up commanding NATO, you feel his longing for their presence.
Mattis reads Roman writers like Marcus Aurelius, but he is no stoic. Decade after decade he is touring some front or another, starting a million affectionate conversations. “How’s it going?” “Living the dream, sir,” is how those conversations begin. He trusts his Marines enough to delegate authority down. He clearly expresses commander’s intent in any situation and gives them latitude to adapt to circumstances.
Love is a motivational state. It propels you. You want to make promises to the person or organization you love. Character is forged in the keeping of those promises. If, on the other hand, you are unable to love and be loved, you’re never going to be in a position to make commitments or live up to them. You’re never going to forge yourself into a person who can be relied upon.
Mattis’ drive, born of his devotion to the Corps, is his most telling trait. He works insanely hard, propels himself extremely quickly, making himself, every day, a better Marine. Much of the work is intellectual. He thought the second Iraq War was a crazy idea, but when he was ordered to command part of it, he started reading Xenophon and ancient books about warfare in Mesopotamia.
“If you haven’t read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren’t broad enough to sustain you,” Mattis and West write.
He is also willing to submit himself to an institution. Somebody like Trump is anti-institutional. He thinks every organization is about himself, and every organization’s procedures and traditions should bend to his desires.
But a person with an institutional mindset has a deep reverence for the organization he has joined and how it was built by those who came before. He understands that institutions pass down certain habits, practices and standards of excellence.
Mattis asserts that his way of doing warfare is simply the Marine way. In the Marine way, for example, “Amateur performance is anathema, and the Marines are bluntly critical of falling short. … Personal sensitivities are irrelevant.” Each mission gives him another body of knowledge, another strength, greater capacity to live execute his devotion to his country.
James Davison Hunter, who wrote, “The Death of Character,” once noted that good character does not require religious faith. “But it does require the conviction of truth made sacred, abiding as an authoritative presence within consciousness and life, reinforced by habits institutionalized within a moral community. Character, therefore, resists expedience; it defies hasty acquisition. This is undoubtedly why Søren Kierkegaard spoke of character as ‘engraved,’ deeply etched.”
In Mattis’ career you see something one saw in the great George Marshall’s career: that you need to work within a structure to be creative. Both generals were total company men, dedicated to their service, yet they were constantly trying to change its practices to keep up with the times.
Mattis barely mentions Trump in this book and doesn’t describe what must have been one of the truly challenging tasks of his life — working under Trump without getting tainted.
He didn’t write about Trump because he didn’t want to undermine the people still working inside the administration. But, he told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic: “There is a period in which I owe my silence. It’s not eternal. It’s not going to be forever.”
Like Goldberg, I think it would be proper for Mattis to end his silence about Trump before the next election. Voters need his firsthand perspective to make a judgment about the fitness and character of the commander in chief.

Resumen: New revelations have made clear the conclusion many of us had already come to: James Comey was a reckless and untrustworthy FBI director.

Texto completo: Since President Trump fired FBI director James Comey in May 2017, Comey has been portrayed as a martyr and saint by much of the media. Comey fueled the adulation with his memoir, “A Higher loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership. ” But today’s report by the Justice Department Inspector General should obliterate whatever halo Comey still possesses.
Comey wrote seven memos summarizing his interactions with Donald Trump. After he was fired, Comey sent one of those memos to a personal friend and lawyer and directed him to leak the contents to a specific New York Times reporter. The leak achieved the result Comey sought — the appointment of a special counsel to investigate President Trump.
James Comey's decision that he was above FBI policy
Today's report documents how Comey brazenly violated federal and FBI policies regarding with his disclosures. Top FBI officials told the IG that they were "shocked," "stunned," and "surprised’ that Comey would leak the contents of one of the memos to a reporter. The IG concluded: “The unauthorized disclosure of this information — information that Comey knew only by virtue of his position as FBI Director — violated the terms of his FBI Employment Agreement and the FBI's Prepublication Review Policy. ”
Where's our apology:James Comey is back to remind us how Donald Trump got elected
Comey claimed that most of the memos he wrote while FBI chief regarding his dealings with Trump were “personal documents” like his will or his passport. That defense cannot even pass the laugh test. The IG concluded that the memos were “official FBI records” and that Comey violated FBI rules by “failing to either surrender his copies of Memos 2, 4, 6, and 7 to the FBI or seek authorization to retain them; by releasing official FBI information and records to third parties without authorization; and by failing to immediately alert the FBI about his disclosures to his personal attorneys once he became aware in June 2017 that Memo 2 contained” information “that the FBI had determined were classified at the ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ level. ”
When asked why he violated FBI policy on leaking the memo to the media, Comey declared that the issue was of “incredible importance to the Nation, as a whole” and that he leaked because it was “something I [had] to do if I love this country…and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI. ” Comey apparently believed that his affection exempted him from the rules that all other current and former FBI officials must follow.
The IG found it “particularly concerning” that Comey failed to disclose to the FBI that he retained copies of his official memos in his personal safe at home even after FBI officials visited his house to remove all FBI property. "Comey took for himself the 'carte blanche authority' expressly denied by the courts" to FBI officials, the report complained.
The IG concluded that by using sensitive information “to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees — and the many thousands more former FBI employees — who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information. ” The IG report warned that "the civil liberties of every individual who may fall within the scope of the FBI's investigative authorities depend on FBI's ability to protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure. "
This is true but it ignores the FBI’s long record of violating Americans’ liberties and covert political interventions. As Yale University historian Beverly Gage noted, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover “insisted that investigative files be kept secret, waging repeated battles to keep them away from the courts and Congress. But he also became a master of the leak, parceling out choice tidbits to reporters at strategic moments. ” Hoover’s FBI covertly intervened in the presidential elections of 1948 (seeking to sabotage Henry Wallace’s campaign), 1952 (smearing Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson as gay), and 1964 (spying on the campaign of Republican nominee Barry Goldwater).
This misconduct rings similar to what was allowed from Hillary Clinton
Comey’s abuse of power to undermine President Trump should be viewed in light of last year’s Inspector General report on the FBI’s kowtowing in their investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server. The FBI chose to exonerate Secretary Clinton despite her violations of federal laws on the handling of confidential information and despite the destruction of evidence and false statements by her aides and associates. The FBI intended to absolve her “absent a confession from Clinton” when they finally interviewed her in July 2016. Comey assured the IG that “by her demeanor, she was credible and open and all that kind of stuff” in that interview — even though FBI agents there believed Clinton had lied to them about not realizing she received confidential information.
Lack of accountability:Trump wants to strike fear in anyone who might investigate or expose him, and it's working
The Justice Department, choosing not to prosecute the former FBI chief for the violations disclosed Thursday, awarded Comey the same “get out of jail free” card that the FBI granted to Hillary Clinton. Other FBI officials who have been investigated were not so lucky. Fourteen FBI officials have been referred to the bureau’s Office of Professional Responsibility for leaks or unauthorized disclosures in recent years, and several of them were fired, suspended, or censured, according to internal FBI documents disclosed by Judicial Watch. Though Comey’s leaks had far greater impact and propelled a lengthy investigation that eventually concluded that there was no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, his lofty former position may have insulated him from legal perils.
Thursday's report is a reminder that Trump’s frequent falsehoods do not automatically make his opponents trustworthy. Americans have yet to learn the full extent of illegitimate and/or tawdry political and bureaucratic meddling during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. There is at least one more Inspector General report pending on the FBI's conduct regarding the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) wiretaps of the Trump campaign — a report that may prove far more troublesome to plenty of former FBI officials.

Texto completo: Hurricane Dorian gains strength. Alex Trebek is back in action. And it’s not too late to say sorry to James Comey.
It’s Ashley. Here’s the news you need to know Thursday.
But first, genetics are complicated: The largest study of its kind found new evidence that genes do contribute to same-sex sexual behavior but echoes research that says there's no "gay gene. "
Calm before Hurricane Dorian
Floridians are closely monitoring Hurricane Dorian, which could hit the state early Monday as a Category 4 hurricane. If it hits as a Category 4, with winds of 130 mph, the damage could be catastrophic: "Well-built framed homes can sustain severe damage with loss of most of the roof structure and/or some exterior walls," the National Hurricane Center said. Forecasters say it’s too early to tell where Dorian, now a Category 1, will have the greatest impact, but any part of the coast between the Florida Keys and the southern part of Georgia could be a landing spot. After that, the storm’s path would be unpredictable.
The most powerful hurricane in US history was a nameless storm that rocked Florida on Labor Day 1935.
Donated kidneys are being thrown away
About 12 people die every day waiting for a kidney, but an estimated 10 donated kidneys are discarded daily. The U. S. ditches about 3,500 donated kidneys a year, many of which could be used to save lives, new research shows. The study, published Monday, showed the U. S. threw away almost 28,000 donated kidneys between 2004 and 2014, often because the donor had hypertension, diabetes, a heart attack or tested positive for Hepatitis C. Last year, nearly 100,000 Americans were on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.
What everyone’s talking about
The third Democratic debate lineup is LIVE! Here's who made the cut.
Bradley Cooper has a mustache now, and the internet is not okay.
Confused ball boy to Venus Williams, probably: “Ma’am… your coffee. "
A very good boy Secret Service dog is being honored for stopping a White House intruder.
A nearly 18-foot python was caught in Florida. Hours later, a second �� was captured.
What is excellent news?
Legendary "Jeopardy!" host Alex Trebek delivered the answer to that question Thursday, telling fans he has completed chemotherapy treatments for cancer and is hard at work on Season 36 of the syndicated quiz show. "I've gone through a lot of chemotherapy, and thankfully that is now over. I'm on the mend, and that's all I can hope for right now," said Trebek, 79. Trebek announced his Stage 4 pancreatic cancer diagnosis in March. "Let me tell you, it’s going to be a good year," he said.
Former FBI chief James Comey is off the hook
Former FBI Director James Comey broke bureau rules when he kept memos at home about his interactions with President Donald Trump and then had a friend describe one to The New York Times. The Justice Department's inspector general reported Thursday that the memos shouldn't have been revealed (to lawyers OR reporters) without FBI approval. Yet prosecutors found no reason to file criminal charges against him. Within minutes of the report's release, Comey took to Twitter, asserting that the report had absolved him of any wrongdoing.
Real quick
An arrest warrant was issued for Los Angeles Lakers center DeMarcus Cousins on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge.
A judge formally ended the criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein, but not without a final tribute to the women who spoke out against the financier.
The El Paso shooting suspect says he bought his AK-47 style weapon from Romania and ammunition from Russia, a report says.
The brother-in-law of a Tampa Bay Rays minor league baseball pitcher is under suicide watch as officials struggle to find a motive in the slaying of the athlete’s family.
Rep. Ilhan Omar denied allegations by a woman who said Omar was dating her political consultant husband.
This shouldn't be the new normal
A Nevada college student was arrested Wednesday after police found a rifle and 2,000 rounds of ammunition in his car parked on campus. The 27-year-old student told university police he forgot that the weapon and ammo were inside the vehicle, College of Southern Nevada president Federico Zaragoza said.
At a North Carolina university, a 19-year-old freshman "obsessed with mass shootings" was arrested Tuesday in his dorm room with two firearms. He told police he planned to kill his High Point University roommate and himself if he failed to get into a fraternity, prosecutors said.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped her bid for president Wednesday after she failed to qualify for the next Democratic debate.
Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, posted a video message to her supporters confirming her decision, making her the latest Democrat to drop out of the crowded field looking to challenge Republican President Donald Trump next year.
A 10-year veteran of the Senate, Gillibrand campaigned heavily throughout Iowa and New Hampshire in the months after launching her campaign in January.
But she struggled to raise campaign funds and generate support in the key public-opinion polls used to determine the field for the primary debates, leaving her out of next month's ABC News/Univision debate in Houston.
In a video posted to her social media accounts, Gillibrand vowed to continue to work to defeat Trump and flip the Senate into Democratic hands.
"I know this isn't the result we wanted," Gillibrand said. "We wanted to win this race. But it's important to know when it's not your time and to know how you can best serve your community and country."
Gillibrand, of Brunswick, Rensselaer County, made family-related issues a centerpiece of her campaign, often highlighting her experiences as a mother as she pushed for a national paid family leave policy.
She was also outspoken on abortion issues, vowing only to appoint Supreme Court justices who support Roe v. Wade abortion rights.
Gillibrand, 52, was re-elected to a six-year term in the Senate last November. Within days of her re-election, she confirmed interest in a 2020 presidential bid despite previously vowing to serve a full Senate term.
She has been in the Senate since 2009, when she was appointed to succeed Hillary Clinton, who had gone on to become secretary of state.
Prior to that, Gillibrand served in the House of Representatives, representing a conservative-leaning district north of Albany.
Gillibrand based her presidential campaign in Troy, not far from her upstate New York home.
Officially eliminated from debate This week, she was officially eliminated from the upcoming Sept. 12 debate when she failed to meet the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold, which required candidates to garner 2% support in at least four qualified polls and have at least 130,000 individual donors to make the debate stage.
In an interview with The New York Times, Gillibrand said she would endorse a Democratic candidate in the race but has not yet decided who.
She also vowed to support the eventual Democratic nominee.
Gillibrand did qualify for the first two Democratic primary debates, enjoying a viral moment in the second one when asked what her first act as president would be.
"The first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said to big applause.
In a tweet, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, called Gillibrand a "great talent, a rising star in the Democratic Party & a good friend."
"The people of NY are fortunate to have her back full time," Cuomo tweeted.
Gillibrand's exit leaves two New York Democrats vying for their party's presidential nomination: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Andrew Yang, a New York City entrepreneur who was born in Schenectady.
Yang qualified for the next debate; de Blasio did not.

After Rape Case Unravels, Ex-Detectives Plead Guilty to Lesser Crimes

Texto completo: In 2017, two New York Police Department detectives faced more than 40 sexual-abuse charges and 25 years in prison after they were accused of handcuffing an 18-year-old woman and raping her in the back of a police van.
Over the course of nearly two years, the case slowly unraveled as lawyers in the case disclosed cellphone records and other evidence that punched holes in the woman's inconsistent timeline and description of events that night, forcing prosecutors to discard her testimony and indict the officers on lesser charges.
On Thursday morning, the two detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, pleaded guilty to bribery and official misconduct charges in a deal that called for five years probation -- and no jail time.
After negotiations had stalled between prosecutors and defense lawyers, the judge in the case intervened on Thursday morning, leading to the plea deal ahead of the detectives' scheduled September trial, officials said.
Eric Gonzalez, Brooklyn's district attorney, said in a statement that while he "would have preferred to see them serve prison time," the plea will send a message that sexual misconduct between officers and people in custody will not be tolerated.
"These defendants engaged in a shocking abuse of power, which they finally acknowledged," Mr. Gonzalez said. "They are no longer members of our Police Department and with today's plea are convicted felons."
Lawyers for the two detectives said their clients had engaged in sex acts with a teenager who was trying to avoid arrest, but that they were not sexual predators.
"This was never a rape case," said Mark Bederow, Mr. Martins's lawyer.
But the woman's attorney, Michael David, said the defense worked to misinterpret her testimony and to shame her.
"They are getting away with rape," Mr. David said. "This is a very sad day for victims of sexual misconduct at the hands of the police. They got away with it. She has no justice."
According to initial testimony, on Sept. 15, 2017, the two plainclothes detectives from Brooklyn South Narcotics arrested the 18-year-old woman for carrying a small amount of pot, then handcuffed her and led her to the back of a police van.
The woman, whom The New York Times has not identified because of the nature of the original charges, told prosecutors that a routine drive to a Brooklyn precinct became her worst nightmare as the detectives took turns sexually assaulting her. Details about the allegations, released just as the #MeToo movement was gaining traction, pushed legislators in Albany to pass a common-sense law making it a crime for police officers to have sex with people in custody.
The two men, who prosecutors said did not report the incident to their superiors, originally faced more than 40 charges that included kidnapping, rape and sexual assault.
But as the case progressed, details emerged that cast doubt about her testimony to investigators and a grand jury, including evidence from cellphones and security cameras that did not match her original statements. The woman had said the detectives drove along the Belt Parkway, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and past a location she said knew by heart, her grandmother's home in Bay Ridge.
The cellphone records showed they never left Coney Island.
Advocates for victims of sexual assault have said it is not uncommon for rape victims to make inconsistent statements because of shame or trauma after an attack.
But other details muddied her story as well, including what she was wearing that night -- sweatpants, not the miniskirt that she had said helped to facilitate the attack -- and her description of the van, which had bucket seats, not the bench seats she had described.
In light of the new revelations, the district attorney dropped the most severe charges in March.
Earlier this year, prosecutors released a letter acknowledging that the woman had made "a series of false, misleading and inconsistent statements about the facts of this case and about collateral or unrelated matters" and that "she made some false statements under oath."
Prosecutors, who said they had DNA evidence to prove that a sexual encounter took place, recalibrated and sought a second indictment that included bribery and misconduct charges.
The new law, Mr. Gonzalez said, will strengthen similar cases going forward, "closing a loophole to claim that the sex was consensual."
Mr. Bederow, Mr. Martins's attorney, said the case should not have dragged on for nearly two years. He said prosecutors used his client as a scapegoat at a time when the #MeToo movement was forcing a reckoning for high-powered men in the world of Hollywood and politics.
"What the district attorney did was follow the political climate," Mr. Bederow said. "They finally acted on the eve of the trial."
Peter Guadagnino, Mr. Hall's attorney, said the detectives' reputations have been irreparably tarnished, no matter their plea. Sentencing is set for Oct. 10.
"This was simply a case of a woman offering a bribe and the two defendants accepted it," Mr. Guadagnino said. "And that's it. It was all lie. They never raped anybody. How do you come back from that?"

Texto completo: HOOVER, Ala. — The first time Ed Orgeron, Louisiana State's football coach, led a Southeastern Conference program, Steve Spurrier had a warning when all of the region's gridiron gods kept their jobs from one season to the next.
“Folks, look around," Orgeron remembered Spurrier, then at South Carolina, saying at a 2006 meeting of the league's coaches. “It ain't going to be like this next year."
A similar grounded-in-history, watch-your-back admonition is in order this year as college football teams begin a new season. For the first time since 2006, every SEC football team has returned its head coach — perhaps as close as the notoriously demanding, overbearing and fickle conference can come to signaling some form of patience or contentedness.
Yet no one seems quite certain how 14 of the South's most scrutinized men together achieved a measure of group job security, tenuous as it might be, found in no other Power Five conference this past offseason.
“It's an enigma," Phillip Fulmer, the athletic director at Tennessee, said in an interview 13 years after he was a member of the conference's last stable head coaching corps. “I think it's an aberration."
Certainly so. Between the 2012 season, when Missouri and Texas A&M first played in the conference, and 2017, the SEC averaged about two head coaching changes a year. Ahead of the 2018 season, five teams hired new leaders, and Mississippi removed the “interim" tag from its coach. Then, despite all the chatter about who was up and who was down and whether a college might pay someone's seven-figure buyout, nothing changed for 2019.
Coaches and administrators suggested university officials were increasingly learning to shrug off more of the social media furor that follows a questionable decision, a blown lead or an old-fashioned blowout.
Some said the big buyout costs tied to the league's coaching contracts influenced decisions — as of April, according to a USA Today database, at least nine SEC head coaches had school buyouts exceeding $10 million. Others noted that university leaders had come to believe that only so many coaches might be prepared for everything that comes with coaching in a conference that does more swaggering than most. This summer, Spurrier was among those who suspected that the turnover before the 2018 season gave rise to the stability — and that it would prove fleeting.
Indeed, it's all too easy to imagine some booster someplace sharpening a knife and suggesting that a seven-win season is simply insufficient. There is always a demand for speed: Most SEC coaches who wind up unemployed lose their jobs because they just lose too many football games to the wrong rivals — and too quickly.
“The more time you have as a coach, you can really build your program and recruit to a certain personality that fits who you are," said Matt Luke, the coach at Mississippi. “Fortunately or unfortunately, this is a performance-based business."
But the development of a title-winning program, several coaches noted, is not instant. Nick Saban, the most feted coach of the era, was 7-6 in his first year at Alabama before NCAA penalties reduced the win total to two.
He posted a 12-2 record the next season. He capped his third season in Tuscaloosa with a national championship and was quickly honored with a 9-foot bronze statue outside Bryant-Denny Stadium.
Saban and Kirby Smart of Georgia have as much employment certainty as any coaches in the sport. Orgeron, whose last team finished at No. 6 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, betrays no worries, and Mark Stoops just presided over a 10-3 season at Kentucky.
And the head coaches who are entering their second seasons with their current programs have some time, at least conceivably.
“Most of them have such big buyouts, they may get an extra year to see if they can get it going," Spurrier said. “But if you lose two or three years in a row, they've got plenty of money, and they'll have to make changes. It's as simple as that." For some coaches, the sameness of the league's coaching ranks could have a subtle, though important, effect. Previous game film, coaches said, was more relevant when a team's top man remained in place, and coaches said having a history with an opponent could offer motivation, whether for revenge or preservation of pride.
“It's nice if you know a little more about them," Fulmer said, “but that also means they know a little more about you."
There are limits, though, to the potential advantages. Half the conference's teams changed offensive coordinators, close to the average over the last five years. Georgia and Ole Miss have new defensive and offensive coordinators.
Dan Mullen of Florida, who was an offensive coordinator there during the 2006 season, quickly noted the potential consequences of coordinator changes when he considered the lack of turnover this year.
“You're going to have to deal with that part of it, you know, whoever's calling the plays and how you adjust to those things," he said from the stage of SEC media days in July.
The conference's head coaching corps of 2005 and 2006 did not endure, of course. In a move still shaping football throughout the South, a frustrated Alabama soon ousted Mike Shula and, in January 2007, hired Saban.
Some moved to other colleges or pivoted to the NFL. One, Tommy Tuberville of Auburn, coached at two more universities and is now in a Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat. Others retired.
“It's nice to have some tangible skills or transferable skills when you're out of work, you know?" Derek Mason, who is 24-38 as he enters his sixth season at Vanderbilt, said after his past as a radio show host came up this summer. “That's sort of what happens every once in a while in our business."

Surgeon General to teens and pregnant women: Weed is way too risky for developing brains

Resumen: 'No amount of marijuana use in pregnancy or adolescence is safe,' said Surgeon General Jerome Adams.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=Surgeon+General+to+teens+and+pregnant+women%3A+Weed+is+way+too+risky+for+developing+brains&amp;author=O%27Donnell%2C+Jayne&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-08-29&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: "As I like to say, this ain't your mother's marijuana," he added.
The "rapid normalization" of marijuana use by young people is of particular concern, Adams said. It's now the third most common illegal substance used by high school students after alcohol and electronic cigarettes, he said, and one in five of teens who try it will become addicted. Teens are also more likely to miss or drop out of school, and significant drops in cognition have been reported in adults who started using as young teens.
"Just like the famous advisory on tobacco in 1964, the significance of today's marijuana advisory cannot be overstated," said Kevin Sabet, a former Obama Administration drug policy adviser who now heads the advocacy group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. "Administration officials should be applauded for finally shining a light on the harms of today's high potent marijuana. "
Weed while pregnant: Far more common and concerning than many realize
Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, a psychiatrist who heads HHS' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said a "significant increase" in marijuana use starting at age 12 was particularly troubling. The brain, she said, is still developing from age 18 to 24. Marijuana use can't be definitively cited as the cause of higher rates of major depression and suicide, but she said increases are seen in studies among young people who use the drug.
Thursday's advisory and awareness campaign, paid for in part by President Trump's recent donation of his second-quarter salary, comes as state and federal health officials are investigating some 200 cases of severe lung illnesses among people using e-cigarettes.
Adams and regulators continued to warn against vaping overall. They did not flag the problem of THC oil or other contaminants as a potential cause of the recent spike in illnesses, as two leading academic researchers and the vaping industry contend may be the case.
The advisory also addressed the growing problem of cannabis-induced psychosis and schizophrenia linked to marijuana use. It was the highest level acknowledgement of the problem, and went further than the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conclusion in a 2017 report that schizophrenia and other psychoses "are correlated with, but not necessarily caused by, heavy marijuana use. "
"Marijuana use is linked to risk for and early onset of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia," said the advisory. "The risk for psychotic disorders increases with frequency of use, potency of the marijuana product, and as the age at first use decreases. "
More: Car crashes, psychosis, suicide: Is the drive to legalize marijuana ignoring major risks?
The National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws lashed out at the advisory, calling it "fear-mongering. ”
“Our current model of federal prohibition represents the utter lack of control over any aspect of marijuana or the marijuana market," NORML said in a statement. "The Surgeon General’s time would be better spent advocating for a legally and tightly regulated cannabis market — one in which we educate Americans about the potential harms and benefits of cannabis through evidence-based public education campaigns. . . . "
The Surgeon General's findings, however, were a relief to author and former New York Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson, who said he has struggled to get traditional media attention for his book, "Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence. "
"The cannabis lobby is desperate to try to shout down any discussion of the links between cannabis and mental illness and will personally attack anyone who tries to raise the issue," said Berenson. "It will be far harder for them to do so in the future now that the Surgeon General — the nation's leading physician, a non-partisan authority on health — has confirmed these links. "

Texto completo: The media are poised to deliver another election victory to President Donald Trump, because their constant bashing of the president turns off many Americans who are middle-of-the-road voters.
The problem with beating Trump relentlessly is that the excess involved makes even the most serious and legitimate criticism of the president and his policies seem like sport — something to indulge in for the mere enjoyment of it, but without any power to bring perspicacity and persuasion to the debate.
Consider the president's visit to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso following the mass shootings that happened in those cities.
I was pleased to see the New York Times carry the headline that read "Trump urges unity vs racism."
I thought that it was decent of the newspaper to put politics aside and focus instead on the unifying aspects of the presidential visit.
My approbation, however, was short-lived. Possibly owing to the intense backlash it received for the headline, the newspaper saw fit to change it to "Assailing hate but not guns."
This, I thought to myself, is not reflective of responsible journalism. Tergiversation is the art form of politicians, not newspapers.
A newspaper shouldn't change a headline because it comes under pressure. Instead, it should explicate the reasons for the headline.
In many instances, the idea of fake news itself is fake, but try telling that to the people who are nonbelievers in the media's honesty.
If Hillary Clinton ever had the chance of winning the presidency, the media spoiled it for her by being less than tough with her on issues and shielding her from proper criticism.
It is good for a candidate to get a thorough cleansing, to have all the issues aired out so that the defining ones become fully framed and do not suffer from distraction and devolution.
I watched the two recent Democratic debates with a fair degree of dismay.
For the most part, the candidates sailed through it without bruising, but that is not what independent voters want.
Immigration, border security, law enforcement, health care, violence in society, and trade cannot be wrapped in gratuitous, sentimental sound bites. However, that is precisely what the candidates seemed to bring to the debate.
I do not bend my feelings toward candidates because they speak of grand schemes like "free tuition for all" and "Medicare for all."
I want to know what mechanism will pay for these programs, and what class of citizens will form the axle and wheels of that mechanism.
I am not interested in any dialog that skirts the real issues and feeds instead on fancies and utopias.
It is the job of debate moderators to pull the candidates away from their comfort zones and talking points with tough and incisive questioning.
Except for two or three sharp exchanges, the debates were boring because the candidates were allowed to walk their political positions with insouciance, and without challenge or contradiction.
A man must have all his weaknesses exposed before he can recognize his strengths. To stand in the soft light of perfection is not to acknowledge the harsh light that falls naturally on all aspects of life and the world.
The man who stumbles and then regains his composure is more attractive politically than another who carefully avoids pitfalls with an unnatural and choreographed walk.
In politics, as in life, the facade of invincibility and flawlessness is easily penetrated by incipient truth and then quickly shattered by it.
Therefore, truth with blemish is a far better accoutrement of politics than disguise and dissimulation.

2 Senators Seek Inquiry Of Ticketing Industry

Texto completo: Can the government play a stronger role in regulating the business of online tickets for concerts and other events?
When lawmakers and federal agencies have considered that question, they have tended to focus on fairness to consumers. In June, for example, the Federal Trade Commission held an industry conference looking at topics like the surcharges tacked on by companies like Ticketmaster and StubHub.
This week, two United States senators went further by asking the Justice Department to investigate the state of competition in the ticketing business, and to extend a regulatory agreement with Live Nation Entertainment, the industry behemoth that owns Ticketmaster.
In a letter to Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust, the senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- both Democrats -- called the ticket industry "broken" and complained of "exorbitant fees and inadequate disclosures" in the ticket buying process.
The five-page letter, sent on Tuesday, directed much of its blame to Live Nation, and echoed longstanding concerns that the company's merger with Ticketmaster, in 2010, gave it too much control over the concert business.
"The Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger has contributed to consumers' difficulties in the ticketing market," the letter said.
In approving the merger, the Justice Department signed a 10-year consent decree with Live Nation that forbid the company from behaviors like using its power over concerts to force venues to use Ticketmaster. An investigation by The New York Times last year found a number of examples where the company had been accused of just that behavior; the company denied any violations of its decree.
The senators' letter asked the Justice Department to conduct a "retrospective study on the effects of past consolidation" and to consider extending the decree past its expiration next year.
The Justice Department has investigated past claims that Live Nation had violated its consent decree and never taken action.
In a statement on Wednesday, Live Nation said the senators' letter is "based on a fundamental misunderstanding of our consent decree and general ticketing industry dynamics."
"Ticketmaster has been successfully growing its client base over the past decade as a result of continuous innovation and providing the best ticketing solution in the industry," the statement continued. "During that period, Live Nation and Ticketmaster have always complied with their obligations under the consent decree. We do not force anyone into ticketing agreements by leveraging content, and we do not retaliate against venues that choose other ticketing providers."
"There is no cause for further investigations or studies," the statement said.
News of the letter was first reported by Billboard.
If the Justice Department decides to act on the senators' request, it would be the latest in a series of moves by lawmakers and major government agencies to try to tame the ticketing market. In 2016, for example, President Barack Obama signed the BOTS Act, which made it illegal to use computer programs to bypass ticket sellers' online security systems.
In June, a number of Congressmen, including Senator Blumenthal, introduced another bill, the BOSS Act, which would require ticket sellers to disclose all fees and make it clear to consumers when not all tickets are placed on sale at the same time.
At the F.T.C. conference, industry leaders were asked about the sometimes confusing array of surcharges that are added to the price of a ticket. One participant, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Sara Fisher Ellison, suggested that Washington could help.
"This is a textbook place," Ms. Ellison said, "where a regulator could make a big difference."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The authority of peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon is a matter of annual debate at the United Nations, pitting security concerns against sovereignty rights. But for the first time in recent memory, the Security Council this year will formally review the size of the forces and allow cuts to be considered when it renews the mission, three officials said on Wednesday.
The issue will be put to the Security Council in a vote on Thursday to extend the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, for another year. A draft of the final agreement, which includes the force reduction review, was described to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity.
It is a small but significant concession to American and Israeli diplomats who have for years said the peacekeepers should more aggressively investigate and report Hezbollah activity in southern Lebanon, near the Israeli border. Because the United States and Israel do not believe the peacekeepers have carried out their duties as fully as possible, the countries have pushed for fewer forces, in part as a cost-cutting measure.
Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, is a political party represented in the Lebanese government as well as a formidable military force. The United States considers Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
Lebanese diplomats, backed by allies in the Middle East and Europe, have long resisted the heightened responsibilities for peacekeepers that could challenge Beirut's sovereignty and put the international forces at risk.
But two high-profile security episodes in 2018 -- the discovery of tunnels into Israel and an attack on the peacekeepers -- have raised concerns that Hezbollah militants are going unchecked in southern Lebanon.
Together, the episodes "show why UNIFIL is unable to carry out the mandate," said Elad Strohmayer, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington. He said the draft of the agreement "doesn't satisfy what we think is necessary to guarantee that UNIFIL operates as it should."
The Lebanese Mission to the United Nations did not comment on Wednesday.
One Security Council diplomat said the United States pushed for peacekeepers to more vigorously investigate threats by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, including verifying that the militant group was not violating a United Nations arms embargo.
The Trump administration and Israel also want the peacekeepers to provide more details about their missions, including when their access is blocked by members of Hezbollah, in reports to the United Nations.
In a statement, a State Department official said the peacekeepers' current mission should "consider and pursue revisions which reinforce success and recognize shortcomings."
That includes "addressing the threat posed by Hezbollah's aggressive rearmament," the statement said, and transitioning responsibility for protecting Lebanon to "capable and credible" government forces.
A second Israeli official said it was unlikely Thursday's vote would noticeably strengthen the peacekeepers' authority.
But Israel could join the United States in demanding a review of the number of peacekeepers in southern Lebanon -- with an eye toward downsizing the force, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate diplomacy.
Currently, just under 10,500 peacekeepers are in the area, and the mission allows for as many as 15,000. Diplomats involved in the negotiations said the United States proposed at one point to reduce the number of peacekeepers to about 9,000.
The Trump administration has consistently described Hezbollah as a threat to Lebanon's security, and its support from Iran has only fueled Washington's crackdown as part of its maximum pressure campaign against Tehran.
Two weeks ago in Washington, Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon did not mention the peacekeepers' mission after a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Nor did Mr. Pompeo, although he praised Mr. Hariri's "courageous commitment to keep taking full responsibility for Lebanon's defense."
Another foreign diplomat familiar with the negotiations said the peacekeepers issue was widely viewed at the United Nations as the latest effort by President Trump to bolster Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before elections there set for Sept. 17.
It also comes as tensions flare between Israel and Lebanon after strikes on Iranian-backed militia offices in Beirut and eastern Lebanon over the past week. Israel has not claimed responsibility for either attack, but Lebanese officials have accused Israel of violating the agreement that ended the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel.

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
(Trice Edney Wire.com) - I know you've been giving the 1619 Project some thought. How can we not be interested in what happens to Black people in America, as well as on the way to America 400 years ago when our first ancestors were brought from Africa to Port Comfort in Virginia. There's something ironic about being brought to a place called Port Comfort and being treated so viciously. The horrors escalated there and many of them are still happening. There are repercussions present from the whole enslavement project that was/is still sanctioned by our government. I've been noting the discussion of psychiatrists about the status of Donald Trump's mental health. It's scary, but we've been warned by psychiatrists who exercised their duty to inform us.
As much as people sing about this being the "land of the free, and the home of the brave," the first part of that phrase is not true for Black people even if a few of us have been allowed to live comfortably without showing any responsibility for the rest of Black people who've been wounded by the circumstance of enslavement. I include all of us as not being free because I believe as Solomon Burke sang, "None of us are free, til all of us are free." I often hear people say we're the land of equal opportunity, but that is an incomplete sentence unless you add something about "except certain people that America has held in bondage for 400 years."
If this were the land of the free and equal opportunity for all, why was Jim Crow necessary and why are Black people still impacted by it? Why was there the Tulsa Massacre just as Black people built up their businesses, their wealth, their community? Why did we need Brown v. Board to give our children better educational opportunities and why didn't we have the right to learn to read before that?
Why would two duly elected Congresswomen of color have to get Donald Trump's and Benjamin Netanyahu's permission to travel anywhere? Was there a written rule that says they could only travel with a White male led group or not at all? Why does Israel get $142 billion of our tax dollars while Black people get nothing to repair the damage deliberately done to our ancestors and ultimately to us? Didn't perpetrators know the horrible things they did to our ancestors would be handed down to us and that past denials would prevent generations to have the ability to accumulate wealth and for so many to live in poverty?
Why do we still have such a high rate of police brutality against Black people? Why are there great efforts to suppress our vote after Black people were denied any voting rights for hundreds of years? Why do we still have to face so many statues of White men who were responsible for our ancestors' enslavement and the problems that still resonate today? Why was Colin Kaepernick punished so harshly for peacefully protesting against racial injustice? Why is White supremacy on the rise so soon after the successful term of President Barack Obama?
I'm tired of hearing people, including Black people, say about America, "This is not who we are." Really? On this 400th anniversary of our being in this country, Black people have always been treated inhumanely.
Thank you to the New York Times for taking a new look at slavery's origin and its legacy. Let us take a new look, too, so we can understand what America is as opposed to what she claims to be. Let us not be fooled by "Make America Great Again" because that implies America was once great for all of us.

Texto completo: The September Democratic debate is coming into focus after a crucial Wednesday deadline.
In order to make the debate stage, those in the field of more than 20 candidates had to show at least 2 percent support in four qualifying polls and donations from at least 130,000 unique donors by the end of the day Wednesday.
The requirements for candidates are essentially double those of the June and July debates, which required 1 percent support in three qualifying polls and 65,000 unique donors to participate. The debate, which will be hosted by ABC News and Univision, is slated for Thursday, Sept. 12. A second night would have been added if the field expanded beyond 10.
Here's where things currently stand:
Ten candidates have qualified Those who are definitely getting up on that stage as of Wednesday are: Former vice president Joe Biden, Senator Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD official Julián Castro, Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Amy Klobuchar, former congressman Beto O'Rourke, Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and businessman Andrew Yang.
Among those who did not qualify: Marianne Williamson last week said she crossed the donor threshold to participate but did not receive the required support in polls.
An aggressive ad buy from Tom Steyer helped push him past the donor requirement, but he fell short by just one qualifying poll .
Prior to announcing Wednesday that she would drop out, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said she was close to receiving the required donors, but The New York Times reported last week that she needed three more polls.
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has the required donors and received up to 3 percent support in several early state polls, but only in two approved by the DNC, her campaign said last week.
According to fivethirtyeight.com, the remaining members of the field did not hit 2 percent in any approved polls prior to the deadline, nor did they hit the donor threshold. Those include Senator Michael Bennet, Governor Steve Bullock, Mayor Bill de Blasio, former congressman John Delaney, and Congressman Tim Ryan.
Debate details The debate will air on ABC and Univision on Thursday, Sept. 12 from 8:00 to 11:00 p.m.
In addition to airing on television, the debate will also stream on multiple Web platforms, including Hulu, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
ABC News and Univision last week announced four moderators for the debate: George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis, and Jorge Ramos. It will be held at Texas Southern University in Houston.
Candidates will be allowed an opening statement, but not a closing statement. Candidates will get one minute and 15 seconds for answers, and 45 seconds for rebuttals.

Cicadas: The perfect summer soundtrack

Texto completo: If the calls of hundreds of glittering cicadas don't remind you of the dog days of summer, what will?
"When I hear the cicada I think of summertime and BBQs," self-proclaimed bug guy Christopher Wade said Monday.
His official title is environmental program administrator for the pesticide section at Delaware's Department of Agriculture, but bug guy is a lot easier to say.
The unique sound that cicadas make is one of the most fascinating things about them, he said.
Another is their complex life cycle.
Here are a few things to know about the bulky, big-eyed insects found in so many Delawareans' back yards.
They're likely dog-day cicadas You may have heard that cicadas only emerge from the ground once every 17 years.
While that is true of some cicadas, others have much shorter lifespans. Generations of these bugs overlap, which means they emerge from the ground annually, Wade said.
In the U.S., they're often referred to as dog-day cicadas, because they molt and take flight in July and August, during the hottest days of summer, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Delaware does also have periodical cicadas — the kind that have 13- to 17-year life cycles — but the next big batch of those isn't due until 2021. The group that typically emerges in Delaware is known as Brood X, or the "Great Eastern Brood."
Every 17 years, Brood X cicadas emerge from the ground, lay eggs, and then die off in several weeks. After mating, females cut slits in the bark of young twigs and lay hundreds of eggs, according to the USDA.
Six to 10 weeks later, the eggs hatch and newborn nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow into to the soil and feed on the juices of plant roots. They go through several stages of development underground before emerging 17 years later, molting and taking flight.
The Great Eastern Brood has the greatest range and concentration of any of the 17-year cicadas, which means the year after next there will be a lot of them.
Broods can number in the billions.
That sound is a mating call "They are so loud," Wade said. "If there's more than them hatching, then, of course, the combined noise could be louder."
The sound you hear is actually the mating call of the male cicada and can be louder than a lawn mower. In a swarm, the high-pitched hum can reach 85 decibels, which is slightly louder than a diesel train, reported the New York Times.
Cicada songs are painful to birds' ears and male cicadas from the same brood often stick together in order to scare away predators.
The bugs have a set of ridged, drum-like organs called tymbals, which vibrate very quickly when pulled in by tiny muscles in their abdomens, according to cicadamania.com. The chirping and clicking noises can be heard by females up to a mile away.
The sound can also damage human ears. If, for instance, you were to pick a cicada up and hold it next to your head, you could end up with hearing damage, the Cicada Mania website warns.
Female cicadas, in comparison, are mostly silent.
They won't hurt you Cicadas generally don't do that much damage. And they don't sting or bite.
Sometimes confused with locusts, they do not feed on trees once they emerge from the ground, though they cut slits in them to lay their eggs. As nymphs, they feed on the juice of tree roots but, again, don't cause significant damage.
"Their numbers aren't great enough to cause substantial damage to property," Wade said.
The only trees that may require protection are young or ornamental fruit trees.
If a female cicada picks one to lay its eggs in, it may lose most or all its branches. But basic garden netting should be enough to stop the damage, experts say.
But these creepy wasps might Cicadas don't sting, but large wasps called cicada killers may attack if threatened.
Big solitary wasps that nest in the ground and feed on cicadas, they generally keep to themselves. They are mostly black with yellow bands and can reach up to 1.5 inches in length, according to the USDA.
"Like any other wasp, they can sting, but they're very docile," said Wade, who has petted a cicada killer on the head before.
"I'm just a weird bug guy, but they're very docile," he said.
If you see one, Wade recommends leaving it alone. If you do step on a cicada killer or disturb its nest, the females have big stingers that they will use to defend themselves.
The males don't have stingers at all.
"They're actually beneficial because they keep the (cicada) population in check," Wade said.

How these vegetarians found their way back to meat

Texto completo: Danielle Welch, 52, of Red Bank, grew up in New Mexico butchering her own meat. She came from a family of hunters — skinning, slicing and trimming animals was expected. Imagine her family's fury when, as a teen, she became a vegetarian. She was cutting through the sinew on a hunk of venison one day and suddenly became nauseated by the blood. From that day on, she couldn't stomach meat. "I couldn't get the smell of blood out of my skin for weeks," Welch said. "That was it for me." For the next 13 years not a single bite of spicy sausage, tender sirloin or crispy chicken passed through her lips. Every time she smelled meat, all she could think of was deer blood. Until one day she changed her mind while visiting friends. "They made steaks, and they actually smelled good to me instead of like blood. So, I decided to eat one," she remembered.
Her disgust at meat was gone. In its stead was more focus and energy brought on by the protein her body was benefiting from, she said. She bid vegetarianism farewell and has been a carnivore ever since.
Is vegetarian healthier? Not necessarily In a world of scare-tactic documentaries, dewy-skinned vegan Instagrammers and bogus health blogs, it's no wonder many think veganism and vegetarianism will lead to a trim waist, glowing complexion, laser-sharp focus, perfect health, and the ability to do hundreds of V-sits in a row. But science and experience say otherwise.
"There's still a lot of junk food that's vegan," said Dawn Cascio, director of food and nutrition at Valley Hospital. "There are vegan chocolate chip cookies. A lot of processed foods like potato chips are vegan. If you don't focus on fresh fruits and veggies and unprocessed grains, you could gain a lot of weight."
As a vegetarian, Welch turned to pasta and bread to supplement her diet and wound up packing on pounds. "You're having so many starches and grains," she said. "Our bodies are not meant to break all those down. We're not cows."
Sometimes cutting out meat and dairy can be downright dangerous.
For proof, look no further than the infamous case of YouTuber Yovana Mendoza Ayres, or Rawvana as she's known. Ayres runs a vegan blog and YouTube channel, where she extols the virtues of raw vegan living (eating only plant-based foods that aren't cooked). She also sells raw vegan meal plans on her website.
But her goose was cooked when earlier this year she appeared in a fellow YouTuber's video eating (cue dramatic music)... fish! Ayres took to the Internet to do some "splaining. She said in a video that after beginning her raw vegan diet she stopped getting her period. Doctors told her that her "hormones were out of wack." She needed to eat more fat and cook her food. She was anemic and her thyroid levels were low. Then she got SIBO, a small intestinal bacteria overgrowth that can lead to malnourishment. After some advice from a nutritionist, she reintroduced eggs and fish into her diet to regain her health, all the while maintaining to her fans that she only ate raw vegan food.
'There's no one-size-fits-all diet' Of course, eating less meat and more plants for good health isn't all phooey. According to Cascio, thorough research shows a link between eating processed meats and an increased risk in developing cancer and heart disease. Eating less meat also shrinks one's carbon footprint and can reduce cruel farming practices.
Just ask Beyonce, or rather her personal trainer Marco Borges. Borges, a nutrition author who recently released the plant-based recipe book "The Greenprint," has pioneered a 22-day vegan nutrition challenge, best known for being used and endorsed by Queen B and Jay-Z.
Borges also conducted a clinical study with Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. He found that over 22 days, people who ate a whole foods (foods grown out of the ground) vegan diet saw positive results. When compared to people who ate a vegetarian diet, their BMIs (body mass index) went down five times more, their body fat reduced by four times more and their cholesterol decreased 400 percent.
If this study is any proof, cutting out meat and dairy can shed pounds and be good for your heart. But not all vegan diets are made the same.
"It's really important to distinguish between whole food plant-based and being vegan... A whole food plant-based diet is vegan, but vegan isn't always whole-food plant based," Borges said. "Whole foods come from the earth like rice, whole grains and beans Not waffles, Impossible burgers and French fries, which are also vegan"
Doctor Iris Erguder-Saman agrees. She's an MD in family medicine and the director of integrative medicine at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. Erguder-Saman works with people who are looking to make big changes to their diet. Her tips? Avoid processed foods like veggie burgers and talk to a doctor before cutting major food groups out of your diet.
"There's no one-size-fits-all diet. Some diets work for some individuals," she said. "It's all about having a conversation and consulting with a healthcare professional."
Getting back together with meat Kassandra Gutierrez, 28, owner of the meal prep and food delivery service The Malleable Palate which is based out of Paterson, says she felt "lighter" and "better" as a vegan. A trained chef, Gutierrez knew which foods to substitute into her diet to stay healthy.
When she was 20 years old she decided to go pescatarian (eating only fish and plant-based foods), then vegetarian, then vegan, after watching the documentary "Forks Over Knives." The film advocates eating plant-based proteins instead of animal proteins, claiming the switch will reduce diseases like cancer and diabetes. But something was missing.
"I enjoy the umami flavor. I craved steak the most when I was pescatarian, seafood when I was vegetarian, and probably cheese when I was vegan," she said. After six months of being vegan, she went back to eating meat.
Jennifer Levine of Montclair went vegetarian while attending UMass Amherst because the food that came with the plant-base dining plan looked better than the others. When she graduated, Levine decided to stay vegetarian. "It became a habit," she said.
About eight years later she went to a deli with her boyfriend. She was about to order her usual meatless sandwich when her boyfriend suggested something life-changing – "Why don't you try the turkey sub?"
"It was radical. That was kind of a turning point," Levine said. She ordered the turkey sub. Then started eating meat again. Levine noticed she had more energy from that point on.
"As a vegetarian, I was carb-loading. I wasn't getting adequate protein," she said. "Since I've started eating meat again, I have a much more refined awareness of what I'm eating."
Oscar-winning actress (and fellow New Jerseyan) Anne Hathaway scrapped veganism after a fateful dinner with her husband Adam Shulman and Matt Damon. The three were dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Iceland. Shulman and Damon asked to eat whatever the chef was making. Hathaway asked if the salmon they were serving was local.
"And they said: 'Do you see that fjord?'" she told the publication Tatler. "So I had a piece of salmon and my brain felt like a computer rebooting."
As a vegan, "I just didn't feel good or healthy ... not strong," she said later to Harper's Bazaar.
Even Jane Brody, personal health columnist and long-time specialist in medicine and biology for the New York Times, weighed in in her 2017 column "Good Vegan, Bad Vegan." Her article was published in The Times in response to the "misstatements" made in the popular Netflix documentary "What The Health."
Eating an egg every day is just as bad as smoking five cigarettes? Eating one serving of processed meat a day raises your risk of getting diabetes 51 percent? All things the documentary claimed. All wrong, said Brody.
In the column she pointed to studies published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Harvard's Department of Nutrition. Both found that eating a primarily plant-based diet would reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, but left room for "various amounts of animal products" in their subjects' diets, wrote Brody. She also drew the distinction between good vegan food (read: broccoli) and bad vegan food (read: vegan chocolate chip cookies). The former will most likely be a positive for your health. The latter most likely will not.
"Eating is so personal and cultural," said Cascio of Valley Hospital. "Everybody is different and needs to find a diet they personally feel great on... If you feel like crap on it, it might not be for you."

Texto completo: For Bloomberg
The open carry of firearms is primarily performance. Whether the performer’s goal is to dramatize extreme gun rights, intimidate others, trigger the libs or cast oneself as the avenging hero in a miniseries of the mind, the practice is not just an assault on public safety. It’s a theater of the absurd.
There is no evidence that open carry makes any corner of society safer. There is, on the contrary, impressive evidence that carrying firearms increases aggression and gun violence. Open carry forces people in public thoroughfares to evaluate the mental state, physical demeanor and emotional intent of every armed person they see. How exactly does one differentiate open carry from homicidal carry?
When open-carry enthusiasts in Texas began organized public performances several years ago, they went to comic lengths to pretend that marching down the street with an AR-15 was perfectly normal behavior. “A rifle on our back is part of our everyday life, just like a cellphone is part of our everyday life,” one performer told The New York Times.
When other Texans declined to indulge the charade, fleeing instead, the group took extra precautions. They gave advance warning to patrons and employees at restaurants before entering. Because that’s what you do at restaurants when your behavior is totally normal and healthy and not at all alarming.
Like civilians, law-enforcement officers must become critics of the performance, deciphering whether the performer appears threatening only because of the presence of a lethal weapon or whether the performance includes additional signals of aggression. How much symbolic aggression makes the performance unlawful? When does a performance cross the line from inherently dangerous to functionally dangerous?
Two episodes in Missouri in recent weeks reveal that the open-carry regime has no answers to such questions.
In Kansas City this month, two armed men at a Walmart caused a panic. According to an eyewitness, shoppers fled the store after seeing the men walking with pistols in their waists. Police arrived. An officer jumped out of his car with a shotgun at the ready. The police questioned the men. Since walking around with guns is legal in Missouri, as in the vast majority of states, they were released.
Just a few days earlier, in a different part of the state, another man induced terror among Walmart shoppers. Yet the results, based entirely on the staging and reviews of his performance, were very different.
Dmitriy Andreychenko, 20, was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol when he entered a Walmart in Springfield, Mo. Andreychenko wore tactical gear and recorded himself on a cellphone as he walked the aisles. A store employee pulled an alarm, and shoppers fled.
Unlike the two men in Kansas City, Andreychenko was arrested and held on terrorism-related charges. “Missouri protects the right of people to open carry a firearm, but that does not allow an individual to act in a reckless and criminal manner endangering other citizens,” a local prosecutor said in announcing the criminal charge.
Why did Andreychenko, who subsequently said he had been testing his Second Amendment rights, end up charged with a felony while the Kansas City pair walked free? What made Andreychenko’s performance illegal?
Guns can be openly paraded in Missouri “unless the firearm is intentionally displayed in an angry or threatening manner, not in necessary self-defense.” Yet in a video taken of Andreychenko’s arrest, the suspect appears preternaturally calm, without a trace of anger.
It seems Andreychenko crossed a psychic border from good-guy-with-a-gun to bad-guy-facing-a-felony-charge when he donned militaristic gear and used a cellphone to record his performance. Cellphones are not lethal. “Tactical” vests — festooned with gear and lots of pockets — are not capable of violence. Yet these are the elements that apparently tipped Andreychenko’s performance over an undefined, and undefinable, line.
Patrons of the Springfield Walmart were not sent fleeing for their lives at the sight of a tan vest with abundant pockets. They ran for the same reason shoppers fled the Walmart in Kansas City: They saw a man with a gun, which every American recognizes is the overture to a shooting. Rather than wait to hear the bullets belt out their opening number — Andreychenko’s rifle is capable of murdering dozens in less than a minute — they ran.
Flight from men carrying guns is eminently sensible. On the other hand, requiring citizens and law-enforcement officers to guess correctly whether the men are staging a gun-culture rite or mass homicide is nothing short of deranged. In the theater world, bad reviews can kill a show. In open-carry drama, performers are empowered to murder anyone in the theater. Periodically, they do.

University invites New York Times columnist offended by being called bedbug to 'speak about civil discourse'

Texto completo: The George Washington University's provost responded to New York Times columnist Bret Stephens after he emailed one of their professors who called him a bedbug on Twitter.
In the email, Forrest Maltzman told Stephens, "as an academic, Professor [David] Karpf speaks for himself and does not take direction from me. His opinions are his own" because of the school's commitment to free speech.
"I see on Twitter that you invited him to your home," the email continues. "I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to come to our campus to speak about civil discourse in the digital age."
Tweet
Copying Maltzman, Stephens sent an email to Karpf about a tweet in which he joked the bedbugs in the New York Times newsroom were actually just Stephens. Stephens encouraged Karpf to come to his home, meet his family, and then call him a bedbug to his face.
Tweet
Facing intense ridicule for sending the email, Stephens deactivated his Twitter account. Appearing on MSNBC Tuesday he said he was offended because the bedbug comment was "dehumanizing rhetoric."
“There is a bad history of being called a — of being analogized to insects. It goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past," Stephens said. "I’ve been called worse, I wrote this guy a personal note, now it’s out there for everyone to see."

Tennis umpire Damian Steiner fired by ATP after giving unauthorized interviews

Texto completo: The chair umpire for the celebrated men's singles Wimbledon final between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer has been fired by the Association of Tennis Professionals for violating tour policies.
Damian Steiner was let go Aug. 15 by the organization, his primary employer, for giving a series of interviews to the media in his native Argentina, according to the New York Times.
Steiner never cleared the interviews with tour officials. The 44-year-old also addressed several topics that go against ATP guidelines, such as individual matches and whether to eradicate the use of towels during play.
WHAT WAS THAT? Loser gives bizarre post-match handshake following US Open defeat
STARTING STRONG: Serena Williams delivers powerful punch, in classic form against Maria Sharapova
“Much of the content of Steiner’s media interviews were a direct violation of the standard protocol in place whereby officials must refrain from discussing specific incidents or matches, individual players, other officials, or rules, in the interest of maintaining impartiality at all times,” the ATP told the New York Times in a statement, confirming Steiner had been fired.
With questions regarding officiating becoming more prevalent in the sport, tennis has taken steps to improve transparency. At the U. S. Open this year, officials are increasing access to top officials such as tournament referee Soren Friemel and chief umpire Jake Garner. Steiner's actions, however, are not what they had in mind.
Steiner was suspended in early August prior to his firing. He began working as a tennis official in 1994.
Last year at the U. S. Open women's singles final, chair umpire Carlos Ramos clashed with Serena Williams in her eventual loss. He will not be in the chair for any of her matches, or for any of her sister Venus' matches, during this tournament.

REALTORS HAVE BEEN PULLED INTO THE OPIOID FIGHT: People are sneaking into open houses under realtors' noses and stealing home sellers' prescription opioids, writes healthcare reporter Cassidy Morrisson.
As the flood of opioids into vulnerable communities has grown, realtors have had to be on guard to prevent drug theft while hosting open houses, and to educate home sellers about their roles in prevention, including hiding their medications in the same way they would firearms.
Realtor associations across the country have taken on the unlikely role, in league with law enforcement and healthcare professionals, in working to prevent the spread of opioid abuse.
Bill McFalls, Jr., president of the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors, said his association tells sellers that hiding pill bottles is not enough. Sellers are advised to lock their medications in a safe. The Delaware County Heroin Task Force is working with the national opioid abuse prevention group Lock Your Meds to encourage people nationwide that locking up opioids is a near fool-proof way to safeguard their medications.
Members are told to ID people arriving to open houses, as well as to keep a close watch on people in the homes, sometimes sending more than one agent to monitor the crowds.
Anjanette Frye, president of Ohio Realtors told the Washington Examiner her association is partnering with the Ohio Opioid Education Alliance.
Realtors encourage sellers to keep drugs away from rogue "buyers" by putting extra pills sellers will not need into bags provided by the realtor "that dissolve the drugs when they come in contact with water,” Frye said. For example, if a seller is prescribed a 30-day supply but they feel better after 15 days, they can put their pills in this bag, add water, and the pills’ chemicals break down and the pills disintegrate. The process has "been pretty successful,” Frye said.
“We’ve been working with the alliance since last year and will continue to work into 2020 and years to come," she said. "Ohio has a huge opioid crisis. This is part of the community building process.”
Frye added that measures Ohio Realtors have taken alongside the Ohio Opioid Education Alliance have led to a noticeable decrease in reported instances of theft.

OKLAHOMA JUDGE WILL DECIDE MONDAY IF JOHNSON AND JOHNSON OWES THE STATE OVER $17B: Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman will issue a ruling at 4 p.m. Monday in the first civil trial in the U.S. seeking to hold a drugmaker, Johnson and Johnson, accountable for helping fuel the epidemic. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter brought forth the lawsuit alleging the company aggressively marketed their opioids Duragesic and Nucynta to doctors and downplayed the addictive properties of opioids.
BIDEN ADDS TO LIST OF HEALTHCARE PROMISES: At a town hall on health care this weekend, Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden derided the healthcare proposals of his 2020 Democratic primary opponents while also taking aim at President Trump for trying to gut his former boss's signature healthcare law.
He pledged to end HIV by 2025: Biden pledged to end the HIV epidemic within five years after being elected, a timeline that would cut in half a similar goal set by the Trump administration.
The former vice president replied "yes" to a healthcare worker who asked him whether he would pledge to end the HIV epidemic by 2025. The audience member said that reaching the goal would require universal healthcare policies, expanding housing, and reforming drug pricing.
Biden didn't say how he would go about addressing HIV specifically but went on to talk about his work in the fight against cancer in the Obama administration. He made some links between the importance of prioritizing medical research, saying such a commitment could also be extended to HIV.
He promised free tuition to medical students who work in rural areas. Biden made the proposal when a medical student asked what could be done to prevent rural hospital closures. "We should make a direct correlation between your tuition and the amount of time you’re willing to go serve in those areas,” Biden said.
BIDEN ON CRITICS SAYING HE’S TOO OLD: ‘DON’T VOTE FOR ME’: Biden had advice for voters who are concerned about his age as he continues to face questions about his stamina. "I say if they're concerned, don't vote for me," Biden, 76, told reporters. During the gaggle he also told reporters he was enjoying Vermont, though he was in New Hampshire.
BIDEN DOLES OUT NEW TRUMP CRITIQUE: ‘UNHINGED’: In what could be a foretaste of a no-holds-barred 2020 general election brawl, Biden and Trump are trading barbs over who is mentally unit for office. "The fact is that day by day we are witnessing a president of the United States who has become more and more unhinged," Biden said this weekend. "I wish this were just a campaign slogan." He raised Trump's comments about the trade war with China, in which Trump called himself the "chosen one" to take on the fight, and said the president was feeling under pressure after a majority of economists predicted the economy would soon lapse into recession.
"I think it's only going to make him more erratic," Biden said of the possibility of a recession. "If it weren't so important it would be comical." He added: "He's not handling it very well."
Trump, 73, has repeatedly jabbed at Biden's mental capacity. “Joe Biden is not playing with a full deck ... This is not somebody you can have as your president,” Trump said after a number of Biden gaffes led to renewed questions about his age and acuity.
DEATH BY VAPING (MAYBE): An Illinois resident died of a respiratory disease Friday after using an e-cigarette, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not disclose whether the person had been using an e-cigarette for a long time, or the patient’s gender or age. The patient blamed his or her chest pains and difficulty breathing on vaping, though, and the CDC told reporters Friday the agency will be working closely with Illinois public health officials to figure out how vaping may have contributed to the person’s death.
PSYCHIATRIST SAYS TRUMP MAY BE AS ‘DESTRUCTIVE’ AS HITLER, STALIN, MAO: Duke University psychiatrist Dr. Allen Frances said the president is “as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin, Mao in the last century,” after telling CNN’s Brian Stelter that mental health professionals shouldn’t diagnose politicians. He also said that equating the president’s perceived erratic behavior gives the mentally ill a bad rap: “Medicalizing politics… stigmatizes the mentally ill. I’ve known thousands of patients, almost all of them are well-behaved, well-mannered good people. Trump is none of these. Lumping that is a terrible insult to the mentally ill and they have enough problems and stigma as it is."
IMMIGRANT ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAID TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE SPONSOR’S INCOME: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent letters to states Friday explaining that a sponsored immigrant’s eligibility for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program will be contingent upon the sponsor’s income. CMS sent the information to explain provisions of the Presidential Memorandum on Enforcing the Legal Responsibilities of Sponsors of Aliens, an order issued in May.

Texto completo: The New England Patriots have yet to visit the White House nearly nine months after winning the Super Bowl and are unlikely to do so.
The White House and the NFL team blamed the lack of a congratulatory ceremony on scheduling conflicts, the New York Times reported. Both sides said it has nothing to do with politics.
But three players — Devin McCourty, Jason McCourty, and Duron Harmon — said after their win they would skip any celebration at the White House.
President Trump has had an otherwise cozy relationship with the team. Robert Kraft, the team’s owner, is a friend and supporter of the president. Coach Bill Belichick has also been supportive of Trump, and Trump has bragged about his friendship with quarterback Tom Brady.
The Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams in February to take home their sixth Super Bowl win. The team has visited the White House after their five previous victories. Four of those visits happened in April and the other took place in May.
A visit was originally planned for April, but fell through. The celebration was then scheduled for May but canceled due to a change in Trump’s schedule.
Time is running out for the team to celebrate with the president as the new NFL season approaches and the team’s schedule picks up.
“We would welcome them to the White House in the future should a future date work out,” a White House spokesman said.

Texto completo: Officials with NASA are investigating an allegation that an astronaut accessed the bank account of her estranged spouse from space, which may be the first allegation of a crime committed in space.
Anne McClain, a decorated astronaut who was once set to be part of NASA's first all-female spacewalk, allegedly accessed Summer Worden's bank account while on a six-month mission aboard the International Space Station, according to a report from The New York Times. The pair were married in 2014; Worden filed for divorce in 2018.
Worden filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming McClain had stolen her identity, although she saw no signs anyone had moved or used money in the account, The Times reported. Worden's parents brought a separate complaint to NASA's Office of the Inspector General that described a "highly calculated and manipulative campaign" designed to win custody of the couple's child.
"There's unequivocally no truth to these claims. We've been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media," McClain said in a statement released on Twitter. "I appreciate the outpouring of support and will reserve comment until after the investigation. I have total confidence in the IG process."
NASA declined to comment on personal or personnel matters involving employees but released a statement to Space.com saying: "Lt Col. Anne McClain has an accomplished military career, flew combat missions in Iraq and is one of NASA's top astronauts. She did a great job on her most recent NASA mission aboard the International Space Station."
Through her lawyer, Rusty Hardin, McClain told The Times she had accessed the account but insisted she did so to ensure that the family's finances were in order and that there was enough money to care for their child, who was born a year before they met. She said she was never told to stop using the account and continued to use the same password she had throughout the relationship.
"She strenuously denies that she did anything improper," Hardin said.
The International Space Station is a joint project involving the United States, Canada, Japan, Russia and several European countries. A legal framework dictates people and possessions in space are under the jurisdiction of their country of origin, according to the BBC.

AMERICAN HISTORY: THE 1619 PROJECT

Texto completo: Last Sunday, the New York Times Magazine published a series of essays constituting what it calls “The 1619 Project,” a look at America’s legacy of slavery at the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to what is now the United States.
The project is a necessarily politically sensitive one, given its subject. That the anniversary happens to overlap with a political moment in which race is a particularly potent subject is a coincidence, but one which heightens the project’s political sensitivity. That it also published shortly after Slate released a transcript of an internal Times discussion was a more unfortunate coincidence, given that part of that conversation was interpreted by conservatives as suggesting that the paper wanted to use race to attack President Trump. (That interpretation is robustly dubious.)
This confluence of factors meant that the response to the project’s release was probably predictable. The essays were framed by some critics as questionable, flawed or even unnecessary. Some critics, like former House speaker Newt Gingrich, determined that the project was about impeaching Trump. Others argued that it was an effort to diminish the United States - an effort that simply repurposed well-established history.
The essays stand for themselves, and you’re welcome to read them. But it’s worth considering the ongoing utility of a discussion about the role of slavery in American history in the abstract.
By naming the project after the year 1619, it reinforces the scale of the oppression of black people in the Americas/America. But it also inadvertently can make it seem like something necessarily historic. The point of the essays, of course, is that the legacy of slavery extends into the present, but the date itself can make it instead seem distant.
Considering the intervening history, though, makes obvious how potent slavery and racism are in modern American society and politics.
The first slaves from Africa arrived in this month, 400 years ago - before the Mayflower arrived at Plymouth Rock. The presence of slaves from Africa was integrated into the earliest days of European colonization of what is now the United States.
American colonies were slave states before they were states in the American union. Slavery was part of the United States at its outset. As Hannah Jones points out in her introductory essay for the project, the first person to die in America’s fight for its freedom from England was a black man, Crispus Attucks, shot to death in the Boston Massacre.
Slavery ended with the Civil War and the ratification of the 13th Amendment. Within 20 years, though, a new institutionalized oppression emerged: laws barring black Americans from voting or otherwise participating as equals in society. (The intervening 20 years, the Reconstruction, was a period in which America tried to rectify the effects of slavery. It ended with the 1877 presidential election.)
These Jim Crow laws segregated the South for decades after slavery was barred, establishing racist tiers to society that prevented black Americans from matching whites in employment, income, political engagement, land ownership and opportunity more broadly. Organized campaigns of physical assault and murder, often with quiet approval from authorities, reinforced that segregation.
While slavery ended in 1865, formal oppression of black Americans continued for the next century. The passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and the Fair Housing Act in 1968 eliminated most of the formal legal policies of segregation.
This is a central point. As of 2018, nearly a third of Americans were alive in 1965. One out of every 10 Americans currently alive were adults at the same time that Jim Crow existed in the South. Some 2.6 million people living in the Deep South last year - Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina - were adults at the time that the Voting Rights Act passed.
Slavery, Reconstruction and Jim Crow make up more than three-quarters of American history. The year 2022 marks a significant moment for our country: It will be the point at which the United States has existed in North America for a longer period than legal African slavery did.
Marking 1965 as an end point is itself overly simple. The passage of the Voting Rights Act didn’t spontaneously and magically eliminate any vestiges of racism or racial differences. We’ve seen repeatedly how backlashes to changes in racial policies occur. Jim Crow was in part a backlash against Reconstruction. It can be more subtle: In the wake of the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education, there was a surge in schools being named after Confederate leaders.
The 1968 presidential election included segregationist former Alabama governor George Wallace as an independent candidate. He won five states. The election was won by Richard Nixon whose “Southern strategy” of amplifying race-based concerns to win over Southern voters prompted the Republican Party to formally apologize in 2005.
Forty-one percent of Americans alive in 2018 were also alive in 1972, when Nixon won reelection.
There are myriad ways in which race and racism permeate American politics and culture to this day. It can be hard to recognize the effects of the legacy of America’s history in those divides, which is something that the Times’ project clearly aims to accomplish. Broadly, the project is predicated on recognizing that those effects linger at all.
Race and partisanship are deeply intertwined in U.S. politics in 2019, making such an exploration almost necessarily one to which one side might object. That Democrats have become increasingly sensitive to the effects of racial discrimination over the past five years - in part, it seems, a function of the Black Lives Matter movement - has led some Republicans to see discussions of race as being inherently partisan.
For those who see the 1619 Project as unnecessary, though, here’s something to consider: Perhaps an expectation that the Times is trying to make a big deal out of walking well-worn territory is a function of how poorly or incompletely that territory has been walked in the past.
Or perhaps it recognizes that many people haven’t walked it.

Texto completo: Harry Reid is starting to make sense.
I was afraid this day would come. Perhaps it’s an indication of the Apocalypse or, at the very least, that multiple blows to the head, received during my less-than-stellar amateur athletic career, have finally caught up with me.
Nevertheless, the former Senate Democratic leader has called out his party’s presidential candidates for their unrealistic solutions to intractable problems such as rising health care costs and illegal immigration.
Reid recently told Vice that Bernie Sanders’ “Medicare-for-All” plan is the wrong way to go on health care. He favors retooling Obamacare. He also took issue with the idea of decriminalizing illegal border crossings.
“People want a fair immigration system. They don’t want an open-door invitation for everybody to come at once,” Reid said.
Reid might have also added, but didn’t, that it would be nice if Democrats would come up with an economic policy that wasn’t hatched on the campus of Sherwood Forest University in the Robin Hood School of Economics.
I realize hating rich people and wanting to take their money and give it to someone else is in vogue right now, but it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.
The Democrats’ wish list of free stuff — health care for everyone, student loan forgiveness, college tuition, a guaranteed job — would total about $41 trillion. As Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute wrote in December, the math doesn’t work. Even if you took every penny from the top 1 percent, you wouldn’t fund a Medicare-for-all program. And doubling the top tax brackets (from 35 and 37 percent to 70 and 74 percent) “would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall.”
What all that means is the middle class will eventually bear the burden of these government giveaways.
The odd thing is progressives continue to push these policies despite the fact that we can all see they don’t work. California, for example, long under Democratic control, has become exactly what progressives claim to abhor — a place where only the super wealthy thrive.
“The annual household income necessary to buy a median-priced home now tops $320,000,” wrote New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo in May. “Yet the streets there are a plague of garbage and needles and feces, and every morning brings fresh horror stories from a ‘Black Mirror’ hellscape: Homeless veterans are surviving on an economy of trash from billionaires’ mansions.”
It’s a searing indictment of ultra-progressivism.
You might have heard about California liberals wanting to secede from the United States.
There are a lot of reasons why they won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.
Mainly, they won’t be able to afford the gas.

Be curious. Be uncomfortable. Learn the history of slavery.

Texto completo: Be curious. Be humble. Be patient. Don't be afraid to be uncomfortable.
These are notions that can apply to almost everything in life, but I've been thinking about them lately as they apply to the way we learn history. Specifically, the way we learn the history of race in our country.
In the past week, a lot of people have been talking about The New York Times' 1619 Project a collection of essays, published in the newspaper's magazine, that examine the role of slavery in creating the culture and economy of the United States. It's illuminating, chilling and provocative. I read it with a pen in my hand, underlining passages.
Like this from Nikole Hannah-Jones: "The Union had not entered the war to end slavery but to keep the South from splitting off ..."
And this from Matthew Desmond: "It was not so much the rage of the poor white Southerner but the greed of the rich white planter that drove the lash. ... Slavery did supplement white workers with what W.E.B. Du Bois called a 'public and psychological wage,' which allowed them to roam freely and feel a sense of entitlement. But this, too, served the interests of money. Slavery pulled down all workers' wages."
And this from Tiya Miles: "It is uncanny, but perhaps predictable, that the original wall for which Wall Street is named was built by the enslaved at a site that served as the city's first organized slave auction."
I underlined a lot of other passages, too, but those help make one of the project's central points: that the enslavement of Africans and their descendants remains tangled in every aspect and every region of our country.
Purely by chance, the day before I read The 1619 Project, I went to see an exhibit at the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie. It's called "Purchased Lives: The American Slave Trade from 1808 to 1865."
It's not a big exhibit, but it leaves a strong impression. Two items, in particular, struck me.
One was a slave collar made of brass and iron, an object whose cruelty was so blunt that when I first saw it I had to walk away. I made myself go back and look: a heavy metal choker with a heavy metal bell attached to each side, guaranteeing that the enslaved human forced to wear it could not run away quietly.
I'd read about slave collars. I'd seen them in movies. But I'd never seen a real one, and seeing this one helped me understand something a little deeper about slavery, cruelty and history.
The other object that particularly struck me in the exhibit was a gentler tool of enslavement, a stylish housecoat for a domestic servant on a Southern plantation. It was made by Brooks Brothers. Yes, that Brooks Brothers, the fancy Manhattan clothier that once fabricated an entire line of clothing for enslaved Southerners, yet another Northern business that profited from the slave trade.
I left the exhibit -- which closes Sunday, Aug. 25, by the way -- just a little more aware not only of history but of how we learn it: fact by fact, object by object, story by story, a little at a time.
Neither the "Purchased Lives" exhibit nor The 1619 Project is the full story of slavery in our country, and the Times' project has many critics. Some objectors are simply ignorant and mean, but others make a coherent case that focusing on 1619, the year that enslaved Africans first stepped off a ship and into the British colonies, is misguided.
Some of the project's critics say the insistence on 1619 turns slavery into an "Anglo" project. Focusing on that year, they say, obscures the fact that the Spanish enslaved Africans in parts of what became the United States -- Florida, for example -- long before that. The 1619 date also gives short shrift to the enslavement of Native Americans.
But even those critiques are a valuable part of the history lesson. A lot more people are talking and thinking about our country's past this week than last week. We're doing it with added information.
It would be a mistake to take The 1619 Project -- or any single exhibit, essay, book, movie -- as the one and only history of slavery and the country.
There is no single version of the past. There never will be. There's always more to uncover, always more to learn.
So let's be curious. Be humble. Be patient. Be excited, rather than uncomfortable, to discover what and who we came from so that we can understand how that shapes us today.
In history, as in everything else, the more you learn, the more you realize how much more there is to know.

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

NASA investigating first alleged crime committed in space

Texto completo: NASA is reportedly investigating an allegation that an astronaut accessed her estranged spouse's bank account from the International Space Station, the New York Times reported on Friday.
Anne McClain informed investigators she accessed the bank account from the space station during a six-month assignment but dismissed any claims of misconduct.
The claim is being reported as the first allegation of a crime committed in space.
McClain's spouse, former Air Force intelligence officer Summer Worden, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission that McClain had committed identity theft but said she did not observe that any money had been moved from the account.
McClain's lawyer Rusty Hardin told the Times that she was worried about the family's finances, specifically financial support for Worden's son, whom the couple had been raising before they split up. Hardin said McClain used the password to the account to monitor the couple's funds while they were together.
"She strenuously denies that she did anything improper," Hardin said, while stressing that McClain was "totally co-operating."
Worden's parents filed a second complaint to NASA's Office of Inspector General alleging that McClain improperly accessed private financial records in an attempt to manage a "highly calculated and manipulative campaign" to gain custody of Worden’s son.
"I was pretty appalled that she would go that far," Worden told the Times. "I knew it was not OK."
Worden said the FTC has not yet responded to her claim.
McClain and Worden married in 2014, but the couple filed for divorce in 2018 after McClain accused Worden of assault.
Investigators from NASA’s inspector general's office have talked to both women, the Times reported. However, McClain asserted in an interview with the office under oath last week that "she is only continuing behavior that Worden had approved to handle the family’s finances."
Photo Caption:A Russian space agency rescue team help U.S. astronaut Anne McClain out from the capsule shortly after the landing of the Russian Soyuz MS-11 space capsule about 150 km (80 miles) south-east of the Kazakh town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.

Key Mueller cooperator Gates testifies in trial of DC lawyer

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rick Gates, a key cooperator in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, testified Thursday against a prominent Washington attorney accused of concealing information from the Justice Department about work done for the government of Ukraine.
Gates, a former campaign aide to President Donald Trump who pleaded guilty last year in Mueller’s investigation, took the stand as a government witness against Greg Craig. It was the latest installment of Gates’ effort to secure leniency from the Justice Department in exchange for his cooperation with multiple probes.
Among those is the case against Craig, an offshoot of Mueller’s investigation into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and part of an ongoing Justice Department crackdown on unregistered lobbying in the U.S. on behalf of foreign governments and other entities.
Gates spent hours describing the international political consulting work he and business associate Paul Manafort – a co-defendant in the Mueller investigation who’s been sentenced to more than seven years in prison – did for a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party and how Craig came to be involved in some of those efforts.
The work that drew the Justice Department’s attention occurred in 2012, when Craig and his law firm at the time – Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom – were engaged by the government of Ukraine to review the prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister, and develop a report on it.
Tymoshenko was a political opponent of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Manafort patron and a political figure whom Gates said he and Manafort had helped get elected.
The report was billed as independent, but critics have said it whitewashed a politically motivated prosecution, and Gates acknowledged on the witness stand that the document was conceived as a way to counter international criticism that Tymoshenko had been denied a fair trial. Prosecutors have also said the project was part of an effort by Ukraine to improve its international standing.
Gates testified that Manafort arranged for the hiring of Skadden to prepare the report, and said he served as an intermediary for the firm and worked with Craig on a publicity plan for the document. That included giving an embargoed copy to New York Times reporter David Sanger.

Prohibition event at Little Jumbo A sex scandal in Prohibition-era Cincinnati sold newspapers and shocked elite sensibilities. In "The Ghosts of Eden Park: The Bootleg King, the Women Who Pursued Him, and the Murder That Shocked Jazz-Age America," Karen Abbott plucks this event from the headlines and takes readers into the courtroom where a trial for murder reveals the corruption at the heart of the War on Alcohol in the 1920s.
The true story centers around George Remus, a pharmacist, lawyer and bootlegger. Remus set up one of the largest illegal whiskey rings in the United States, in violation of the Volstead Act of 1920, which prohibited the manufacture, sale or transportation of alcohol to, from or within the United States. With flair and impunity, Remus exploited a legal loophole in the law that allowed whiskey to be sold for medicinal purposes. He bought off law enforcement officials and flaunted his wealth at lavish parties. Hypocrisy and hubris proved a heady mix for Remus, whose wild parties had few limits. Neither did his jealousy. When he discovered his wife was having an affair, he chased her through Cincinnati's Eden Park and shot her to death. His murder trial was a sensation.
"The Ghost of Eden Park" also features Mabel Walker Willebrandt, U.S. assistant attorney general and Remus's nemesis, who had been appointed recently by President Warren Harding to enforce prohibition. The 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote at just been ratified less than a year before her appointment, and the 32-year-old Willebrandt embraced her job with special zeal.
Abbott brings the Prohibition Era to life with this riveting work of historical true crime.
Malaprop's Bookstore/Café presents the New York Times-bestselling author and her new book, "The Ghosts of Eden Park," at 6:30 p.m. Aug. 27 at a special Speakeasy Event at Little Jumbo cocktail bar, 241 Broadway St. Abbott will be in conversation with New York Times-bestselling author Denise Kiernan. Because seating is limited, participants must register at malaprops.com to attend. Event registration is free, but anyone who is not already a member at Little Jumbo will be asked to pay Little Jumbo's $1 membership fee on site.

Connecting to Appalachia
Appalachia, by its very mention, conjures images of a rugged and rich mountainous terrain whose ridgelines are blanketed by misty clouds. Its peaks and valleys so abundant with a diversity of life that many a naturalist has been compelled to put pen to paper and expound upon the beatific wonder unfurled in every direction. Bartram, Kephart, Dykeman, Ellison and many others have arduously paid homage to this region, its people, and their struggle with and against the land. Their work has laid the foundation for continued exploration and inspired writers throughout the region to engage the natural world around them.
In "Mountains Piled Upon Mountains: Appalachian Nature Writing in the Anthropocene," editor Jessica Cory has assembled works from contemporary writers that reflect the intricacies of the relationship between the land and its people in this era of human influence on the environment. She employs place-based fiction, poems, and literary nonfiction from the likes of Ann Pancake, Taylor Brown, Kathryn Stripling Byer, Thomas Rain Crowe and Wayne Caldwell, among many others in and of Appalachia. The way in which Cory has arranged the pieces into seven sections (Contemplate, Recount, Destroy, Preserve, Protect, Evolve and Celebrate) gives each piece context and connects the reader to the writer and the environment.
In a time where misconceptions and downright misinformed opinions continue to perpetuate a narrative of Appalachia sorely lacking in any real insight, it is refreshing to engage a collection such as "Mountains Piled Upon Mountains." Join Jessica Cory and a host of contributors at Malaprop's at 6 p.m. Sept. 5 for readings and discussion.

Inquiry by M.I.T. Will Focus On Donations From Epstein

Texto completo: A week after Joichi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, apologized for his ties to the disgraced New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that the university would investigate its dealings with Mr. Epstein.
In an email sent Thursday evening to the M.I.T. community that was shared with The New York Times, the president, L. Rafael Reif, said the university had received roughly $ 800,000 in donations from Epstein funds over a 20-year period. The money went to the Media Lab, an elite research center led by Mr. Ito, as well as to a member of the M.I.T. faculty, the physicist Seth Lloyd. Mr. Ito is also on the board of The New York Times Company.
Mr. Epstein was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center before he committed suicide on Aug. 10. He had long faced accusations of sexually abusing girls. In 2008, he pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor.
Acknowledging a "mistake in judgment," Mr. Reif said, "with hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed M.I.T. to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts."
The fact-finding mission announced by Mr. Reif will be supervised by the school's provost, Martin A. Schmidt, an electrical engineer who has been on M.I.T.'s faculty for over three decades. A spokesman for M.I.T. declined to comment further.
In a post on the website Medium on Thursday, Mr. Lloyd apologized for maintaining a relationship with Mr. Epstein that began in 2004. He said he had visited Mr. Epstein during his 13-month stint in the Palm Beach County Jail on the charges in Florida.
Mr. Lloyd added that articles on Mr. Epstein published in The Miami Herald over the last year, in which several women said that Mr. Epstein had sexually abused them, "opened my eyes."
Between 2008 and 2016, Mr. Epstein was a source of funding for his projects described in 19 papers, Mr. Lloyd acknowledged, all but one of them published after Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty, according to an analysis by Robert Rutledge, an associate professor at McGill University.
"I helped Mr. Epstein protect his reputation, and I disempowered his victims," Mr. Lloyd wrote in his post.
The Media Lab has found itself in crisis. Two scholars who work there announced that they would leave it over the Epstein revelations. Some students have called for the departure of the media lab's director, Mr. Ito, a venture capitalist and skilled fund-raiser who became its head in 2011.
Mr. Ito disclosed the donations -- though not their amount -- in an apology posted on the Media Lab website on Aug. 15. In the statement, he revealed that he had taken investments from Mr. Epstein for the lab and for his own investment funds. He also said that he had spent time at Mr. Epstein's residences.
Mr. Ito, who is also a professor at the school, said in the apology that he had met Mr. Epstein in 2013, years after he had been released from jail. He has not responded to requests for additional comment.
On Thursday, Mr. Reif described "the core facts, as best as we can determine" as M.I.T.'s having received approximately $ 800,000 from Mr. Epstein's foundations, all either to the Media Lab or to Mr. Lloyd, who met Mr. Epstein at least as early as a 2004 dinner in Monterey, Calif.
Although Mr. Ito and Mr. Lloyd have offered public apologies, Mr. Reif said in the email, "I believe the situation also requires a broader and deeper institutional response."

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and his former nemesis, ex-Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, have written dueling op-eds on the legislative filibuster in which Reid called for ending it and McConnell argued for keeping it in place.
“If future Democrats shortsightedly decide to reduce the Senate to majority rule, we’ll have lost a key safeguard of American government,” McConnell wrote in the New York Times last week.
But the matter could end up being settled by the next president.
Progressive groups are ramping up pressure on Democratic Party White House hopefuls, pushing them to commit to ending the legislative filibuster if the party wins the Senate and White House in November.
The filibuster, in practice, often requires 60 votes to pass legislation. So far, a handful of Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed ending the filibuster, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and most recently, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another leading presidential candidate, said he is open to making it harder to filibuster bills but has not pledged to get rid of the 60-vote threshold.
Progressive groups are urging Democrats, if they win back the Senate majority, to use the so-called nuclear option and end the filibuster with a simple majority vote. Such a change would lower the threshold for all legislation to 51 votes, or a majority of voting senators.
The anti-Trump group Indivisible laid out the “simple” maneuver on its website.
“Let’s assume that it’s 2021 and Democrats have the majority,” the group writes. “They introduce a big package of democracy reforms, like DC statehood and expanding voting rights. Mitch McConnell, the self-proclaimed ‘grim reaper’ of progressive legislation, then initiates a filibuster. Democrats can then hold a vote, and with just 50 votes eliminate the filibuster and prevent McConnell from vetoing the legislation.”
Progressives see ending the filibuster as the only way to greenlight a far-left agenda in the Senate, where the 60-vote threshold has long forced the two parties to find bipartisan and thus more moderate agreements on legislation.
Such a move would be particularly valuable if the House remains under Democratic control, as it is expected to do, and the party also wins the Senate and White House, which is entirely possible.
Harris, speaking in Sioux City, Iowa, earlier this month, appeared to agree it might be time to end the filibuster. "I want to find common ground on legislation, but if there’s gonna be the obstructionist kind of tactics we’ve seen, then I’ll get rid of it," she told reporters.
Senate Democrats have increasingly warmed up to the idea of ditching the legislative filibuster, in part because each party played a role in eliminating the 60-vote threshold on presidential cabinet and court nominees.
Democrats, under Reid, used the nuclear option in 2013 to eliminate the filibuster on most presidential and judicial nominees in order to usher through President Obama’s court picks.
In 2017, McConnell employed the nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote threshold for high court nominees.
Now many Democrats believe the legislative calendar should employ the 51-vote threshold, pointing to likely obstruction by Republicans who would block their party’s agenda in 2021.
Reid, the former top leader in the Senate, earlier this month called on all Democratic presidential candidates to pledge to eliminate the filibuster. “The Senate today, after years of abusing an arcane procedural rule known as the filibuster, has become an unworkable legislative graveyard,” Reid wrote.
Senate Democrats, if they win the majority, will ultimately control whether the legislative filibuster will remain.
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has not ruled out eliminating the filibuster if his party wins back control of the Senate. The anti-filibuster views of a President Warren or Harris would weigh heavily on Schumer and his caucus.
“We’ll sit down and figure out the best thing to do to get things done, but we have to get things done and nothing is off the table,” Schumer said in July.
Democrats, if they win both the Senate and White House and maintain control of the House, will be eager to advance a progressive agenda while they control government. Immigration reform, healthcare legislation, and climate change measures don’t stand a chance otherwise.
So far, the top Democratic candidate has not pledged to ditch the filibuster.
Joe Biden, who is leading in all polls and served in the Senate for more than three decades, called ending the filibuster “a very dangerous move,” although he backed Reid’s decision in 2013 to end the filibuster for lower court nominees.
Like other Democrats, Biden’s position on the filibuster has evolved.
In 2005, then-Sen. Biden warned Democrats not to use the nuclear option to lower the threshold on judicial nominees, arguing that the GOP would someday be in the majority again and Democrats would regret the move.
Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and former top leadership aide in the Senate, told the Washington Examiner that the swinging political pendulum will weigh heavily on the minds of Democratic lawmakers in 2021 if they are faced with a vote on ending the legislative filibuster.
Laws rammed through Congress by Democrats, Bonjean noted, would simply be undone once the GOP inevitably gained control again in a few years, creating tremendous uncertainty.
“The Senate would learn a hard lesson over another 10 years or so, that maybe this is not way to do it,” Bonjean said.

Marianne Williamson condemns 'over-secularization of the Democratic Party'

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson discussed her own faith and criticized "conventional politicians" for lacking a "sophisticated understanding" of issues in the United States.
"Some people seem to think if you’re coming from a spiritual perspective, you’re less sophisticated. I respectfully disagree, I think you’re more sophisticated. I think people who have a deeper understanding and commitment to love tend to have a greater recognition of the power of evil," Williamson told the New York Times on Thursday.
She then criticized politicians for not recognizing the "dark psychic force" she referenced in the second Democratic presidential debate.
"The conventional politicians haven’t been mentioning it because they don’t know what to say about it because there’s a lack of sophisticated understanding of what it is and what to do about it," said Williamson.
Williamson's defense of a spiritual perspective came after she criticized Democrats.
"I believe that the over-secularization of the Democratic Party has not served it. And I don’t think it has served the Democratic Party to make people of faith feel so diminished sometimes," said Williamson.
Democratic voters are less likely to believe in God than Republicans and Independents, and religiously unaffiliated Americans overwhelmingly identify as Democrats.
Several Democratic politicians have been criticized for targeting people of faith. Last December, Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, questioned a Catholic judicial nominee over his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization, prompting an official rebuke from the Senate. In 2017, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein drew criticism for telling judicial nominee Amy Coney Barrett, also a Catholic, "the dogma lives loudly within you."
"It’s only been in the last few decades that Democrat and liberal politics has become so overly secularized and so overly corporatized. This is an aberration in my mind, and I’m enough of a student of American history to know that. Franklin Roosevelt said a prayer on the radio as soon as the D-Day invasion began. Look at the Second Inaugural Address of Abraham Lincoln. He contextualized the entire Civil War in terms of what it represented spiritually and his quoting from the Bible and so forth," said Williamson.
In 1978, 6% of Democrats were religiously unaffiliated, while more than 30% identified as Catholic, 19% as mainline Protestant, and 22% as evangelical Protestant. The percentage of Democrats identifying as religiously unaffiliated has more than doubled in the last four decades, while those identifying as Catholic, mainline, and evangelical declined by roughly nine percentage points in each category.
Williamson is the author of over a dozen books about spirituality. She grew up in a conservative Jewish home, but was later influenced by Helen Schucman's 1976 book A Course in Miracles, which the author claimed was dictated to her by Jesus.
She has made love a centerpiece of her campaign, and has said she is "going to harness love for political purposes."

Charles M. Blow: There’s no limit to the administration’s lust for punishment

Texto completo: There seems to be no limit to the cruelty Donald Trump and his administration are willing to exhibit and exact when it comes to immigrants and asylum-seekers from Latin America.
And then conservatives in this country cheer, in much the same way that the Rome mobs in the Colosseum did as people were ripped to shreds by lions.
On Wednesday, Trump’s administration announced new rules that would allow migrant families to be held indefinitely. As The New York Times reported, “The new regulation would codify minimum standards for the conditions in family detention centers and would specifically abolish a 20-day limit on detaining families in immigration jails.”
The day before, the administration announced that immigrant families being held at the border wouldn’t be given flu vaccines. CBS News noted, “The U.S. will not provide vaccines for migrants — even after three migrant children have died in the past year from the flu.”
But none of this will disturb the people who support Trump. This is a large part of the reason they like him.
People often wonder how Americans who had been traditional Republicans could line up behind Trump, who most assuredly is not a traditional Republican. They ask how the religious right could warm to a man who is the opposite in terms of character and piety to all that it has hitherto professed.
I have posited that this is in part because Trump has for them transcended the ordinary and mundane and attained the status of folk hero, a realm in which the rules no longer strictly apply.
But I think that there is also another facet worth exploring: the degree to which Trump’s own punitive spirit aligns with and gives voice and muscle to American conservatives’ long-simmering punitive lust. And this insatiable desire to inflict pain has particular targets: women (specifically feminists), racial minorities, people who are LGBTQ and religious minorities in this country. In short, the punishments are directed at anyone who isn’t part of, or supportive of, the white supremacist patriarchy.
Take this country’s history of dealing with drug use and addiction. According to the Drug Policy Alliance: “The first anti-opium laws in the 1870s were directed at Chinese immigrants. The first anti-cocaine laws in the early 1900s were directed at black men in the South. The first anti-marijuana laws, in the Midwest and the Southwest in the 1910s and ’20s, were directed at Mexican migrants and Mexican Americans. Today, Latino and especially black communities are still subject to wildly disproportionate drug enforcement and sentencing practices.”
The crack epidemic, which many viewed as an inner-city problem among mostly black and brown people, produced a vicious raft of drug laws and the 1994 Crime Bill. However, now that there is an opioid epidemic disproportionately affecting white people, there is a concerted effort to rebrand them as victims rather than criminals and to treat them with a compassion that was denied nonwhite people addicted to drugs in previous eras.
Women fighting for their own rights, equality and body autonomy have, throughout this country’s history, been met with hostility, vitriol, derision and even violence, from the women’s suffrage activists to the women’s liberation movement to our current activists for women’s reproductive rights.
The whole discussion of abortion and those who oppose a woman’s right to choose this legal and legitimate medical procedure is in part rooted in punishment. The woman was a reckless custodian of her body and dared to have sex, unprotected, at a time when she wasn’t prepared to be a mother or with a man she didn’t want to be her child’s father. For shame. She should be made to complete the pregnancy, give birth to the child and raise it. This is her punishment for sex.
The gay rights movement was born of fatigue of people being targeted and punished for the way they expressed their love and their gender. This has evolved from sodomy laws to anti-gay immigration policies to marriage exclusion to HIV criminalization laws to bathroom bills.
This same punitive spirit also shows up in welfare restrictions, conservative opposition to the Affordable Care Act, education policy and criminal justice.
In discussions about the disproportionate rates of black male incarceration or black men gunned down by the police, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve read or heard conservatives say that these black males’ own actions courted the punishment, that they got what they deserved.
This has ever been the case: the flaying of black flesh as punishment for some infraction, perceived or real, from the lash and hounds of slavery to the lynchings that surged after the Civil War, from state execution when the killing moved indoors to our current extrajudicial killings by the police in which morbid act moves back outside.
So Trump’s draconian treatment of people at the border makes perfect sense when viewed through this lens. These immigrants are being punished for coming to this country. People are being punished for seeking asylum. Parents are being punished for bringing their children.
And as Trump increases the pain, a great roar goes up from the Colosseum of Conservatism.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump bromeó con miembros de su ejecutivo con la posibilidad de intercambiar Puerto Rico para adquirir Groenlandia , un territorio autónomo danés.
Después de que se hiciera público el interés del presidente por la isla ubicada al norte de Canadá, un exfuncionario de la administración Trump confirmó aThe New York Times que el mandatario había comentado a modo de broma la idea de cambiarla por la isla caribeña.
Trump manifestó su inclinación por Groenlandia debido a “los abundantes recursos de la isla y a su importancia geopolítica “. Sin embargo, la Primera Ministra de Dinamarca tachó esta idea de “absurda”. “Groenlandia no está en venta. Groenlandia no es danesa, es groenlandesa. Espero que no […] se haya dicho en serio”, expresó el lunes Mette Frederiksen. Tras estas afirmaciones, Donald Trump suspendió la visita que tenía prevista a la reina Margarita II.
Respecto a Puerto Rico, el presidente ha arremetido reiteradamente contra su gobierno , al que a señalado como “ incopetente y corrupto “. La brecha entre el gobierno de la isla y el federal se hizo más grande tras el huracán María en septiembre de 2017. Los isleños criticaron las gestión del gobierno de los Estados Unidos.
Después de The New York Times hiciera pública este jueves la broma de Trump, el exgobernador portorriqueño Aníbal Acevedo Vilá cuestionó en un tuit a la comisionada residente en Washington Jenniffer González y a la actual gobernadora de la isla. “¿Seguirá considerando declararse republicana?”, preguntó Acevedo Vilá sobre Wanda Vázquez, que se inclinó recientemente hacia “filosofías republicanas”.
Según el New York Times, Trump propuso cambiarnos por Groenlandia. ¿Qué tendrá qué decir Jenniffer González sobre esto? ¿Volverá a quedarse callada? Y la Gobernadora, ¿seguirá considerando declararse republicana? La dignidad de Puerto Rico ???? no es negociable. pic.twitter.com/U75u5tCigz

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In a party that overwhelmingly supports President Donald Trump, a few naysayers are popping up, raising the prospect that Trump could face more opposition from within his own party as he seeks re-election to a second term in 2020.
However, unseating Trump will be no easy feat. The president has the power of incumbency, with nearly 8 in 10 Republicans approving of Trump’s overall job performance in a recent poll, and Trump has brought in $57 million in the second quarter of this year alone, excluding money donated to the Republican National Committee.
But, there are a few Republicans who don't seem to be passengers on the Trump train.
Trump is already facing one official challenger in the GOP primary. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced his White House bid in April. Weld ran as Gary Johnson’s running mate on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016.
Joe Walsh, a one-term tea party-backed GOP congressman from Illinois turned conservative radio host, said Thursday during an interview on CNN that he is considering a 2020 primary challenge to Trump.
“I’m strongly, strongly considering it. That’s — again, I’m not trying to be cute or coy,” Walsh said. “I’ve told you before — if somebody’s going to get in there and go after him … it’s got to be done soon. ”
In a New York Times op-ed last week, Walsh wrote, “I didn’t vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 because I liked him. I voted for him because he wasn’t Hillary Clinton. ”
William Kristol, a prominent conservative and “Never Trump” Republican, is encouraging Walsh to run. Kristol is the former editor of the now-defunct conservative magazine The Weekly Standard.
Walsh has been publicly critical of Trump, including the president's fiscal decision-making and racial rhetoric. Walsh also called the 2018 Russia–United States summit in Helsinki “un-American” after Trump publicly seemed to side with Vladimir Putin over the U. S. intelligence community regarding Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
"In Mr. Trump, I see the worst and ugliest iteration of views I expressed for the better part of a decade. To be sure, I’ve had my share of controversy. " Walsh wrote in the op-ed. "On more than one occasion, I questioned Mr. Obama’s truthfulness about his religion. At times, I expressed hate for my political opponents. We now see where this can lead. There’s no place in our politics for personal attacks like that, and I regret making them.
"The fact is, Mr. Trump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects," he also wrote.
Additionally, George Conway, a vocal Trump critic and husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, tweeted his support for a possible Walsh run.
Walsh’s public talk about a possible White House run comes after former Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S. C. , appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday and said he is considering a primary challenge to Trump.
“There’s been a drumbeat over the last year of people who I admire, who are not crazy, who are very thoughtful saying we need to have this conversation,” Sanford, who is also a former governor of South Carolina, said.

Both Walsh and Sanford have said they intend to make a decision about challenging Trump by Labor Day.
Additionally, the Washington Post reports that Jeff Flake, a former Arizona senator and another "never-Trumper," said he has taken numerous recruitment calls in recent days from GOP donors rattled by looming signs of economic turbulence and who are eager for an alternative to Trump.
Flake has also said that it is better for a Democrat to win in 2020 that Trump, declaring, "Four years is difficult enough to unravel some of the damage" caused by the Trump administration, Flake said in March.
"Yes . . . and this notion, this narrative that's been built up, that Donald Trump is the only one that can cobble together the Electoral College and win is just a fallacy," Flake also said in March.

And the prospect for a fifth GOP primary challenger to Trump has cropped up. Former Ohio governor John Kasich will head to New Hampshire next month to “take a look at things” after experiencing “an increase” in overtures this summer, an adviser said. The Washington Post first reported Kasich's upcoming trip.
Speculation about the prospect of one or more new GOP primary challengers to Trump comes after weeks of very public criticism of the president by Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director who recently withdrew his support for Trump. Instead, Scaramucci has declared Trump “unstable” and unfit for office.
He revealed he is in the process of forming a super PAC to run advertisements against his former boss.

Scaramucci called his past support for Trump a mistake and is seeking to take action in the political arena against the president. He also ridiculed against Trump on Twitter, comparing the president to the Game of Throne's Night King and calling Trump a "bully. "
The view that Trump is a bully who must be removed from the political scene by someone on the conservative side of the political spectrum is one shared by Walsh ho wrote as much in his New York Times op-ed.
“We need someone who could stand up, look the president in the eye and say: 'Enough, sir,'" Walsh penned. "'We’ve had enough of your indecency. We’ve had enough of your lies, your bullying, your cruelty, enough of your insults, your daily drama, your incitement, enough of the danger you place this country in every single day. We don’t want any of this anymore, and the country certainly can’t stand four more years of it. '”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Joe Walsh, a conservative radio show host and former Republican congressman from Illinois, is expected to announce he is running for president as early as this weekend, presenting President Trump with a challenger from the right his critics hope will weaken the president in the 2020 election.
Mr. Walsh stands virtually no chance of wresting the Republican presidential nomination from Mr. Trump, whose approval rating with Republican voters is consistently in the high 80s, and whose political aides have been aggressively moving to tighten their control over state parties to thwart primary challenges.
But those encouraging Mr. Walsh, a Tea Party conservative who served one term in the House and went from staunch Trump supporter to acerbic critic, hope he can appeal to reluctant Trump voters who are open to an alternative.
In 2016, Mr. Walsh wrote on Twitter that he was voting for Trump, adding: "On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?" Now, Mr. Walsh is calling the president a "racial arsonist" and hoping to turn his fighter personality around on Mr. Trump to help defeat him.
Before his likely announcement, according to two people who have spoken with him, Mr. Walsh has hired a senior political adviser, organized meetings with high-profile Trump antagonists in New York City, and published an Op-Ed in The New York Times with the goal of previewing his campaign message.
Mr. Walsh has yet to definitively say whether he is running. "If I do it, it's going to be before Labor Day," he said in an interview.
Once an ardent and vocal critic of Hillary Clinton, Mr. Walsh said the breaking point for him came last year during Mr. Trump's meeting in Helsinki, Finland, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
"He lost me for good in Helsinki, when he stood in front of the world and said, 'I believe Putin and I don't believe my fellow Americans,"' Mr. Walsh said, framing a potential run as a moral imperative "to stick our necks out because when people see that, more and more people will."
Mr. Walsh is being encouraged by William Kristol, the conservative writer and former editor of the now defunct magazine The Weekly Standard. Mr. Kristol has been a "Never Trump" Republican since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016 and has been working hard over the past year to recruit someone to run against him.
Mr. Kristol said Mr. Walsh's comfort with the in-your-face format of conservative talk radio makes him a potentially more effective combatant against Mr. Trump than someone like William Weld, the genteel former governor of Massachusetts, whose own primary challenge to the president has gained little traction.
"He has a different appeal than Bill Weld," Mr. Kristol said. "The fact that he was a Tea Party congressman who voted for Trump in 2016 gives him an ability to speak to Republican primary voters that 'Never Trumpers' like me don't have."
Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's campaign, responded to a request for comment with two words about Mr. Walsh's possible challenge: "Certain failure."
But Lucy Caldwell, an adviser to Mr. Walsh, said she planned to make an appeal to "traditional campaign consultants who should look beyond fear of losing an R.N.C. contract, and think about why they got into politics in the first place."
Mr. Trump's advisers have been mindful for over a year that primary challenges can expose weaknesses in re-election efforts, and can conclude with messy delegate fights on the floor of the Republican National Convention. Led by the former White House political director, Bill Stepien, they have been working to tighten their stranglehold on state parties to make it virtually impossible for any primary challenger to amass delegates.
Some Trump advisers are more concerned about a primary challenge than they publicly let on, as Mr. Trump faces more strain in the job than he has in many months. They are also aware that primary challenges can weaken incumbents in a general election. The most recent example was President George Bush, who faced a primary challenger from the right in 1992 from Patrick J. Buchanan, a former aide to Richard Nixon and a prominent conservative.
In Mr. Trump's case, there is little to no space to his right for a challenger to occupy. And his lock on Republican voters has remained solid. But primaries can drain energy and resources, particularly when the president is increasingly focusing on distractions, like a feud with his 11-day communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, who has recently turned against his former boss, calling him a "demagogue" and encouraging Republicans to take a stand against him.
Some public polling has found that more than 40 percent of Republicans are open to a primary challenge to Mr. Trump.
"One of the things that is clear is that there is a high interest in an alternative," said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who has been working with Mr. Kristol on a group called Defending Democracy Together, to resist Mr. Trump from within the party.
"People say they like the economy and some of the things he's doing on immigration and judges, but he's divisive and doesn't tell the truth," Ms. Longwell added. "People have eyes. They're very clear about who this person is. These are not the people who attend the rallies."
Mr. Kristol, who acknowledged that he had made several efforts at recruiting a Republican to take on Mr. Trump, admitted that the race would be "David and Goliath," with Mr. Walsh as the underdog.
"But I think he's a good David," he said.
In his New York Times Op-Ed, Mr. Walsh said he regretted some of the excesses of his own political career like questioning President Barack Obama's "truthfulness about his religion" and expressing "hate for my political opponents," noting "we now see where this can lead."
He called Mr. Trump "unfit for office" and wrote that "in Mr. Trump, I see the worst and ugliest iteration of views I expressed for the better part of a decade."
Mr. Walsh said he was aware of the challenges that he would face if he ran. Among them will be the almost certainty of losing his radio show.
"Unless you wash this guy's feet every day," he said, "it's hard to keep a radio show or TV show in conservative media."

Texto completo: A year ago last Friday, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason."
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
Why is the assault on the press dangerous?
* It undermines our democracy.
* It allows those in power to say, "Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be."
* It allows partisans of both parties to say, "Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology." Or, "because you agree with my cult personality."
* It allows anyone who screws up to say, "The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger."
The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Texto completo: A few years ago, I took a call at the nature center about a big snake in Tekakwitha Woods Forest Preserve. The caller was pretty rattled, and she wanted someone to "do something."
We naturalists are pretty used to snake calls. I calmly suggested, "It could be a fox snake. Not at all dangerous." As I began to launch into the benefits of native snakes, she interrupted. "No! It’s really big!"
One of our rangers had received a similar call and was already out looking for the suspect serpent. He spotted some kids clustered around a tree with mouths agape and easily homed in on the problem.
There, coiled on a branch, was a REALLY big snake. It was a four-foot ball python. The source of the exotic reptile could only be a pet owner who didn’t want it anymore.
Castoff critters are a local and a worldwide ecological problem. In the case of the Tekakwitha Woods python, no harm was done (that we know of). An animal control expert captured the snake, which was put up for adoption with a more responsible owner. But untold numbers of pets released in natural areas are not retrieved. Scads of them reproduce and wreak ecological and economic havoc.
Take Chance the Snapper, the headline-grabbing gator in Chicago who held media attention last July. An anonymous pet owner released it in Humboldt Park. A coldblooded creature, Chance would have little chance of survival in our brutal winter, but he could do significant damage to wildlife, people and property in the meantime.
Chance evaded capture for a week. Finally, the city of Chicago brought in the big guns, hiring a gator-trapper from Florida with a price-tag upward of $30,000.
Less ominous than an alligator or a python on the loose is the common goldfish. Yes, the tiny orange fish that you brought home from the pet store in a plastic bag can become a 10-pound monster in the wild.
"Goldfish are one of the world’s worst invasive aquatic species," according to an article in The New York Times. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources reported that goldfish are present in almost all waterways of Illinois.
What makes little Swimmy so pernicious in the wild? Goldfish are omnivorous and fecund — in other words, they’ll eat anything in their path and make tons of babies. They roil up the stream bed and muddy the waters for native species that need clear streams. They also carry diseases that are easily transmitted to native fish.
Other animals frequently let loose in natural areas are frogs, birds, and turtles. Lots of turtles. I once watched a woman release an unwanted red-eared slider in the salt marsh where I worked in the San Francisco Bay Area. I couldn’t stop her in time. This eastern, freshwater turtle wasn’t long for the world in the salt marsh.
The best turtle release story can be traced to Al Capone. The Chicago Tribune reported, "In November 1930, a ‘deluge’ of box turtles was ‘mysteriously let loose’ on South Michigan Avenue ... The owner of those turtles … was none other than Al Capone. Capone had attempted to cash in on the increasingly popular sport of turtle racing, hoping to feature it at his speak-easies. … The legendary mobster had an underling purchase 5,000 turtles in Oklahoma. When the venture didn’t pan out, a frustrated Capone had his henchmen dump the turtles, which was how 2,000 of them turned up on Michigan Avenue, and another 3,000 or so surfaced in Cicero."
Scarface’s motives aside, why do people release pets in the wild? Boredom, perhaps? Kids easily tire of sedentary pets. (Box turtles are famously unexciting.) Parents don’t want to clean or feed them. There’s also the expense. Keeping pets costs money, and resentment grows along with the dollars spent on the darn critter.
Like the turtle in the tank, a pet owner finds himself between a rock and a hard place. The animal’s gotta go, but what are the options? Euthanizing the pet seems barbaric and heartless. (And what would you tell the kids?) That leaves the Free Willy solution. Return the animal to the wild and watch it swim/fly/crawl into the sunset.
Hold on a minute. Releasing a pet may seem like a gesture of love, but, in reality, it’s cruel. It’s also illegal in natural areas. The wild is no ecological nirvana for an animal born and raised in captivity.
"The fallout can be catastrophic," according to a July 2019 National Geographic article. "If the animal doesn’t die as a result of predation, exposure, or starvation, it may find a mate, proliferate, and become an invasive species."
What’s the solution? Naturalist Pam Otto with the St. Charles Park District has solid advice.
"First and foremost, realize what you’re getting into before you ever bring the critter home," Otto says. "Budgies, goldfish and rabbits live upward of 10 years; snakes and salamanders over 20 years; turtles anywhere from 30 to 80-plus years, depending on species. Getting an animal when it’s young means you’re signing up for (a long) period of caretaking and responsibility. Instead of getting a hatchling snake, adopt one that’s 15 years old. It will still have 5 to 10 good years left. Boom! You’ve cut your time commitment in half."
If you must part with your pet, Otto says, "Rescue groups are an option. Besides the Chicago Herpetological Society, we’ve worked with Friends of Scales, Fur Angels and the Greater Chicago Caged Bird Club. These are all-volunteer organizations that house homeless pets in foster homes and adopt out via application."
Sometimes pet stores will take healthy, older pets as display animals, she added.
In our heart of hearts, most of us want to do right by the animal. Remember, most pets are not equipped to survive in the wild. Those that do become pests in no time. Say goodbye in a way that respects your pet and the natural environment.

Texto completo: I am going to say this as simply and clearly as I can: If you’re an American Jew and you’re planning on voting for Donald Trump because you think he is pro-Israel, you’re a damn fool.
Oh, don’t get me wrong. Trump has said and done many things that are in the interests of the current Israeli government — and have been widely appreciated by the Israeli public. To deny that would be to deny the obvious. But here’s what’s also obvious. Trump’s way of — and motivation for — expressing his affection for Israel is guided by his political desire to improve his re-election chances by depicting the entire Republican Party as pro-Israel and the entire Democratic Party as anti-Israel.
As a result, Trump — with the knowing help of Israel’s current prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu — is doing something no American president and Israeli prime minister have done before: They’re making support for Israel a wedge issue in American politics.
Few things are more dangerous to Israel’s long-term interests than its becoming a partisan matter in America, which is Israel’s vital political, military and economic backer in the world.
As Dore Gold, the right-wing former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and once a very close adviser to Netanyahu, warned in a dialogue at the Hudson Institute on Nov. 27, 2018: “You reach out to Democrats, and you reach out to Republicans. And you don’t get caught playing partisan politics in the United States.’’
Trump’s campaign to tar the entire Democratic Party with some of the hostile views toward Israel of a few of its newly elected congresswomen — and Netanyahu’s careless willingness to concede to Trump’s demand and bar two of them, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, from visiting Israel and the West Bank — is part of a process that will do huge, long-term damage to Israel’s interests and support in America.
Netanyahu later relented and granted a visa to Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, for a private, “humanitarian’’ visit to see her 90-year-old grandmother — provided she agree in writing not to advocate the boycott of Israel while there. At first Tlaib agreed, but then decided that she would not come under such conditions.
Excuse me, but when did powerful Israel — a noisy, boisterous democracy where Israeli Arabs in its Parliament say all kinds of wild and crazy things — get so frightened by what a couple of visiting freshman American congresswomen might see or say? When did Israel get so afraid of saying to them: “Come, visit, go anywhere you want! We’ve got our warts and we’ve got our good stuff. We’d just like you to visit both. But if you don’t, we’ll live with that too. We’re pretty tough.’’
It’s too late for that now. The damage of what Trump and Bibi have been up to — formally making Israel a wedge issue in American politics — is already done. Do not be fooled: Netanyahu, through his machinations with Senate Republicans, can get the United States Congress to give him an audience anytime he wants. But Bibi could not speak on any major American college campus today without massive police protection. The protests would be huge.
And listen now to some of the leading Democratic presidential candidates, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — you can hear how unhappy they are with the behavior of this Israeli government and its continued occupation of the West Bank. And they are not afraid to say so anymore. As The Jerusalem Post reported on July 11, “Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose presidential candidacy has rallied in recent weeks, told two Jewish anti-occupation activists ‘yes’ when they asked her for support.’’
But who can blame them? Trump is equating the entire Democratic Party with hatred for Israel, while equating support for Netanyahu — who leads the most extreme, far-right government that Israel has ever had, who is facing indictment on three counts of corruption and whose top priority is getting re-elected so that he can have the Israeli Knesset overrule its justice system and keep him out of court — with loving Israel.
How many young Americans want to buy into that narrative? If Bibi wins, he plans to pass a law banning his own indictment on corruption, and then, when Israel’s Supreme Court strikes down that law as illegal, he plans to get the Knesset to pass another law making the Supreme Court subservient to his Parliament. I am not making this up. Israel will become a Jewish banana republic.
If and when that happens, every synagogue, every campus Hillel, every Jewish institution, every friend of Israel will have to ask: Can I support such an Israel? It will tear apart the entire pro-Israel community and every synagogue and Jewish Federation.
Then add another factor. By moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — and turning that embassy, led by a Trump crony, Ambassador David Friedman, into an outpost for advancing the interests of Israeli Jewish settlers, not American interests — Trump has essentially greenlighted the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
Don’t get me wrong. I strongly oppose the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement — which Representatives Omar and Tlaib have embraced — because it wants to erase the possibility of a two-state solution. And I am particularly unhappy with Representative Omar.
I know a lot about her home district in Minnesota, because I grew up in it, in St. Louis Park. Omar represents the biggest concentration of Jews and Muslims living together in one district in the Upper Midwest. She was perfectly placed to be a bridge builder between Muslims and Jews. Instead, sadly, she has been a bridge destroyer between the two since she came to Washington. But anytime she is legitimately criticized, Democrats automatically scream “Islamophobia’’ and defend her. That’s as disturbing as Trump.
I know that more than a few Somali immigrants in Minneapolis, who face so many challenges — from gang violence to unemployment — are asking why is Omar spending time on the West Bank of the Jordan and not on the West Bank of the Mississippi?
I love Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs — but God save me from some of their American friends. So many of them just want to exploit this problem to advance themselves politically, get attention, raise money or delegitimize their opponents.
In that, Trump is not alone — he’s just the worst of the worst.

Texto completo: If you want to dine at one of the world's best restaurants, you don't have to travel very far. The Grey at 109 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. has earned a spot on Food & Wine and Travel + Leisure's inaugural World's Best Restaurants list, which was released Tuesday morning.
The list, which is unranked and includes 30 establishments from around the world, was curated by writer Besha Rodell, Food & Wine editor
Hunter Lewis, Travel + Leisure editor Jacqueline Gifford, a panel of 22 culinary personalities and one anonymous critic.
"Being included in something called 'Best in the World' by such highly regarded publications, certainly tells us that we are doing something that resonates here and abroad. But, more importantly, it reminds that we have built a team that is world-class and we have not yet even begun to tap the potential of this extraordinary group of people. That's really exciting for all of us," said founding partner Johno Morisano, who opened the restaurant alongside partner and executive chef Mashama Bailey nearly five years ago.
The inaugural list celebrates the very best of cuisine and culture, and The Grey earned a spot because it's one of a handful of restaurants in North America that best reflects its place of origin, Lewis told the Savannah Morning News.
"From a design point of view, The Grey is a beautiful gathering place with historical resonance, and Mashama Bailey's talent for elevating the foodways of the region and creating modern, luxurious, and soulful dishes is second to none. We're also impressed with Mashama and Johno's leadership and the work culture they've created at The Grey that other restaurateurs can learn from," he said.
The Grey has regularly earned national acclaim, including from The New York Times, Eater, Time magazine and Southern Living. Most recently, Bailey was awarded the 2019 James Beard award for best chef in the southeast. She's also featured on the latest season of the Netflix series "Chef's Table."
Morisano said when he and his wife moved to Savannah eight years ago, their goal was to become part of the community and contribute to it. He and Bailey approached The Grey the same way, he said.
"I think outlets like these take notice of The Grey because we stick to our knitting. We're just making food and creating experiences for our guests. In the larger scheme of things in this world, it's not that big a deal. But, in order to make those experiences complete, we have to endeavor to get them exactly right 100% of the time - which we do not accomplish because it's really difficult," he said.
"So while recognition like this is awesome and puts some gas in our tank, tomorrow we will be back to being completely focused on that night's dinner service."

Trump sees 'disloyalty' in Democratic Jews

Texto completo: President Trump on Tuesday said that Jewish people who vote for Democrats are showing "either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty," prompting an outcry from critics who said the president's remarks were promoting anti-Semitic stereotypes.
Trump made the comment in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office ahead of a meeting with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.
Trump began by lashing out at Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, questioning the sincerity of her tears at a news conference where she talked about her decision not to travel to Israel to see her grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank.
"Yesterday, I noticed for the first time, Tlaib with the tears," Trump said. "All of the sudden, she starts with tears, tears. . . . I don't buy it for a second, because I've seen her in a very vicious mood at campaign rallies, my campaign rallies, before she was a congresswoman."
He then went on to attack Democrats more generally over the views of Tlaib and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Both women have long been critics of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians. They support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, a global protest of Israel known as BDS.
"Where has the Democratic Party gone?" he asked. "Where have they gone, where they're defending these two people over the state of Israel? And I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty."
Critics on both sides of the aisle immediately pointed out that Trump's use of the word "disloyalty" had echoes of anti-Semitic tropes accusing Jews of dual allegiance.
Omar responded to the president's remark with a two-word tweet. "Oh my," she said, followed by a face palm emoji.
Some on Tuesday also noted that the overwhelming majority of American Jews have long voted Democratic.
In 2016, for instance, 71 percent of Jewish voters voted for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, while 23 percent voted for Trump, according to exit polls.

Trump cancels Denmark trip after Greenland rebuffWASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday night abruptly canceled a trip to Denmark, writing on Twitter that because the country's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, “would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland," they would meet “another time."
Trump was scheduled to visit Copenhagen on Sept. 2-3, after being invited by Queen Margrethe II.
Last week, Trump confirmed reports about his long-held interest in buying Greenland from Denmark, a land deal he has become interested in because of the island's natural resources, like coal and uranium.
“Well, a lot of things can be done," Trump said Sunday. “Essentially, it's a large real estate deal."
But Trump also claimed that discussing a potential purchase of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory reliant on Danish support, was not the purpose of his trip to Denmark. “We may be going to Denmark, but not for this reason at all," he said.
Tuesday night, Trump scrapped the entire visit.
He said he was reacting to Frederiksen's hard rejection of his interest. “Greenland is not for sale," she told a Danish newspaper this week. “Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenland. I strongly hope that this is not meant seriously."
Apparently, it was.
“The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct," Trump tweeted. “I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!"

Pompeo, GOP heavyweights meet amid Senate rumors
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo attended a private briefing over lunch on Tuesday with Republican stalwarts including Arthur Laffer, Steve Forbes, and billionaires John and Margo Catsimatidis, amid rising speculation that the top US diplomat may run for the Senate next year.
The attendees at the lunch hosted by the Committee to Unleash Prosperity were confirmed by two people familiar with the event.
The move comes amid rising speculation that Pompeo, a former House member from Kansas, may step down from President Trump's administration to run for a Senate seat opening up following the retirement next year of Pat Roberts.

Billboard in Baltimore calls Kushner a 'rich pest'
A billboard in Baltimore, supported by the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, draws a comparison between the president's son-in-law and a rat, playing off President Trump's recent comments in which he called the Maryland city a "rat and rodent infested mess."
The billboard went up Monday near City Hall, the city's central police district office, and other municipal buildings.
It shows a cartoon of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is an owner of rodent-infested apartment buildings in the Baltimore area.
On the billboard, Kushner is called a "rich pest" as he sits on a pile of money; across from him is a cartoon rat holding a piece of cheese. The billboard calls it "poor guy just trying to survive."
In late July, Trump sent tweets disparaging Baltimore, calling it a "disgusting" place "no human" would want to live.
Kushner owns more than a dozen apartment buildings that were cited for more than 200 code violations in 2017.

Pompeo Says Iran Strategy Is Working

Texto completo: The Islamic State has gained ground in some areas, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged on Tuesday, despite President Trump's proclamation that the extremist group had been vanquished.
Mr. Pompeo also conceded, in a television interview, having some frustration in dealing with North Korea.
But he said he believed the administration was finding success with the intensified sanctions against Iran that were set in motion after Mr. Trump repudiated the 2015 nuclear agreement with that country.
"We've put in place a set of sanctions that have denied the Iranian regime wealth," Mr. Pompeo said in the interview, on "CBS This Morning." In the administration's view, he said, "that is working."
Mr. Pompeo spoke ahead of an appearance later Tuesday at a United Nations Security Council meeting on the Middle East, where he sought to portray Iran as the region's principal wrongdoer.
"Failing to confront the Iranian regime's malign activities will only grow the regime's multicontinental body count," Mr. Pompeo told reporters outside the Security Council.
In prepared remarks before the Council, he accused Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, of having "gone all-in on a campaign of extortion diplomacy" to frustrate the administration's intention to bring all Iranian oil purchases to zero. Among the examples he cited were the Iranian seizures of foreign-flagged oil tankers traversing the Strait of Hormuz last month.
There are expectations that Iran will release one of those vessels, the British tanker Stena Impero, in coming days, following the release over the weekend of an Iranian tanker, the Grace 1, by the British territory of Gibraltar, despite American pressure. That vessel, which has been renamed the Adrian Darya-1 by Iran, has been reported heading to Greece.
But the State Department said Tuesday that it had warned Greece and other countries that the Iranian vessel was in violation of American sanctions and that any providers of assistance could be vulnerable to criminal prosecution in the United States.
"The United States has a set of sanctions that preclude crude oil from being shipped to any country," Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the Security Council. "We've made clear, anyone who touches it, anyone who supports it, anyone who allows a ship to dock is at risk of receiving sanctions from the United States."
Iran's United Nations ambassador, Majid Takht Ravanchi, who also spoke at the Security Council meeting, attributed the Middle East's instability to what he described as the history of American interventionism and Washington's support for Israel and Saudi Arabia.
The United States, he said, had "persistently sowed division between the regional countries," and "the Iranophobic statements of the U.S. officials serve also the same purpose."
The tensions between the United States and Iran have raised fears of a new armed conflict in the Middle East.
All other major powers, including the American allies Britain and France, support the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and have urged the United States to rejoin it. The agreement limited Iran's nuclear activities in return for an end to most economic sanctions against the country.
The Trump administration has argued that the agreement is weak and merely delays the time when Iran would be able to make a nuclear weapon. The administration's position is not widely shared. Iran promised under the agreement that it would never seek nuclear arms.
Mr. Trump's declarations of success in some other high-profile issues -- notably in terminating the Islamic State and ending the menace of North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities -- have faced increased skepticism.
Mr. Pompeo offered a mixed answer in the CBS interview when asked about reports, including a New York Times article, on the revival of the Islamic State in the Middle East, five months after Mr. Trump declared that the group's self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq had been defeated.
"It's complicated," Mr. Pompeo said. "There are certainly places where ISIS is more powerful today than they were three or four years ago. But the caliphate is gone and their capacity to conduct external attacks has been made much more difficult."
Regarding North Korea's threats to the United States, which Mr. Trump said he had eliminated after having met the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore last year, Mr. Pompeo also offered a mixed picture.
"We haven't gotten back to the table as quickly as we would have hoped, but we've been pretty clear all along we knew there would be bumps along the way," he said in the CBS interview.
Mr. Pompeo also acknowledged having some frustration over the recent, repeated firing of short-range missiles by Mr. Kim's forces, in what has been seen as a warning. North Korea, analysts say, is seeking leverage in a new round of talks that Washington hopes to start soon.
"Yes, I wish that they would not," Mr. Pompeo said. "But in the end, Chairman Kim made a commitment to President Trump, in Singapore in June of last year, where he said he was prepared to denuclearize."
Also on Mr. Pompeo's New York agenda on Tuesday was a meeting at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, a conservative group that includes the billionaire Steve Forbes and the economist Arthur B. Laffer. The meeting added to speculation that Mr. Pompeo was weighing a Senate candidacy in his home state of Kansas.
Asked in the CBS interview about his political aspirations, Mr. Pompeo did not rule out anything but emphasized his fealty to Mr. Trump: "I would love to serve for him just as long as I can," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

UPS invests in self-driving trucking company

Texto completo: ATLANTA - UPS announced its venture capital arm UPS Ventures is investing in autonomous driving company TuSimple and testing self-driving tractor-trailers.
The tests of self-driving trucks started in May 2019 on a route between Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona with a driver and engineer in the vehicle, according to Sandy Springs-based UPS.
The company said it wants to better understand what would be required for autonomous trucking in its network, at a level where "the vehicle's onboard computer is in complete control at all times, eliminating manual intervention."
TuSimple, founded in 2015, aims to bring the first self-driving truck to market with technology for shipping companies to operate self-driving tractor-trailers.
UPS noted that it contracts with third-party trucking companies to handle the influx of shipments during its peak holiday shipping season, and TuSimple believes it can cut the costs of that contracted trucking by 30 percent.
"While fully autonomous, driverless vehicles still have development and regulatory work ahead, we are excited by the advances in braking and other technologies that companies like TuSimple are mastering," said UPS chief strategy and transformation officer Scott Price in a written statement. "All of these technologies offer significant safety and other benefits that will be realized long before the full vision of autonomous vehicles is brought to fruition," he added.
The potential for autonomous vehicles was a subject of negotiations in talks for a UPS-Teamsters labor contract for drivers and others who handle small packages.
The deal struck last year calls for the company to review technological changes with the union six months before rolling out changes, such as the deployment of delivery drones, driverless vehicles or other innovations.
Late last year, the threat of a strike by UPS Freight workers prompted the company to disrupt freight service. UPS Freight handles bulk shipments on pallets from shippers to stores, and when the union announced the potential for a strike, the company temporarily cleared its network of freight until workers approved the new contract.

Texto completo: After a couple of wild weeks, with financial markets and the economy sending mixed signals, the question of the moment is: Are we on the verge of a recession?
Looking at the rest of this year, almost all forecasters say no. While the US economy is slowing, the output of goods and services should continue at a respectable clip of about 2 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to remain near a 50-year low (it was 3.7 percent in July), and a spike in inflation is on no one's radar.
But the picture is far less certain if we peer farther down the road.
In a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists, 38 percent of respondents said they expected a downturn in 2020. The good news: That's a dip from 42 percent in the group's survey in February, before the Federal Reserve made clear it would ease interest rates as needed to extend the economic expansion.
The caveat: Most respondents to the survey, which was taken July 14 through Aug. 1, replied before the trade fight with China escalated. On Aug. 1, President Trump ordered tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing responded by letting the value of its currency slide against the US dollar, which was seen as a retaliatory move.
Since then, US stocks have taken a bumpy ride lower, and bond investors are acting like they consider a recession inevitable.
Still, given all the concern recently about corporate America growing cautious, it is interesting, even heartening, to see some business economists pushing back their recession forecast to 2021. Thirty-four percent of those surveyed by the NABE don't see the economy contracting until 2021, up from 25 percent in February.
“Survey respondents indicate that the expansion will be extended by the shift in monetary policy," Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG and president of the NABE, said in a statement.
In other words, the Fed's willingness to keep credit flowing — confirmed with its quarter-point rate cut on July 31 — probably keeps the economy moving forward through next year.
That would be good news for workers, management, and investors. It would also benefit Trump as he runs for reelection next year. A recession before November 2020 would seriously hurt the president's bid for a second term.
Recent economic data show manufacturing declined for two consecutive quarters, and business invesment softening.
But consumers remain confident and are continuing to spend, which is essential, since our purchases account for more than two-thirds of economic activity. In July, retail sales rose a faster-than-expected 0.7 percent.
“I think they're mainly feeling what's going on in the labor market — people are getting jobs and real wage growth is a little higher than it has been," said Megan Greene, the NABE's survey chair and a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center of Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School. “We see the same phenomenon in Germany right now. The economy is circling the drain, but if you speak to regular Germans about it they haven't noticed because unemployment is low and their standard of living hasn't suffered."
So what could trigger a recession before 2021?
The list of threats has become familiar: tariffs and the trade war; recessions in key economies such as China and the aforementioned Germany; a decision by Britain to exit the European Union without a divorce agreement. (The NABE survey found 60 percent of respondents anticipate a no-deal Brexit or a “hard Brexit," which could entail some kind of transition agreement.) And we can't rule out a shock from a military confrontation with Iran or North Korea.
“Often, a recession results when some widely held belief about the world turns out to be false," Neil Irwin of The New York Times wrote over the weekend. “In 2001, it was that a technology boom would fuel the economy and the stock market indefinitely; in 2007, it was that the housing market would never melt down across all regions at once."
These days, Irwin said, events are undercutting our belief in progress — “that the world will only become more stable and interconnected over time, and that trade, currency and diplomatic relationships can be counted upon."
That's a scary proposition. Unfortunately, it's an entirely reasonable one, too.

Social media is poisoning American minds, and media literacy is the cure

Texto completo: In 1987, "The Closing of the American Mind" was a nonfiction best-seller. In 2019, we might as well have "The Poisoning of the American Mind" on the best-seller lists.
That thought came to mind when the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein popped up on social media almost immediately - reinforced by none other than the president of the United States.
"Hours after Mr. Epstein was found to have hanged himself in his Manhattan jail cell, Mr. Trump retweeted a post from the comedian Terrence Williams linking the Clintons to the death," reported the New York Times. "Mr. Epstein 'had information on Bill Clinton & now he's dead,' wrote Mr. Williams, a Trump supporter."
In no time, an abundance of similar posts appeared on my Facebook and Twitter feeds. When I tried to debunk those claims with facts from credible sources - a time-tested strategy I teach in my English classes - I was met with scorn and ridicule: "How dare you question the idle and speculative theories we formulated within 24 hours of a story breaking!"
Social media, simply, is poisoning American minds.
New York Times opinion writer Charlie Warzel made a comparable observation, noting how "our information delivery systems were not built for our current moment - especially with corruption and conspiracy at the heart of our biggest national news stories (Epstein, the Mueller Report, mass shootings), and the platforms themselves functioning as petri dishes for outlandish, even dangerous conspiracy theories to flourish."
While Warzel focuses on the responsibility of social media platforms to quell such disinformation, I place the blame on individuals, who should know better. Unfortunately, "The Poisoning of the American Mind" is in full swing.
But first, back to Allan Bloom's book "The Closing of the American Mind," which questioned the direction of higher education at the time. Bloom, a University of Chicago professor and proponent of the "the Western canon" - classic texts that critics deride as the work of "dead white guys" - disliked the multiculturalism emerging on American campuses. The book, not surprisingly, sparked a lofty debate among educational elites.
Funny thing, though: Bloom's book reached the top spot on the best-seller list and stayed there for four months. In total, the book sold more than 1 million copies in its first year of publication.
Somehow, I doubt an erudite tome espousing the values of a classical education would be quite so popular in 2019. Which begs the question: Has the American mind really "closed" since 1987? Yes, I would offer, but not so much that some poison can't still seep in.
Author Tom Nichols chronicled just how much the American mind has closed in his 2017 book "The Death of Expertise." Many factors have been at play, but the rise of the internet is foremost. To that point, Nichols describes the "Google-fueled, Wikipedia-based, blog-sodden collapse of any division between professionals and laypeople." In other words, everyone is an expert now!
"This is the opposite of education, which should aim to make people, no matter how smart or accomplished they are, learners for the rest of their lives," writes Nichols. "Rather, we now live in a society where the acquisition of even a little learning is the endpoint, rather than the beginning, of education. And this is a dangerous thing."
And thus, "The Poisoning of the American Mind." Social media has insidiously enabled the most ridiculous and pernicious ideas to spread like a virus - think "measles" in a vaccine-free environment - which puts all of us at risk. But rather than waiting for tech companies to deliver a cure, I offer an antidote on the personal level: media literacy.
Adults must become vigilant and apply a skeptical mindset to all information they see. True, many people remain annoyingly stubborn and woefully illiterate in this regard, but most adults should recognize this state of affairs as a serious "societal-health crisis."
In addition, we must place particular focus on children. To that end, the state Department of Education's Digital Citizenship, Internet Safety, and Media Literacy Advisory Council has been working for two years on recommendations for the classroom, which can't arrive soon enough. Otherwise, the poison will only continue to ooze into American brains for years to come.

Kennedy mulling run at Markey

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III is weighing a primary challenge to Senator Edward J. Markey, according to a person close to Kennedy and a Democratic congressional source, a move that would upend Massachusetts politics and trigger a potentially divisive intraparty fight.
Kennedy will make a decision about whether to run in the coming weeks, the person close to him said, adding that the four-term congressman began weighing the idea recently after he was approached by people urging him to make the bid.
The 38-year-old scion of the nation's most famous political family paid for a poll in recent weeks testing a matchup against the 73-year-old Markey, according to two Democratic operatives familiar with the poll. The survey found voters favored Kennedy by a small margin, according to several people familiar with the results.
Publicly, Kennedy's team has said he plans to run for another term for the Fourth Congressional District, which stretches from Brookline and Newton south to Fall River. His behind-the-scenes consideration of a high-profile primary challenge, however, is another sign of how the state's longstanding tradition of respecting incumbents is ending, a demise hastened by the 2018 midterm elections, which showed voters clamoring for fresh faces.
Kennedy would hardly be in the mold of insurgent candidates Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who knocked off veteran House Democrats in primary upsets in part by calling for new and younger voices in the party. He is the grandson of former US attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 while campaigning for president. If he runs, Kennedy would be following a familiar family path toward higher office.
Such a challenge would instantly become the most-watched congressional primary in the state, and likely the country, a generational battle between two well-liked members of the Democratic establishment. Markey, a Malden native elected to the Senate in 2013, has been a fixture of Massachusetts politics since he first won a House seat in the suburbs north of Boston in 1976, running as a political rebel unafraid to take on the Democratic establishment.
“If Joe Kennedy got into the race, he would be the front-runner automatically, and Ed Markey would be faced with the most difficult race of his life," said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic consultant based in Boston.
Markey has been building his reelection campaign — he had a sizable war chest of $4 million in cash on hand as of June 30.
“Senator Markey is running for reelection no matter who enters the race," spokeswoman Giselle Barry said Saturday. “He is crisscrossing the state and will continue campaigning hard."
Markey has collected endorsements from several members of the state's congressional delegation, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has made a video supporting him, according to one person familiar with it. But there are notable holdouts, including Pressley and Representative Katherine Clark, a member of House Democratic leadership who is close with Kennedy. The news that Kennedy was weighing a primary challenge was first reported Saturday by The New York Times.
Markey's hold on the Senate seat has been the subject of talk among Massachusetts political insiders after Pressley's 2018 upset of Michael Capuano, a 10-term incumbent with a well-established liberal record, showed Massachusetts voters were open to primary challengers who make a compelling argument.
That speculation kicked into high-gear after Politico this week reported on telephone poll testing Kennedy against Markey. A citizen group has also launched an effort to draft Kennedy into the race.
But a primary challenge would surprise some Democrats who know Kennedy as a loyal and patient team player during his six years in Congress.
Former representative Barney Frank, a Democrat who was succeeded by Kennedy, said challenging Markey would seem out of character.
“Because he's a very effective, highly regarded member who works well with other members, it would be totally inconsistent with his mode of politics," Frank said.
And Frank did not sound warm to the prospect. “The idea that tens of millions of dollars would be spent on Democrats fighting other Democrats who have virtually no policy differences is crazy," he said.
But Kennedy has been elevating his national profile. Democratic leaders chose him to give the party's rebuttal to President Trump's State of the Union address in 2018. During the midterms later that year, he traveled widely to campaign for other Democrats, and he frequently pens op-eds about his political beliefs on issues including foreign policy, mental health treatment, and legalizing marijuana.
Challenging Markey could be preferable to waiting for a Senate seat to open up — a development which could draw other high-profile contenders. Kennedy had $4.2 million in his campaign account as of June 30 and is known as an effective fund-raiser.
A group of Massachusetts Democrats is actively urging Kennedy to run, launching a website, Facebook group, and, just recently, an online petition that has about 200 signatures so far.
“We launched this effort not because we are anti-Markey, but because we strongly believe in Congressman Kennedy and his vision for America. These are unusual times in our nation and a new era in politics in which incumbency no longer means that someone is entitled to elected office in perpetuity," said the draft movement's organizers in an op-ed published in Commonwealth Magazine.
“In our view, we need passionate, proactive leadership in the US Senate to combat the divisiveness of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republican Party. We need Joe Kennedy."
The Massachusetts delegation's longest-serving member, Markey already faces two primary challengers, though neither is well-known: Shannon Liss-Riordan, a labor attorney, and Steve Pemberton, a former foster child who became an executive and author.
With all the interest in his seat, Markey has been circling the wagons, lining up high-profile endorsements from major interest groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, a group that supports abortion rights; raising money; and spending on social media ads. Markey also has teamed with Ocasio-Cortez on legislation for her Green New Deal proposal to fight climate change, an issue he has been active on for years.
Markey's vulnerabilities stem from his decades-long tenure in Congress, plus the fact that he is not as well known as some of his other colleagues, such as Warren, said Peter Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College.
“I think he [Kennedy] and a number of other Democrats believe that Senator Markey has some vulnerabilities. And given some of the generational politics that we have seen playing out over the last few years, it doesn't surprise me that there would be a challenge to Markey," Ubertaccio said.

Why Was There No Reckoning?

Texto completo: As a result, I was a primary target of Gamergate. They tried to hack my studio. They attempted to steal and publish my academic records. They shot videos wearing skull masks and showing viewers the knives they said they planned to murder me with. But I stood my ground; I didn't back down and I told reporters the truth about what was happening.
I meticulously documented all of it -- the death threats, the rape threats, the identity theft. And, along with other women who were being targeted, I waited for law enforcement to prosecute the men who had threatened to murder me and other women. I met with the F.B.I., with the White House and with members of Congress. I waited for justice. I am still waiting.
I wish I could tell you that it's gotten better. It hasn't. Gamergate gave birth to a new kind of celebrity troll, men who made money and built their careers by destroying women's reputations. It poisoned our politics and our society. Attacks on journalists, disinformation campaigns, the online radicalization of young men -- these are depressingly familiar symptoms of our current dysfunction.
What about in the gaming industry? Before those events in 2014, there was almost no discussion about the challenges women faced in game development. We build worlds of fantasy for men, by men. Gamergate should have been a time of reckoning for the gaming community, which had long been rife with sexism and misogyny. It wasn't.
Since Gamergate, there is finally some awareness of these problems, but there has been little action. The number of women promoted to senior positions and studio heads is still dismally low. In the workplace, women have a persistent sense of being undervalued and unheard. Gamergate gave our industry an easy villain to blame for our problems. The perception was that women were leaving because of harassment. The reality was that we were leaving because we felt underpaid, underpromoted and unable to balance the demands of work and life.
We needed the men who sexually harassed us at work to be fired. What we got instead were catered luncheons for women in tech. Even today, game studios rarely stand by their employees who are targeted by online mobs who use exactly the same tactics they used during Gamergate. Everyone agrees sexism is a problem, yet no one admits to sexism.
Since Gamergate, many women I know are reluctant to speak publicly on gender issues, because they fear -- rightly -- that they will be targeted and harassed. One close friend told me she could not risk her young daughter being targeted or worse -- growing up without a mother. Women who have been sexually harassed simply leave their companies out of fear of ending up in the press. Speaking up exerts a heavy price, as does being silent.
And yet, there are thousands of small victories that came as a result of Gamergate. I know women who were in college five years ago who saw the sisterly solidarity in the gaming industry and were inspired to follow their dreams and make video games. Women today are vastly more organized and better networked. When a game conference has an all-male lineup, you can be certain that the organizers are going to hear about it. When you look at the bylines of industry publications, there are many more women today than there were in 2014. This isn't the revolution we wanted, but I now feel certain that revolution will come.
The main lesson I took from Gamergate is that asking the status quo to do the right thing doesn't work. In a way, that is empowering. Instead of asking men to fix this field, women need the power to fix it ourselves. Increasingly, women are founding game studios, pushing for promotions and helping young women find their first jobs. The people who hate us are more organized, but so are we. And for myself, I decided to run for the House of Representatives, to give law enforcement the resources to prosecute online extremism. Perhaps the most lasting legacy of Gamergate will not be prosecutions but the leaders who stepped up after the carnage.

Texto completo: There has been a lot of talk recently in the political arena about the likability trap for women: Women who behave in authoritative ways risk being disliked as insufferable prima donnas, pedantic schoolmarms or witchy women.
What you haven't heard about much is the way successful women overcome this form of gender bias. I have interviewed about 200 women over the years in my research on gender and the workplace, and they all employ a similar set of strategies for escaping the likability trap. One former chief executive described hers this way: "I'm warm Ms. Mother 95 percent of the time, so that the 5 percent of the time when I need to be tough, I can be." She embraced a stereotype that typically holds women back -- the office mom -- but flipped it around, using its momentum to propel herself forward. I call it gender judo.
Why do women need to do this? Even as women have moved into traditionally male domains, feminine mandates remain. More than 40 years of research by social scientists have shown that Americans define the good woman as helpful, modest and nice. In other words, as focused on her family and community, rather than working in her own self-interest. Meanwhile, the ideal man is defined as direct, assertive, competitive and ambitious.
This version of masculinity maps perfectly onto what we expect from leaders, in business and politics. Women in leadership need to display these "masculine" qualities, but when they do they risk being seen as bad women, and also as bad people. So savvy women learn that they must often do a masculine thing (which establishes their competence) in a feminine way (to defuse backlash).
In their study of female entrepreneurs, the social scientists Matthew Lee and Laura Huang found that venture capitalists were more likely to fund companies led by women if those companies were presented as having a social impact. This provides a "cover" that helps women overcome the perceived mismatch between the stereotypes of the good, community-focused woman and the hard-driving entrepreneur.
Other research finds that women make a similar finesse while negotiating. Women who negotiate as hard as men do tend to be disliked as overly demanding. So they use "softeners" in conversation. ("It wasn't clear to me whether this salary offer represents the top of the pay range.") When Sheryl Sandberg negotiated for what no doubt was an outlandishly high compensation package at Facebook, she told Mark Zuckerberg: "Of course you realize that you're hiring me to run your deal teams, so you want me to be a good negotiator. This is the only time you and I will ever be on opposite sides of the table." She turned a salary negotiation (competitive and ambitious) into a touching testimony of team loyalty.
Isn't this all a bit revolting? Here's what works for men negotiating for a higher salary: I have another offer, and I need you to match it. Why should women have to do something different?
They shouldn't.
When women embrace feminine stereotypes like the office mom, they reinforce both the descriptive stereotype that women are naturally nurturing and communal, and the prescriptive stereotype that they should be. But sometimes what women need to do to survive and thrive in the world is exactly the opposite of what they need to do to change it.
For women who want to master this strategy, the first step is to behave as assertively as comes naturally and see what happens. If you find your effectiveness jeopardized because you being yourself triggers dislike, then you need to decide whether overcoming the backlash is worth the sacrifice.
If it is, try doing something masculine in a feminine way. Think of femininity as a tool kit, and choose something that feels authentic to you. But don't choose deference. One study found that women who used a submissive conversational style, apologizing and hedging, just undercut themselves.
The most common anti-backlash strategy I found in the women I interviewed was to mix authoritativeness and warmth. "I got feedback I was intimidating, so I would make sure that I got to know people, and before a meeting I would share something personal to make myself more approachable," one woman, who is now a chief executive, told me.
Some women use metaphors to recode behavior that is coded as masculine. A woman responsible for winning new clients at a major consulting firm, where rainmakers were called "hunters," told me she rejected that label. "I always said: 'No, no, no, I'm a gardener. I grow things,"' she told me. Just another dame who loves to nurture.
Another tried-and-true move is what anthropologists call gender display. "For me, it's pink lipstick," one woman told me. She is the lone female member of the board of a public company.
In the most sophisticated form of this strategy, powerful women create an entirely new narrative, softening their hard-driving personas by highlighting that they are also communal, selfless mothers. A brilliant recent example is M.J. Hegar's 2018 congressional campaign video. In it, a battered door -- all that's left of the helicopter she was shot down in while on an Air Force rescue mission -- is tucked behind her dining table, where she sits contentedly with her family.
This is all a lot of hard work, and it's work that men don't have to do. Men, to be successful, just need to master and display masculine-coded traits; women, to be successful, need to master both those and some version of feminine-coded traits that do not undercut their perceived competence or authenticity. That's a lot trickier.
What's the solution? Organizations have to be vigilant about challenging the biases that force women to do this in the first place. The workplace is often structured in ways that reward behavior that's considered socially appropriate in white men but socially inappropriate in women and people of color. This provides an invisible escalator for white men.
The goal is not to empower women to be as emotionally tone deaf and grabby as men are sometimes encouraged to be. Instead, we should work to make sure that both men and women are rewarded for displaying empathy or a willingness to put the common good above self-interest. These qualities have long been undervalued in work and in political life because they have been coded as feminine, and the world needs much more of them.

Nike alters policy for pregnant athletes

Texto completo: Nike is changing its policy to guarantee a pregnant athlete's pay and bonuses cannot be cut over the 18-month period covering eight months before the athlete's due date and 10 months after. Under Nike's previous policy, which had been updated in 2018, according to a spokesman, that period lasted 12 months.
"Female athletes and their representatives will begin receiving written confirmation reaffirming Nike's official pregnancy policy for elite athletes," a spokesperson wrote in an email. "In addition to our 2018 policy standardizing our approach across all sports to ensure no female athlete is adversely impacted financially for pregnancy, the policy has now been expanded to cover 18 months."
In a form letter intended for athletes and agents dated Aug. 12, John Slusher, Nike's executive vice president of global sports marketing, said the new policy also will apply to current contracts.
Nike came under fire after several athletes denounced how it and other apparel companies treated them financially after becoming pregnant. Tennis star Serena Williams said Nike supported her during and after her pregnancy, but multiple track and field athletes described problems.
In a New York Times op-ed in May, sprinter Allyson Felix wrote that contract renewal talks broke down after Nike offered to pay 70 percent of her previous salary and refused to guarantee she wouldn't be financially punished for performing below her standard in the months before and after childbirth. In another Times op-ed, distance runner Kara Goucher said she felt forced to train, owing to financial pressure, rather than care for her newborn.
Felix gave birth in November after an emergency Caesarean section, the complications of which threatened her and daughter Camryn. She returned to competition in July at the U.S. outdoor championships, then announced she had signed a sponsorship contract with Athleta, a deal that includes a partnership for initiatives that empower women.

Texto completo: AIKEN, South Carolina — Elizabeth Warren is sticking with her endorsement of fellow Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey amid rumors that Rep. Joe Kennedy III is eyeing a primary challenge against him in 2020, but she had kind words for the young Kennedy.
“I endorsed Ed Markey six months ago, seven months ago,” Warren told reporters in Aiken, South Carolina, on Saturday. “Eddie has been a great partner in the Senate."
“Joe Kennedy is also a great partner,” Warren continued. “He and [his wife] Lauren were both my students, and I worked with Joe before either one of us was in politics and have worked with him ever since he's been in Congress. He's really an amazing person.”
The New York Times reported Saturday that Kennedy, 38, would decide in the coming weeks whether to challenge Markey, 73, citing a senior Democratic official. Aides for Kennedy did not deny involvement in poll testing Kennedy’s prospects against Markey. A group intended to draft Kennedy for the race was formed after the poll was conducted.
"This is not about the incumbent. It's not about Sen. Markey. We admire his public service over the past 43 years,” Jamie Hoag, who helped launch the group to draft Kennedy, told Politico. “This is about Joe Kennedy and why we think he would be the best fit for the U.S. Senate.”
Representatives for Markey say that he will not be chased into retirement rather than end his long career in public office with a primary defeat.
Kennedy is serving his third term in Congress, representing a district that encompasses some Western Boston suburbs and stretches south to areas outside of Providence in neighboring Rhode Island. Markey is serving his first term as a senator, having previously represented northern suburbs in Boston in Congress for 37 years.
Kennedy is a grandnephew of former President John F. Kennedy. His father, John F. Kennedy II, was a congressman for 12 years, retiring in 1999.

Maybe the forces of liberty will win

Texto completo: Sadly, few people are rooting for liberty these days, and even among those who are, there's a dismaying amount of pessimism about its prospects.
Consider China.
There's a new bipartisan consensus these days: The "elites" made a "bad bet" on China.
We were told by "elites" that giving China access to the global marketplace would deliver huge economic benefits for America. Simultaneously, economic liberalization in China would lead to political liberalization. After all, the history of democratization usually begins with growing prosperity. As the middle class gets richer, it demands rights and protections once enjoyed only by aristocrats -- i.e. political representation and the rule of law. This is how liberal democracy emerged in England and Holland in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in much of the rest of the free world since then. The same will happen in China, policymakers said. And since democratic societies tend not to go to war with each other, American and global security will improve.
And now, today's elites insist that it was all false.
While it's true that the benefits were oversold and the costs minimized, it's not clear to me that any of these claims are settled.
On the economic front, plenty of studies show that Americans benefited from increased trade with China. Consumer goods got cheaper, particularly for lower-income Americans. Yes, America lost some manufacturing jobs to China -- though it almost certainly lost more to robots. But competition with China also yielded more hiring of Americans in non-manufacturing jobs, a much larger part of our economy. Perhaps this painful transition was necessary and inevitable. (For those interested, Duke Law School's Scott Lincicome authored an excellent survey of the economic literature at the Bulwark in January.)
In short, the economic argument is a mixed bag. Though the fact that hundreds of millions of Chinese people were lifted out of abject poverty -- by markets -- is a moral victory for humanity and an important demonstration of the fact that police states alone don't make life better for the policed.
Which brings us to freedom. Beijing remains stubbornly -- and by some measures, increasingly -- authoritarian. It's not as bad as when Chairman Mao killed some 60 million of his own people, but China's technologically advanced police state is still plenty grotesque.
Why? A scholar who spent years in China once explained to me that the government -- i.e., the Communist Party -- is often more afraid of the people than the people are of it. The Communist Party understands the history of democratization as well as anyone. It's just betting that artificial intelligence and facial recognition will keep its aristocrats in power in ways that the bayonets and gunpowder of yesteryear could not.
China is in a nationalist phase, just as Germany, France, Italy and other former or would-be Great Powers were on their way to democracy. That poses very real dangers to the global order in the same way the nationalist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries did. Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm wanted what he called a "place in the sun" for the German empire, and so did Adolf Hitler. Chinese leader Xi Jinping wants it, too.
Whether it was a young political scientist named Woodrow Wilson hailing Otto von Bismarck's authoritarian Prussia as the most "admirable system ...and most nearly perfected" in the world, or Lincoln Steffens claiming upon his return from Soviet Russia that he'd "seen the future, and it works," or New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wishing that America could learn from China's "one party authoritarianism," virtually every time nationalist and authoritarian regimes seize the reins, countless Western intellectuals became convinced that a better, more "efficient" model of government had been created.
As George Orwell observed, this sort of thinking amounts to power-worship, and this mindset leads people to think that current trends will only continue in a straight line into the future.
But that's not how the last three centuries have gone. Power-hungry experts love to tell us freedom has had its day, yet liberty keeps winning. The freedom fighters in 2019 Hong Kong may meet the same fate that the protestors in Tiananmen Square did in 1989. But that doesn't mean they'll be remembered as victims of a lost cause. Rather, they might be remembered as proof that liberty can win in the long run, when people fight for it.
The great lie about China wasn't that good things would come from its enrichment, but that the good things would be instantaneous -- and easy. Liberty is never easy. It takes work.

Texto completo: In her first season as artistic director of the Portland Chamber Music Festival, Melissa Reardon has largely maintained the traditions established by the festival's founder, Jennifer Elowitch. Her programming of the main festival concerts at Hannaford Hall follows Elowitch's pattern of mixing established masterworks with contemporary works and 20th century rarities. And to play them, she assembles ensembles of mostly young players, some already established, others at the start of their careers but already regarded as promising.
That said, Reardon is already experimenting with new twists that will put her own stamp on the festival. There have been more concerts outside the two weeks of the main festival, including several at Space, and both in the summer festival and in the Space concerts, she has introduced Chamber Pop, a crossover series that can be an interesting sideline, so long as it doesn't proliferate to the point where its overtakes the festival's principal musical mission.
That mission was fully on display Thursday evening, in a program that included Mozart's Clarinet Quintet (K. 581) and Schumann's Piano Quartet (Op. 47), framing a vital but more rarely heard work by Prokofiev, the Sonata for Two Violins (Op. 56).
The Mozart, written in 1789, two years before the composer's death at age 35, has that otherworldly quality that makes his late works so irresistible. Everything you expect is there: The courtly language and structural symmetry of the Classical era are fully in place, as is the clarity of texture and clean lines that give each strand of instrumental interplay a distinct character. Yet there is something extra that you don't hear in the music of Mozart's contemporaries, or even in Mozart's earlier works - a depth that defies analysis, and is often called spirituality, partly for lack of a more precise term, and partly because it just feels right.
That is especially so in the slow movement, which is tinged with the same sort of heart-rending but elevated melancholy you hear in "Dove Sono" and "Porgi Amor," the Countess' two central arias in "The Marriage of Figaro," composed three years earlier. Alexander Fiterstein, the clarinetist, played the line in that spirit, with an almost vocal inflection and purity of tone.
Fiterstein brought that same warmth, though channeled through a brighter filter, to the lively opening Allegro, the graceful Menuetto and the bright-hued, lively finale, and his colleagues - violinists Jesse Mills and Susie Park, Reardon on viola and Karen Ouzounian, cellist - produced a plush ensemble sound, and characterful individual interactions in the work's elaborate interplay.
Alexi Kenney and Tai Murray followed the Mozart with a vigorous performance of Prokofiev's two-violin work. Composed in 1932, the Sonata does not yet show the bitterness that became part of Prokofiev's music (like Shostakovich's) after Stalin had more time to mess him around. But you do get some of Prokofiev's trademark steeliness, in the brusque second movement, as well as his evocative wintery sound, in the slow movement.
Kenney and Murray did a superb job of making Prokofiev's spare scoring sound rich and full-bodied, as if they were a full quartet, while also creating an flexible, fully responsive balance between the two lines.
The second half of the program was devoted to the Schumann, in a beautifully shaped, steamily Romantic performance by violinist Park, violist Dov Scheindlin, cellist Clancy Newman (whose own work, "Collision Course" opens the final program Saturday) and pianist Robert McDonald. The ensemble handled the frequent shifts of focus and tempo in the opening movement with a compelling fluidity. Another highlight, though a fleeting one, was the degree to which the players brought out the almost Mendelssohnian sprightliness of the Scherzo. And the passion and energy with which they played the finale was perfectly calibrated.

Texto completo: To get a laptop that's usable for most schoolwork, you typically need to spend at least $ 450 to $ 500. Spend less, and you'd have a better experience browsing the internet on your phone.
At this price, I've seen jangly trackpads, loose keys, unreadable screens, hinges that can't hold a screen upright, and processors that buckle under the load of two browser tabs. Still, if you know what to look for, you can find a laptop that can browse the web and handle most schoolwork, such as writing term papers or taking notes. At Wirecutter, I've tested dozens of laptops, and here's what I'd recommend as the best laptops under $ 500.

The specs to look for
When shopping for a laptop under $ 500, you don't have a lot of control over features, but there is a minimal threshold to meet for a good experience. You could get a laptop for $ 200, but you shouldn't. Here's what to look for:
■ Solid-state storage: I've found that SSD storage instead of spinning hard drives makes the biggest difference in how a laptop feels to use in everyday tasks. Launching applications and opening files is much snappier on an SSD than on a hard drive.
■ Seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core i3 or i5 processor: An Intel Core i3 processor offers plenty of power for basic Web browsing, word processing, and video watching. (A Core i5 is better but rare in this price range.) You can find Pentium and Celeron processors at this price, but they're too slow for Windows. Chromebooks can get away with a less powerful Core m3 processor.
■ 4 GB (preferably 8 GB) of memory: A laptop with 4 GB of memory allows you to have two or three applications open at a time, but after 10 or so browser tabs it'll slow to a crawl. A model with 8 GB is much better, but rare. Chromebooks can get away with 4 GB of memory because that operating system doesn't require as much as Windows to run smoothly.
This leaves you with a choice between three different types of computers: a Chromebook, a Windows laptop, or a tablet.
If you want something portable or durable, and you rely mostly on Google Docs for schoolwork, get a Chromebook. If you prefer Windows and don't mind dealing with slightly sluggish performance and less durability in favor of wider software support, get a Windows laptop. If you want a light and portable device primarily for writing or for taking notes, get an iPad.
Consider a Chromebook
If you don't need Windows applications or access to specialty software, buy a Chromebook. They're better built, they have longer battery life, and they're easier to update than their Windows-based competitors.
Chromebooks run Google's ChromeOS, where you do everything through the Chrome Web browser. They're most useful for students who do coursework in Google Docs or through online education portals. Chromebooks update automatically and have no bloatware or preinstalled software to remove the way Windows laptops do, which makes them much easier to use. Chromebooks can run some Android mobile apps but can't run Windows applications, so they aren't good for tasks that require special software, such as coding or media editing. Despite being browser based, Chromebooks do have offline support, according to Google, but they're not as useful as a Windows computer if you don't have an internet connection.
For under $ 500, Wirecutter's pick for the best Chromebook is the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA. Weighing less than 3 pounds, it has a 10-hour battery life, a bright touch-screen, and a backlit keyboard that's comfortable to type on. But this model is old and won't get software updates after 2022. If you can spend more than $ 500, get Wirecutter's pick for the best Chromebook overall, the Asus Chromebook Flip C434TA, which has a larger screen and a newer processor and is often on sale for around $ 530. The C434TA is a classy laptop and could be mistaken for a high-end Windows computer at a glance. Both Chromebooks are fine options for high school and college students who work in Google Docs and are rarely without an internet connection.
If you're shopping for younger students in elementary or middle school, I'd go with Wirecutter's budget Chromebook pick, the Acer C771T, which has a slower processor but also offers a durable case made to withstand a beating. I've seen this laptop continue to work even after a kid dunked a full glass of water on it.
What to look for in a Windows laptop
For $ 500 you can't get a Windows laptop that can multitask that well or run memory-heavy programs, but you can get one that feels snappy enough for browsing the Web, running lightweight productivity software, and watching movies. A cheap Windows laptop can do what a Chromebook can, but it's also likely saddled with bloatware, worse battery life, slow performance with lots of tabs open, and a cheaper-feeling case. The main reason to get one over a Chromebook is if you need to run Windows software.
The best option I've found is the Asus VivoBook Flip 14 TP412FA. Its 128 GB of SSD storage is plenty for most people, and the Core i3 processor is fast enough. Its biggest problem is its measly 4 GB of memory, which causes it to slow down if you run more than three applications at once or open about 10 tabs in a browser. Otherwise, the VivoBook Flip's touch-screen is vibrant (albeit a bit too reflective for outdoor use), and the keyboard is comfortable and backlit. And although I had issues with the trackpad not always registering movement, it's still better than most options in this price range. The battery was underwhelming in my tests, lasting less than five hours. That won't get you through a day of school without having to find a plug to charge.
The next-best option I've found is the Acer Swift 3 SF314-54-39BH, which isn't as well built but performs just as effectively and has a battery life of around seven hours.
Who an iPad works (and won't work) for
An iPad makes for a bad laptop -- but not everyone needs a laptop. If you would use a laptop only to browse the Web, handle email, or take notes in class, you might be better off skipping a laptop in favor of an iPad and an external keyboard. The combo of a sixth-generation iPad and a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard is cheaper than a Windows or Chromebook laptop, not to mention lighter, more versatile, and better in battery life than most Windows options.
I'd choose an iPad over a similarly priced laptop for watching movies, browsing the internet, reading textbooks, and writing (emails, essays, or notes). Basically, it's perfect for a lot of liberal arts students. If you prefer to take digital handwritten notes, the sixth-generation iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil, which works better than the Windows and Chromebook styluses I've used.
The iPad is a bad choice if you code, edit media files, work extensively in Google Docs, do design work, or require a mouse.
When to upgrade
Laptops under $ 500 are good for students who don't need special software, as well as for anyone who just wants to browse the Web. If you need a laptop capable of creative tasks, heavy multitasking, or gaming, you have to spend more money, but our guide to the best laptops can help you find what you need.

Texto completo: CAPE TOWN, South Africa - It was like a scene from the apartheid days: a military unit with armored trucks and assault rifles patrolling the streets of a South African township.
But as soldiers arrived in Mitchells Plain, an impoverished suburb outside Cape Town, people did not hide inside or erupt in protest, as many would have decades ago when the army was a symbol of white minority rule.
Instead, residents rushed from their homes to welcome the troops, who were sent in in July to quell an extraordinarily bloody spate of gang violence and have remained in the area ever since.
"This is what we need," said Nasser Myburgh, a radio technician, watching soldiers and police search a house on his street for drugs. "The people are shooting here every night."
Cape Town, widely known as a tourist destination for its historical sites and natural beauty, has become one of the world's most dangerous cities. Police recorded more than 2,800 killings in 2018, and its homicide rate - about 66 killings per 100,000 people - is surpassed by only the most violent cities in Latin America, according to the Citizens' Council for Public Safety and Criminal Justice, a nongovernmental group in Mexico,
The violence largely stems from escalating turf battles between gangs that traffic in drugs, weapons and illicit goods like abalone, a shellfish prized by poachers.
Trying to stanch the bloodshed, President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered the military intervention July 12, despite experts' warnings that soldiers can do little about the underlying issues, like worsening corruption and rising unemployment, that have allowed gangs to reign over the townships for decades.
The area of Mitchells Plain where Myburgh lives is on the Cape Flats, an expanse fringing the city where Black and mixed-race people were forcibly moved from central parts of the city during apartheid.
His neighborhood has been divided by a warring array of gangs: the Hustlers, Rude Boys, Ghetto Kids, Spoilt Brats, Hard Livings and Americans, whose symbols include dollar signs and the U.S. flag. Gang graffiti marks the walls of the small, crowded houses, many with backyard shanties to compensate for a lack of housing.
The first weekend of military patrols saw killings drop on the Cape Flats, according to provincial health authorities. Over the following weekend, 46 people were killed.
The police precinct with the highest number of killings in South Africa last year, Nyanga, also in the Cape Flats, had 308 killings - one fewer than Baltimore, a city with 10 times as many people. Mitchells Plain had 140 killings, while central Cape Town - home to upmarket restaurants, galleries and hotels - had just eight.
This year, intensifying gang rivalries have driven the violence to crisis levels. The murder rate was "about twice as bad as what we've seen before," said Jean-Pierre Smith, the city's mayoral committee member for safety and security.
Officials like Smith say that the military deployment, called Operation Prosper, will help stabilize Cape Town's 10 most dangerous neighborhoods and allow important social programs to resume working - schools and ambulances, for example, cannot operate in many areas. But critics warn that bringing in the army may only dampen the violence.
"As soon as the army leaves, a lot of these gangs are going to uncover their weapons and drugs and go back to business as usual," Stupart said.
Every evening, Myburgh, the radio technician, locks his family indoors and switches on the television. "Walk outside," he said, "you're probably going to get shot."
Gangsterism is less a syndrome of the Cape Flats than its dominant governing force. Early gangs took root amid the turmoil of forced removals from the 1960s, '70s and '80s, when tens of thousands of families were evicted from neighborhoods designated for whites. Unemployment has remained high in much of the area; in Mitchells Plain, less than 37% of the population has a job.
After apartheid, when South Africa's international borders opened, many gangs morphed into powerful criminal enterprises, said Simone Haysom, a researcher at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.
"The gangs still feed on state neglect and social dysfunction," said Haysom, the author of a book about violence in the Cape Flats. "But the territorial control, the profits and the violence are vastly greater than they have ever been before."
Also driving the conflict is a ready supply of weapons, many obtained from corrupt officials: in 2016, for example, a veteran police officer in Pretoria was convicted of illegally selling around 2,000 firearms, most of which ended up in Cape Flats.
"It's the guns that changed everything," Myburgh said.

Texto completo: Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib’s since-canceled trip to Israel was sponsored by Miftah, an exceptionally anti-Semitic group that encourages Palestinian terrorists and claims Jews used the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover. The organization also publishes Neo-Nazis and supports calls for the destruction of Israel.
But you would never know this about Miftah from following the press' coverage of the congresswomen’s fight this week with the government of Israel. In reporting on Omar and Tlaib’s controversial junket, some of America's largest and most prestigious newsrooms have managed somehow to omit the most damning details of the sponsoring group’s outright anti-Jewish bigotry.
Just an oversight, I am sure.
The L.A. Times’ editorial board, for example, describes Miftah simply as “a nonprofit organization headed by a Palestinian lawmaker." No further context is provided. Additional reporting from the L.A. Times on Israel’s decision to block Tlaib and Omar from visiting does not even mention that the U.S. lawmakers’ trip was sponsored by Miftah.
Elsewhere, a review of seven separate Associated Press reports found only a single example of Miftah mentioned by name. That lone mention is as follows:
MIFTAH, the Palestinian organization that was to host Tlaib and Omar in the West Bank, issued a statement saying that Israel’s decision was “an affront to the American people and their representatives” and “an assault on the Palestinian people’s right to reach out to decision-makers and other actors from around the world.”
The remaining six Associated Press reports refer to the anti-Semitic organization simply as a “Palestinian group,” a “Palestinian organization,” and twice as a “Palestinian organization aimed at highlighting the plight of the Palestinians.” The group's anti-Semitism and anti-Israel mission are never mentioned.
Over at the New York Times, there is more of the same. The editorial board chose Thursday to focus its anger on President Trump, claiming he encouraged Israel to block the trip solely “to titillate the bigots in his base.” Speaking of bigots, the editorial’s only mention of Miftah is when it quotes the anti-Semitic group directly to describe it as one that promotes “global awareness and knowledge of Palestinian realities.” Additional New York Times reporting characterizes Miftah only as “an organization headed by a longtime Palestinian lawmaker, Hanan Ashrawi.”
To the newspaper’s credit, it published an opinion article Friday, which correctly describes Miftah as a group that “has proudly praised female suicide bombers and pushed the medieval blood libel.” So, there is at least that. But that is it. The United States' most powerful newspaper makes no mention anywhere else of Miftah’s activities and beliefs in its coverage of the Omar and Tlaib vs. Israel story.
The Washington Post's reporting has been similarly silent on Miftah's outrageous bigotry. Two separate articles, one published Thursday and one published Friday, use the exact same language to characterize Miftah as “a nonprofit organization headed by Palestinian lawmaker and longtime peace negotiator Hanan Ashrawi.” That is it. Nothing more. Though the Washington Post could not be bothered to provide any details or commentary on the nature of Miftah, it did manage to find the time to profile Rep. Tlaib’s grandmother.
There is much, much more like this from our leading newsrooms.
Of Miftah, Reuters says only that it is “a West Bank-based nongovernmental organization that is co-sponsoring the trip.” Yahoo! Finance calls it simply a “nonprofit organization headed by Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi.” Bloomberg News does not even try to describe the group. ABC News meanwhile quotes Miftah to describe it as a “nonprofit Palestinian group” that seeks a "sovereign, independent, democratic, tolerant and inclusive Palestinian state, which grants Palestinians their basic rights, preserves their dignity, and enjoys international recognition and respect."
The Washington Examiner itself published articles this week quoting the anti-Semitic organization directly to characterize it as a pro-Palestinian nonprofit that seeks a "sovereign, independent, democratic, tolerant and inclusive Palestinian state.” However, unlike every other newsroom mentioned in the above, and with the sole exception of that one New York Times op-ed, the Washington Examiner is the only one that has provided additional reporting and commentary detailing Miftah’s anti-Semitic history, activities, and mission statement.
If I remember correctly, American newsrooms were quick in 2018 to talk about the dangers posed to Jews in both the United States and abroad following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. There was no shortage of discussions about the threats Jews face every day with the worldwide rise of anti-Semitic sentiment. None of this is wrong. Anti-Semitism is real and it is getting worse.
It is nothing short of breathtaking, then, to see that many of these same newsrooms have chosen to ignore Miftah’s overtly anti-Semitic beliefs and rhetoric. I am sure it has nothing to do with the fact that the two American lawmakers involved in this week's story are also members of the Democratic Party. I am sure that is totally unrelated.

New Jersey town hires birds of prey to combat flocks of aggressive gulls

Texto completo: Ocean City, New Jersey, has hired birds of prey to keep its aggressive sea gull population at bay while summer tourists enjoy the Jersey shore.
The sea gulls in Ocean City are exceptionally antagonistic birds, according to the New York Times. The birds routinely dive-bomb people walking the boardwalk with food.
Ocean City, a popular summer vacation spot, has hired four hawks, two falcons, and an owl to patrol the boardwalk with their trainers daily to ward off the flocks of hungry gulls.
Sea gulls have snatched crackers, sandwiches, and pretzels from the hands of tourists and locals. The birds have begun biting people with food. Usually, the person will drop whatever they’re holding and a swarm of sea gulls will drop down and eat as much of the fallen food as they can.
"I've seen them take on an entire pizza," said Tom Baglini, 71, a resident of Ocean City. "I saw the guy and he had the box, and he took one slice out, and the bird came down, hit the slice, then hit the box, and the pie hit the ground, and then, like hundreds of birds just swarmed."
Ocean City’s hired birds have helped tame the sea gulls. While the gulls never leave, the presence of a falcon or owl make the gulls keep their distance from the throngs of people walking up and down the boardwalk.
"The best way to put nature back into balance is to bring back predators," Sierra Club chapter director Jeff Tittel said. "Whether it's hawks or falcons in urban areas to reduce pigeon populations, or sea gulls along the coast, it makes a lot more sense."
The hired birds are trained not to attack the gulls. The city is paying out $2,100 a day through labor day to keep the aggressive gulls away through Labor Day. After that, the summer crowds will disperse and the gulls will once again have free rein of the boardwalk.

Sanders campaign continues attacks on journalists: 'Their paychecks are signed by a billionaire'

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign made the latest addition to their enemies list quite explicit on Thursday: journalists employed by "corporations" and "billionaires."
In the first edition of "Bern Notice," a digital newsletter released by the Sanders campaign designed to circumvent traditional media outlets, campaign speechwriter David Sirota wrote a fiery screed against so-called corporate media and its conspiracy to sink the Vermont senator's second presidential bid.
"Reporters don’t have to receive a call from Jeff Bezos to know that their paychecks are signed by a billionaire with a well-known personal and corporate agenda — and knowing that agenda exists can shape overall frameworks and angles of coverage," the left-wing reporter-turned-politico wrote.
Sirota continued to argue that Sanders' policy agenda of radically redistributing wealth and expanding the social safety net is driving critical coverage of the campaign, which has significantly struggled to replicate its 2016 primary performance.
"Does corporate and billionaire ownership help create a general framework of coverage? Yes, of course," wrote Sirota.
The attacks from Sirota comes just days after Sanders lashed out at the Washington Post for its coverage.
“See, I talk about that all of the time,” Sanders replied. “And then I wonder why the Washington Post — which is owned by Jeff Bezos, who owns Amazon — doesn’t write particularly good articles about me. I don’t know why," Sanders said Monday in New Hampshire. "But I guess maybe there’s a connection. Maybe we helped raise the minimum wage at Amazon to 15 bucks an hour as well.”
Sanders’ criticism of the media echo remarks he has made dating back decades.
"Television is the major vehicle by which the owners of this society propagate their political points of view (including lies and distortions) through the 'news,'" Sanders wrote in an op-ed published about 40 years ago.
"The function of private media is to make money for the people who own the media," Sanders said in a 1988 speech, during his first failed House race. "You can be damn sure that when you own and control this country, you own and control the media."
The Vermont senator has long decried horse-race political stories and articles about personal characteristics as “gossip.” Sanders sticks to talking about his democratic socialist policy ideas rather than adjusting his message or tactics to garner more press coverage.
Sirota joined the Sanders campaign in March and previously wrote for a variety of outlets including Huffington Post, New York Times, and the Guardian.
In 2013, Sirota penned a defense of Hugo Chavez's leadership in Venezuela for a column in Slate.
"When, by contrast, a country goes socialist and its economy does what Venezuela's did, it is not perceived to be a laughing matter — and it is not so easy to write off or to ignore. It suddenly looks like a threat to the corporate capitalism, especially when said country has valuable oil resources that global powerhouses like the United States rely on," Sirota wrote.

Robert Gehrke: This proposed Utah law may give dating apps the tools they need to warn against catfishing

Texto completo: Last year, a Kaysville woman went to the FBI alleging a man she had met through an online dating app claimed to be an FBI security expert and had asked her to order him cellphones he needed for his job.
She had let him order the phones through her account and, before she knew it, he allegedly had ordered between $200,000 and $500,000 in phones that he didn’t pay for, having them shipped outside the country, according to KSL.
It’s just one example of a problem not uncommon on online dating apps, so-called “catfishing,” where someone pretends to be someone he or she is not in order to take advantage of an unsuspecting individual.
It’s nothing new. It has been prevalent enough that it has been the focus of books and television shows.
Now, one of the leading online dating platforms, Match Group — which runs OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder and, of course, Match.com — is advocating for a new law in Utah requiring dating apps that ban a user for catfishing to notify anyone with whom the fake account holder has interacted with through the app.
Rep. Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, is exploring how a bill could be crafted and a discussion of the issue is scheduled for the Legislature’s law enforcement interim committee next week.
“I do have concerns about people misrepresenting themselves on the internet and preying on vulnerable individuals. Right now I want to see what we can and can’t do and have the conversations,” she said. “I don’t know exactly where this will be able to go.”
A notification law similar to the one that Match wants recently took effect in Vermont.
A Match spokesperson said the company uses technology and staff to monitor for suspicious activity and identify stolen credit cards and advises customers never to send money to people they meet, but they want to be able to do more.
“Match supports the efforts of Utah legislators to enact strong new protections against online fraud and catfishing that impacts Utah users,” the company spokesperson said. “Utah is leading in this area and we are pleased to be part of this effort.”
Examples of catfishing from across the country show the practice goes way beyond simply using a photo 20 pounds lighter or 10 years younger than they actually are.
Last month, The New York Times told the story of Renee Holland, a 56-year-old Delaware woman who struck up an online romance with a supposed soldier, to whom she had sent care packages, thousands of dollars in gift cards, and $5,000 for plane tickets for his return trip home.
Holland, who was married, was left waiting, draped in a flag at the Philadelphia airport, and on the way home bought sleeping pills and vodka and tried to take her own life.
And you might remember the case of Manti Te’o, a Notre Dame football star whose online girlfriend supposedly died of cancer. It got national attention, people around the country donated to a charity in her name, and she never existed.
Some cases are even darker.
In Iowa last year, the Supreme Court upheld the sexual assault conviction of a man who had pretended to be someone else online and convinced a woman to wear a blindfold and have sex with him. The court ruled that consenting to sex with one individual under a false pretense does not equate to consent with another.
Of course sexual assault is already a crime. So is fraud, whether it’s coercing someone to send care packages or order cellphones, and prosecutors have the ability to charge those cases already.
What the proposed Utah law seeks to do is reduce the ability of serial scammers to violate customers’ trust again and again — because if someone is running a scam on one person, chances are they’re running it on many others, too. It would alert potential victims that they may have already been duped, empower some of those victimized by a catfisher to go to authorities, and reminds users to be careful with what they share online.
Couldn’t companies like Match do this on their own? Well, yeah, probably. Platforms do reserve the right to boot users who don’t abide by the terms of service — which of course we all know because we have read them.
Notifying users that someone was using a fake profile, however, is a little more problematic and, frankly, part of the reason the companies like the proposed legislation is it protects them legally if a banned user claims their reputation was damaged by the notifications.
And it makes sense to explore the issue. With online dating platforms becoming more ubiquitous — an estimated 40 million Americans are using them — they will only become even more fertile territory for fraud.
Requiring dating companies and potentially other social media apps to notify users of catfishing scams is a simple measure that would help ensure that people already putting themselves in a vulnerable position don’t go, as the old song went, looking for love in all the wrong places.

Texto completo: They met at a libertarian conference in Las Vegas in July 2015, where they discussed Milton Friedman, Anton Chekhov and John Locke.
He was the philosophizing founder and chief executive of Overstock.com, a publicly traded e-commerce retailer that sells discount furniture and bedding. She was an ambitious graduate student from Russia.
It was the start of a three-year relationship between the e-commerce executive, Patrick Byrne, and the young woman, Maria Butina, that became romantic at times. She is now serving 18 months in prison after being accused by federal prosecutors of trying to infiltrate powerful political circles in the United States at the direction of the Russian government. She ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.
Byrne’s relationship became widely known Monday, when his company took the unusual step of issuing a news release that called attention to it. In the release, which was put out in response to a report that Byrne had been involved in the federal inquiry into the 2016 presidential election, Byrne said he had been helping law enforcement agents, whom he referred to as “Men in Black,” with their “Clinton Investigation” and “Russia Investigation.”
In an interview late Wednesday, Byrne said he wanted to shed light on what he saw as problems in the way top law enforcement officials had handled the government’s case against Butina.
The release, titled “Overstock.com CEO Comments on Deep State,” sent the company’s shares plummeting more than 30% over the next two days, while opening an intriguing new chapter in the tale of Butina and her connections to influential Americans. Her lawyer, Robert Driscoll, confirmed that Butina and Byrne had been “romantically involved” and that, according to Byrne, government officials had instructed him on how to interact with her.
In the interview, Byrne said he was still “quite fond” of Butina. “Maria should go home and be president of Russia one day,’’ he said. “That is the best thing that could happen to Russia and the U.S.”
Butina, 30, was sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent. She achieved notoriety by networking with groups like the National Rifle Association, and by posing for pictures with Republicans like Donald Trump Jr. and Scott Walker, the former Wisconsin governor.
For a time, she dated a Republican political operative who had worked on several campaigns. Her lawyer said she was dating the Republican operative while periodically seeing Byrne.
Byrne, whose father had been the chief executive of the insurance company GEICO, has a reputation for speaking his mind with financial analysts and in interviews. The news release Monday was particularly colorful and, at times, cryptic.
It did not mention Butina specifically, but instead cited two articles published recently on the website of Sara Carter, a journalist and Fox News contributor. One of the articles detailed his relationship with Butina. In the news release, Byrne said he “confirmed” Carter’s account.
The relationship, Byrne said in the interview, began in Las Vegas, where he was giving a talk at the FreedomFest convention, an annual gathering of libertarians.
Butina, according to Bryne, introduced herself and said she wanted to discuss her gun rights group, but he was not interested. She then told a different story: that she was working for a top official at Russia’s central bank and wanted Byrne to go to Moscow to speak about blockchain technology. Byrne arranged to meet her for lunch in his hotel suite the next day.
They hit it off, he said, discussing Russian history, literature and philosophy. “She said, ‘You are a very famous man in Russia,’” he recalled.
Still, Byrne described being somewhat suspicious of Butina’s intentions. Eventually, he said he began to communicate with the FBI about their interactions. Driscoll, Butina’s lawyer, said Byrne had contacted him after she was sentenced to prison in April and had told him he had spoken periodically to the FBI about Butina. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.
After the convention, Byrne and Butina kept in touch through text messages. She told him she wanted him to meet her in Paris, Rome or Montenegro. They finally decided to meet at the Bowery Hotel in New York in September 2015. Byrne, who calls himself as a “56-year-old bachelor,” said the rendezvous in New York quickly became romantic. They met several more times in different cities around the United States, and she visited him at his home in Utah.
“I think she admired him, but I don’t think she was looking to settle down,” Driscoll said.
During the visits, Byrne said Butina spoke increasingly about meeting or seeking to meet people involved in the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, which made Byrne wary. Her lawyer said she was merely an ambitious person hoping to advance her career by improving relations between the United States and Russia.
Bryne has recently been focused on developing a blockchain business called tZero that he describes as the place where “blockchain meets capital markets.” Overstock is based in Midvale, Utah, and until this week its stock had been soaring. On Thursday, the company’s share price rallied to rise more than 16%, erasing many of the recent losses.
In the news release Monday, Bryne said he had previously worked with law enforcement authorities in a case involving a friend who was murdered and also as part of a “shake up” of Wall Street a decade ago.
Byrne said he was motivated to come forward in recent weeks because he believed that top law enforcement officials had not handled the investigation into Butina properly. In the company’s news release, he said the investigation was “less about law enforcement and more about political espionage conducted against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.”
Citing Byrne’s concerns, Driscoll wrote a letter to the Justice Department’s inspector general and office of professional responsibility on July 25, saying the Overstock executive had told him that during his relationship with Butina, he had “acted at the direction of the government and federal agents by, at their instruction, kindling a romantic relationship with her.”
Driscoll urged Justice Department officials to examine Byrne’s concerns further.
“As an adjunct professor and CEO of a public company, Byrne is a credible source of information, who from my view has little to gain, but much to lose by disclosing a sporadic relationship with Maria,” he wrote. “His claims are worthy of investigation.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Hope Hicks, President Donald Trump’s former campaign aide and White House communications director, on Thursday stood by her testimony to a House panel despite a demand that she clarify statements about hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign.
In July, documents were unsealed in the criminal case of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer who pleaded guilty and is imprisoned in part because he made arrangements for hush-money payments to two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump. The documents appeared to contradict Hicks’ testimony June 19, according to House Democrats.
Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , demanded in a letter July 18 to Hicks that she clarify her answers by Thursday.
The evidence “raises substantial questions about the accuracy of each of those statements,” Nadler said in the letter. “Given the apparent inconsistencies between your testimony and this evidence, I would like to give you an opportunity to clarify your testimony on a voluntary basis, prior to our considering compulsory process. ”
But Hicks' lawyer, Robert Trout, denied any inconsistencies with her testimony.
"Ms. Hicks stands by her testimony," Trout told Nadler in the letter Thursday. "She had no knowledge of, and was not involved in any conversations about, 'hush money' payments to Stormy Daniels during the campaign. "
Hicks, who testified to the committee behind closed doors, declined to answer 155 questions about the administration. But she answered campaign-related questions.
Hicks testified that she “wasn’t aware of any hush payment agreement” with porn actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. Committee members asked Hicks repeatedly about conversations with Cohen and Trump about any payments made to Daniels, but Hicks insisted she was never present for a conversation about the payments.
But Nadler said those replies appeared inconsistent with documents unsealed from Cohen’s case.
On the evening of Oct. 8, 2016, Hicks participated in a four-minute with Cohen and Trump, then a two-minute call with Cohen before Cohen had a series of calls and texts with Trump and officials at the National Enquirer about how to facilitate payments to the actress, according to a federal agent’s affidavit. After confirming the payment Oct. 28, 2016, Cohen spoke directly with Hicks.
On Nov. 4, 2016, days before the election, as the Wall Street Journal prepared a story about Trump and McDougal, Cohen spoke frequently to Hicks and National Enquirer officials. That night, Cohen used two cellphones at the same time to talk with Hicks and the actress’s lawyer at the same time, according to the agent.
But Trout went point by point through Nadler's letter, disputing that Hicks had misled lawmakers or misrepresented what happened. Hicks maintained that she didn't know about payments before they were made and that references to them came after news reports. Trout's letter said Hicks could confirm that Cohen routinely had separate conversations on two phones at a time.
"In sum, the information in the search warrant affidavit is not inconsistent with Ms. Hicks' testimony, and does not establish any lack of candor on her part," Trout said in the letter.
Her reply comes at a time of unprecedented legal clashes between Congress and the White House.
The House held Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt over their refusal to provide information about a citizenship question for the census. The House filed federal lawsuits seeking access to blacked-out portions of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and to enforce a subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn, who is a key figure in the report.
Trump has called the various legal challenges and investigations presidential harassment and a partisan witch hunt.
Hicks’ name appears more than 180 times in the Mueller report’s text and footnotes. She described meetings and dealing with the aftermath of incidents, including:
•Trump helping draft a response to media questions about the meeting June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower, when Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner met with Russians offering damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. On June 28, 2017, at Kushner's lawyer's office, Hicks reviewed emails setting up the meeting. She said they looked “really bad” and that media coverage would be “massive” when the story broke, the report said. During a foreign trip, Trump helped draft a statement July 8, 2017, for his son to provide The New York Times that said the meeting was "primarily" about adoptions and didn’t mention disparaging information about Clinton.
•Sessions recusing himself from the Russia inquiry because he worked on Trump’s campaign. Trump scolded Sessions in Hicks’ presence. Trump, who was "extremely upset" about Mueller's appointment in May 2017, told Sessions he should resign. “Hicks said she had only seen the president like that one other time, after the 'Access Hollywood' tape came out during the campaign,” the report said, referring to a televised recording of Trump saying he grabbed women’s genitals. Trump pocketed Sessions' resignation letter for a year and a half but fired him the day after the midterm election in November 2018.
•Trump telling Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on May 10, 2017, in the Oval Office that he fired Comey. “He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump told the Russians, according to the report. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off. … I’m not under investigation. ” When Hicks told Trump about news stories about the meeting, Trump didn’t look concerned and said Comey “is crazy,” the report said.

Texto completo: Israel’s Interior Ministry announced on Thursday that Democratic Congresswomen Ilhan Omar (Minn. ) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich. ) would be barred from entering Israel ahead of their planned visit.
The ban has sparked a mountain of criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. President Donald Trump tweeted ahead of the official decision, seemingly encouraging the prime minister’s decision.
“They hate Israel & all Jewish people,” Trump tweeted.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, from California, and New York Sen. Chuck Schumer both wrote statements asking Israel to reverse its decision.
“Israel’s denial of entry to Congresswomen Tlaib and Omar is a sign of weakness, and beneath the dignity of the great State of Israel,” Pelosi wrote. “The President’s statements about the Congresswomen are a sign of ignorance and disrespect, and beneath the dignity of the Office of the President. ”
“No democratic society should fear an open debate. Many strong supporters of Israel will be deeply disappointed in this decision, which the Israeli government should reverse,” Schumer tweeted.
Several Democratic presidential candidates echoed their sentiments.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , tweeted Thursday, “Opposing Netanyahu's policies is not ‘hating the Jewish people’” in response to Trump, whom he called a bigot.
Author and candidate Marianne Williamson said she looks forward to visiting Israel with the congresswomen as president and accused Trump of pressuring Israel.
U. S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman put out a statement of support for Israel’s decision.
“The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel is not free speech. Rather, it is no less than economic warfare designed to delegitimize and ultimately destroy the Jewish State,” he wrote referring to Omar and Tlaib’s stated support for the BDS movement.
More: Israel blocks Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering country
Omar and Tlaib have come under fire from Israel’s allies in the past for their open criticisms of the state and its occupation of Palestine. The Muslim congresswomen were set to visit the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Tlaib also planned to visit relatives.
Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi said the visit was “to engage with the Palestinian people directly and to see things on the ground,” The New York Times reported.
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, in an unusual break from the Israeli government, voiced its disagreement with the ban, but reiterated its opposition to the sentiments expressed by Omar and Tlaib.
“It is an affront that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, under pressure from President Trump, would deny entry to representatives of the U. S. government,” Omar said in a statement. “Trump’s Muslim ban is what Israel is implementing, this time against two duly elected Members of Congress. ”
“As a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, it is my job to conduct oversight on foreign aid from the United States of America and to legislate on human rights practices around the world,” she continued.

I've treated suicidal prisoners — Jeffrey Epstein's death is a medical, security disgrace

Resumen: No matter what happened in Jeffrey Epstein's cell, medial personnel and prison authorities clearly failed in their duty to monitor and treat him.

Texto completo: As a physician who has worked with prisoners as well as suicidal patients, I was shocked by the strange circumstances surrounding sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein’s death by apparent hanging in his cell. We may never know for sure all the details of what happened, though I expect further review of the autopsy results to determine once and for all whether this death was self-inflicted.
Earlier in my career, I worked on both a psychiatric ward and a prison ward. In both places, the regular surveillance was sufficient (at least every 15 minutes on the psych ward) so that suicide was almost impossible. For someone who, like Epstein, had apparently made a suicide attempt less than three weeks before, it is almost inconceivable to me that he could possibly be without diligent, frequent observation and without surveillance cameras constantly monitoring him.
How could he be placed in a cell, according to the New York Post's unnamed source, with a bunk bed to hang himself on and a strong enough bed sheet to do it with? If one cellmate was transferred, as sources told The New York Times, why wasn’t he immediately replaced with another?
'Serious irregularities' raise eyebrows
It's true that suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and, in 2014, hit a 15-year high in federal and state prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But although accused sexual offenders are particularly at risk for both suicides and homicides, the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein was imprisoned has had only one reported suicide over the past 40 years, the gangster Louis Turra, 21 years ago.
Money talks: Harvard drops #MeToo image when donations are at risk
Despite its reputation for squalor and overcrowding, the corrections center is not known for suicide.
What is most disturbing to me, as a physician, is the way Epstein went from being on suicide watch starting July 23 to going for long periods without being observed just six days later, sources told The Times. Having treated depression for many years, I know suicidal ideation doesn’t turn on and off like a switch. A person does not want to end it all one day — staring down news as bleak as Epstein faced — and then six days later you are suddenly stable and out of danger. Whoever took Epstein off this watch made a very poor judgement at the very least. And the latest reports by sources of The Times that guards fell asleep for possibly hours while on watch and then falsified records is simply inexcusable.
I am not a conspiracy theorist, though it is conceivable to me that the “serious irregularities” Attorney General William Barr is concerned about could possibly turn out to reveal that Epstein’s was not a simple suicide, that there were other actors in this tragedy. Time, along with the final autopsy report, will tell. It is clear that there were many victims in Epstein's life who loathed him for legitimate reasons, and many others who stood to lose more by his survival than by his death.
Doctors try to save everyone
But no matter what happened inside Epstein’s cell, both the medical personnel and the prison authorities who were involved had the obligation to bring him to a safer place, whether that meant more enhanced psychiatric observation inside the prison, or transferring him with enhanced security to an inpatient psychiatric facility. There was plenty of warning that this could happen.
Children deserve more than we give them: I lost a student to sex trafficking and murder. We woefully fail to protect our children.
After all, we don’t judge our patients, no matter how repulsive their actions or the allegations against them are. Doctors and nurses are simply assigned to try to keep them alive. I have taken care of a perpetrator of assault chained to a stretcher in the emergency room right next to his victim suffering from a gunshot wound, and I have had to do my best to save both without hesitation.
The prison officials who took Jeffrey Epstein off his suicide watch prematurely, relegating him to almost certain death, did not do the prison system and how it handles mental health emergencies any favors.

Texto completo: For the Monitor
In studying the history of Italian and German fascism in the 1930s, it is fair to say that the world was not adequately warned about the danger. To a shocking extent, the American press of that era whitewashed and minimized the fascist threat. This was true with both Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.
Mussolini became Italian prime minister in 1922. After his infamous march on Rome leading 30,000 Italian fascist blackshirts, he forced the resignation of the liberal government. He quickly consolidated power and in 1925 declared himself supreme leader for life. Nevertheless, in the United States Mussolini got remarkably favorable press coverage for years after that.
The New York Times credited Mussolini with returning Italy to “normalcy.” In the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution, many American papers worried more about the advance of the left than they did about the fascists. In 1928, the Saturday Evening Post serialized Mussolini's autobiography. The largely favorable press coverage happened while Mussolini's secret police jailed and eliminated his opposition and at the same time created a one-party dictatorship.
Similarly, the American press largely treated Hitler with kid gloves. The press saw him as volatile and a bit of a buffoon, but his dark side was obscured until it was too late. His incremental steps toward totalitarianism were buried in the news. Hitler shut down the newspapers of his political opponents on the left, arrested editors and sent them to concentration camps.
The American press poorly covered anti-Semitism and the increasing danger to Jews. This was true even though Hitler had been very on record with his hatred.
While as a general rule the American press failed to alert the public to the danger represented by the European fascists, there were notable exceptions. For many years, the journalist Dorothy Thompson ran a one-woman campaign against Hitler and the Nazis. Her heroic story deserves to be much more widely known.
Meeting the ‘Little Man'
Thompson was bureau chief for the Philadelphia Public Ledger and she wrote for the New York Evening Post. She had moved to Europe in the 1920s and become fluent in German. In 1931, she managed to wrangle an interview with Hitler.
The interview became the basis for her 1932 book I Saw Hitler! The interview first ran in the March 1932 issue of Cosmopolitan, then a serious magazine. Initially, Thompson wrote: “He is formless, almost faceless, a man whose countenance is a caricature, a man whose framework seems cartilaginous, without bones. He is inconsequent and voluble, ill-poised, insecure. He is the very prototype of the Little Man.”
Thompson dismissed Hitler although he admitted to her that he intended to create a dictatorship. After their interview, Hitler crushed his opposition, disappeared many and further advanced his persecution of the Jews. Thompson had to reassess. She realized she had seriously underestimated Hitler and the Nazi movement.
By March 1933, Thompson started writing a string of anti-Hitler articles. Her writing did not escape notice of the Nazis. In the summer of 1934, she was the first foreign correspondent expelled from Nazi Germany. The Nazis put journalists on notice that they would tolerate no criticism of Hitler.
When she returned to the United States, the New York Herald Tribune hired her. Her column “On The Record” was syndicated and it ran in 170 papers around the country. She also wrote a monthly column for Ladies Home Journal, and she appeared often on NBC radio. Her expulsion from Germany made her famous and led to her becoming a big media celebrity.
Thompson became a leading voice against fascism, regularly denouncing Hitler and the Nazis. She also demanded that America accept more European refugees. She herself personally helped many refugees get to America and obtain asylum. She was one of the few journalists who spoke out consistently on behalf of the European Jews.
She advocated for Herschel Grynszpan, a 17-year-old Jewish boy who walked into the German embassy in Paris and assassinated Ernst vom Rath, a secretary to the Nazi ambassador. It was this event that precipitated Kristallnacht.
‘He will be one of the boys'
Thompson was the inspiration for Katharine Hepburn's role of Tess Keating in the 1942 movie Woman of the Year. She also inspired her husband of that time, Sinclair Lewis, to write the novel It Can't Happen Here.
Concerned about the possibility of fascism in America, Thompson wrote: “No people ever recognizes their dictator in advance. He never stands for election on the platform of dictatorship. He always represents himself as the instrument (of) the Incorporated National Will. . . . When our dictator turns up you can depend on it that he will be one of the boys, and he will stand for everything traditionally American.”
Thompson went to the large February 1939 rally organized by the German-American Bund and Nazi sympathizers held at Madison Square Garden. She took her seat in the first row of the press gallery, and she loudly ridiculed and made fun of the pro-Nazi speakers. She did get herself surrounded by security goons and ejected from the Garden.
From early on, Thompson argued against appeasement of the Nazis and she recognized that neutrality was not an option. Of her, Winston Churchill wrote: “She has shown what one valiant woman can do with the power of the pen. Freedom and humanity are her grateful debtors.”
As we face the rise of authoritarian and fascist governments and movements, Thompson's example is instructive. She showed how to fight back. Reporting on and exposing the current fascist threat is now more important than ever.

Texto completo: This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.
GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba -- On a Monday morning four and a half years ago, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, one of the men accused of conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks, made a stunning announcement for all in the military courtroom to hear: He knew the new Arabic translator sitting beside him from the secret C.I.A. prison network where the United States tortured its detainees.
What followed said a lot about the enduring secrecy around the torture program and the black-site prisons, the disputes over what evidence is admissible in the war court established to try terrorism suspects and the grindingly slow effort to get justice in the 2001 attacks.
By blurting out the man's name in open court, Mr. bin al-Shibh had undercut the government's efforts to keep under wraps the identities of most people who worked at the black sites. The interpreter's name, initially included in the court transcript for that day, was later redacted. Defense lawyers were instructed -- in secret -- that what happened was a security breach and that they were forbidden, by a national security directive, to publicly acknowledge what had happened in open court.
Never mind that the interpreter's name was called out publicly at the Guantánamo air terminal at the end of that week as lawyers and journalists checked in for their flight back to the United States.
The revelation derailed a week of pretrial hearings and was the start of one of the strangest and most complex chapters in the Sept. 11 case's pretrial hearings.
The interpreter has not been seen publicly at Guantánamo since then. And more than four years later, defense lawyers and prosecutors say they did not know about the man's past when he was assigned to be an interpreter for the defendants at the trial.
But the moment raised still unanswered questions of how someone who had worked for the C.I.A. found his way to a defense team that had already protested government efforts to gather intelligence about its activities, from the F.B.I. turning a defense-team member into a confidential informant to the discovery of listening devices hidden in supposedly confidential attorney-client meeting rooms.
There was some initial skepticism about the claim by Mr. bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni captive who is accused of organizing the Hamburg, Germany, cell of 9/11 hijackers. The C.I.A. had deprived him of sleep and subjected him to other memory-damaging abuse during the four years the United States held him incommunicado starting in 2002. Once at Guantánamo, the military drugged him.
It seemed possible that he imagined he knew the man through a haze of tortured memories, even though some of his fellow defendants told the judge they recognized the interpreter too after Mr. bin al-Shibh said to the court: "The problem is I cannot trust him because he was working at the black site with the C.I.A. and we knew him from there."
But Mr. bin al-Shibh was right. During that week in February 2015, people with knowledge of the case confirmed that the linguist had worked for the C.I.A. -- and that he lied about it in interviews with defense lawyers when he was assigned to the Guantánamo trial.
The episode has elements of the absurd. But it offers a graphic illustration of why the effort to try, convict and execute the five men accused of conspiring in the hijackings that killed 2,976 people has been mired in pretrial hearings since 2012.
In the years since Mr. bin al-Shibh recognized the interpreter, defense lawyers have sought to question him to help them develop their arguments to avert a death-penalty trial for their clients.
They say information from the interpreter could bolster a defense theory that the Bush administration thwarted justice by torturing the suspects in the black sites rather than taking them straight to the United States for trial. And they want to know if the interpreter can fill in gaps left by the destruction of evidence by the C.I.A., to argue the defendants have been deprived of due process.
The interpreter's testimony has taken on greater importance, the lawyers say, because he may be a rare eyewitness to how the defendants were held and interrogated in the black sites.
The prosecutors have been so determined to stop the testimony -- or at least restrict it to a secret session -- that they put the judge on notice last month: If he opted for open-court testimony, even if delivered in a way that masked the interpreter's identity and distorted his voice, the government would invoke a national security privilege and refuse to let him testify at all.
The law that created the military commissions grants that authority to the team of prosecutors, which is led by Brig. Gen. Mark S. Martins of the Army. But a judge can then freeze the proceedings until the government allows him to testify.
In court several weeks ago, one of the prosecutors, Clayton Trivett, acknowledged that the interpreter's identity had been made public. But he said the man and his family would be in danger even if he were to testify anonymously behind a blank screen through a voice scrambler in the courtroom, where no recording is allowed. The interpreter's name has now been officially classified.
The New York Times has chosen not to identify the interpreter by name in this article. Efforts to reach him failed.
Like nearly every other linguist at Guantánamo, English is his second language and he has an accent. But, the prosecutor argued, a foreign intelligence agent who somehow managed to hear the testimony might be able to track him down.
Anne FitzGerald, an investigator with Amnesty International in London, who saw the interpreter episode occur in the courtroom at Guantánamo in 2015, called the tug-of-war over his testimony "some sort of metaphor for the whole process," which has dragged on for years with few signs of coming to a close anytime soon.
"It was so bizarre in the first place that he appeared there," Ms FitzGerald said. "Either it was an enormous oversight on somebody's part, or not. So it's equally bizarre that they've taken four years to figure out what to do about it."
In one reminder of the slow pace of the case since 2015, Ms. FitzGerald's Amnesty International portfolio has changed from researching counterterrorism to gun violence.
The judge at the time the interpreter appeared in court has retired -- and been replaced twice.
Now the new trial judge, Col. W. Shane Cohen of the Air Force, is deciding whether the defense lawyers can question the interpreter about his work with the C.I.A., or just how he found his way to a pool of contract linguists defense lawyers can use at Guantánamo.
To avoid prosecution concerns that someone will recognize the interpreter -- again -- the judge has canceled scheduled secret testimony in favor of a sworn deposition. Under that formula, neither the accused nor the public will be able to watch when the interpreter answers questions under oath, at a top secret facility in the United States.
The secret testimony almost happened at Guantánamo in January, by order of Colonel Cohen's predecessor.
But that judge, Col. Keith A. Parrella of the Marines, was suddenly diagnosed with a detaching retina and cut short a weeklong hearing before the interpreter testified.
That delay gave defense lawyers, the American Civil Liberties Union and news organizations, The New York Times included, time to challenge the closure of the proceeding in a higher court. The United States Court of Military Commission Review found that Colonel Parrella had not justified closing the unclassified portions of the linguist's testimony, and sent the issue back to the trial court to consider again.
Colonel Cohen heard arguments on the issue last month in what became a test run for how to handle the actual evidence. When a defense lawyer, Alka Pradhan, argued for open-court testimony by the interpreter, a court security officer on two occasions triggered a white noise button, preventing journalists and other members of the public from hearing what she had said.
At the Guantánamo court, the audio emerges from the court to a spectators' gallery on a 40-second delay, time enough for a security officer to block spectators from hearing classified information -- something that did not happen the day Mr. bin al-Shibh named his interpreter in open court.
But last month, the public heard Ms. Pradhan's words turn into white noise midsentence. After the first instance, once the sound came back on, Mr. Trivett, a prosecutor who specializes in national security questions, apologized for mistakenly having her silenced.
"I believed that was national security information," he said, according to a transcript of the unclassified session. "I was incorrect."
The same transcript blacked out two of Mr. Trivett's open-court remarks, for the first time, on why the interpreter should not testify in open court.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: If only Steve King would keep his mouth shut.

The Iowa Republican, whose dishonesty and rhetorical stupidity resulted in a congressional reprimand earlier this year, managed to sully the pro-life movement with his latest attempt to defend it.
Speaking to the Westside Conservative Club on Wednesday, King said he supported Alabama’s abortion ban, which does not include exceptions for rape and incest, because humanity might not exist had it not been for … rape and incest.

"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?" King said, according to the Des Moines Register. "Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."

It's a good, common pro-life argument to say that an unborn child shouldn’t be punished for the “sin of the father, or of the mother.” But King seems to be going one step further, claiming that humanity's survival depends upon the evils of rape and incest. Again, here are his words: “Would there be any population of the world left if we [made exceptions for rape and incest]?”
Humanity will never be able to rid itself of its sins. We are bound to live alongside them. But to elevate them as serving some sort of existential purpose is ridiculous.

I certainly hope King doesn’t believe gruesome violence is necessary for the continuation of humanity and that his words were a rhetorical blunder. If that’s the case, he should step up, admit he misspoke, and apologize to the pro-lifers who are now being pressed to answer for his foolishness.

But I wouldn’t hold my breath. King has a long track record of lying or blaming others when confronted. Take, for instance, the time King was pulled from his congressional committee assignments for saying, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King claimed the entire quote was a fabrication and part of a hit job to get him kicked out of office.

"People think it was an organic media feeding frenzy, but no, it was orchestrated from the beginning," he said, according to the Des Moines Register. "They had told me, heads up before Christmas, they're going to try to drive you out of office and get you to resign. Within 24 hours, you had people saying 'resign, resign, resign.' Why? Because the New York Times misquoted me?"

What about the time King claimed the Weekly Standard lied when it reported he had referred to immigrants as “dirt?” The Weekly Standard’s audio recording confirmed its reporter’s story and King’s dishonesty.

King doesn’t seem to understand that words matter or that the pro-life movement will suffer from his carelessness. It may take his losing his primary next year to his challenger, Republican state Sen. Randy Feenstra, an outcome that seems increasingly likely by the day.

Texto completo: You want to do your part. So, you take the time to sort the recyclables for trash pickup. Well, come September, if you live in Jackson you'll have to find private alternatives if you want to continue recycling. The city of Jackson is ending is curbside recycling program.
Public Works Director Bob Miller, citing global market forces and limited financial resources, said Jackson will end its curbside recycling program Sept. 1. Residents should receive at least one more collection before or by Aug. 31.
The city has been spending about $1.15 million a year, about $96,000 a month, for curbside pickup. Less than a third of the Jackson community is engaged with the program, Miller said.
The decision follows similar moves by cities across the country as market demand for recycled materials has diminished drastically in recent months.
China is no longer accepting used plastic and paper resulting in a rise in collection bills in U.S. cities which has forced many municipalities to end their programs, according to the New York Times.
The country had been a big buyer of recyclable material in the U.S. until January when it determined too much trash was mixed in with recyclable materials like cardboard and certain plastics, the article said.
Jackson is one of 300 cities that have recently suspended their curbside recycling program as the market demand for recycling materials has dropped.
Funds will be diverted to cleanup of illegal dumpsites However, Miller said money saved from the program is going to benefit the community in another important way. The city intends to use funds to clean up the more than 100 illegal dumpsites across Jackson.
He said the city will consider reimplementing a recycling program when the marketplace "reorganizes itself."
"I understand people feel very strongly about this and believe it's a move in the wrong direction. It's a move that recognizes the realities of the marketplace and the limited availability of funds. We want to redeploy where we can have just as important of a positive impact," he said.
City leaders have discussed ending the program as the city and its waste services contractor, Waste Management, have been embroiled in an extended contract dispute.
Waste Management has argued the city cannot back out of the recycling clause of its contract while the city of Jackson has disagreed and held off on paying the amount for months.
Are there recycling alternatives? Yes Miller said the Department of Public Works is working to find recycling collection alternatives for residents.
Miller and Council President Virgi Lindsay will discuss the suspension of the recycling program in more detail at a town hall at Belhaven University Thursday. The meeting will be from 6 to 7 p.m.
"We are going to make suggestions about alternatives, until we reach a point where there is a good market for recycling products. It's going to be very financially difficult for us for now, so I encourage people to find others ways to recycle on their own until we can restart recycling citywide again," Lindsay said.
For residents who want to continue curbside recycling, they may contact any certified recycling hauler directly, including Environmentality Recycling Solutions and Allen Recycling, the city said in a press release.
The city advises residents to contact the City of Jackson Solid Waste Division at 601-960-1193 for more information on the program and alternatives.

Democrats Try to Pressure Republicans to Act on Gun Safety Legislation

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- House Democrats, seeking to pressure the Senate Republican leadership to take up gun safety legislation, broke away from their August recess on Tuesday to appear in the Capitol with victims of gun violence, who pleaded with Congress to act swiftly to prevent further bloodshed.
Six top Democrats called on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, to bring senators back to Washington to pass two House bills: one mandating background checks on all gun purchases, including at gun shows and on the internet, and another extending the time the F.B.I. has to complete background checks.
"The time is not simply for reflection," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic leader. "The time is not for a moment of silence. The time for the Senate is to act. The time is to listen to the American people."
[Read more about mass shootings in 2019.]
Returning to Washington from their districts, the lawmakers shared stories from their constituents demanding action. Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, whose husband, John, was on the board of the National Rifle Association before his death in February, described attending a festival in her hometown in the days after mass shootings in Ohio and Texas. She said an Arab-American child approached her and asked, "Why do people hate us? Are we safe?"
"I shouldn't be answering questions of mothers of kindergartners or of children themselves about whether they are safe or hated," Ms. Dingell said, her voice rising. "We can't keep going to our corners and not figuring out what we are going to do."
On the other side of the Capitol, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has also been pressing Mr. McConnell to take up the House legislation and intends to formally request that the Trump administration cancel its request for $ 5 billion in border wall funding and reallocate the money for other uses, including initiatives to address gun violence and violent white supremacy, according to a senior aide to Mr. Schumer.
Gun safety has long been one of the most divisive issues in Washington, but this month's massacres in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, have thrust it onto the congressional agenda in a way not seen since 2012, after the massacre of 26 children and staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
Congress failed to take action in the wake of that tragedy; a bipartisan background check bill fell in the Senate in 2013. The House, now under Democratic control, passed a background check bill earlier this year, along with a bill extending the time the F.B.I. has to conduct background checks to 10 business days from three. But Mr. McConnell had refused to take up the measures because President Trump threatened to veto them.
But while Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Mr. McConnell favors expanding background checks, the leader has not committed to taking up the bill, and he has said he has no intention of bringing the Senate back early to consider it.
Mr. Trump on Sunday telephoned Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat who has been one of the leading voices in Congress for gun control, an indication that the president is interested in pursuing legislation. Earlier in the week, Mr. Murphy had contacted the White House to indicate that he was willing to work with Mr. Trump on the issue, which prompted the call.
The conversation was positive, with Mr. Trump indicating that he was serious about persuading Republicans to act, according to officials familiar with their discussion. And the two agreed to set up a staff-level dialogue this week between their offices and those of Senators Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who are working feverishly to revive the background check legislation they wrote after the Sandy Hook massacre.
The N.R.A., which opposes gun registration in any form, has for years fought against background check bills, arguing that they "don't stop criminals from getting firearms" and that some proposals "would deprive individuals of due process of law." If such a bill passed and was signed by Mr. Trump into law, it would be the first significant federal gun safety law in a quarter-century.
Tuesday's news conference comes as Democrats, including those on the presidential campaign trail, are rushing to embrace gun safety legislation and make it a campaign issue. Gun safety was a major topic of conversation at the Iowa State Fair over the weekend, which turned into a kind of contest to determine which Democrats could advance the most aggressive gun control measures.
And while House Democratic leaders are pushing for the background check bill, many Democrats are seeking to revive the assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004 and had barred the purchase of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles and high-capacity magazines like the gunman used in Dayton.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called for an assault weapons ban in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Monday. On Tuesday, his campaign sent an email to supporters asking them to sign a petition asking Congress to reinstate the ban and said it already had 18,000 signatures.
The ban, though, is a nonstarter in the Senate, and even its chief sponsor, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday in an interview that the better strategy was to pressure Mr. McConnell to take action on the bills the House had already passed.
"We passed two pieces of legislation that will make a real difference, that are overwhelmingly supported by the American people," said Mr. Cicilline, who is also a member of Democratic leadership. "I think the sense is: Let's push hard to get the Senate to come into session or at least act on the two bills that we've already sent them. And then we can take up other ideas."
Polls show that roughly 90 percent of the public supports expanded background checks, but Democrats were for years skittish about pursuing gun safety legislation. With more and more mass shootings, that has begun to change.
"The biggest thing that has changed is a cultural shift with all of these shootings," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "When the mayor of Dayton said something like they were the 250th city to have a mass shooting this year, when you have all of the people that have been killed -- and not just in mass shootings, every day on the streets -- I think there is just a whole different momentum for doing something."
The political landscape is changing as well. Last year, two Democrats -- Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado and Lucy McBath of Georgia -- flipped Republican seats in swing districts after campaigning on a promise to fight gun violence. Mr. Crow is a military veteran. Ms. McBath's 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed seven years ago at a Florida gas station by a white man who complained that Jordan and his friends were playing music too loudly in their car.
"It's a false choice between the Second Amendment and responsible regulation and prevention," Mr. Crow said in an interview. "I come at this from my frame as a lifetime hunter and a gun owner. It's a false choice, it's one that we now reject. We can respect the cultural heritage of responsible gun ownership in America but also save thousands of lives."

Texto completo: The guards did not check on him for three hours, officials said. The disclosures came as the guards and the warden at the jail were removed.
The two staff members who were guarding the jail unit where Jeffrey Epstein apparently killed himself fell asleep and failed to check on him for about three hours, then falsified records to cover up their mistake, according to several law enforcement and prison officials with knowledge of the matter.
Those disclosures came on Tuesday as the two employees were placed on administrative leave and the warden of the jail, the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, was temporarily reassigned, pending the outcome of the investigation into Mr. Epstein's death, the Justice Department announced.
The two staff members in the special housing unit where Mr. Epstein was held -- 9 South -- falsely recorded in a log that they had checked on the financier, who was facing sex trafficking charges, every 30 minutes, as was required, the officials said. Such false entries in an official log could constitute a federal crime.
In fact, the two people guarding Mr. Epstein had been asleep for some or all of the three hours, three of the officials said.
The attorney general, William P. Barr, on Monday ordered the Justice Department's inspector general to look into how Mr. Epstein had managed to commit suicide while in custody and why he had been taken off a suicide watch 12 days earlier.
"We will get to the bottom of what happened," Mr. Barr said.
The warden, Lamine N'Diaye, will be transferred to a Bureau of Prisons office in Philadelphia while the F.B.I. and the Justice Department's inspector general conduct inquiries. The Justice Department said in a statement that it might take additional punitive actions.
Prison staff discovered Mr. Epstein, 66, dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday, officials said. He had apparently hanged himself with a bedsheet, likely fastening the sheet to a top bunk and pitching himself forward, law enforcement and prison officials said.
Mr. Epstein had been awaiting trial on charges he had sexually abused scores of teenage girls at his mansions in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.
He had apparently tried to commit suicide once before, on July 23, shortly after he was denied bail, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch, prison officials familiar with the incident have said.
Six days later, prison officials determined that he was no longer a threat to his own life and returned him to a cell in the 9 South housing unit with another inmate, officials said. That inmate was later transferred out of the cell, leaving Mr. Epstein alone on Friday night.
Though it is standard practice to house people who have recently been taken off suicide watch with another person, the prison did not replace Mr. Epstein's cellmate.
The Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, did not immediately identify the two correctional officers who were placed on administrative leave.
Two prison officials familiar with the incident said the two staff members had not looked in on Mr. Epstein for about three hours before he was found.
One of the staff members was a former correctional officer who had taken a different position at the detention center that did not involve guarding detainees. He had volunteered to work again as a correctional officer for the extra overtime pay, a law enforcement official and an employee at the jail said.
The second officer, a woman who was assigned to that wing, had been ordered to work overtime because the jail was short staffed.
James Petrucci, the warden at a federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., has been named acting warden of the Manhattan jail, officials said.
Some union leaders for prison workers expressed dismay with Mr. Barr's decision to allow the warden to continue working, even as the two staff members were placed on leave.
"It makes me angry that they reassigned the warden," said Jose Rojas, an official in the prison employees' union and a teacher at the Coleman prison complex in Sumterville, Fla. "They didn't put him on administrative leave like the others. The warden made the call to take Epstein off suicide watch and to remove his cellmate. That is egregious."
Since Saturday, Mr. Barr has been briefed multiple times a day on the inquiries into Mr. Epstein's death, a Justice Department official said.
In addition to the investigations by the Justice Department, the inspector general and the F.B.I., two other reviews of Mr. Epstein's death were underway, a Justice Department official said.
A team of psychologists from the Bureau of Prisons visited the Manhattan jail on Tuesday to review each step of the decision to take Mr. Epstein off suicide watch.
On Wednesday, an "after-action team" -- led by the bureau's Southeast regional director -- is scheduled to be at the prison to determine whether employees and officials followed protocols in the days and weeks before Mr. Epstein died, the official said.
Mr. Epstein's death has drawn sharp criticism from Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
On Monday, the chairman and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the acting director of the Bureau of Prisons, Hugh Hurwitz, demanding answers about how Mr. Epstein could have been unsupervised long enough to take his own life.
The letter said Mr. Epstein's apparent suicide had brought to light "severe miscarriages" or deficiencies in how inmates are managed at the jail and had "allowed the deceased to ultimately evade facing justice."
It was signed by Representatives Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, and Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican.
Mr. Nadler and Mr. Collins demanded that the Bureau of Prisons hand over by Aug. 21 any details about Mr. Epstein's mental health evaluations and his housing, as well as the bureau's protocols for handling inmates considered at risk of suicide.
They also requested to be told how Mr. Epstein was being monitored and what the surveillance cameras may have recorded in or near Mr. Epstein's cell.
At the same time, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged Mr. Barr on Tuesday to rip up an agreement federal prosecutors in Florida had reached with Mr. Epstein in 2008 that shielded not only him, but also any other co-conspirators who may have helped him lure teenage girls into prostitution.
"This crooked deal cannot stand," Mr. Sasse said in his letter.

Texto completo: How Beijing is weaponizing social media in its fight to crush the Hong Kong protests.
MELBOURNE, Australia -- As the police deploy tear gas against protesters on the streets of Hong Kong, another battle is raging less visibly: the one for narrative control. After weeks of asserting that the unrest had been orchestrated by foreign "black hands," Chinese officials on Monday accused protesters of showing the first signs of "terrorism." Such messaging is key to Beijing's public opinion operation, which has been turned up to full volume.
The weapons of this information war include a flood of social media posts from state-run media, some carrying misinformation. When a woman dispensing first aid was shot in the eye by the Hong Kong police, the state-run CCTV reported on its official social media account that she had been shot by protesters. It also accused her of handing out money to demonstrators. Chinese readers are unlikely to question the veracity of such an authoritative source, and CCTV's Weibo post, which says the movement is slandering the Hong Kong police by blaming them for the injury, has been liked more than 700,000 times.
Ten weeks ago, when Hong Kongers first took to the streets to protest disputed extradition legislation, Beijing censored all reports of this civil unrest. But in recent days, it has reveled in posting video of protesters purportedly using air guns, slingshots and petrol bombs against the police. The state-run Global Times has described protesters as "nothing more than street thugs who want Hong Kong to 'go to hell,"' or as people who had "voluntarily stripped themselves of their national identity." Such descriptions are aimed at delegitimizing the protesters' cause, especially among educated mainlanders who might otherwise be sympathetic.
Chinese people living or studying overseas are another important audience for Beijing's messaging. Their primary news diet is largely delivered via WeChat, a Chinese chat app where messages are subject to censorship, so they often still fall within Beijing's propaganda orbit. Recent pictures of an American diplomat meeting two activists, Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, were used to bolster Beijing's claims of hostile foreign forces backing the protests. On Tuesday, scenes of a Chinese state media worker being tied up at the airport and beaten by young protesters flooded Chinese social media, bolstering calls for Beijing to intervene militarily in Hong Kong.
Such messaging helps to mobilize Chinese communities, especially newly arrived migrants in Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, to support the official line from Beijing. One website for a planned protest this weekend in Sydney asks Chinese to stand together against "rioting" in Hong Kong, which it said was causing discrimination against Chinese in Australia.
The battle over Hong Kong is, in effect, being exported, pitting overseas Chinese communities against each other. Over the past few weeks, "Lennon Walls," covered in colorful Post-it notes expressing support for Hong Kong, have been torn down by supporters of Beijing from Auckland, New Zealand, to Vancouver, British Columbia, and from Hobart, Australia, to Harvard Square. After a violent tussle between pro-China and pro-Hong Kong students in late July at the University of Queensland in Australia, the Chinese consul-general in Brisbane, Xu Jie, issued a statement praising the "spontaneous patriotic behavior of Chinese students."
One reason this conflict is playing out on social media is that almost all of Hong Kong's big media companies are owned by mainland business executives or groups with extensive business interests in China, so they have instinctively taken a pro-Beijing stance. This has left digital news outlets and the overseas media as the front line in the battle for public opinion. People trying to livestream the protests and foreign media are apparently already being targeted by the police. In recent weeks, a BBC journalist was saved from injury only by his face mask, which shattered when the police shot directly at his head. Another reporter wearing a bright yellow press vest was crushed against a wall by three police officers. Two journalists were attacked by a gang of street thugs, and a well-known British livestreamer scratching his belly was publicly accused by a pro-Beijing politician of being a "foreign commander" sending hand signals to protesters. Such an accusation would be laughable had it not been so widely shared.
To counter what they say are lies and malicious distortions, the protesters have started to hold regular news conferences, with their representatives addressing the media wearing face masks and yellow helmets. The movement's social media strategy has been to use colorful memes and videos tailored for different audiences, including large-print messages with floral backgrounds for elderly readers.
In recent days, the state-run Chinese media has begun sharing videos showing large-scale exercises featuring the People's Armed Police, a paramilitary group, in the city of Shenzhen, over the border from Hong Kong. The same group, instead of the People's Liberation Army, was used to crack down on protests in Chengdu in 1989. Hong Kongers may dismiss these provocations as bluffing, but it is a clear sign that the information war, like the battle for Hong Kong itself, is set to escalate further.

Texto completo: A 35-year-old who worked in the Bronx was found dead, continuing a rash of suicides this year that has rattled the nation's largest police department.
Another New York police officer killed himself Tuesday morning, continuing a rash of suicides that has claimed eight lives this year, rattled the nation's largest police force and prompted commanders to issue urgent pleas for despondent officers to seek counseling.
More police officers commit suicide every year than are killed in the line of duty; since 2014, in New York City, an average of five officers have died each year by suicide.
But the apparent suicide of a 35-year-old off-duty officer in Yonkers put the city on track to have one of the worst years for police suicides in the last decade, and once again underscored the Police Department's ongoing struggles to persuade officers that they should seek treatment if they are experiencing problems with mental health.
The police in Yonkers said they responded at 3 a.m. to a report of a suicide in a home in Shoreview Drive and found a New York City officer dead from a self-inflicted wound.
The officer, Johnny Rios, worked in the 50th Precinct and had been temporarily assigned to a detail at Yankee Stadium. He had been with the department for seven years and had no blemishes on his record, the police said.
Gerard Rios, 60, an older brother, said that his younger brother had been melancholic in the last few months after losing his father, Evaristo Rios, 80, in April and after the recent suicide of a fellow officer, Kevin Preiss.
"When my father passed away, all of the police officers came to the funeral," Mr. Rios said. "My other brother knew he had been sad. But we were not expecting this."
"He was a wonderful person," his sister, Dolly Rios, said. "He was always funny, upbeat. Just a great guy."
New York's police commissioner, James P. O'Neill, declared a mental-health crisis in June and told officers that they could get confidential help from department chaplains, peer support groups and phone- and text-message hotlines.
Chief Terence A. Monahan, the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer, echoed Mr. O'Neill's plea during an interview on Tuesday.
"We want a person, when they are in a real dark period -- low point of their life -- to realize they can come, they can talk to someone," Chief Monahan said. "That it is O.K. to ask for help."
He said he wanted to increase the number of clinicians and peer volunteers available to counsel police officers in crisis and to make it easier for officers to connect with therapists who accept their health insurance.
"This isn't something that we can speak of in hushed tones anymore," Chief Monahan said. "We need to talk openly about it. Every precinct, every office in the department. This is like any other disease. You get treated. You get well. You get back to work."
The push to heighten awareness about mental health comes as the department grapples with its sixth suicide in two months.
Four officers killed themselves in June alone. On June 5, Deputy Chief Steven J. Silks, a highly respected veteran who was facing mandatory retirement, shot himself in his police vehicle. The next day, another veteran officer, Detective Joseph Calabrese, took his own life in a marsh in southern Brooklyn. Officer Michael Caddy fatally shot himself near his Staten Island precinct station house on June 14, and on June 26, Officer Preiss was found dead at his home in Long Island.
Researchers have found police officers are at a higher risk of suicide than people in other jobs, because of the high stress of the work, peer pressure to keep emotions in check and constant access to firearms.
When word came Tuesday of the officer's death in Yonkers, Chief Monahan said he felt a mix of pain and frustration. "What are we doing?" he said. "What are we missing? What more can we do to keep our members safe?"
He said he has lost not only colleagues, but friends, to suicide over the years, including Chief Silks.
"This is something that has touched me throughout my entire career," Chief Monahan said. "This has been a very bad year. It's been a very bad two months. These are more than numbers. These are fellow police officers."

De acuerdo con el NEw York Times, el régimen de Maduro ha usado el aparato represivo del Estado contra sus propias fuerzas de seguridad para mantener el control sobre estas. La reciente muerte del capitán Rafael Acosta Arévalo es uno de los ejemplos.
“El abuso contra los oficiales ha crecido porque representan una amenaza real para el Gobierno de Maduro”, indicó el general Manuel Cristopher Figuera , exdirector de Inteligencia de Venezuela, quien desertó en abril y vive en EEUU, en un artículo publicado este martes por el New York Times.
Indica además el rotativo que de acuerdo con denuncias de varias organizaciones, como la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos y la Democracia , que señala que hay 117 oficiales, entre activos y retirados, detenidos en cárceles venezolanas.
El artículo subraya el caso de Acosta Arévalo, que murió a finales de junio bajo custodia del Estado venezolano por su supuesta implicación en una conspiración para dar un golpe de Estado , lo que fue condenado por EEUU.
Trump congela dinero y bienes del gobierno de Venezuela en EEUU, incluyendo PDVSA
El Gobierno de EEUU culpó al presidente Maduro y sus “asesores cubanos” por la muerte, a la vez que reiteró el apoyo al pueblo venezolano, según un mensaje publicado el pasado 1 de julio por la secretaria adjunta de Estado de EEUU para Latinoamérica , Kimberly Breier, en su cuenta de Twitter.
El Times recuerda que el militar fue sepultado el 10 de julio, en contra de los deseos de su esposa y rodeado de guardias de seguridad en una operación controlada por el Gobierno.
También de que los cinco familiares a los que se les permitió asistir no pudieron verlo porque su cuerpo estaba envuelto en un plástico marrón.
De acuerdo con el rotativo neoyorquino, algunas secciones del informe de su autopsia, que fueron filtradas, señalan que Acosta sufrió un traumatismo por fuerza contundente y electrocución , y que las autoridades han admitido el uso de fuerza excesiva en su caso.
El Gobierno venezolano detuvo a dos militares en relación con su muerte y señaló que los oficiales usaron fueron excesiva cuando el capitán se resistió al arresto, recuerda el Times.
Igualmente cita en el artículo los casos de otros militares que fueron torturados como el de Juan Carlos Caguaripano, un capitán de la Guardia Nacional que en 2017 dirigió un asalto fallido en una base militar, quien sufrió lesiones en los testículos debido a los golpes que recibió en la cárcel.
El preso más conocido de Venezuela y un plan de fuga planeado al milímetro
El artículo asegura que en los últimos dos años, a medida que se agrava la escasez de alimentos por el derrumbe de la economía petrolera, las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado han llevado a cabo por lo menos cinco operaciones para derrocar o asesinar a Maduro.
El Gobierno asegura que ha frustrado al menos una docena más de complots, incluido el plan con el que se vinculó a Acosta y otros cinco detenidos, lo que el Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) , la organización política de Maduro, utiliza para justificar la vigilancia constante, detenciones arbitrarias y las torturas a los que considera sus enemigos.
Entre los vigilados, los 160.000 soldados que conforman las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela, señala además al Times al citar denuncias de Naciones Unidas.
Destaca también que la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos, con sede en Caracas y que representa a varios de los militares arrestados, ha documentado 250 casos de tortura cometidos por las fuerzas de seguridad venezolanas contra oficiales militares, sus familiares y activistas de la oposición desde el 2017.
Estos abusos fueron dados a conocer el pasado mes en un informe publicado por Michelle Bachelet, alta comisionada para los Derechos Humanos de la ONU.
Asimismo, el artículo apunta que aunque Maduro ha tratado de garantizar la lealtad de los altos mandos militares con promociones y contratos lucrativos, los oficiales de rango medio y bajo y sus familias se ven cada vez más afectados por la crisis.
“El hambre llegó a los cuarteles y se infectaron con disidencia”, dijo al diario Ana Leonor Acosta , abogada de la Coalición, quien asegura también que las Fuerzas Armadas están llenas de paranoia, desconfianza y división.

Texto completo: A mysterious explosion at an offshore Russian military site involving a nuclear power source for a missile is fueling international speculation as few details are available about what caused the blast and what its effects are.
Officials with Russia's nuclear energy company Rosatom said five of its scientists were killed in an explosion Thursday during a test of "a nuclear isotope power source" for a rocket.
The accident occurred on a platform in the White Sea off Nyonoksa and caused a reported radiation spike in nearby Severodvinsk.
On Tuesday, Russian newswire Interfax and the Washington Post and CNN, citing other local Russian news outlets, reported that residents in Nyonoksa were being temporarily evacuated, but Russian officials cancelled the order hours later.
At least 5 killed: Deadly explosion at Russian test site involved nuclear power source
Here's what we know now about the explosion:
Nyonoksa evacuation order adds more confusion
An evacuation early Wednesday was ordered for the small town of Nyonoksa on the White Sea because of activities at the test site where the explosion occurred, Interfax news agency reported.
However, hours later, Russian officials backtracked on the order. Ksenia Yudina, a spokeswoman for the Severodvinsk regional administration, said planned military activities at the site were canceled and the town's 500 residents did not have to leave.
Nyonoksa is about 30 miles from Severodvinsk, a city of 183,000, where the radiation spike was reported. Residents in Severodvinsk also received evacuation orders that were later canceled Tuesday.
At least five people were killed and others were injured in the blast, but an official death toll has not been confirmed as Russian officials have issued conflicting statements.
TASS: Radiation increased up to 16 times above normal levels
Severodvinsk experienced a radiation increase four to 16 times above normal background levels, Russian weather service Rosgidromet said, according to news agency TASS.
TASS reported that the city's civil defense department head Valentin Magomedov said immediately after the blast that Severodvinsk saw radiation levels at 2 microsieverts per hour, which is about three times above normal levels.
Safe exposure is 0. 6 microsieverts per hour, and a normal X-ray of someone's digestive tract would be 3. 3 millisieverts per examination, TASS reported.
Local officials in Severodvinsk said radiation levels normalized shortly after the blast occurred, and Russian officials were assuring residents that the region was safe.
Trump weighs in on Russia's 'failed' missile test
President Donald Trump tweeted Monday evening that the "United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. "
"We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!" Trump added.
Nuclear experts believe the accident occurred during a test of a missile that Russian President Vladamir Putin has touted in the past year, the New York Times and Reuters reported.
The SSC-X-9 Skyfall is a prototype cruise missile that could reach any corner of the world with a nuclear reactor as its power source, the Times reported.
Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday that "security is fully ensured" in the region but didn't comment on the missile that exploded, the Post reported.
Vyacheslav Solovyov, scientific director at the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, told a local newspaper that the institute was studying "small-scale" power sources that include "fissile materials," the Times and Reuters reported.

Crisis May Affect Afghan Talks, Envoy Says

Texto completo: Pakistan's ambassador to the United States raised the possibility Monday that his country might redeploy troops from the Afghanistan border to the Kashmir frontier, a shift that could complicate American peace talks with the Taliban.
Such a possibility, coming just as Pakistan's longstanding Kashmir crisis with India has escalated, could add a new element to the peace negotiations, which are said to be in the final stages and would end nearly two decades of American military entanglement in Afghanistan.
Pakistan's ambassador, Asad Majeed Khan, emphasized in an interview with The New York Times editorial board that the Kashmir and Afghanistan issues were separate and that he was not attempting to link them. On the contrary, he said, Pakistan hoped the American talks with the Taliban would succeed and that his country was actively supporting them.
"We are doing all that we can and will continue," Mr. Khan said. "It's not an either-or situation."
Nonetheless, Mr. Khan said, India's crackdown on the disputed region of Kashmir, on Pakistan's eastern border with India, "could not have come at a worse time for us," because the Pakistanis have sought to strengthen military control along the western border with Afghanistan, an area long infiltrated by Taliban militants, as part of the effort to help end the Afghanistan conflict by denying the group a safe haven.
"We have our hands full" on the western border, Mr. Khan said, adding, "If the situation escalates on the eastern border, we will have to undertake redeployments."
Right now in Islamabad, he said, "we are not thinking about anything but what is happening on our eastern border."
The ambassador spoke a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India abruptly canceled the limited autonomy that Indian-controlled Kashmir has held since the 1940s.
Mr. Modi's decision was greeted enthusiastically in India and instantly raised tensions with Pakistan, which claims part of Kashmir. India, which is majority Hindu, and Pakistan, majority Muslim, have fought two wars over Kashmir, which also has a Muslim majority.
"Pakistan as a punching bag sells in India," Mr. Khan said.
There has been little communication between the two countries over the past week, the ambassador said, and the crisis "unfortunately, I suspect, is going to get worse."
He declined to specify what such a worsening would look like.
"We are two big countries, with very large militaries, with nuclear capability and a history of conflict, so I would not like to burden your imagination on that one," he said. "But obviously if things get worse, things get worse."

Texto completo: An explosion at a northern Russian base that killed at least five people last week involved a small nuclear reactor, state nuclear officials said.
The blast occurred Thursday on a platform in the White Sea off Nyonoksa and caused a reported nearby radiation spike in Severodvinsk.
State-controlled nuclear energy company Rosatom said the explosion occurred during a test of "a nuclear isotope power source" for a rocket.
Vyacheslav Solovyov, scientific director at the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, also confirmed to a local newspaper that the institute was studying "small-scale" power sources that include "fissile materials," the New York Times and Reuters reported.
Five scientists from the center were buried Monday. The country's defense ministry originally said two people were killed in the accident, but Rosatom said five of its workers were killed.
Nuclear experts believe the accident occurred during a test of a missile that Russian President Vladamir Putin has touted in the past year, the Times and Reuters reported.
The SSC-X-9 Skyfall is a protoype cruise missile that could reach any corner of the world with a nuclear reactor as its power source, the Times reported.
The explosion occurred when the rocket's fuel caught fire, according to Reuters. “The testers are national heroes,” said Valentin Kostyukov, head of a nuclear center part of Rosatom.
Russian military officials denied that the blast caused a radiation spike, but the city of Severodvinsk initially posted a statement on its website warning of the increase that was later taken down, Bloomberg reported.
The extent of the damage from the accident was not immediately clear but appears to be much smaller than that of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, the Times reported.

Texto completo: Yesterday's pop culture, reconsidered today. An ongoing series.
Somewhere among my family's mementos there is a photo, which I will make certain you will never see, of me in the early '80s, wearing a goofy smile, a prodigious bush of hair and a T-shirt with the block-lettered slogan, "ANTI-PREPPIE."
How did I, 12 or 13 years old in a Rust Belt small town, even know that there was such a thing as a preppy, much less that I was anti-that? Why would I care enough to plaster my enmity across my chest? The closest thing to an elite preparatory institution in my hometown was the Catholic school. The most coastal element of my experience was Lake Erie. I didn't know any Muffys or Trips; I doubt I ever met an actual prep-school graduate until I went to college.
What I knew of prepdom was the version that had percolated into the shopping centers and school hallways of the Midwest, thanks to "The Official Preppy Handbook." The slim, plaid-jacketed guidebook, edited by Lisa Birnbach and written by her, Jonathan Roberts, Carol McD. Wallace and Mason Wiley, promised its reader virtual entree into the squash courts and folk ways of the old-money elite.
It sold more than a million copies, swathing a nation of copycats in popped-collar Lacoste alligator shirts and sweaters knotted at the neck. It would create a pop-culture shorthand, launch a thousand trend stories and inspire characters like Alex P. Keaton, the Reaganite Ohio teen of "Family Ties."
I never owned a copy. I'm not sure I ever saw it outside a mall bookstore. All the same, it was everywhere. I knew it secondhand, through its resonance in news features and on TV and in the pastel-and-khaki transformation of the popular kids. That was all I needed to know that I hated it and everything it stood for.
Like many adolescents before the internet, I cobbled together my sense of the world and my place in it from pop culture affiliations. I watched slobs-vs.-snobs movies like "Caddyshack" and "Animal House," where the villains were country clubbers, frat boys, the rich kids at the camp across the lake. I read "Doonesbury" and "Bloom County." I watched Hawkeye Pierce prank snooty Charles Emerson Winchester on "M*A*S*H."
I wore T-shirts from Kmart. Neither of my parents had gone to college. If it was the snobs against the slobs, I knew which side I was on.
But the sides were shifting. The year 1980, when the "Handbook" appeared, was a weird in-between moment in American culture. The decade had arrived on the calendar but not quite in the zeitgeist. Jimmy Carter was still president; the book appeared in stores just a few months after Ronald Reagan was nominated in a Detroit convention hall a short drive from my home.
The book seemed to rise on the updrafts of his election and the pop-culture shift that accompanied it, from the underdog sympathies of the 1970s to overdog fantasies like "Dynasty," from hating the rich to envying them to loving them.
The "Handbook" was one of the first touchstones of an era that celebrated coveting, from the bubbly home tours of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" to the upscale-aspiration of MTV's early videos. It was O.K. to want stuff again. This was a shift with broad social and political implications, even if at the time, I saw those reflected mostly in my classmates with their dumb alligator shirts.
I've been thinking about this period a lot over the past couple years, while writing a book that involved diving into the cultural history of the 1980s. For research, I dug up the "Handbook," no longer an easy feat; the decade-defining icon has been relegated to used-book bins.
The book I read was little like the one I'd let live rent-free in my head. Yes, on the surface, it's a how-to guide to prep life, with vast, closely observed entries on picking the proper school, the proper clothing, the proper pet (a dog). There's a page on caring for genuine madras (it needs a 24-hour soak in cold salt water[!] before first washing) and one devoted entirely to ducks ("the most beloved of all totems").
But it's also trenchant and hilarious. It can be as cutting as Lucille Bluth on her third martini. Birnbach -- no lock-jawed Connecticut Mayflower descendant but a Jewish New Yorker who took on the book project as a 21-year-old Village Voice writer -- approached it, she would later say, as an "insider-outsider."
She's affectionate but acerbic. One section is titled "Prep sex: A contradiction in terms." A diagram of preppy college fashion takes a Margaret Mead tone: "For the first time they are in a community of many different types of people, and this very functional uniform helps them to identify one another in a crowd." The illustrations of athletic, cheerfully boozy white people are archly annotated in what would become the manner of the elites-puncturing Spy magazine (where Birnbach later worked).
Birnbach described her tone as "loving irreverence," but it's a cleareyed love that sees its subjects as charmed goofballs with safety nets under their safety nets. It's not quite celebration and it's not entirely satire; it's halfway between roast and toast. Birnbach sees prepdom as enticing, faintly ridiculous and thus essentially harmless. She sees a species anxious about its perpetuation, seeing its place in the world sinking like the evening summer sun off a bayside dock.
This deeply ironic, conflicted work became an unironic hit, much like, say, Madonna's "Material Girl" would. It was bought as a style bible and gentrified department-store shelves until, in the words of a 1984 article in The New York Times on troubles at alligator-shirt-maker Izod, the youth of America "moved on to the 'Flashdance' look."
In 1980, the "Handbook" was a fun lark. Read today, it's an ambivalent document of a transitional moment, when the blue-jean populism of the 1970s was giving way to designer-jean materialism, eventually ushering in a capitalism more rapacious and untiring than the blue-blood leisure Birnbach's prepsters aspired to. It reads especially quaint and wistful now that the cultural markers it delineates have been scrambled, with conservative self-described anti-elitist "deplorables" pledging fealty to a country-club owner.
I didn't know about any of those nuances at the time, just as I didn't realize how much of the anti-snob comedy I loved -- "Doonesbury," "Animal House" -- was in fact created by alumni of Yale and Harvard. I didn't really understand the American class system that the "Handbook" described and that the mass-market preppy fad elided. I thought of my public-school classmates, buying boat shoes at the mall, as preppies. Had I read chapter six of the "Handbook," about life in the suburbs, I would have known that "What Preppies don't need are good public schools and a shopping mall." (Ouch.)
When it came to prepdom, I didn't know what the thing was. I just knew that being not that thing was key to being who I was.
And who, I guess, I am. I have no idea what happened to that "ANTI-PREPPIE" T-shirt. In my closet now are several solid-color, basic-dad polo shirts. They're simple. They're comfortable. They're no big deal. None, however, has a little alligator on the chest. Some allegiances you never quite shake.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Guards on Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working extreme overtime shifts to make up for staffing shortages the morning of his apparent suicide, a person familiar with the jail's operations told The Associated Press.
The person said that the Metropolitan Correctional Center's Special Housing Unit was staffed with one guard working a fifth straight day of overtime and another who was working mandatory overtime. The person wasn't authorized to discuss jail operations publicly and spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity.
The jail staff failed to follow protocols leading up to Epstein's death, according to a report from The New York Times, deepening the fallout from what led to the highly connected financier's apparent suicide.
Epstein should have been checked on by guards in his cell every 30 minutes, but that didn't happen the night before his apparent suicide, a law enforcement official told the Times.
The Times spoke to the official on the condition of anonymity. The Associated Press has not independently confirmed the information.
Market watch
A law enforcement source also told the Times he was alone in his cell early Saturday after his cellmate was transferred. An official with knowledge of the investigation told the paper that the Justice Department was told Epstein would have a cellmate and be monitored by a guard every 30 minutes.
The mystery surrounding how he was able to kill himself in jail comes as investigators have been digging into allegations of sexual abuse and conspiracy against Epstein. An additional federal investigation was launched Saturday after the Federal Bureau of Prison said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at a high-security jail in Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead from an apparent suicide, the BOP said.
New York City's chief medical examiner released a statement Sunday evening saying an autopsy has been performed on Epstein, but that more information is needed before a cause of death determination is made.
Barrett
Dr. Barbara Sampson said a city medical examiner performed the autopsy Sunday while a private pathologist observed the examination at the request of Epstein's representatives.
The private pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, was the city's chief medical examiner in the late 1970s and has been called as an expert witness in high-profile cases including by the defense at O.J. Simpson's 1994 murder trial.
Sampson said having a private pathologist observe an autopsy is a routine practice.
MSNBC
Epstein's abrupt death cuts short a criminal prosecution that could have pulled back the curtain on the inner workings of the high-flying financier with connections to celebrities and presidents, though prosecutors have vowed to continue investigating.
Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found a little over two weeks ago with bruising on his neck, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly. But he was taken off the watch at the end of July and therefore wasn't on it at the time of his death, the person said.
Attorney General William Barr, calling for an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, said he was "appalled" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody.
"Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered," Barr said in a statement.
Epstein, 66, had been denied bail and faced up to 45 years behind bars on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges unsealed last month. He had pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial.
The federal investigation into the allegations remains ongoing, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said. He noted in a statement Saturday that the indictment against Epstein includes a conspiracy charge, suggesting others could face charges in the case.
Epstein's death raises questions about how the Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of such high-profile inmates. In October, Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia where had just been transferred.
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Saturday in a scathing letter to Barr that "heads must roll" after the incident.
"Every single person in the Justice Department -- from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer -- knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him," Sasse wrote.
Epstein's removal from suicide watch would have been approved by both the warden of the jail and the facility's chief psychologist, said Jack Donson, a former prison official who worked for the Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades.
On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein's ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.
Giuffre, in an interview with The New York Times, said she's grateful Epstein will never harm anyone again, but is angry that there would be no chance to see him answer for his conduct.
"We've worked so hard to get here, and he stole that from us, too," she told the newspaper.
Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre's attorney, said Epstein's suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed "is no coincidence." McCawley urged authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said "participated and facilitated Epstein's horrifying sex trafficking scheme."
Epstein's arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed Epstein to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.
Federal prosecutors in New York reopened the probe after investigative reporting by The Miami Herald stirred outrage over that plea bargain.
The Hill
His lawyers maintained that the new charges in New York were covered by the 2008 plea deal and that Epstein hadn't had any illicit contact with underage girls since serving his 13-month sentence in Florida.
Before his legal troubles, Epstein led a life of extraordinary luxury that drew powerful people into his orbit. He socialized with princes and presidents, and lived on a 100-acre private Caribbean island and one of the biggest mansions in New York.

Texto completo: As the competitive nature of our world continues to increase, success can feel elusive.
Whether your sights are set on landing a promotion, raising capital, wining that new account, or inventing a game-changing product, you'll need to break free from traditional thinking in order to seize success.
The ones who score the brass ring are not necessarily smarter or better connected.
The common elements of those that seize extraordinary results have little to do with the brand name of their schooling, their hometown, or their race, gender, or age.
When looking deeper into those who achieve greatly, they tend to embrace two positive core philosophies, which are brought to life by swapping two simple words in their everyday language:
Can't vs. yet Carol Dweck, bestselling author and leading researcher in the field of having a growth mindset, shares the incredible power of the word "yet."
Those with a fixed mindset, meaning they believe people either have a certain talent/ability or they don't, often quit when success isn't achieved on the first attempt.
In contrast, those with a growth mindset believe that persistence, resilience, and tenacity are the stuff of champions.
Instead of saying "I can't write" (meaning the person will never be a good writer), the growth mindset individual would proclaim, "I'm not a good writer yet."
By simply replacing the word "can't" to "yet," you open up the prospect of growing into a desired outcome rather than giving up at the first signs of adversity. What is something you've been thinking you can't possibly achieve? Where could you add the word "yet" to the mix in order to liberate potential?
Have to vs. get to A close friend of my wife's tragically learned that her young son is suffering from brain cancer.
Before the health crisis, daily responsibilities such as going to work, running to the grocery store, or changing a diaper may have felt like a "have to" chore.
After her son kicks cancer, she'll undoubtedly relish each task with a new sense of gratitude. She'll be grateful that she'll "get to" pay the bills or do her taxes, realizing that the freedoms we have to do our daily work is a privilege and a gift.
Gratitude begets success, so when we flip "have to" to an appreciative "get to", we end up attracting more prosperity and joy into our lives. Think about your own "have to's" this week, and try swapping your words. When you "get to" do stuff, you do it better and enjoy the process.
These two simple vocabulary swaps can help you embrace the mindsets of success and happiness. Take your new language for a test drive, and you'll get to enjoy new levels of prosperity and joy.

'Deep River' explores survival, compromise

Texto completo: Karl Marlantes says his penchant for writing long novels comes naturally: He has much to tell through his stories and the undercurrents he masterfully weaves just below the surface.
His latest case in point is his second novel, "Deep River," which fills more than 700 pages as it winds its way through the tale of three sibling Finnish immigrants in early 20th century America.
His award-winning debut novel, "Matterhorn: A Novel of the Vietnam War," was a New York Times bestseller that also had much to say, as Karlantes draws on his own experiences as a highly decorated U.S. Marine during that conflict; and his autobiographical "What It Is Like to Go to War" explores his personal impressions on war.
An Oregon native, Yale graduate and Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, he now lives in rural Washington.
What influenced your interest in history, and the specific time and location of "Deep River," set in the Pacific Northwest from 1893 to 1932?
I've always loved reading history. It provides great lessons for anyone who cares to think about what has gone on before. One of the quotes in my non-fiction book, "What It Is Like to Go to War," is from Otto von Bismarck: "Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others." That time period was also interesting to me because it was, in my opinion, the time of most dramatic change. My grandmother went from no electricity, no running water, horses and buggies, to freeways and landing on the moon. The question of how to adapt in a human and loving way to changing technology is still with us, and still inadequately answered.
The book chronicles the saga of two brothers and a sister who are forced to leave their farming life in Finland and migrate to a logging and fishing community in Washington state to escape the harsh Russian occupation of their homeland. The siblings come to America with differing dreams and personalities: there is Aino, the activist who was introduced to socialism at age 13 by her teacher; Ilmari, a blacksmith with dreams of church building; and Matti, the fortune-seeker. Tell us about each of these characters and their ultimate roles.
All of us adopt a stance toward life, based on such things as character, aptitude, and what happened to us as we were growing up. Kierkegaard refers to the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. These stances are how we deal with such imponderables as our own death and destiny.
Aino is an atheist – she firmly believes no one is coming to help, so we must build heaven on earth, in her case through communism and then the IWW (International Workers of the World). Her brother Matti learns early that rich people suffer much less than poor people. He is like many Americans who think we can just take out an insurance policy against mortality by driving virtually indestructible SUVs to soccer games. Ilmari is traditionally religious. There is a heaven, and we'll all get there, but in the meanwhile, there are some serious unanswered questions, like why some children suffer and go to heaven just like the ones who don't. He moves from traditional Christianity to an amalgam of Christianity and mysticism, which has been my own spiritual journey.
The characters are also highly influenced by their counterparts in The Kalevala. Aino who refuses marriage to an older man through suicide; Matti, hot-headed Lemminkäinen; Ilmari, the powerful blacksmith; Ilmarinen, who forged the magic sampo, the mill that grinds out eternal bounty; and Jouka, who echoes Joukahainen, the celebrated minstrel.
Explain "sisu" and its importance in the lives of the characters in "Deep River."
Sisu is what won "The Winter War of 1939" against the overwhelming might of the Russian army. As a child, if I fell and hurt myself and even started to whimper, my mother or grandmother would ask, "Where's your sisu?" I would find it and not whimper. It's courage, stubbornness, stoicism, many such traits combined and very hard to define.
In the lives of my characters, it is a major force in surviving, getting done what must be done to put food on the table, standing up against odds that any reasonable person would run from. Sisu is not reasonable. And, as Vasutäti points out, it is not always applicable.
Along with your debut book "Matterhorn," you are developing a reputation for lengthy, robust narratives that fully develop your characters, their timelines and their settings – and both are packed with historical details and sweeping landscapes. Did you set out to produce epic works (that would rise so quickly to bestseller status), or did your stories just work themselves out to be generous volumes?
I swear I'll correct that image with my next novel, but then again, stories tend to just keep happening to me while I'm writing. I never set out to write epic works. I do know, however, that among my favorite novels are "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina," and "The Brothers Karamazov," all hefty volumes. As a reader, I like to get into a world, and if the writing is good, feel disappointed when I leave it. So, in that respect, long novels are good. I am also much taken by true epics, the "Táin Bó Cúailnge" of the Irish, the "Song of Roland" of the French, "The Iliad and Odyssey" of the ancient Greeks, "The Aeneid of the Romans," and "The Kalevala of the Finns."
Many reviews note that "Deep River" is, in part, somewhat of a comment on today's political state in America. Could you address that?
The two major protagonists, Aksel and Aino, are almost allegorical figures for this tension in American political life between the collective and the individual. We seesaw between the two, The Great Society followed by Ronald Reagan and The Roaring Twenties followed by The New Deal.
Aksel and Aino both learn that they need each other to make it through life. It's called compromise, something we have lost in today's political scene. There are many parallels between the time of the novel and now, not even remotely allegorical: wars being fought that involved no immediate threat to our own security, opposition to those wars being characterized as unpatriotic, giving up individual privacy and freedom to the Espionage Act of 1917, which was sold to protect us from "bolshevism" and used to crush the IWW in the name of national security, and the Patriot Act of today, which was sold to protect us from terrorists and justified by the same reasoning, horrible income inequality, the struggle to make a living wage, the unconscious destruction of our natural environment, the problems associated with immigration, false stories in biased newspapers, all compounded by a feckless federal government.
Signing, Mississippi Book Festival
Karl Marlantes will sign copies of "Deep River" at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Lemuria Books in Jackson and 5:30 p.m. Thursday at Off Square Books in Oxford. He will also participate in a Fiction Panel at 12 p.m. at the Mississippi Book Festival Aug. 17 and sign at the Book Signing Tent at 1:45 p.m. For details, visit msbookfestival.com.

Texto completo: WILSON, N.C. -- "It was hard, and it was fun, and it was extraordinary," the photographer Burk Uzzle said of Woodstock, where he captured one of the most famous images of the festival, featured on the cover of the soundtrack album for the documentary film "Woodstock." Uzzle was 31 years old that weekend; formerly a staff photographer at Life, he had left the magazine to freelance with the Magnum photo agency. (His clients in 1969 included The New York Times, he said.)
While a host of publications tried to send him to the festival on assignment, Uzzle turned them down because he disliked how editors "tell you what you should be seeing and doing, and I find that irritating," he said recently, with a smile, in his cavernous studio space here.
Instead, Uzzle took his family -- including his two sons, then 9 and 10 years old -- camping on a friend's property in the Catskills, next to a trout stream. The morning of Friday, Aug. 15, 1969, they woke up early and drove half an hour for what Uzzle intended to be a one-day freelance visit to the Woodstock festival. They brought along a small knapsack with some snacks for the kids (crackers, candy bars, tinned fruit) and a poncho in case it rained (which it did, abundantly). He carried two Leica cameras, one with a normal lens, the other with a medium-wide lens. "And then I stuffed my pockets with as much film as I could get in, which I discovered was 15 rolls," he said.
The Uzzle family, among the first to show up at Woodstock, even got a prime parking space. But soon after they arrived, they heard that the New York State Thruway had been shut down because of the immense crowd. "It was very quickly apparent that we weren't going to get out anytime soon," Uzzle said.
When their supplies ran out, they lined up at the festival's food stands like everyone else. "Nobody was getting a lot to eat," Uzzle recalled. For shelter on a wet, muddy weekend, they built a lean-to by attaching the poncho to a barbed-wire fence on some nearby hills, digging a drainage trench around it. "And it worked!" he crowed. "We were dry when we needed to be dry and we were wet all the rest of the time."
Uzzle visited the stage where musicians were performing, but quickly decided that the story of Woodstock was out in the audience. He couldn't convince friends on assignment to join him, so he settled for cadging some rolls of color film from them.
Wandering through the crowd of hundreds of thousands, he found people cooperating to build tents, skinny-dipping in a nearby pond and curling up together in bales of hay. Uzzle was a classical music fan who didn't drink or smoke pot, but he found a utopia at Woodstock anyway. "It was a hard decade: assassinations, riots, Washington. My archive is full of really bad stuff," he said. "And then you get to Woodstock, and here are all the hippies that everyone thought were going to ruin the world, but these people decided to look after each other."
Uzzle's iconic Woodstock photo is of a couple wrapped in a blanket, embracing each other at dawn, oblivious to the camera and the chaos surrounding them. He didn't speak with his subjects, but they were later identified as Nick Ercoline and Bobbi Kelly -- who at the time had been dating for just 10 weeks, but now have been married for 47 years.
Uzzle took the picture in the early hours of Sunday morning. He woke up around 4:30 a.m. and was walking around, looking for interesting subjects, being careful not to burn through his film too quickly. When he spotted the couple from a distance, he checked the light and zone-focused for a distance of 15 feet. His mentor, Henri Cartier-Bresson, had told Uzzle to study the Quattrocento painters for their detailed compositions, and that homework paid off: "I walk up and I know the curvature of the hill has to work with the curvature of the heads. And there's the flag, it's going to have to be there, and just enough of the people."
He took a few frames in black and white before switching to color. Five decades later, Uzzle still remembered the details, down to the f-stop of 1.4: "Very slow shutter speed, almost dark, holding myself very still, maybe a 15th of a second, and I was lucky that it was still sharp. But I was not high! So I was able to make the composition and be in focus and take the picture. And then I turned around to find something else to shoot."

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who was being held in a Manhattan jail awaiting federal sex trafficking charges, died early Saturday from an apparent suicide, according to federal authorities.
After being found "unresponsive in his cell" at the Metropolitan Correctional Center at around 6:39 a. m. and receiving life-saving measures, Epstein was transported to nearby New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to a statement by the MCC. The center referred to his death as an "apparent suicide. "
Attorney General William Barr said he was "appalled" that Epstein's died of apparent suicide while in federal custody at the MCC, which is part of the U. S. Bureau of Prisons facility under the Department of Justice.
“Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered," Barr said in a statement. "In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death. "
U. S. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska, in turn, took Barr to task over the affair with a stinging letter to the attorney general demanding that "heads must roll. "
"Every single person in the Justice Department — from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer — knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn’t be allowed to die with him," wrote Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Epstein, 66, an investment banker who counted among his powerful connections former President Bill Clinton, President Donald Trump and Prince Andrew, had pleaded not guilty to charges of drug trafficking and allegedly sexually abusing dozens of underage girls in New York and Florida.
He repeatedly refused to answer questions regarding the lurid sexual allegations against him or the possible involvement of others, including high-profile figures.
His death came within 24 hours after long-sealed documents were released by a federal court in a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein’s ex-girlfriend brought by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s accusers.
Among the thousands of pages of documents was the partial transcript of a 2016 videotaped deposition in which Epstein pleaded the Fifth Amendment against incriminating himself when asked a series of explosive questions, including whether he was a member of the Mar-a-Largo resort in Florida owned by Trump.
Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre’s attorney, said Epstein’s suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed “is no coincidence. ” McCawley called on federal authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said “participated and facilitated Epstein’s horrifying sex trafficking scheme. ”
“The reckoning of accountability begun by the voices of brave and truthful victims should not end with Jeffrey Epstein’s cowardly and shameful suicide,” McCawley said in a statement. “The victims await the true justice they have sought and deserve. ”
Three weeks ago, Epstein was found unconscious in his cell at the center. He had suffered injuries to his neck in what appeared to be a suicide attempt or jailhouse assault.
A person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Epstein had been taken off suicide watch. The person wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. It wasn’t immediately clear when he was taken off suicide watch.
The New York Times, quoting a person familiar with Epstein's detention, reported that he was removed from suicide watch July 29 and returned to the special housing unit, which has extra security.
Epstein had been housed in the jail’s Special Housing Unit, a heavily secured part of the facility that separates high-profile inmates from the general population, according to the Bureau of Prisons.
Three members of Epstein’s defense team, lawyers Reid Weingarten, Marty Weinberg and Michael Miller, issued a statement saying, “We are enormously sorry to learn of today’s news. No one should die in jail. ” They declined to comment on the circumstances of his death.
Another Epstein lawyer, Marc Fernich, issued a personal statement calling Epstein's death an "unthinkable tragedy" and criticizing prosecutors, plaintiffs' lawyers, jailers and the press, among others.
"All seem to have a share of Mr. Epstein’s blood on their hands," he said. "All should be ashamed of their behavior. "
Fernich said in the statement that he was speaking as an “outraged citizen and defense lawyer, not as a representative of Jeffrey Epstein’s defense team. "
Epstein was convicted in 2008 on Florida charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution.
He avoided what could have been a lengthy prison sentence under a plea deal with then-U. S. Attorney Alex Acosta. The deal drew intense scrutiny and led Acosta to resign as President Donald Trump's labor secretary.
The recently released documents included depositions of years of alleged sex acts involving underage girls. The material, released as a result of petitions by the Miami Herald and other news media, included sordid allegations involving prominent individuals.
Among the documents are police reports, flight logs and even a purported memoir by a woman who says she was a victim of Epstein's when she was teenager.
Jennifer Araoz said in a statement Saturday she and other accusers will be scarred for the rest of their lives, while he won’t confront the consequences of the “trauma he caused so many people. ”
Brad Edwards, a lawyer for nearly two dozen other accusers, called Epstein’s suicide a “selfish act” that was “not the ending anyone was looking for. ”
Epstein was arrested by federal agents in July at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey after his private jet landed from Paris.
The federal indictment claims Epstein "incentivized his victims" by paying them hundreds of dollars for each girl they recruited. Encounters with his victims would begin with a "massage" before Epstein would “escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victim,” the indictment says. It also says unnamed employees of Epstein aided in scheduling the girls.
Nicholas Biase, spokesman for the U. S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York, declined to comment on the reported suicide or the future status of the Epstein case.
The federal investigation into the allegations remains ongoing, U. S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said.
It was unclear before Epstein's death whether federal prosecutors were pursuing a superseding indictment that would include additional charges and defendants beyond Epstein.
Julie K. Brown, a reporter for the Miami Herald whose dogged reporting led to a re-examination of the Epstein saga, told CNN Saturday that his death may bring out more witnesses.
"It might open up the case even more," she said. "There will be people that maybe will not be as afraid to talk now. "

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Russian officials opened an antitrust investigation into Apple for restricting and removing parental control apps from its App Store shortly after the company released its own competing service, the latest sign of the growing scrutiny of Silicon Valley's power.
Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service said late Thursday that it would investigate whether Apple had violated Russian competition law when it removed a parental control app made by Kaspersky Lab, a Russian cybersecurity company, from the iPhone App Store. The Russian agency said that after reviewing Kaspersky's complaint, it concluded that Apple had rejected the app, which it had previously approved, and set unclear requirements for app developers.
The New York Times reported in April that shortly after Apple introduced tools to help people limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones, the company removed or restricted popular apps that offered similar services. Apple said the apps improperly used technologies that gave them too much access to users' data.
In June, Apple reversed itself and allowed the apps to return with the same technologies, as long as they promised to not "sell, use or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose." Many of the apps have since returned to the App Store.
Apple said in a statement on Friday that Kaspersky had not submitted a new version of its app for review.
"Apple respects the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service and we are confident their review will confirm that all developers have an equal opportunity to succeed on the App Store," Apple said in the statement. "We treat all developers the same, and invest a lot in creating a safe and trusted place for our customers to discover and download apps."
Kaspersky said in a blog post that despite Apple's policy reversal, the Silicon Valley company has still put parental control apps at a disadvantage. As part of its complaint, Kaspersky said that Apple's rules for returning to the App Store were vague, that Apple prohibited the apps from sharing data with third-party analytics firms to improve their services and that Apple did not allow the apps to use the same technology it did to help parents control their children's phones.
Kaspersky has previously faced scrutiny for how it handles users' data. United States security officials have said Kaspersky's antivirus software has been a tool for Russian intelligence authorities, an accusation that Kaspersky has rigorously denied.
"The company has no ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts," Kaspersky said in a statement.
The Russian investigation is another front for Apple in a widening clash with regulators over how the company oversees the App Store, which distributes millions of apps to customers' iPhones.
Two other developers of parental control apps, Kidslox and Qustodio, have complained to the European authorities that Apple unfairly blocked their apps. At least one American company has lodged similar complaints in conversations with Justice Department officials, according to a person close to the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were private.
The Justice Department is considering other antitrust complaints against Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, while the House Judiciary Committee is also investigating possible anticompetitive behavior by the four companies. Most of the antitrust scrutiny of Apple has focused on its control of the App Store.
Amid the increasing attention, Apple in May published a web page defending its approach to the App Store. It said it strove to create "a safe and trusted place for customers" and "a great business opportunity for all developers."

A Lament for Our Smartest Chimp

Texto completo: Do other animals think, and what do they think about? Sarah, a chimpanzee who died last week in her late 50s, offers some important clues.
Sarah, who could have been deemed the world's smartest chimp, was brought to the United States from Africa as an infant to work with David and Ann Premack in a series of experiments designed to find out what chimpanzees might think. In order to determine what, if anything, might be on Sarah's mind, she was one of the first chimpanzees to be taught a human language. The Premacks taught her to use plastic magnetic tokens that varied in size and color to represent words. She formed sentences by placing the tokens in a vertical line. Ann Premack noted that her earliest words named "various interesting fruits," so that Sarah "could both solve her problem and eat it."
Food plays an important role in chimpanzee life, and in Sarah's case, food often took on meaning beyond sustenance. She clearly had favorite foods, like chocolate, and much of the time would only correctly answer the questions she was asked if chocolate was forthcoming. She often would create sentences of the form "Mary give Sarah apple" but when Mary would change the order to read "Sarah give Mary apple" Sarah would not be happy and knock the sentence off the board.
The Premacks noted that one of the difficulties in teaching language to a caged subject is finding things to talk about. There is only so long even food-motivated chimpanzees will be willing to talk about bananas. Finding new sources of interest was important and for Sarah it was clear that asking her about her favorite people and promising her M & Ms provided strong motivation.
Sarah's favoritism toward certain people came in handy in her groundbreaking participation in tests that lead to a subfield of inquiry known in psychology and philosophy as "theory of mind." Sarah helped David Premack and co-author Guy Woodruff answer the title question of their 1978 paper "Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?" in the affirmative.
To have a theory of mind is to be able to attribute purpose, intention, beliefs, desires, and other attitudes to both oneself and another person or animal. In order to test whether Sarah could understand that people had thoughts that differed from her thoughts, she was presented with short video tapes where a human actor in a cage was trying to perform a task, like trying to get some bananas that were inaccessible. After watching the video Sarah was shown two pictures, one that would allow the actor to reach his goal (a box) the other not (a key). She successfully solved the problems for the actor.
But there was some concern that she was putting herself into the position of the actors, which would be a pretty exciting cognitive feat on its own, but wouldn't show that she attributed attitudes to the actors. So she was presented with more videos, one in which the actor was her favorite caretaker and another in which the actor was someone she didn't really like. Sarah selected the right responses more often for the actor she liked, and the wrong responses for the actor she didn't much care for.
Sarah's career established that not only do chimpanzees have complex thoughts, but also distinct personalities with strong preferences and prejudices. But this is just part of her remarkable life story. As she grew older she helped a diabetic chimpanzee named Abby, who she was living with, remember to get her medication. She was a loving, yet stern, aunt-like figure to a pair of young chimpanzees, Harper and Emma, and she helped Henry, a male chimpanzee who came from a situation of terrible abuse, get along with other chimpanzees.
Since the time that Sarah was thought to have established that chimpanzees know what others might want or need, a growing number of investigators have tried to figure out if other animals have a theory of mind. Though there have always been skeptics, studies have suggested that crows, jays, ravens, other apes, monkeys, and maybe dogs, may know what others are thinking. In social animals, being able to glean what others might be thinking is a good strategy for getting along. For chimpanzees living in sanctuaries, it can facilitate care.
At Chimp Haven, the national sanctuary for chimpanzees, where Sarah spent the last 13 years of her life, she was pampered and adored by the staff. She had chimpanzees, like Marie, who doted on her. I will forever remember her gentle pant hoots when I visited as she demanded treats from me. I feel honored that I was one of the people she liked and I delighted watching her gingerly divide up the items in the trail mix I gave her -- dried apricots in this pile, cashews in this pile, raisins in this pile, and her beloved M & Ms, that she separated out, but always ate first.
All who knew her couldn't help but be charmed by her determination. Her legacy will long be remembered and she will be sorely missed.

With Lawsuit, Fourth Man Claims Sexual Abuse by Prominent Coach

Texto completo: Sexual abuse allegations continued to roil figure skating on Friday when a lawsuit was filed against Richard Callaghan, a once prominent coach of Olympians who has faced public accusations of improper conduct that stretch back two decades.
Adam Schmidt, 34, a former skating student of Mr. Callaghan's, filed a lawsuit in San Diego saying that Mr. Callaghan had repeatedly abused him from 1999 to 2001, beginning when Mr. Schmidt was 14 years old. Mr. Schmidt became the fourth male skater to have publicly accused Mr. Callaghan of improper behavior during a period from the early 1990s to the early 2000s.
Also named as defendants were U.S. Figure Skating, the sport's national governing body, and a skating facility in suburban Detroit where Mr. Callaghan taught Mr. Schmidt.
Dean Groulx, Mr. Callaghan's lawyer, said that neither he nor his client was aware of any such accusation or lawsuit and therefore could not comment. Mr. Groulx added that Mr. Callaghan "denies that he has engaged in any wrongdoing at any time."
Mr. Callaghan, 73, is best known for coaching Tara Lipinski to a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics and coaching Todd Eldredge to a world championship, six United States titles and three Olympic appearances.
He was suspended from involvement in skating last year after a renewed examination of accusations made against him by three former skaters to The New York Times in 1999. The U.S. Center for SafeSport, an independent organization created in 2017 to investigate allegations of abuse, conducted the examination.
Mr. Schmidt's lawsuit followed recent public accusations made by two female skaters that John Coughlin, a two-time United States pairs champion, had sexually abused them. The accusations were made last week by the Olympian Ashley Wagner and, in May, by Bridget Namiotka, a former skating partner of Mr. Coughlin's.
Other charges against Mr. Coughlin were made anonymously. He was restricted from the sport in December 2017. He denied charges of sexual abuse to USA Today and killed himself the following January, one day after he was handed a full suspension by U.S. Figure Skating.
Mr. Schmidt would not comment beyond an interview with ABC, according to his lawyer, John Manly.
Mr. Manly also represents about 200 accusers of Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, the former American women's gymnastics team doctor, who is expected to spend the rest of his life in prison after being convicted of serial sex abuse. Mr. Manly said in a statement that Mr. Schmidt's case was another "sad example of the culture of child abuse that is rampant in our Olympic sports programs."
U.S. Figure Skating and the rinks where Mr. Callaghan taught "ignored complaints against him for years," Mr. Manly said in the statement, accusing the defendants of concealing from Mr. Schmidt's parents and the authorities information that Mr. Callaghan might have abused skaters.
"If they had done their legal duty in 1999 and reported Callaghan to the police, our client and other children could have been protected from this monster," Mr. Manly said.
U.S. Figure Skating said in a statement that it did not comment on pending litigation. But the federation added that it "fully supports all victims of sexual abuse and misconduct and encourages anyone who has been abused or suspects abuse or misconduct to immediately report it to local law enforcement, the U.S. Center for SafeSport or U.S. Figure Skating."
In March 2018, Mr. Callaghan was suspended from the sport. He was coaching in Florida at the time and has previously denied any wrongdoing.
The suspension resulted from a complaint made to SafeSport by Craig Maurizi, 56, a prominent coach who was a former student and coaching partner of Mr. Callaghan's. In 1999, Mr. Maurizi told The Times that Mr. Callaghan had engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with him for a number of years, beginning when he was 15.
The accusations were dismissed at the time by U.S. Figure Skating because they had not been levied within a required 60-day period after the abuse allegedly occurred. Mr. Maurizi's charges received renewed scrutiny after SafeSport decided to investigate.
Two other former skating students of Mr. Callaghan's also accused him of improper conduct in The Times article in 1999. Eddy Zeidler said Mr. Callaghan exposed himself to him in a hotel room in 1992. Roman Fraden said that Mr. Callaghan made inappropriate sexual remarks to him in 1994, and Mr. Fraden's parents said they confronted Mr. Callaghan over the remarks.
Mr. Callaghan resigned from the Detroit Skating Club in 1999 and eventually moved to Florida to continue coaching.
In the 1999 Times article, Mr. Callaghan, in denying the accusations, accused Mr. Maurizi of trying to poach skaters to further his own coaching career. And he expressed suspicion that some of his other former skaters were attempting to blame him for their own unfulfilled careers.
"For whatever reasons I don't understand, people love me or hate me," Mr. Callaghan told The Times in 1999. "I have no clue why. In almost 30 years, I've taught about 500 kids. I don't understand this. The allegations are awful. I can't believe I worked my butt off for kids to be successful in skating to be better people and this stuff happens."
From 1999 to about 2002, Mr. Schmidt trained at the Detroit Skating Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., with Mr. Callaghan as his coach, according to the lawsuit filed. In October 2001, Mr. Schmidt attended an event in San Diego called the Masters of Figure Skating competition. He was 16 at the time. The lawsuit, and an accompanying news release, said that Mr. Callaghan "secluded" Mr. Schmidt and sexually abused him at the arena where the competition occurred.
The lawsuit also accused U.S. Figure Skating of having received information that Mr. Callaghan had engaged in inappropriate behavior with other minors but did not report him to the authorities, as required by law.
In the wake of Mr. Maurizi's accusations in the late 1990s, the skating federation has taken a number of steps to strengthen its protection of young athletes. For instance, coaches are forbidden from being alone with skaters under 18. And it is mandatory for everyone in skating to report all witnessed or suspected abuse.
Mr. Schmidt told ABC News that Mr. Callaghan began abusing him at the Detroit Skating Club and that the assaults escalated at the Onyx Ice Arena in Rochester, Mich., which was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. Tom Anastos, the owner of the rink, told ABC he was unaware of those allegations and that if any complaint had been received at the rink "we would have acted on it."
Mr. Schmidt told ABC that, following practices on the ice, he would go to his coach's office, where Mr. Callaghan touched him inappropriately while the coach was nude from the waist down.
"I didn't understand it at the time, because I was just so obsessed with my career and wanting to please him," Mr. Schmidt told ABC.
He said he was hospitalized with psychological trauma in January 2017 and disclosed the alleged sexual abuse to a therapist, who confirmed Mr. Schmidt's account to ABC.
"How did this happen?" Mr. Schmidt told the network. Referring to the allegations Mr. Maurizi made against Mr. Callaghan in 1999, Mr. Schmidt added, "Why 20 years ago did everyone know and do nothing?
"Because if they had done something then," Mr. Schmidt continued, "I never would have been abused."

Texto completo: Healthcare decisions
It seems intuitively obvious and necessary to me that medical care should be given to all in need no matter their personal circumstances or personal lifestyle choices - be they citizens, illegal aliens, or even visitors. Obviously, it needs to be paid for - the hows of that debate are myriad.
What doesn't seem to be addressed is who will make the decisions about what one "needs" and what one "wants" for health care. Will it be the legislators who seem capable only of yelling at each other? Will it be religious factions who may or may not approve of birth control or abortions or gender surgery or Viagra? At what point does care start or stop?
We can't come to an agreement about when life begins, much less agree on the rights of terminally ill to die. Are experimental drugs or procedures experimenting with people" lives or taxpayers' dollars?
In January, because of international travel plans, I was advised by my doctor and the CDC to get hepatitis A vaccine. It is a two-part drug and I was told to come back in six months for the second injection. When I returned for Part 2, the doctor's office told me Medicare would not authorize Part 2 of the drug.
They authorized Part 1 but not Part 2. Who is making these decisions?

Ban assault weapons
As a forensic psychiatrist, I have evaluated many people who were potentially violent, to themselves and to others. The first step to minimize any harm is to remove any dangerous weapons from the individual.
The same approach is needed for our country and, in my opinion, the first step should be a ban on assault weapons and it should happen immediately. Not only should the sale of assault weapons be banned but all that are currently owned need to be bought back.
Although other steps are needed, such as universal background checks, they will not be as effective in minimizing deaths from violent attacks as the assault weapon ban. We may not immediately stop the attacks but we can lessen the effects while adopting a more comprehensive approach to the problem.
Anything less than this is an abdication of responsibility by our government.

Front page
What newspaper am I reading? Understanding that The Capital had a horrific loss of talent last year, I have been very patient with the number of articles that are copy and pasted from The Washington Post and New York Times (aka Washington Bureau). The Monday edition is really challenging me to keep my subscription to The Capital.
I gave up on the Post over 15 years ago after reading it my entire life. The Post is nothing more than free strategic communications for the Democrat party.
Page 1 top left, Trump hit piece (Washington Post), Page 2 (Washington Post only), Page 6 (Washington Post, 2 articles), Page 7 (Opinion piece begins with "Trump lies"). Where is the balance?
Will the Washington Times or Examiner not cooperate with you? Please help me understand who is now in control of your paper.

Light on the water
I have read and loved The Capital for 75 years, since I was small enough to have to spread it on the floor to read the comics. One reason I still like it is that the front page almost always has a nice story with local "good news" events and pictures.
Joshua McKerrow's pictures and story motivated me to send my compliments - lights on water and Spa Creek where I grew up; and I remember A. Aubrey Bodine's photography (The Capital, Aug. 6).
McKerrow writes almost poetically. He deserves a raise!

Texto completo: NAIROBI, Kenya - A Kenyan lawmaker was kicked out of the parliamentary chamber on Wednesday for bringing her infant daughter in with her, in a move that drew outrage from some fellow politicians and the public.
The lawmaker, Zuleikha Hassan, said she took her baby with her to work at the National Assembly in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, after an emergency left her without child care.
"I said, 'Why should I stay at home and not go to work, just because of the baby?'" she said in an interview. "Why should they criminalize having a baby? So, I said, 'I'm going to Parliament with a baby.'"
She also lamented the lack of child care facilities at the government buildings, and said with more young women getting into the workforce, "the spaces have to be more sensitive, especially for younger women who are in childbearing age."
In video from inside the chamber, a baby's soft babbling can be heard in the background as the speaker of Parliament demands that Hassan leave. Other members of Parliament appeared to shove one another in the center of the chamber as the squabble unfolded.
"Those members who are crossing the floor willy-nilly must know they are out of order," said Chris Omulele, the temporary speaker of the House, as he raised his voice in an attempt to restore calm before repeatedly demanding that the lawmaker leave. "The honorable Zuleikha, kindly withdraw with decorum."

State Department worker quits because of failed resistance to Trump policies

Texto completo: In an op-ed published by the Washington Post, the U.S. Foreign Service's Chuck Park laid out the reasons why he is resigning from the State Department, including what he calls a lack of resistance from within the ranks to President Trump's policies.
Park said liberals and conservatives are wrong to assume there are people in the federal bureaucracy who are working to undermine Trump, so much so that he nicknamed it the "The Complacent State," a play on the term "Deep State."
"Over three tours abroad, I worked to spread what I believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance. But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home," Park wrote.
He said, if anything, "what I have not seen is organized resistance from within. To the contrary, two senior Foreign Service officers admonished me for risking my career when I signed an internal dissent cable against the ban on travelers from several majority-Muslim countries in January 2017. Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore."
He added, "If the resistance does exist, it should be clear by this point that it has failed."
Park pointed to a New York Times op-ed that called for the public shaming of the “midlevel functionaries who make the system run" and said people should be "named and shamed" for following Trump's orders.
"Every day, we refuse visas based on administration priorities. We recite administration talking points on border security, immigration and trade. We plan travel itineraries, book meetings and literally hold doors open for the appointees who push Trump’s toxic agenda around the world."
He came to the decision to resign after last weekend's El Paso, Texas mass shooting at the hands of a gunman "whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our president." He indicated he would not be able to justify to his 7-month-old son why he was working in the administration.

Teachers’ union spends millions to stifle school choice in California

Texto completo: Anyone who wonders about the importance of the United States Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which declared that unions can no longer force public-sector workers to pay dues, should heed the latest lobbying numbers released by the state of California.
The California Teachers’ Association spent more than $1 million a month since April to influence lawmakers as it pushed bills aimed at cracking down on charter schools, according to a report this month in the Sacramento Bee. The union topped the list of the state’s biggest spenders on lobbying.
Its money wasn’t directed toward improving the lot of public-school teachers, but toward crushing a bright spot in public education. Charter schools are publicly funded, but their success has been an embarrassment to the union. They are exempt from many union-backed administrative rules and often hire teachers who are not members of unions. But they’ve been particularly successful in low-income communities where traditional public schools are failing.
In Janus, the justices ruled last year that workers should not be forced to pay dues to an organization that espouses views they might not support. The court revisited the 1977 Abood case, which declared that public employees may withhold the portion of their dues used for direct political activities. The plaintiffs in Janus argued, correctly, that even the collective bargaining-related dues that unions collect, known as agency fees, amount to a form of coerced support.
But there was a secondary benefit to the decision. Giving union members a choice means that many of them will opt out of union membership. “Members and money are power in politics,” Stanford political science professor Terry Moe told The New York Times soon after the decision. “This will weaken the teachers unions nationwide as a political force.”
If the CTA has fewer members and less of a war chest, it will presumably have less money and time to spend lobbying the Legislature to hobble charter schools or promote other causes. Janus backers argued that the decision could force unions to focus on bread-and-butter issues.
Obviously, the CTA — as the Bee story makes clear — has yet to scale back its political activities. But recent statistics suggest that many unions are losing members and even the unions themselves expect to cut their budgets over time. The jury still is out, but it would be good news for public employees, taxpayers and maybe even the unions themselves if union must focus more on improving their services and less time influencing the Legislature.
This session, some anti-charter measures already have failed, but one major remaining bill would strip charter schools of the ability to appeal for support beyond the local school board. That’s crucial, because many school boards have anti-charter majorities because of local union political efforts.
The CTA is so active this year because of election changes. Jerry Brown was a dependable charter supporter, but was replaced by Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose support is less certain. Democrats also enhanced their supermajorities.
Instead of spending millions of dollars pushing anti-competitive measures that will hurt kids, the unions should focusing on improving the education at unionized public schools. There’s so much work to be done on that front. They’re unlikely to do that on their own, which is why Janus offers some hope for the future.

Texto completo: TARTA's missed bus

If the TARTA Board would have taken action years ago, this latest fiasco could have been avoided. As the ATU Local 697 Business Agent at that time, I requested the board's intervention and offered them the evidence of what was going on at TARTA. The collective bargaining agreement was constantly ignored and blatantly violated. The resulting grievances and unfair labor practices cost TARTA in legal fees.

TARTA has been without a real general manager since Richard Ruddell left in early 2003 when he was chosen by Fort Worth to lead their transit system.

Since then, TARTA has been run by the human resources department disguised by a person titled general manager with a huge salary and company vehicle. Since handing Jim Gee a job he was grossly inexperienced to perform, TARTA, once a respected transit authority, began its descent into dysfunction.

TARTA needs an experienced general manager who actually manages. TARTA/TARPS has great employees and passengers who deserve so much more. Board minutes and The Blade articles can prove what I have written.

Give Kranz honor

I agree with Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz in his suggestion to change the name of Toledo Express Airport to the Eugene Kranz Airport of Toledo ( Mayor Kapszukiewicz wants name of airport changed to honor Kranz, July 26).

Mr. Kranz has been recognized in the New York Times and on CBS Evening News as a national hero. He should be honored and recognized in Toledo as a great hero too.

It would be a wonderful tribute to this man for all that he has done for NASA, as flight director for the rescue missions and for our country. It would be great for Toledo.

Temple is grateful

As president of the board the Zen Buddhist Temple of Toledo, I thank you for the editorial on the building of our new Temple on a donated wooded lot within the city (Welcome the temple, July 30).

We look forward to contributing to the remarkable religious diversity of Toledo as the practice of our small, contemplative, religious community moves to this beautiful site set back into the woods. Our intention is for the temple to blend into the natural surroundings and for our community to hold the habitat and woods in sacred stewardship.

We'd like to express our deep gratitude for the donation of this land and funds to build upon it. We'd also like to express how deeply we have been moved by the support we have received and the many testimonials voiced to city council that demonstrate the positive impact the temple has had on peoples' lives.

Our practice is one of compassion and kindness and of manifesting this in the world in our everyday lives. We hope that, over time, we can demonstrate to the local community, by the way we walk through the world - by our words and actions - our deep commitment to being good neighbors.

Texto completo: HARLAN, Iowa — President Trump needs to take responsibility for his racist rhetoric, according to Elizabeth Warren, responding to questions over why she labeled the president a white supremacist.
“He’s a man who cozies up to the white supremacists, he calls them fine fellows, he’s talked about trying to get brown people and black people out of this country, he’s talked about shithole countries. This is what he’s done. The wink and a nod,” the senator for Massachusetts and Democratic presidential candidate told reporters Thursday during a campaign stop at a farm in Harlan, Iowa.
Warren added, “And he can’t have it both ways. He can’t keep trying to stir this up, give aid and comfort, be embraced by the white supremacists, and then say, ‘Oh, but not me.’ No, he’s responsible. He’s the president of the United States.”
Outrage among Democrats over Trump’s predilection for racially divisive language has escalated since it was discovered that the shooter who last weekend killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, left behind a manifesto warning of an immigrant “invasion,” a word the president has invoked to talk about the migrant issues being experienced at the southern border.
Warren told the New York Times after a town hall in Council Bluffs, Iowa, late Wednesday she believed Trump was a white supremacist. Her comments echo Beto O’Rourke’s from the weekend; the former Texas representative employed the same descriptor during an interview with CNN following the massacre in his hometown on El Paso.
Warren is in the midst of a four-day swing of the Hawkeye State, where most of the 2020 Democratic primary field is stumping this week during the Iowa State Fair.

Texto completo: Health care right
Editor: In response to the recent Democratic presidential debates, I agree with Sen. Bernie Sanders’ position that health care is a human right that should be accessible to all Americans.
I have a friend who is a single mother and primary school teacher in New Jersey. She and her children are covered under her employer-sponsored health plan. Recently, her son experienced bullying at school. She called 20 child counselors and not one would take her insurance.
She had to resort to the nonprofessional help and guidance of family and friends. Doesn’t her son have a human right to mental health care?

Calculated malice
Editor: On July 25, The New York Times published accounts expressing that Robert Mueller had utterly failed in his congressional testimony the previous day.
The early report from practically every source verified this: House Democrats could not rebut President Donald Trump. Even Peter Baker of The New York Times, who is regarded by some as the nation’s best reporter, indicated that critics of the president had a bleak day.
By that evening, though, a calm and considered view emerged at most cable news networks. A consensus formed among Democratic Party leaders that they now had something useful to work with. Commentators initially mentioned a lackluster performance by Mueller; it seemed that they had wanted more drama. Many of the former special counsel’s answers to intense questioning were yes or no. It was quite different from what we’ve become accustomed to from our president.
Indeed, Mueller is the anti-Trump. The modest and humble fellow is the very opposite of the leader of the free world who, in truth, is not just a blustering bully, but obnoxious.
Heading toward Election Day in November 2020, Trump now answers critics with only reaction. Let us recognize that he can so easily do that because his attitude is set - with malice aforethought. It boils over.

Public safety crisis
Editor: On July 7, I was treated to a delicious breakfast courtesy of the dedicated volunteers of the Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Company.
It was a great value at $10, with waffles and omelets. On July 13, the great food continued at the Covington Independent Fire Company picnic. That short-staffed public safety agency still manages to put on a great picnic with delicious food. A great breakfast was held at the Madisonville Fire Department on July 28, again a small group of volunteers was trying to raise funds for their critical public safety agency.
These were just three events in our area that help fund local emergency services. We all count on them to be there when we need them, but we must support them so they can be there for us. Despite a shortage of volunteers, funding struggles and agencies facing closure, Harrisburg has failed to act. In 2014, then-state Fire Commissioner Ed Mann said, “Soon, nobody’s going to show up.” In 2018 Rep. Frank Farry, of Bucks County, said volunteers are “going the way of the dinosaur.”
A report commissioned by the Legislature was released this year with dozens of recommendations to help address this crisis, yet volunteers face deafening silence from their state leadership. Several local ambulance companies have closed or face closure.
We are making it harder for firefighters and emergency medical technicians to volunteer and the state has failed to pass meaningful legislation to help ease this burden. If we don’t act to save volunteer emergency services, which are staples in our communities, we run the risk of facing massive tax increases to fund fully paid services, or worse, no services.
I thank all first responders in our area for all they do for us. I appreciate their selfless hard work and dedication.

Dangerous effect
Editor: What is the real reason Republicans in Congress and President Trump want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and take health care away from millions of people, especially those with pre-existing conditions?
It doesn’t hurt them or cost them anything, since they have top-of-the line insurance through the government. Could it be their hatred for President Obama, as Sen. Mitch McConnell said from the beginning of the Obama administration that they would never work with him or the Democrats in Congress? They don’t care about the American people, only their own ideology.
Trump’s followers should think of the ramifications of his actions and not just listen to his ramblings.
His hatred of Obama has done away with many lifesaving regulations, threatens health care coverage for millions, denies global warming and he believes a tackle shop owner over scientists. His targets include the environment, clean air and water, while instituting tax cuts for the wealthy and targeting Medicare and Social Security. Taxpayers, meanwhile, pay more for consumer products because of his tariffs.
He is friendly with dictators but hostile to our allies. If he doesn’t like critics he tries to ban them from his social media account. Eventually, this will catch up with his followers but it might be too late. Our world will never be the same because of him.
Sorry to say, Democratic presidential candidates and the new Democratic members in Congress are defeating themselves unless they stop bickering and blaming each other and start saying how they will win in 2020. If not, there will be another four years of Trump’s America.

Trump says HE’ll likely commute Blagojevich sentence

Texto completo: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as they flew back to Washington from El Paso, Texas, the president hinted he was open to giving Blagojevich, 62, a break, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
"In the last hour of the flight, POTUS came back to the press cabin for a 45-minute off-the-record conversation. He then said the press could put one part on the record — that he is again considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich," the pool report said.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, misstating Blagojevich’s sentence.
"He’s been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happens — over a phone call which he shouldn’t have said what he said, but it was braggadocio you would say. I would think that there have been many politicians — I’m not one of them, by the way — that have said a lot worse over the telephone."
The New York Times’ Maggic Haberman tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.
In June 2018, Trump broached the possibility of freeing Blagojevich, suggesting the one-time "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant was convicted for "being stupid."
Wife Patti Blagojevich has waged a focused campaign — primarily in FOX News appearances and through social media — to appeal to Trump for clemency, the Sun-Times reported.
"His wife I think is fantastic, and I’m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly. I think it’s enough, seven years," Trump said.
Contacted by a Sun-Times reporter late Wednesday, Patti Blagojevich was surprised to hear of the president’s comments but declined to comment.
Blagojevich is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2024. He currently is serving his sentence in Colorado.
In 2018, Trump first dangled the potential of helping Blagojevich. That prompted seven GOP House members from Illinois to urge the president not to commute the sentence after Trump raised the possibility of clemency.

TONI MORRISON, 88; Nobel novelist hailed as our 'conscience'

Texto completo: Toni Morrison was a single mother of two, with the age of 40 looming, when she sat down at her kitchen table to write her first book.
"The Bluest Eye" was a different kind of novel by a different kind of African-American writer, the tale of a young black girl raped by her father and fixated on white child star Shirley Temple, a reflection on the evils of racism and repressed rage.
Morrison, who died Monday night at the age of 88, used her 1970 debut as a springboard to a long, storied and unlikely career, staking her claim as one of the nation's most celebrated and revered authors. The ground-breaking writer earned a Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988 and became the first black woman to capture a Nobel Prize five years later, just two of her many career highlights.
"Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page," said President Obama, one of her many unabashed fans, via Twitter. "Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while."
Morrison died peacefully, surrounded by family and friends, after a brief illness at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, according to her publisher Alfred A. Knopf.
Her recounting of previously untold tales of black life in America were written specifically for African-Americans: A black woman writing about black people for black readers. Yet her books "Song of Solomon" and "Beloved" became universally praised, with the latter becoming a movie starring Oprah Winfrey and directed by Oscar-winner Jonathan Demme.
"Beloved" spent a staggering 25 weeks on The New York Times best-seller list, and was the first in a trilogy of books completed by "Jazz" and "Paradise."
The Swedish academy, in giving her the Nobel Prize for her body of work, hailed her use of language and "visionary force" in her work.
"She was our conscience," said Winfrey via Twitter. "Our seer. Our truth-teller. She was a magician with language, who understood the power of words. She used them to roil us, to wake us, to educate us and help us grapple with our deepest wounds and to try to comprehend them.
"She was the Empress Supreme among writers. Long may her WORDS reign!"
Obama presented Morrison with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and her 1977 breakthrough novel "Song of Solomon" won the National Book Critics Circle Award.
But her journey to the upper echelon of modern literature was a somewhat late-in-life ascent, starting with her decision - at the urging of her future Knopf editor Robert Gottlieb - to choose between editing the work of others or writing her own. Across the next half-century, her rise continued as the author with the graying dreadlocks and warm voice became one of America's esteemed and admired authors.
Winfrey, who played the escaped slave Sethe in "Beloved," helped spread the word about the brilliant writer, touting four of her novels for Oprah's book club with its massive legion of followers.
Fellow African-American female author Terry McMillan, whose books include best sellers "Waiting to Exhale" and "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," recalled Morrison as both mentor and friend.
"Ms. Morrison changed my life," she tweeted. "Over and over and over. She squeezed my hands. Told me to tell my stories my way ... And don't be afraid of anything. I am grateful for the stories she told about us, black women."
Morrison once recalled the incomparable feeling that accompanied the Nobel Prize.
"Nobody was going to take that and make it into something else," she declared. "I felt representational. I felt Ohioan. I felt blacker than ever. I felt more woman than ever. I felt all of that, put all that together, and went out and had a good time."
Her most recent book, "God Help the Child," was published in 2015. And she was the subject of an acclaimed documentary this year, "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am."
"For me, Toni has been a treasured collaborator, a monumental inspiration and, most importantly, a cherished friend," said Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, director of the documentary. "We will all miss her, but the gifts she left us - her written works that have transformed so many lives around the world - live on to educate, empower and nourish us."
Morrison was born Chloe Wofford, one of four children of an Ohio welder and his domestic worker wife. Encouraged by her parents to read and to think independently, Morrison became a high school honors student before attending Howard University, where she met and married Jamaican architect Harold Morrison. The couple had two children, Harold and Slade.
Morrison became a teacher at Howard, but soon became disillusioned and left for an editor's job for Random House. After working on books by Muhammad Ali and activists like Black Panther leader Huey Newton and Angela Davis, she finally decided to do her own writing.
Morrison wound up teaching for year at Princeton University before her retirement in 2006, splitting time at a riverfront home in Rockland County and an apartment in lower Manhattan.
Morrison, with the closing line of her Nobel Prize address, typically provided the perfect epitaph for her unparalleled life.
"We die," said Morrison. "That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives."

At Target, what's old is new again

Texto completo: It all started in 1999 with a playful little teapot with a red whistle at the spout.
Some critics wondered if the masses would appreciate it as "good design," especially in places like Peoria. The teakettle, designed by postmodern architect Michael Graves for Target, didn't immediately fly off the shelves. But soon, it became a hot seller, along with other items like a toilet bowl brush and a chess set, and the concept of design partnerships took off.
Others retailers have copied the idea to varying degrees of success. But two decades later, the high-low design collaboration remains one of the hallmarks of Target and has cemented its reputation as a purveyor of cheap-chic goods.
Target has done more than 175 of them -- some big multiyear ones, others small and for a limited time -- since first linking up with Graves.
Some have been so popular that they crashed its website. Remember Missoni in 2011 or Lilly Pulitzer in 2015?
Others have had a more tepid reception, ending up on the clearance rack, but still made headlines. Think the partnership with Neiman Marcus that flopped back in 2012.
Now Target is celebrating the 20th anniversary of that first collaboration by reissuing iconic pieces from 20 previous partnerships, including Graves, Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer as well as Philippe Starck, Isaac Mizrahi, Anna Sui and Jason Wu.
The anniversary collection, which will hit stores and its website on Sept. 14, will include nearly 300 items priced from $7 to $160, with most items under $50.
The company won't reveal the actual pieces that will be part of the collection for another couple weeks to build up the anticipation.
Target also has commissioned a book and documentary about its 20 years of democratizing design that will be released this fall, and the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York City will have an exhibit about it, too.
While these design collaborations were an important ingredient in Target's ascent 20 years ago when they were still more of a novelty, executives and experts alike say they continue to be just as crucial, if not more so, to Target today.
"They're these periodic 'wow' moments that are so true to the brand," said Target CEO Brian Cornell. "The reaction it leads to from the guest -- they love those moments. It's a reminder we bring this element of style that's accessible and affordable to guests across the country."
While they're not a big enough piece of Target's overall business to make or break a quarter, he said they help drive awareness of Target, traffic to its stores and its website, and keep the brand on trend.
In 1999 when Target first partnered with Graves, the chain was still adding hundreds of stores and expanding to other parts of the country. It was a $21 billion retailer with 851 stores in 41 states. Its main competitors were Kmart, which was then known for its blue-light specials, and Walmart, which was all about everyday low prices.
The design collaborations helped further distinguish Target from that pack at that time, said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail.
"They elevated what a big-box mass retailer was all about," she said. "It wasn't only about low prices. It was this notion that even if you are potentially lower income you were worthy of good design. That was a very big statement and a differentiating position for a popular-priced retailer to take in those days."
Today, Target has matured, its growth has slowed and it is opening far fewer stores. It's a $75 billion company with 1,853 stores in all 50 states. But the competition has gotten more fierce with more retailers selling many of the same items -- and not just in stores, but also online, led by Amazon, said Liebmann.
"We see in our research how shoppers are willing to buy anything anywhere," she said. "Today, differentiation and expecting more is more important than ever before."
The seeds of Target's first design partnership with Graves were planted, curiously enough, during the restoration of the Washington Monument in the late 1990s.
Target, which had contributed $6 million to the project, asked Graves to design the scaffolding. Graves was 64 years old at the time, a renowned architect and designer who lived in Princeton, New Jersey, but who had little name recognition outside of certain circles.
A Target executive had told Graves, "We've been knocking you off for years," Graves said to the New York Times at the time. "So why not go right to the source?"
That young Target executive, a vice president in home decor, was Ron Johnson, who went on to have a high-profile career as head of Apple's retail stores and short-lived stint as CEO of J.C. Penney.
The idea of such a partnership wasn't completely new. Kmart had already hooked up with Martha Stewart on a line of sheets and towels. But the difference was that Target knew that Graves was a not a celebrity many would know.
Graves' initial collection of 150 kitchenware items was so successful that it was soon expanded to more than 500 items. It went on to be one of Target's longest-running design partnerships, sunsetting in 2013, two years before Graves died.
It was followed by other collaborations with designers such as Philippe Starck, who re-imagined baby products; Todd Oldham, who tackled dorm accessories; and Isaac Mizrahi, who offered womenswear. Makeup artist Sonia Kashuk's partnership with Target is still going strong.
In later years, Target managed to tap up-and-coming designers such as Proenza Schouler and Joseph Altuzarra before they hit the big time as well as more well-known brands such as Hunter.
These days, most of Target's partnerships tend to be for a limited time. The more popular ones, such as Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer, can lead to such frenzies that stores are mostly sold out within hours. Its most recent collection with Vineyard Vines sold out online within a day.
Now that Target in the past few years has refreshed its portfolio of private-label brands, such as its blockbuster kids' clothing line Cat & Jack, the design partnerships also have the added benefit of bringing more attention to its other new in-house brands, said Carol Spieckerman, a retail consultant.
"The overall effect is to freshen up the floor and take away some of the predictability that was beginning to plague Target," she said.

Texto completo: Paul Krugman has lost it.
Yes, the Nobel prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist has been declining toward hackery and absurdity for years, between his notorious pronunciation that the internet would have no impact on the economy, his promise that markets would “never recover” if President Trump won election, and his blog post blaming Sarah Palin for the attempted assassination of a Democratic congresswoman. Nonetheless, many on the Left have continued to view Krugman as a legitimate writer and thinker. But after his latest insanity, even liberals might stop taking him seriously.
In a Monday Times column entitled “Trump, Tax Cuts and Terrorism,” Krugman hit a new low. He opens the piece by directly blaming Republicans for terrorism. Its first line reads: “Why has the Republican Party become a systematic enabler of terrorism?”
Krugman says the GOP is an “enabler” of terrorism because, in the wake of the tragic mass shooting carried out by an apparent white supremacist in El Paso, Texas, most Republicans continue to support Trump. Krugman writes that Trump “has arguably done more to promote racial violence than any American since Nathan Bedford Forrest, who helped found the Ku Klux Klan.”
Basically, anyone who disagrees with Krugman’s party is fine with terrorism, or something. And Trump is a Nazi.
This is absurd on many levels. For one, Trump immediately denounced the violence in a presidential address, and directly condemned white supremacy and violence by name. His speech did contain some silliness about video games causing violence, but as my Washington Examiner colleague Tiana Lowe noted, Trump largely did “what a leader must do — name and shame the enemy and the evil empowering their violence.”
So while there are certainly fair criticisms to be made of the president’s record on race, the argument that he is in anyway to blame for this violence, much less that his supporters condone it, is completely unsubstantiated and patently absurd. In fact, Krugman’s disturbing accusations white wash the horrible crimes of the El Paso shooter (who I will not name) by blaming his horrendous actions, in part, on other people.
Krugman doesn’t stop there. He goes on to essentially argue that many Republicans are racist “economic radicals” who value money over human life:
In effect, then, the Republican Party decided that a few massacres were an acceptable price to pay in return for tax cuts … So as I said at the beginning, the G.O.P. has become a systematic enabler of terrorism. Why? Follow the money.
This is disgraceful, absurd, and insulting. In the wake of the El Paso shooting, elected Republicans and conservative commentators across the board have almost all vigorously denounced white nationalism and violence. Have they, at times in the past, overlooked the unsavory views of some people on the conservative fringes or defended questionable comments by Republican officials? Certainly. But the implication that anyone in the conservative mainstream condones racist violence is intellectually dishonest and untrue.
This latest batch of absurd, bad-faith smears reveals what we already knew about Krugman: He just can’t accept the fact that millions of well-intentioned, intelligent people disagree with him on complex matters of public policy and politics. The liberal economist thinks anyone who disagrees with him is both racist and bought off, such a sell-out that they value conservative economic policy over the lives of their fellow Americans.
Krugman’s worldview is, at its core, deranged. And his latest proclamation about the GOP will prove just as wrong as the rest.

La estricta Nueva York no escapa a los tiroteos masivos: 521 baleados este año, cifra en alza

Texto completo: Aunque los funcionarios de Nueva York condenaron pronto las nuevas masacres de civiles baleados en ataques al azar en otros estados del país el fin de semana, la ciudad tiene su propio problema de violencia armada.
Es cierto que el crimen de Nueva York está en niveles mínimos, pero ello no implica que no haya necesidad de controlar las armas.
Hace apenas unos días, el 27 de julio, un tiroteo masivo en una fiesta comunitaria en Brownsville (Brooklyn) dejó a una persona muerta y 11 heridos. Y la madrugada de ayer, en una vigilia en Crown Heights, cuatro personas más resultaron heridas de bala.
En el ínterin, el gobernador Andrew Cuomo firmó una ley que desde septiembre subirá de 3 a 30 días el período para tramitar un permiso de armas en Nueva York.
Específicamente en NYC, hay un auge de las pandillas violentas y varios inocentes han sido alcanzados por balas perdidas desde principios de junio en toda la ciudad, seis de ellos menores de edad.
Hasta el 28 de julio, 521 personas habían recibido disparos este año en la ciudad de Nueva York, en 441 incidentes, según la policía. Ello indica un alza frente a 501 personas disparadas en 413 incidentes en el mismo período en 2018.
Los disparos no se extienden de manera uniforme por toda la ciudad. Algunos recintos en Queens y Manhattan no han reportado ningún tiroteo este año. Otros han sumado muchos.
En el distrito 79 del Norte de Brooklyn, que incluye a Bedford-Stuyvesant, 24 personas han recibido disparos este año, incluidas las de la fiesta el 27 de julio donde los investigadores dijeron que varias víctimas tenían vínculos con pandillas.
Inmediatamente después de ese ataque en Brownsville, Eric Adams, presidente del condado de Brooklyn y otros más, pidieron que el hecho se etiquetara como un tiroteo masivo.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio inicialmente se resistió a llamarlo así, pero luego sí usó el término, destacó The New York Times.
“Nos hemos vuelto insensibles a la violencia armada en ciertas partes de la ciudad”, comentó Adams ayer. “Once personas en Park Avenue en Manhattan, es un tiroteo masivo y una crisis. Once personas baleadas en Park Place en Brooklyn, es un día (normal) en el vecindario”.
¿Cómo se compara el estado de Nueva York con otros en términos de leyes de armas?
Nueva York tiene una calificación A del “Giffords Law Center” para prevenir la violencia armada. El centro clasifica a Nueva York en el 6to de los 50 estados por la fuerza de sus leyes sobre armas, y el 48 de los 50 por tener una de las tasas más bajas de muertes por armas.
El Centro destaca que existe una correlación directa entre leyes más estrictas sobre armas y menos muertes. Pero los grupos pro derechos de armas creen que estas leyes penalizan a propietarios que son respetuosos de la ley.
¿Cuáles son las leyes de armas de Nueva York?
Después del tiroteo masivo en la escuela primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut en 2012, el estado de Nueva York impulsó leyes más estrictas sobre armas (The Safe Act).
Esas reglas requieren que las armas de asalto se registren cada cinco años con la policía estatal, y hacen que las verificaciones sean obligatorias. en un esfuerzo por evitar que las personas con antecedentes penales graves o enfermedades mentales compren armas.
¿Cuántos delitos se cometen con armas de fuego en el estado de Nueva York?
El año pasado, hubo 7,885 crímenes violentos cometidos con armas de fuego en Nueva York, según cifras estatales. Más de 4,200 de esos crímenes ocurrieron en los cinco distritos de la ciudad de Nueva York, con pistolas como principal arma.
Muchas de las armas usadas en esos crímenes no son de acá. Según la Fiscalía general del estado, llegan a Nueva York desde lugares que no tienen leyes tan estrictas como las locales.
While gun control advocates view no single measure as a cure-all, they see tightening background checks as one of the most basic steps to diminish gun violence. Most Americans support such efforts, polls show, but the NRA portrays them as an affront to the Second Amendment.

Texto completo: Un nuevo reporte deja en evidencia la relación entre la retórica que maneja el presidente Donald Trump y las palabras del asesino de El Paso consignadas en el manifesto que dejó antes del tiroteo.
La investigación de The Hill concluyó que la campaña del presidente Trump ha colocado miles de anuncios en Facebook desde enero de este año advirtiendo de una “invasión” en la frontera sur de Estados Unidos.
Los más de 2000 anuncios se publicaron entre enero y mayo y muestran cómo la campaña del presidente se ha aprovechado de un lenguaje que los críticos califican de racista y xenófobo para obtener apoyo político.
“La crisis en la frontera sur es aún peor de lo que la mayoría entiende”, dice un anuncio, publicado por primera vez en enero.
“Hice MÚLTIPLES viajes a la frontera para mostrar la verdadera invasión que ocurre, pero los demócratas y los medios de comunicación falsos simplemente no me escuchan” .
El uso de la palabra “invasión”, ha sido objeto de duras críticas en los últimos días después de que apareció en un manifiesto escrito por el asesino de El Paso, Texas. Patrick Crusius supuestamente escribió que el ataque, que mató a 22 personas, fue una respuesta a una “invasión hispana de Texas”.
El uso repetido de la campaña de Trump de la palabra “invasión” en los anuncios de Facebook fue informado por primera vez por The New York Times el lunes.
Otro anuncio de la campaña de Trump, publicado por primera vez en Facebook en febrero, acusa a los demócratas de no negociar de buena fe la financiación del muro fronterizo propuesto por el presidente, diciendo que “LA OBSTRUCCIÓN es mucho más importante para ellos que SU SEGURIDAD”.
“¡Tenemos una INVASIÓN! Entonces estamos CONSTRUYENDO EL MURO para DETENERLO. Los demócratas nos demandarán. ¡Pero queremos un PAÍS SEGURO! ”, Dice el anuncio.
La campaña de Trump ha invertido millones de dólares en publicidad digital, particularmente en Facebook, y los datos del sitio de redes sociales muestran que los anuncios que usan la palabra “invasión” representan solo una pequeña fracción del total de anuncios comprados por la campaña, reportó The Hill.
Según datos de la firma digital demócrata Bully Pulpit Interactive entre el 5 de enero y el 27 de julio, la campaña gastó $8.7 millones en publicidad en Facebook
Además de los anuncios de Facebook, Trump ha mencionado repetidamente una llamada invasión en la frontera sur durante manifestaciones de campaña y en Twitter.

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

Texto completo: Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story misspelled the name of the network provider Cloudflare.
The online message board 8chan, which has been linked to three mass shootings in 2019, will be terminated, Cloudflare announced late Sunday night, just hours after the site's founder called for its end.
Cloudflare cut off services for 8chan at midnight PDT, CEO Matthew Prince said in a statement, though he noted that another network provider could bring 8chan back online. That's what happened in 2017, when Cloudflare booted The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi message board.
"The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths," Prince said. "Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit. "
During media interviews earlier Sunday, 8chan founder Fredrick Brennan called for the imageboard's end.
El Paso Walmart shooting: Quiet Texas neighborhood stunned by connection to El Paso shooting suspect
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the New York Times on Sunday. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it. ”
Founded as an alternative to the more well-known 4chan message board, 8chan, or "Infinite Chan," has nearly 20,000 public boards. The website's welcome is, "Welcome to 8chan, the Darkest Reaches of the Internet. "
Many of the posts that could be quickly accessed prior to the website's termination included offensive images and language.
Saturday's shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which left at least 20 dead and more than a dozen injured, is the latest with a link to the website. The suspected gunman has been charged with capital murder and the crime is being investigated as a possible hate crime after the discovery of a racist manifesto on 8chan.
The death toll in the El Paso shooting increased to 22 on Monday. There are now 24 wounded.
In March, a New Zealand man posted a lengthy manifesto to Twitter and to 8chan before killing 50 and injuring dozens in a rampage that was live-streamed on Facebook and Twitter.
In April, a shooter posted a manifesto to 8chan before killing one woman and injuring three others at a California synagogue.
The New York Times reported 8chan, "remained on the fringes until 2014, when some supporters of GamerGate – a loose reactionary collection of anti-feminist video gamers – flocked to 8chan after being kicked off 4chan.
By Sunday evening, the shooter's alleged manifesto was still circulating on 8chan.
A 'venomous' website for 'extremist hate'
In interviews with the Washington Post and the New York Times, Brennan said 8chan needs to be shut down. He gave up control of the website to Army veteran Jim Watkins in 2015, both newspapers reported.
“The board is a receptive audience for domestic terrorists," Brennan told the Post.
The Washington Post called the website "one of the Web’s most venomous refuges for extremist hate. "
One anonymous 8chan user, for example, praised the El Paso shooting in a thread, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a news release.
“The motive and the manifesto have not been named the entire day. There weren’t even speculations. They are f------ SCARED. ”
'But this isn't the end'
In a message at the top of its website, 8chan states, "only content that violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other United States laws is deleted," from the imageboard and warns users that posts and boards are user-created and "do not represent the opinions of the 8chan administration. "
Brennan told the Post that 8chan is a "vanity project" for Watkins that doesn't make much money. He also told the newspaper the website's servers are distributed around the world, which makes it difficult to take down.
It has also been protected from web-based attacks by Cloudflare, according to the Post. Cloudflare lawyer Douglas Kramer told the Post he worried dropping 8chan's protection would encourage "cyber vigilantism. "
In its termination statement, Cloudflare said it feels uncomfortable "playing the role of content arbitrator" but called on technology companies to work with lawmakers on dealing with hate-filled sites.
"There comes a time when enough is enough," Prince said in a tweet with the termination statement. "But this isn't the end. We need to have a broader conversation about addressing the root causes of hate online. "

Texto completo: Empty-nester mom movie "Otherhood" starring Felicity Huffman is finally hitting Netflix.
Pushed back from its original spring release due to the brouhaha surrounding Huffman's involvement in the college admissions scandal, "Otherhood" finally premieres on the streaming service Friday.
The film follows three moms – Huffman as Helen, Angela Bassett as Carol and Patricia Arquette as Gillian – as they struggle being left behind after their adult children begin to lead their own lives.
The friends don't quite know how to handle things now that they're "others" instead of mothers. The three women pack up and surprise their sons – who forget them on Mother's Day! – with a visit to New York.
"You know who you are without me," Carol tells her son. "I need to figure out who I am without you. "
Here's what you should know about "Otherhood," and where Huffman's legal charges stand right now.
'A heart that is bigger than the sun': Felicity Huffman has been 'humbled' by the college admissions scandal, says Eva Longoria
'Beginning rather than an ending'
In the film, Carol, a widow, decides she needs some time to figure out who she is when she's not a mother, and temporarily moves in with her son Matt (Sinqua Walls), a successful art director. He's not overly happy about it.
The movie is about the mothers' relationships with their sons, their deep friendship with each other, but also with themselves and what they want out of life, said executive producer Cindy Chupack.
"The women need to figure out who they are in this stage beyond motherhood – otherhood – which might be a beginning rather than an ending," Chupack told TV Insider.
Stars speak out on Huffman's scandal
The movie production wrapped before the story broke about the scandal. But more recently her co-stars praised how Huffman handled being accused of paying $15,000 to have her daughter's SAT answers corrected.
While doing press for the movie, Arquette said she believes her co-star is "sincerely truly sorry. "
"I think she dealt with it the best way that you can deal with it, but I know she's probably carrying a lot of shame and guilt," Arquette told Entertainment Tonight.
Bassett told The New York Times, "We all make mistakes. None of us is perfect. I think Felicity handled these unfortunate circumstances in a mature, responsible way. She held herself accountable and didn’t make excuses for her decisions, and I can only respect that. "
Before the scandal broke, Huffman shared her thoughts with Entertainment Tonight on being a mother on the set of "Otherhood" and said that done right, "you work yourself right out of a job. "
"If you do it badly and you've damaged your kids enough they're going to need you your whole life," Huffman said.
What's the status of Huffman's legal case in the college admissions scandal?
In May, a tearful Huffman pleaded guilty to charges in the nation's largest college admissions scandal, becoming the highest-profile defendant to admit to crimes in the blockbuster case. She is scheduled to be sentenced September 13 in federal court in Boston.
The 56-year-old actress pleaded to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud for paying $15,000 to have someone secretly and illegally correct her older daughter’s SAT answers. As part of the plea deal, federal prosecutors recommended she get a four-month prison sentence, substantially lower than the maximum of 20 years the charges carry.

A tale of Zorro and Little St. Jeff's

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character -- the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.

Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist -- and now accused sex trafficker -- is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."

Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name.

The carriers of Epstein's apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn't be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers.

Instead, according to the Times' reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.

For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein's special black book.

The male invitees weren't your run-of-the-mill scientists but some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia.

Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual imposter."

Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks.

To the layman's eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker's comfort.

Epstein was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation.

But he wasn't convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.

Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary.

Gods don't like to be contradicted and Pinker was thereafter told he'd been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.

Speaking of which, Epstein's private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs "Little St. Jeff's" — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week.

Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall.

What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh's headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein's remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen.

Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. He is a perversely tragic figure.

Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable.

Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind, he forgot that he was mortal and may have flown too close to the sun.

Confined now to a jail cell — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries -- his suffering must be immense.

And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: Moments after the United States women's soccer team won the World Cup last month, Nike released a bracing commercial celebrating the championship as a triumph of female empowerment.
"We will keep fighting not just to make history, but to change it, forever!" the ad's narrator says as a crowd of voices bursts into the ubiquitous "I believe that we will win" cheer.
The impeccably timed and beautifully crafted spot was an implicit endorsement by Nike of players who are suing the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay, a particularly expedient position for a company that recently had been accused of gender discrimination by both sponsored athletes and employees.
After withering criticism from runners it had once sponsored, Nike announced in May that its contracts no longer would include performance-pay reductions that effectively penalized female runners for becoming pregnant. Allyson Felix, an Olympic gold medalist who went public with her dispute with Nike over maternity coverage, recently was signed by Athleta.
Nike also is fighting a class-action lawsuit filed by two former employees who have accused to company of gender bias in pay, career development and other aspects of work. And last year, at least 11 Nike executives were forced out after an investigation into complaints of harassment and other inappropriate behavior.
Only three months ago, a Nike vice president said she feared the company was "sliding back into old muscle memory."
In a statement to The New York Times last month in response to questions about the soccer commercial and the equal pay fight, Nike noted its broad support of women's soccer -- it sponsored 14 of the 24 teams in the recent World Cup -- and of women's sports in general.
"We are proud to draw from the incredible momentum for women's sports today to serve the next generation of female athletes," said Nike, which paid $ 27 million last year to sponsor U.S. Soccer.
As the United States women's soccer team embarks on its World Cup victory tour, the fight over equal pay is only intensifying. Last week U.S. Soccer released a fact sheet that claimed women's national team players actually had earned more than their men's counterparts over the past decade; a spokeswoman for the players disputed the federation's math, calling U.S. Soccer's calculations "utterly false."
As the sides prepare to enter mediation over the gender discrimination lawsuit, the players and their union know how influential sponsors will be. "Sponsors are incredibly huge because they put a lot more pressure than we are able to on U.S. Soccer," Alex Morgan, a team captain, said in an interview. "Especially the sponsors that are already partners with U.S. Soccer."
Nike is not the only U.S. Soccer sponsor to embrace the players' equality campaign, a broadly popular effort that inspired chants of "equal pay" from fans inside the stadium at the World Cup final and later at the team's victory parade.
The campaign comes at a time when consumers want corporations to make public stands on social and political issues.
"More than ever, corporations are expected to reflect the values of their customers," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies corporations and civil rights. But he cautioned that, ultimately, corporate decisions are driven by money, not beliefs.
"I don't think we would see businesses wading into the political thicket if they didn't think it was in their interests," Winkler said.
Just before the World Cup, for example, Visa announced a five-year sponsorship agreement with U.S. Soccer that was applauded by some soccer fans because Visa executives claimed more than half of the money would support women's soccer. Sheerin Salimi, a Visa spokeswoman, said the split was written into the contract.
Chris Curtin, Visa's chief brand officer, said the company was not necessarily trying to address thorny issues with sponsorship dollars, but rather was "attempting to articulate who we are as a company and what we stand for as a brand."
Visa's sponsorship is an anomaly. The negotiations coincided with the equal pay debate (and litigation), leading to the unusual step of formalizing how a sponsor's money would be spent, with U.S. Soccer acceding to close the deal.
Nike and Visa's entrance into the equal pay debate stands out, because U.S. Soccer sponsors generally want to avoid taking public stances on contentious issues. Several other federation sponsors -- Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson and Continental Tire -- did not respond to requests for comment, and another, the watchmaker Tag Heuer, declined to comment. Volkswagen said it believed in "equality, inclusion and access," and AT&T said the company had "clearly communicated our position that we expect players to be equally compensated" to U.S. Soccer.
Matthew Kohan, a Budweiser spokesman, said the company did not plan to renegotiate its contract with U.S. Soccer soon; its deal expires in a few years. He added that most of its sponsorship contracts contain incentive-based compensation, and so Budweiser was paying the women for winning the World Cup, though he would not reveal the amount.
"There are still plenty of businesses sitting on the sidelines, that think the best thing is to stay quiet, to stay out of hot-button controversies," said Winkler.
And then there is Secret, the women's deodorant brand of the consumer goods conglomerate Procter & Gamble. Secret became a U.S. Soccer sponsor on March 4, emphasizing women's strength and teamwork. Four days later, the players filed their lawsuit, and 10 days after that Secret introduced a commercial supporting equal pay that featured Morgan and other players.
Secret said that it had been working on the commercial for nine months and that the timing was coincidental. The timing was not coincidental the next time Secret talked about the issue.
One week after the United States won the World Cup, Secret bought a full-page ad in The Times announcing that it would donate $ 529,000 -- $ 23,000 for each of the 23 players on the roster -- to the national team's players association. The ad announcing the donation criticized U.S. Soccer directly, urging it to be on "the right side of history."
So why did Secret partner with U.S. Soccer only to criticize it months later?
Sarah Black, a Secret spokeswoman, said in a statement that its deal with the federation does not mandate equal pay, and that it was in discussions with U.S. Soccer about its sponsorship, which lasts through 2019.
"We were compelled to join the players to help create long-term change," Black said. "And to create real change, we knew we needed to not only use our brand voice and our platform for progress, but also put our money where our mouth is in a public way."
Nike, the soccer federation's top corporate benefactor has yet to wade that deeply into the debate.
The company has a long history of savvy campaigns about women's sports, said Steve Papson, a professor at St. Lawrence University who wrote a book about Nike's advertising. He pointed to the company's lauded 1995 "If You Let Me Play" commercial, which was released as substantial opportunities to sell athletic shoes to young women emerged.
"It positioned themselves right then and there as supporters of women in sports," said Papson, adding that "it didn't hurt themselves in terms of the marketplace."

Texto completo: In his recent testimony on Capitol Hill, former special counsel Robert S. Mueller issued a warning that echoed the 1966 movie comedy, "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" Except he wasn’t joking. Far from it.
"Over the course of my career," said the longtime FBI director, "I have seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government’s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious."
So how did President Donald Trump and his acolytes respond? By denying and denouncing the unvarnished truth Mueller had stated. By plunging their heads deeply into the sands of self-delusion. Within days of Mueller’s appearance, Trump had engineered the departure of Dan Coats, his director of national intelligence, who had earned a reputation for courageous candor by refuting the president’s prejudices and emphasizing Moscow’s malign machinations.
Every Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee signed a bipartisan report documenting the "growing volume of malicious activity" targeted at U.S. election systems. And while the senior Republican, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said some progress has been made in protecting those systems, "There is still much work that remains to be done."
At the same time, practical bipartisan legislation aimed at bolstering the ability of election officials to ward off Soviet subversion was blocked by the Senate’s Republican leader and Trump’s Chief Enabler, Mitch McConnell.
Trump’s relentless refusal to acknowledge Russia’s role in his victory symbolizes a much larger flaw in his approach to the presidency: rejecting any information that contradicts his view of the world. Take just one example: After his intelligence chief Dan Coats testified last January that Iran was living up to their nuclear agreements, an enraged president tweeted that his own intelligence team should "go back to school." Then he added: "They are wrong!"
There it is. Pure Trump. I am right and they are wrong. And that approach makes rational decision-making and problem-solving impossible.
How can the nation respond to the tocsins tolled by Mueller, Coats, Burr and Wray (Republicans all) if there are no accepted facts, no common basis for deliberation, no respect for the professional researchers and analysts whose life works are to study, measure and describe reality? The answer is clear. America cannot respond and the public knows it. In the latest ABC/Ipsos poll, only 17% said they were "very confident" that "the U.S. can effectively defend itself" from foreign intrusions into next year’s campaign.
It’s entirely appropriate for lawmakers to disagree on policies and priorities. But the whole process of decision-making is severely crippled when those lawmakers cannot even agree on the nature of the problem they are trying to solve. As Douglas Wise, a former CIA officer and deputy head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told The New York Times: "Intelligence has to be candid, truthful and accurate even if it is unpleasant and does not confirm to the biases of the president."
The Russians are indeed coming. And Trump is not building a wall to keep them out. He’s opening a door to invite them in.

What playing guitar with 3 missing strings did to my creativity

Texto completo: When those strings were off, I could no longer rely on the patterns I knew. I was forced to solve musical problems in totally different ways. As a result, my creativity didn't crumble ... it soared.
Studying jazz guitar in college, I had a professor that would force me to remove strings from the instrument.
One, two, sometimes three strings had to be removed before I attempted a performance.
You might guess that gutting half of my available resources would crush my ability to play, let alone be creative.
Yet a surprising and counterintuitive thing happened. When those strings were off, I could no longer rely on the patterns I knew. I was forced to solve musical problems in totally different ways. As a result, my creativity didn't crumble ... it soared.
Nearly all of us are faced with some form of limited resources. There's never enough time, capital, bandwidth, talent, facility space, or raw materials.
But those resource-constrained situations can help us unlock of our gifts of inventive thinking. When we are forced to solve problems in radically new ways, we make up for the lack of external resources with our internal resource of human creativity.
The concept of a "forced handicap" is not new:
Athletes train with ankle weights, in high altitude climates, which helps push their capacity to new levels.
Teams often perform at their best when coming from behind, with just a few minutes left on the clock.
Inventors discover breakthrough when their back is to the wall, under poor conditions and dwindling resources.
If more resources equated to more creativity, the federal government would be the most imaginative organization on the planet while startups would be the most rigid and bureaucratic.
Yet just the opposite occurs — constricted resources serve as a creative catalyst.
What would the notion of "removing strings" look like for you? What forced limitations could you implement in order to unshackle your imagination?
If you normally have a week to tackle a certain type of challenge, how would your team perform if they only had a three-hour sprint? What would you do to keep new customers calling if your marketing budget was cut by 85%?
If you had to deliver on your quarterly targets with only half your team size, how would you shift roles and responsibilities in order to achieve the objective?
The next time frustration sets in around a lack of fresh ideas, try removing — not adding — resources. By changing parameters, you'll uncover new paths of discovery.
So go ahead and jam with just three strings. A beautiful melody of success may soon follow.

When those strings were off, I could no longer rely on the patterns I knew. I was forced to solve musical problems in totally different ways. As a result, my creativity didn't crumble ... it soared.

Texto completo: Arizona Democrats will matter in this year's presidential election because, unlike past years when Arizona's electoral votes were predictably in the Republican column, that is no longer the case.
While the GOP winning margin was 8% in 2008 and 2012, in 2016 the difference declined to less than 4%. And last year Arizona Democrats won a U.S. Senate race, two statewide races, and gained ground from Nogales to Page.
So, Arizona is competitive.
Indeed, Arizona may even prove to be a key swing state on the national map. The target states Democrats must flip to win in 2020 are Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. All were won by Trump in 2016, yet three of the four elected a Democratic governor last year. But Democrats need a cushion, and the next two closest states Trump won are North Carolina and Arizona.
This means that Arizona Democrats shoulder a larger responsibility in making their choice this year.
While it's tempting to fall in love with candidates who meet every aspirational ideal, this year we must apply a different — more pragmatic — standard. Can they win Arizona? Because it may determine who wins the White House.
There are multiple theories that address this question.
Are lessons to be learned from past Democratic statewide winners like Bruce Babbitt, Dennis DeConcini or Janet Napolitano? The recent successful campaigns of Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and education chief Kathy Hoffman? Or — given that we are talking about federal issues — of Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema?
These were notably center-left campaigns that all successfully captured disaffected moderate GOP voters and a super-majority of independents.
Progressive Democrats make a different case that a more ideologically pure candidate will ignite record turnout of new voters that will make the difference on election night. This is the "vote-for" argument.
This was the theory of David Garcia's courageous campaign for governor last year. He and Sinema were both good candidates with much to offer, but the electoral difference between them was a significant 15 points.
And a major reason was that many of these GOP and independent swing voters were available to Sinema but not for Garcia. Their respective campaign strategies reflected this.
This year the tri-partisan Sinema "coalition" is definitely available to a Democratic presidential nominee.
Yet the policy discourse in the Democratic primary campaign has focused on Medicare for all, more open borders, health care for immigrants, free college, reparations for African-Americans, a federal $15-hour minimum wage and other aspirational (and expensive) issues.
The Democratic left is looking to use this platform to primary centrist candidates across the country. And President Trump is skillfully making "the Squad" — and socialism — the face of the national Democratic party.
Would Senator Sinema have carried Arizona on this platform?
Consider 2018 national results. Democrats flipped 40 congressional seats and governorships in the presidential battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Mexico and North Carolina, as well as in Louisiana, Kansas and Montana — states where Trump won by margins of 15% to 20%.
The New York Times interviewed many of these successful governors who expressed deep concern with the ideological drift of the presidential race.
Democrats are right to make the case that our economy isn't working for most Americans; that the wealth gap is strangling opportunity; that power and wealth rig the system — both economic and political — and that health care is a right inherent to all Americans.
But Democrats are smart to seek a nominee that can win in the Midwest as well as in Arizona.
They need to make this case to a friendly audience, rather than a re-elected — and greatly emboldened — President Trump.

Going back to work after loss Like Meghan McCain, many women quietly return to jobs after suffering miscarriage

Texto completo: What do most professional women do after they've had a miscarriage early in the pregnancy? Go back to work, seemingly without skipping a beat, often saying nothing about it.
Meghan McCain, a co-host of "The View," recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, revealing that she'd had a miscarriage. At the time, she went back on the air after missing only a few days.
But, she explained, when you're a daily fixture on national television, even a few days' absence is enough to cause rumors. "I am not hiding anymore," she wrote. "My miscarriage was a horrendous experience and I would not wish it upon anyone."
Neither would I. I've had that experience twice.
My first miscarriage took me completely by surprise. My body had always worked like clockwork, and I'd assumed it would efficiently produce a healthy child. But then the technician explained to my husband and me at our first ultrasound that while I had a gestational sac, there was no embryo inside it.
"Lights on, nobody home" is how I couldn't help thinking about it.
It was a traumatic experience, but also oddly isolating. My husband, Bill, of course, was by my side every moment he could be, but he was also struggling with his own reaction and desperate to know that I would be OK. And so I was determined to be OK, whenever he was around. Alone, in my bathtub, was the only time I let myself cry.
I was determined to be OK around everyone else as well. We hadn't told most people that we were pregnant yet; it's a good idea to wait until you're well into the second trimester, and I was only in the beginning of it. Only the people we were close with knew anything had happened at all, and those who did know didn't seem to know what to say. So nobody said much of anything.
I've always been in love with my career, so I returned to that love as the most logical thing to do. A few days after that first miscarriage, I flew to Chicago for a conference. I never considered canceling. I hadn't planned to tell anyone I was pregnant, so it seemed just as easy not to say anything about the miscarriage.
Back home that weekend, Bill's son and daughter-in-law were having a christening for a child of their own. They had started having babies in their 20s. Bill is older than me, and I had married him at 40. That meant we were starting, or attempting to start, our family late in life, when he was already a grandfather.
Being in my 40s added an extra layer of shame to the whole event. It felt like my own fault for having hesitated too long.
It didn't occur to anyone, not even Bill, that I might not want to go celebrate someone else's baby. When I suggested that I stay home, his reaction was enough to convince me that I really couldn't say no. So I put on my prettiest dress and my best smile and went through the whole day acting as though nothing was wrong.
Afterward, I learned that some family members had asked Bill how I was doing. I kind of wish they'd asked me instead. I wouldn't have known what to say, but at least I'd have felt that my miscarriage was a real event, not a ghost occurrence that couldn't even be mentioned.
The second time, after a few more years of trying, the miscarriage came much more quickly. I started spotting less than two weeks after the positive pregnancy test. I'd barely gotten used to the idea that I was having a child when it turned out I wasn't having one after all. By this time I was 45, and I knew I'd lost my last chance to carry a baby to term.
The following week, I headed to New York for yet another conference. For days, I smiled and networked and solved problems and chatted with hundreds of people. Again, I didn't mention that I'd just had a miscarriage.
If I'd managed to have a baby, there would have been a shower and gifts and all the ritual that goes with that. If there had been a death in the family, there would have been another set of rituals to mark that occasion. If I'd had a serious illness, there would have been get-well cards and questions about how I was doing.
For a miscarriage, there is none of that. There is just silence. And an immediate return to what's supposed to be normal life.
McCain equates her miscarriage with losing a baby that she says she'll always love. For myself, I don't quite see it that way. I never felt a kick, or finished picking out a name, or bought a crib, or did any of the things that would make a baby seem truly real. But it was a big loss nonetheless.
Health organizations estimate that there are about one million miscarriages a year in the United States. It's happened to millions and millions of women.
We live in a culture that's good at creating traditions and rituals for nearly every stage of life, from turning 16, to graduation, to a death in the family. Something so common and so devastating deserves to have a ritual of its own. At least, it deserves to be talked about, not met with the bland pretense that nothing at all has happened.
It deserves better than silence.

Ugandan Academic Jailed for Posts Insulting President

Texto completo: KAMPALA, Uganda -- A prominent Ugandan academic has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after being found guilty of cyberharassment for a series of Facebook posts criticizing President Yoweri Museveni, including calling him "a pair of buttocks."
The verdict on Friday against Stella Nyanzi, a university lecturer and researcher, drew the ire of rights activists, who accused the government of using laws about electronic communications to stifle political dissent.
Joan Nyanyuki, director for East Africa at Amnesty International, said, "This verdict is outrageous and flies in the face of Uganda's obligations to uphold the right to freedom of expression." She added that it "demonstrates the depths of the government's intolerance of criticism."
The Computer Misuse Act "has been used systematically to harass, intimidate and stifle government critics," Ms. Nyanyuki added.
The verdict and the sentence should be quashed and Dr. Nyanzi, who has been in jail since November, freed immediately, Amnesty said.
Dr. Nyanzi, who was a research fellow at Makerere University in Kampala, has drawn the government's wrath for her attacks on him and her commentary, laced with profanity, that was posted on her Facebook page and often shared widely.
In 2017, Uganda's top prosecutor sought to use a colonial-era law, once used by the British to quash African resistance, to commit the academic to a mental institution.
It was only the second time in recent memory that the law, the Mental Treatment Act of 1938, had been invoked in a case over free speech, according to lawyers. The first involved a student who was forcibly taken several times to a psychiatric hospital after lampooning the president on social media.
Dr. Nyanzi attended her sentencing session on Friday in a court in the center of Kampala, the capital, via video link from a maximum-security prison by the shores of Lake Victoria on the city's outskirts. She shouted vulgarities and flashed her breasts and a double middle finger on several occasions during the session.
Her conviction stemmed from a Facebook post last year in which she said she wished Mr. Museveni, 74, had been burned up in his mother's birth canal.
Security forces detained Dr. Nyanzi as she left a Rotary Club event in Kampala, where she had given a talk on providing schoolgirls with sanitary pads, a subject over which she has publicly argued with Mr. Museveni's wife, Janet, who is the education minister.
Dr. Nyanzi was held for 18 hours and beaten, her lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, told The New York Times in 2017. She was charged with writing posts that "disturbed the peace, quiet or the right of his privacy of his excellency the president of Uganda Yoweri Kaguta Museveni with no purpose of legitimate communication."
Dr. Nyanzi's Facebook posts contain profanity-laced vitriol about the president and his wife (whom Ms. Nyanzi describes as having a "tiny brain" the size of a sexual organ), as well as academic studies of "Radical Rudeness" and the "Necessity of Political Vulgarity" -- political tactics Ugandans once used to resist British imperialism.
"Know our rich history before you think I am the first fighter with words," Dr. Nyanzi wrote in one post.
She wrote in her most recent post, a poem about her court case: "My presence in your Court as a suspect and prisoner highlights multiple facets of dictatorship. I exposed the entrenchment of autocracy. I refuse to be a mere spectator in the struggle to oust the worst dictator."
Another lawyer for Dr. Nyanzi said she had yet to decide on whether to appeal her conviction.
Critics say that Mr. Museveni is increasingly becoming intolerant of dissent as resistance to his rule grows.
Mr. Museveni, still in power 31 years after setting out as a great hope for African democracy, routinely intimidates dissidents and journalists. Live broadcasts of demonstrations are banned, and social media is blocked during elections that are already deeply flawed.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

'STAR TREK' MOVES FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE; SHOWTIME ANNOUNCES PREMIERE DATES

Texto completo: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - As a prequel series set before the original '60s "Star Trek," CBS All Access' "Star Trek: Discovery" had a built-in canon problem from the start: Why in all of "Star Trek" lore had viewers never heard of Spock's foster sister? Why had fans never heard of a spore drive on a Starfleet ship?
The end of season two - spoilers ahead! - rectified those challenges to established "Star Trek" history when the U.S.S. Discovery jumped 930 years into the future, and those who knew of its existence inside Starfleet swore themselves to secrecy.
When "Discovery" returns for its third season sometime in 2020 - probably after "Star Trek: Picard," which is expected to premiere early next year - "Discovery" will take place in a period of "Star Trek" history viewers have never seen. And executive producer Michelle Paradise says there is no plan to jump backward in time.
"We're there and we're staying there. It does take us beyond canon, but to be clear we honor canon, all that came before us," she said following a CBS Studios press conference Wednesday during the Television Critics Association summer 2019 press tour. "There is a history to the world that we are entering into - all of the shows that have come before, everything that has been established - but we are in fresh snow this season."
That means building the future of the future from scratch.
"What does that mean for just the look and feel of the world? And how do we also maintain what everyone loves about 'Star Trek' in all of that, and everything from what we see on screen, the clothing, the look and feel of the structures," Paradise said. "Certainly at 930 years in the future you would expect that technology is advanced. So that's a lot of the conversations that we've been having: What does the technology look like in addition to the world itself? And the look and feel of ships and all of that."
The season three premiere filmed partially in Iceland to simulate an alien world, and while the show may now be set in the further flung future, the tone is unlikely to change.
"We found what I think is a wonderful mix of heart and character and adventure and fun and funny and action," Paradise said. "I think we really hit our stride with that. . So we fully intend to keep that moving forward even into this new future, whatever it may be."
Showtime news
Showtime announced it has ordered a second season of "City on a Hill" and offered premiere dates for returning series "Shameless" (9 p.m. Nov. 3), "Kidding" (10 p.m. Nov. 3), "Ray Donovan" (8 p.m. Nov. 17), spinoff series "The L Word: Generation Q" (10 p.m. Dec. 8) and the final season of "Homeland" (9 p.m. Feb. 9).
New comedy "Back to Life," about a British woman (Daisy Haggard, "Episodes") who returns home after 18 years in prison, debuts at 8:30 p.m. Oct. 6.
Abby McEnany stars in "Work in Progress" (11 p.m. Dec. 8), executive produced by Lilly Wachowski ("Sends8"), as a Chicago lesbian "whose misfortune and despair unexpectedly lead her to a vibrantly transformative relationship."
Docuseries "Couples Therapy" (10 p.m. Sept. 6) follows four couples in weekly therapy sessions.
Showtime gave a series commitment to a scripted drama based on this summer's New York Times nonfiction best-seller "Three Women" by Lisa Taddeo, "a portrait of erotic longing in today's America."
In addition of Pablo Schreiber ("Orange Is the New Black") as Master Chief, Showtime's long-gestating "Halo" series, based on the Xbox game, will star Natascha McElhone ("Californication") and Bokeem Woodbine ("Fargo") when it airs in early 2021.
Gal Gadot ("Wonder Woman") will star in a limited series about the life of actress/inventor Hedy Lamarr that will be written by Sarah Treem ("The Affair").
Earlier this week, Showtime ordered southwestern Pennsylvania-set drama "Rust," starring Jeff Daniels and based on the Philipp Meyer novel "American Rust." Showtime Entertainment president Gary Levine said "Rust" will film in the first half of 2020. As for where it will be shot, Mr. Levine said that's something producers are still figuring out, but Pittsburgh is in the mix: "We hope we can make it there."
Rebooting 'The L Word'
Showtime's "L Word" reboot features much of the original cast - Jennifer Beals, Katherine Moennig, Leisha Hailey - and creator Ilene Chaiken ("Empire") is also back although she credits new showrunner, Marja-Lewis Ryan, a fan of the original, with finding a way to bring the show back in a fresh way.
"The world has changed a lot in these 10 years, and lesbians still belong on television," Ms. Chaiken said. "We're telling stories about what happened in those 10 years [the show was off the air], where we are now and where we're headed."
Beals noted the landscape has changed since the original "L Word" ended in 2009.
"We've expanded the discussion about sexuality and gender identification," she said. "When we were starting the show, nonbinary was a mathematic term. Now, we talk about it in terms of identity and being able in this new iteration of the show to talk about all the other ways we talk about gender identity and sexuality."
Ms. Ryan noted that while there have been advances for gay rights, some challenges facing the LGBTQ community remain the same, including high levels of homelessness and suicide. She hopes representation in "The L Word: Generation Q" helps today's young people the way the original aided her.
"Young adults need people to look up to," she said. "Part of what this show was for me was an aspirational queer narrative. . To say there is plenty of queer narrative on television and film suggests there is a limit to what there ought to be. You'd never make that [argument] about straight couples. Of course not. Every relationship is very different."
Kept/canceled/revived
Pop TV renewed darkly comedic drama "Flack" for a six-episode second season with Sam Neill and Daniel Dae Kim joining Anna Paquin in the cast.
Amazon's Prime Video canceled "Forever" and "Lore."
Bob Harper, a staple on the original "The Biggest Loser," will host the reboot on USA in 2020.

Texto completo: They inherited the names and nicknames of Kennedys before them: Rose, Joe, Teddy and Kick.
Some have felt the lure of politics and social activism, running for Congress or advocating for the environment, while others have gravitated to the stage or Hollywood.
A sprawling group with many in their 20s and 30s, the younger generation of Kennedys took a tragic turn in the national spotlight this week. One of its members, 22-year-old Saoirse Kennedy Hill, suffered an apparent drug overdose on Thursday at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., and died.
Ms. Kennedy Hill, a student at Boston College, was a granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the daughter of Courtney Kennedy Hill.
In some ways, Ms. Kennedy Hill typified her Kennedy generation, bearing a famous name, elite education and access to the storied compound on Cape Cod where her grandmother, Ethel Kennedy, still lives. But like so many of her cousins, she was little known to the wider public, a relatively anonymous young woman who had scarcely begun to choose her life's path.
[A granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy died after an overdose]
Ms. Kennedy Hill's grieving family posted pictures and tributes online after her death became public.
"Yesterday the world lost a light that enchanted everyone and everything around her," Michaela Kennedy Cuomo, a granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, wrote of her cousin on Instagram on Friday. "Let us honor her life by carrying forth her loving compassion, merriment and her passionate fight for women's empowerment."
An autopsy performed on Friday showed no trauma beyond the lifesaving measures taken by emergency medical workers, and the cause and manner of her death will not be released before a toxicology report is completed, said Michael O'Keefe, the Cape and Islands district attorney. Police in Barnstable, Mass., are investigating the death with Massachusetts State Police detectives.
Like Ms. Kennedy Hill, many of the Kennedy grandchildren have kept low profiles as they attended prestigious colleges like Harvard, Wesleyan and Brown, and college preparatory schools like Deerfield Academy. But even as they kept their heads down, the political dynasty was never far away.
For example, when Ms. Kennedy Hill introduced Boston College's local congressman to a group of students, he had a familiar name: Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, her cousin.
Mr. Kennedy, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, won the seat in Congress in 2012 that Barney Frank had held since 1981. He took a well-worn path to elected office, attending Stanford, serving in the Peace Corps and graduating from Harvard Law School, then taking a job as a county prosecutor in eastern Massachusetts.
The Kennedy name was an inevitable element of his campaign, and his Republican opponent, Sean Bielat, suggested that Mr. Kennedy was trying to coast to Congress on his family.
"I'm extremely proud of my family's service to the country," Mr. Kennedy said in a 2012 interview. "It creates a curiosity about my candidacy. But then I've got to earn it."
Other Kennedy grandchildren have not shied away from politics, including Jack Schlossberg, the 26-year-old son of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, who bears a dark-haired resemblance to his late uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr. When he was 24, he interviewed President Barack Obama onstage at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, asking Mr. Obama about the most difficult decisions of his presidency and how young people could find political courage in their own lives.
In 2016, he wrote an essay for Politico about the legacy of his grandfather, the former president. "Today, my grandfather would be 98 years old," he wrote. "He'd have no idea how to use a cellphone, and he'd be shocked by just how far the Republican Party has lost its way."
Tatiana Schlossberg, Jack's sister, worked briefly at The New York Times as an environmental reporter and will have a new book called "Inconspicuous Consumption" published in August.
Several of the Kennedy grandchildren have eschewed politics to pursue careers in film or theater. Bobby Kennedy III, the oldest son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., recently wrote and directed a film about Hunter Thompson's unsuccessful run for sheriff of Pitkin County, Colo. Mr. Kennedy, who says on the film's website that Mr. Thompson taught him to shoot a gun when he was 12, told The Denver Post in 2016 that he hoped the film would inspire young people to be engaged in politics.
"I just really want to motivate a bunch of young 20- and 30-year-olds to get back into politics right now," he said.
Bobby's younger sister, Kathleen "Kick" Kennedy, whose namesake great-aunt died in a plane crash in 1948, has had assorted television and stage roles. In 2014, when she made her professional theatrical debut in the title role of Jean Anouilh's "Antigone," she told The Associated Press that she did not see herself as going off in a radically different direction from the rest of her family.
"Everyone thinks it's so crazy and I'm such a tangent from this tree, but I see it all kind of relating, personally," she said. "I mean, if you break down what a lot of politics is you get stage presence, charisma and, more importantly, a search for truth and the desire to serve a common good, which I believe theater does."
She also said that she did not think her famous name would help her as an actress -- "It's all about the performance at the end of the day" -- and expressed a yearning to forge her own success.
"Hopefully one day people will come see me for something that doesn't have to do with my last name," she said.
Among scores of grandchildren, some have occasionally made the tabloids.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended his son, Conor Kennedy, in 2016 after he was arrested for disorderly conduct after a fight outside a nightclub. The elder Mr. Kennedy said his son, who attended Harvard, had been protecting a friend who had been called a homophobic slur.
"Conor has always reacted against bullying," Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told The Aspen Times when his son's mug shot ran in the paper just after Christmas. "I'm happy he stood up for his friend." The charges against him were dismissed after he pleaded guilty and stayed out of trouble for six months, the newspaper reported, noting that prosecutors were sure to say that they had not treated him differently than any other defendant.
In 2016, Harper's Bazaar called Kyra Kennedy "the latest Kennedy making headlines" after she and her crew of young friends, named the "Snap Pack" for their frequent social media posts, were profiled in The New York Times.
Larry Tye, the author of "Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon," attended the Middlesex School in Concord, Mass., with David Anthony Kennedy, who was Robert F. Kennedy's fourth child and Ms. Kennedy Hill's uncle. David Kennedy died at 28 of a drug overdose in a Palm Beach hotel room, after years of struggling with drugs and alcohol.
Mr. Tye said he was struck by the apparent parallels between the two deaths, which to him seemed to reflect the particular burdens and traumas associated with being a Kennedy.
"If there's any legacy that would have absolutely crushed him," he said of Bobby Kennedy, "it would be seeing this happen first to his son and now to his granddaughter."
[Saoirse Kennedy's death adds to family's tragic history]
The burdens carried by the Kennedys were, first, he said, the lasting trauma of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy's assassinations, which scarred their children deeply: David Kennedy was 12 and watching television alone in a Los Angeles hotel room when he saw his father murdered as he celebrated his victory in the California Democratic primary.
But in addition, Mr. Tye said, being a Kennedy meant living to a certain extent in the public eye, and the attention was often a double-edged sword. While many Americans admire the family, Mr. Tye said, others resent them as the embodiment of whatever they dislike about the Democratic Party or progressive politics.
Ms. Kennedy Hill was a communication major at Boston College, where she took a course in the spring of 2018 on social media and social justice. Her project for the semester was about the #MeToo movement, and she shared facts and analysis about the movement on Twitter.
"In classes she was often the first student to offer an opinion on readings that demanded clear critique about the challenges of contemporary society," Marcus Breen, the professor who taught the class, said in an email.
Even before college, Ms. Kennedy Hill had been vocal about supporting survivors of sexual assault. She founded Deerfield Students Against Sexual Assault with several other friends in high school, according to the school newspaper. Ms. Kennedy Hill also served as vice president for the College Democrats.
Robert Dallek, the presidential historian, whose biography of John F. Kennedy is called "An Unfinished Life," described the Kennedys as "America's royal family" and said that the tragedies that had befallen them were a part of their mystique and hold on the American imagination.
"It's a case of triumph and tragedy, great success and terrible suffering, and in many ways it's the American story," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: President Trump's private company has received a subpoena for documents related to a hush money payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, indicating renewed law enforcement interest in the payoff.
The subpoena from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. arrived at the headquarters of the Trump Organization in New York on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the order. It came just weeks after a judge in New York said federal prosecutors had effectively concluded a campaign finance investigation into the hush money.
Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations and other crimes, acknowledging as part of an agreement with prosecutors that he arranged payments in 2016 to two women to keep their allegations of affairs with Trump from becoming public before Election Day. Cohen, who is serving a three-year prison sentence, said the payments were arranged at Trump's direction. The president has denied the affairs and any wrongdoing.
On Friday, a lawyer for the Trump Organization called the new subpoena, which was f irst reported by the New York Times, a form of harassment.
"How many times are we going to go over the same ground again and again?" attorney Marc L. Mukasey said in a statement. "It's harassment of the president, his family, and his business using subpoenas and leaks as weapons."
Vance's office declined to comment. The Times reported that the district attorney is examining whether any senior officials in the Trump Organization filed falsified business records about the payments in a violation of state law.
The district attorney's inquiry is among a number of New York-based investigations into the president and those in his orbit. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn have been examining possible foreign influence on Trump's campaign. Meanwhile, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) is suing Trump and his children, accusing the family's charity of "persistently illegal conduct."
James's office has also interviewed more than two dozen former workers at Trump's golf clubs, asking about allegations that Trump's company exploited them because they lack legal immigration status. And her office has subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, one of Trump's main lenders, after allegations from Trump's former attorney that Trump misled lenders about the size of his fortune.
Cohen has maintained that Trump directed him and other Trump Organization executives to make the hush money payments.
"It was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light," he said at his sentencing in December. "Time and time again, I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds."
Last month, in a letter to U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said the government had "effectively concluded its investigations" into who else besides Cohen could be criminally liable as part of the hush money scheme.
In response, Jay Sekulow, the president's current attorney, said, "Case closed."

Poll shows Biden more popular than Clinton ever was in Ohio

Texto completo: The recent Quinnipiac presidential election poll showing a matchup between Democrat Joe Biden and Republican President Trump predicts a hard-fought race for Ohio if Mr. Biden gets the nomination.

According to the poll, if the election were held today, Mr. Biden would beat President Trump by 50 percent to 42 percent. No other Democrat - Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, or Cory Booker - topped 45 percent, or polled ahead of Mr. Trump.

When a candidate's polling numbers cross the 50-percent threshold the outlook for the opponent is grim.

Mr. Biden's 50 percent is also a higher poll number than Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, received from Quinnipiac in Ohio at that time.

The poll doesn't necessarily undercut the view that gained popularity after Republican Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray for governor in 2018, that Ohio is no longer a swing state, as expressed by Mr. Cordray's former campaign manager, Michael Halle.

Right after the election, he told the New York Times, Ohio and Iowa are two states that Obama won in both his presidential campaigns, and now they're just not competitive in the way they once were. Mr. Halle is now senior strategist for Mr. Buttigieg.

Quinnipiac has a long history of polling Ohio frequently during election campaigns and has posted all of its previous polls on its website.

At about this same time four years ago, August, 2015, Mrs. Clinton was polled as beating Mr. Trump 43 percent to 38 percent. Mrs. Clinton was the undisputed Democratic front-runner, and Mr. Trump was still considered a joke as a presidential candidate, and she still managed only 43 percent.

Mrs. Clinton's polling numbers remained at 43 percent or lower all the way into July, 2016. That month, she was locked in a tie with Mr. Trump at 41 percent each, with 18 percent either undecided or pretending to be.

Mrs. Clinton's numbers improved in August, 2016, when she jumped to a 49 percent to 45 percent lead over Mr. Trump - the week after Bernie Sanders endorsed her at the Democratic National Convention. That was her high-water mark.

Over the next three months, her number with Quinnipiac dropped to 45, 42, and then 41 percent.

In the end, Mr. Trump carried the state by 52 percent to 44 percent, about the same number that Mrs. Clinton got in Quinnipiac's first Trump vs. Clinton poll in August, 2015.

If Quinnipiac's polling has validity, then by starting at 50 percent, we can project that Mr. Biden will finish at about 50 percent.

If Mr. Biden polls this way in Ohio, then he polls that way in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

Some Democrats read Mr. Biden's polling as evidence that Mr. Trump has lost support in Ohio. They reason that if the former vice president is this far ahead this early in the campaign, then the party need not play it safe with a moderate/centrist politician like Mr. Biden. Why not throw caution to the wind and nominate Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders?

Ms. Warren's campaign is already trying to lay the groundwork for that argument. Ms. Warren has now made several campaign stops in Ohio. She was here Monday night in Toledo and attracted a good crowd. Mr. Trump's margin of victory was so small in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that the Democrats could sacrifice Ohio and hope to eke out an election from those three states.

Victory in Ohio is not as critical to a Democrat as for a Republican. History tells us that a Republican must carry Ohio to win the presidency, but a Democrat can lose Ohio and still win (it last happened in 1960).

That's a risk some in the party want to take.

This poll is just the opening round of the 2020 election. Mr. Biden is not even the Democratic nominee yet. Yet, his polling shows that he has a well of favorability in Ohio that the party's 2016 nominee did not enjoy.

Jewish Education Loan Fund: Investing in students’ futures

Texto completo: What does Jewish Education Loan Fund do?
Student debt in the United States has reached record levels, making higher education out of reach for many families and saddling others with thousands in high-interest loans. According to The New York Times, 94% of undergrads are now borrowing for their education as compared to 45% in 1993.
Since 2009, the Jewish Education Loan Fund has provided more than $7 million in the form of more than 2,000 student loans. JELF is one of the oldest continuously active nonprofits in the United States, founded in 1889 as the Hebrew Orphans’ Home. The orphanage was established to support children from the former B’nai B’rith District 5 (the same five-state region we still cover today) who had lost one or both of their parents. While the Hebrew Orphans’ Home closed its doors in 1930 due to changing societal needs, the organization successfully transformed itself into Jewish Children’s Services (JCS) which placed Jewish children in foster care. In 1961, the organization began providing interest-free loans for higher education, as government organizations began filling the foster care role. In 1989, the organization formally changed its name to Jewish Educational Loan Fund (JELF).
Today, through a combination of student loan repayments as well as the support from donors throughout our region, JELF is assisting more students each year to meet their education goals. As Chief Executive Officer Jenna Leopold Shulman says, “The cost of college should never have to outweigh its benefit, but sadly for many, it does. JELF helps fill the gap between scholarships, government loans and what the students still need to continue their education.”
How does your agency benefit the community?
JELF has provided loans to students all over the United States and around the globe. In 2018, loan recipients were enrolled at 135 different colleges, vocational and technical schools. Students from South Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties) represented 27% of JELF recipients, with nearly 11% coming exclusively from Palm Beach County. After borrowing from JELF, former recipients pay back their student loans at a 99% repayment rate, which allows them to continue benefiting others in the community. With their higher education, these students also are able to become more productive members of their communities. Many of them have taken leadership and board roles in different worthy nonprofits, including but not limited to JELF.
What is your agency’s focus for the future?
As Stan Lowenstein, current JELF board president, says, “I am excited about deepening our community impact. By gaining more awareness for our program we can fulfill our goal of ensuring that all Jewish students have the opportunity to earn their degree with as few financial obstacles as possible.”
How can the community help?
The Palm Beach County community is in a position to greatly help JELF in several ways: the first is simply by letting people know that JELF exists. By letting people know, we can reach more students who need our help. Small actions, such as connecting on our Facebook page (@JELFSoFla) or telling a college/grad student, can make a big difference. Further, by donating to JELF, you also can help Jewish students achieve their higher education.

Mission Statement
The Jewish Education Loan Fund’s mission is to provide interest-free loans to Jewish students from Florida, as well as the four other states that we currently serve (Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia) who lack the needed resources for their education after high school. Loans can be used for any accredited higher-learning, including college, graduate school and degree-granting vocational programs.
Key Program
Interest-free student loans: JELF helps fill the gap between scholarships, government loans and what the students still need to continue their education. Ninety-nine percent of the loan recipients repay the loans, allowing JELF to continue benefiting others in the community.
JELF has two loan seasons: March 1 to April 30, which covers assistance for the following fall, spring and/or summer terms; and Sept. 1-30, which covers assistance for the following spring and/or summer terms only. To apply, students must visit JELF’s online application and create an account. Students must supply the following documentation, which can be uploaded directly to their account: final transcript from the school last attended (if not currently a student); school acceptance letter (if they are an entering student); parents’ currency year tax return(s) and schedules and W-2s or 1099s (if student is listed as a dependent or is under 25 years of age); student’s current year tax return and schedules (if filed) and W-2 or 1099 (if worked); spouse’s current year tax return and schedules and W-2 or 1099 (if married); and the Student Aid Report (SAR) received after filing 2019 FAFSA.
Students would need to contact their Local JELF Administrator (LJA) to schedule a personal interview and submit final required supporting documents by June 15 and/or Oct. 21. (This includes final transcript for school year most recently completed, the financial aid award letter as well as costs of attendance for the school the student is attending.)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore “dangerous,” “filthy” and “rodent infested” -- that is, if you can believe what you read in the “failing New York Times.”
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story entitled “The Tragedy of Baltimore,” which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. “’Watch your step,’ someone called out as the group neared a dead rat,” the Times reported.
The city’s “regression has been swift and demoralizing,” the Times wrote, adding that officials have “struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge.” One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, “we’re all bolted in our homes, we’re locked down.”
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita -- more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore’s population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 -- up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing “American carnage.”
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore’s remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. Children are trapped in failing schools that can’t teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to “a Third World country” and said it is “a community in which half of the people don’t have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable.” This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions -- we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore’s leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule.
Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor’s office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to “concentration camps”) but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump’s presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics. In 2016, Trump visited a black church in Detroit and gave a major speech in Charlotte in which he promised black Americans, “Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion.” Last year, he was supposed to visit Baltimore to deliver a similar message but canceled. That would have been a lot more effective than a tweetstorm that only prompts Baltimore’s beleaguered residents to rally around their incompetent Democratic leaders.

Texto completo: SAN JUAN, P.R. -- The ousted governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo A. Rosselló, chose his successor on Wednesday, nominating Pedro R. Pierluisi, who formerly represented the island in Congress, to serve as secretary of state. The move positions Mr. Pierluisi to take over as governor when Mr. Rosselló's resignation becomes effective later this week.
Even so, Mr. Pierluisi's ascension remained uncertain, as a tense power struggle among leaders of the ruling New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rican statehood, threatened to derail his nomination and keep the territory in political turmoil.
Questions about the complicated succession have lingered since last week, when Mr. Rosselló announced his imminent exit. He was under fire for his participation in a leaked exchange of rude text messages, and faced intense pressure from a mass uprising of Puerto Ricans who were fed up with corruption, a stagnant economy and a poor response to Hurricane Maria in 2017.
A local blogger posted a new set of messages from the same chat on Wednesday, revealing more insults -- and a discussion of how to help a Cabinet member who was under investigation.
Mr. Pierluisi, 60, was expected to take the oath of office as secretary of state on Wednesday, the governor's office said. Mr. Rosselló called a special session of the Legislative Assembly for Thursday, the day before he is scheduled to step down, to confirm the recess appointment.
In a statement, Mr. Rosselló said he picked Mr. Pierluisi, his former 2016 primary rival, because of his experience as Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, and before that as secretary of justice when Mr. Rosselló's father, Pedro J. Rosselló, was governor in the 1990s.
The governor said that Mr. Pierluisi intended to serve through the end of the current term but would not run for re-election as governor in 2020.
"His aspiration is to complete this term, so that the successes we have achieved do not disappear," Mr. Rosselló said. "The electoral process that will begin in the coming months will allow other highly qualified leaders to put their ideas and character to the people's consideration, as Pierluisi and I did in the last primary."
Mr. Pierluisi said he would be responsive to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans whose street protests ended Mr. Rosselló's term as governor.
"I have listened to the people's messages, their demonstrations, their demands and their concerns," Mr. Pierluisi said in a statement accepting the nomination. "And in this new challenge in my life, I will only answer to the people."
But first, he will have to contend with the powerful Senate president, Thomas Rivera Schatz, who let it be known before the nomination was even official that Mr. Pierluisi would not have enough votes to win confirmation.
Under Puerto Rico's Constitution, the secretary of state automatically replaces a governor who leaves office. But the last official to hold the post, Luis Rivera Marín, stepped down over his role in the leaked private group chat on the messaging app Telegram that precipitated the political crisis. His departure created a critical vacancy ahead of Mr. Rosselló's resignation, which becomes effective at 5 p.m. on Friday.
It left Wanda Vázquez, the secretary of justice, next in line. But Ms. Vázquez made clear that she was not a politician and preferred not to step in as governor. Hundreds of protesters, denouncing Ms. Vázquez's close ties to the disgraced Mr. Rosselló, rallied outside the Justice Department on Monday and demanded that she, too, resign.
Behind the scenes, Mr. Rosselló, 40, negotiated with legislative leaders to try to find a consensus candidate who could be left in charge of the troubled government until next year's election. But it was difficult for them to find a candidate who could be confirmed by the Legislative Assembly and be acceptable to the public. Protesters said repeatedly that they were tired of crony politics.
Mr. Pierluisi served eight years in Washington as Puerto Rico's nonvoting resident commissioner in Congress during the Obama administration. Like Mr. Rosselló, he is a Democrat when it comes to national politics, though many New Progressives are Republicans.
Mr. Pierluisi, a lawyer, could have a conflict of interest because he works for a firm that does external legal consulting for the unelected federal oversight board that oversees Puerto Rico's finances. On Tuesday, Mr. Pierluisi was placed on a leave of absence from the law firm, O'Neill & Borges.
His brother-in-law, José B. Carrión III, remains the chairman of the federal oversight board. The New York Times found in 2016 that Mr. Pierluisi introduced legislation as resident commissioner that would benefit at least two Wall Street companies that had hired his wife, María Elena Carrión, for financial advice. (Mr. Pierluisi and Ms. Carrión are in the process of divorcing, the Puerto Rican news media have reported.)
Mr. Pierluisi's ties to the unpopular oversight board do not sit well with some lawmakers. Several went on television to call his nomination unacceptable.
"No one can question his abilities," Representative José Meléndez, a member of the New Progressive party, told WAPA, a local station. "But I saw him in meetings with the board, and he was on the side of the board. That puts him in conflict with government policies. He'd probably have to recuse himself. It's going to be very difficult for him to govern without access to the fiscal control board."
Senator José Antonio Vargas Vidot, a political independent, chided the statehood party for not looking outside of its usual ranks for a nominee. "It's as if the PNP doesn't have anyone without a conflict," he told WAPA.
Yet Gisela Gómez, 45, who sells homemade sweets to tourists in San Juan, the capital, said she participated in the massive march last week to oust the governor and was pleased with Mr. Pierluisi's selection.
"We have to run all of the corrupt ones out, and replace it with a new government," Ms. Gómez said. "I don't know much about politics, but from what I have heard, of all of them out there, he is the best one."
Juan Pagán, 57, a cabdriver who was standing on a street corner in Old San Juan hoping to pick up cruise ship passengers, said that although he does not vote for the New Progressive Party, he thinks Mr. Pierluisi is an acceptable candidate.
"At least he's the least bad," Mr. Pagán said. "The party is completely corrupt. History has said that that is the most corrupt party in history," he added, noting that there were dozens of arrests during the administration of Mr. Rosselló's father.
The choice of Mr. Pierluisi suggested that Mr. Rosselló remains determined to keep Mr. Rivera Schatz, one of his rivals in the party, from succeeding him.
But Mr. Rivera Schatz could prove to be an unstoppable foe: If lawmakers block Mr. Pierluisi's confirmation, then his recess appointment would be rejected and he would no longer be secretary of state, said Efrén Rivera Ramos, a law professor at the University of Puerto Rico. That would leave Ms. Vázquez as the next governor.
Mr. Rivera Schatz is known to dislike Ms. Vázquez and to harbor ambitions to run for governor himself next year. And he holds considerable sway within his party; he became its interim leader after Mr. Rosselló relinquished the role of president.
But he, too, is considered a divisive figure. The protesters who marched against Mr. Rosselló and then Ms. Vázquez also chanted to Mr. Rivera Schatz: "No te vistas, que no vas" -- Don't get dressed; it's not going to be you.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Rivera Schatz said the confirmation process will play out and lawmakers will perform their constitutional duty. But he did not mention Mr. Pierluisi by name, or refer to his chances at winning the Senate vote -- which he indicated might not take place until midafternoon on Friday.
"There is no problem that does not have a solution, and in Puerto Rico we should focus on solutions," Mr. Rivera Schatz said. "We should promote unity, not discord."

Texto completo: The outside contractors who were brought in to flush out the subway's clogged drains did a fine job, clearing the gunked-up flow-ways and enabling trains to run better.
Now we need an industrial-strength declogging of the state's gunked-up campaign finance system, which allowed those contractors to contribute big money to Gov. Cuomo's reelection effort, as The New York Times has pointed out. Whether they donated to express admiration for Cuomo's leadership, or in a tacit thank-you for getting the work, or to prime the pump to get more of it, doesn't matter. The appearance of back-scratching undermines public confidence.
Cuomo, who says all this was kosher, who insists he has nothing at all to do with the MTA's procurement process, is not alone in pocketing political money from persons with financial interests before the state. But the governor has a unique responsibility to lead.
Cuomo has proposed legal fixes many times, including lowering the ridiculously high contribution cap of $69,700 for statewide contenders. The Legislature, typically miserable on this issue, has failed to act.
The answer is simple: The governor should unilaterally change the rules for his own campaign. No contributions, or at the very least no obscenely large ones, for companies doing business with state government or affiliated entities.
A second avenue for reform is a nine-member Public Campaign Financing Commission that will produce a binding plan by Dec. 1, unless a new law overrides it within 20 days. It should lower overall limits and restrict donations from those seeking or holding state business.
This shouldn't be difficult.

Texto completo: GUN CONTROL

Senator Bernie Sanders' record on the issue is more complicated than he let on.
What he said:
“Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election."
This is misleading. Sanders suggested he had a long history of fighting the National Rifle Association. Sanders noted that he has a “D minus voting record from the NRA and as president I suspect it will be an F record." He vowed that as president, he would “do everything I can" to take on the NRA.
But Sanders left out parts of his record as a lawmaker defending gun rights in Vermont, a rural hunting state. In 1993, then-Representative Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated background checks and imposed a five-day waiting period for gun purchasers.
In 2005, while still in the House, Sanders voted in favor of a measure to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits arising from the criminal use of their products. In 2012, after a mass shooting in Colorado, he suggested the federal government should steer clear of gun control, saying, “In my view, decisions about gun control should be made as close to home as possible — at the state level." But Sanders voted in favor of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which passed as part of a broad package of crime legislation.
HEALTH CARE

Governor John Hickenlooper suggested universal health care would not play well with moderate voters.
What he said:
“Last year Democrats flipped 40 Republican seats in the house and not one of those 40 Democrats supported the policies of our front-runners at center stage."
This is exaggerated. Hickenlooper was referring to “Medicare for All," the progressive plan for universal health care. Many of the seats Democrats flipped in taking control of the House in 2018 were in swing districts, or districts carried by President Trump; most of the freshmen who won those seats are centrists and do not support Medicare for All.
But at least two of them — Katie Porter and Katie Hill of California — do, and campaigned on it.
In 2017, Porter said on Twitter: “I believe in universal coverage and I support Medicare for All." Hill's campaign posted a video on Facebook explaining her reasoning for backing Medicare for All. “We have to do whatever it takes to get us to Medicare For All as soon as possible," she said.
TRADE POLICY

Sanders blamed trade policy, apparently referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement, for Detroit's decline.
What he said:
“Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the streets as they moved to low-wage countries."
This is exaggerated. NAFTA, which went in effect 1994, is often blamed for the loss of American manufacturing jobs in the Midwest, but Detroit's struggles started well before that as global competition increased. Auto jobs started scattering during the energy crisis of the 1970s and the economic downturn of the 1980s. Moreover, jobs in Detroit were also lost to competition the union-averse South, where many carmakers sought cheaper labor.
* * *
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Trump's trade deals are not about helping American workers but are actually about helping big companies.
What she said:
“Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just doesn't understand what's going on. Look at the NAFTA 2.0. What's the central feature? It's to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity."
This is mostly true. While the drug provisions are not the core element of the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (NAFTA 2.0), it is a controversial provision that continues to hold up ratification of the trade pact. As The Times reported in March, the agreement gives biologic drugmakers 10 years of protections against other products that would rely on the data they used to win approval.
That 10-year provision would raise the timeline in Canada, where the industry currently has eight years of protection, and in Mexico, where it technically has none. It would not change current policy in the United States, where the standard is already 12 years.
CLIMATE CHANGE

The timelines of the problem are more complex than two candidates described.
What was said:
Beto O'Rourke : “I listen to scientists on this, and they are very clear. We don't have more than 10 years to get this right."
Mayor Pete Buttigieg : “Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate."
Both statements are misleading. Both O'Rourke, a former member of Congress from Texas, and Buttigieg are referring to a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that finds countries have about a dozen years to keep the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
At that point the planet will face severe effects including worsened droughts, floods, and heat waves. And since most scenarios for curbing warming require halving worldwide emissions by 2030, that means countries must take serious action now. But to claim that there are 12 or just 10 years until the point of no return goes beyond what the panel itself says.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers in Congress from both political parties have accused the Trump administration of delaying an $ 8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island off the coast of China that is supported by the United States.
Chinese officials have said they object strongly to the sale of 66 jets requested by Taiwan, which would be by far the largest such purchase by its government in many years. Lawmakers are now questioning whether the Trump administration is delaying approval of the sale, either to avoid upsetting Beijing while delicate trade negotiations are underway or to use it as a bargaining chip.
Any such move by the administration would ignite intense bipartisan opposition in Congress.
"Our support for Taiwan through arms transfers is not up for negotiation with Beijing," Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The New York Times on Monday.
"I will support the sale of F-16s to Taiwan as soon as the State Department notices them to our committee, which I expect to happen soon," Mr. McCaul said.
Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Trump administration "is possibly obstructing the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan so the president can use them as leverage in his failing trade war with China."
"Taiwan's defense cannot be a bargaining chip to be cashed in for a smile from China's dictatorship," Mr. Menendez said Monday.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday to meet with Chinese negotiators. President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to restart talks during a meeting on June 29 in Osaka, Japan.
In Twitter posts on Tuesday, Mr. Trump criticized China and said it should enter a deal now. "We have all the cards," he said.
Lawmakers who oversee foreign policy in Congress had expected the State Department to sign off on the fighter jet sales by last week, before the House went on recess. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has not yet approved the official notification to allow the sales to move forward. The Senate leaves Washington on Friday, and Congress is not scheduled to return until Sept. 9.
A Senate aide described hesitation by administration officials to move forward with the sales "in light of the ongoing negotiations with China."
Jeff Emerson, a spokesman for the trade representative, said Mr. Lighthizer had not suggested delaying the arms sales or offered it as a bargaining chip in the trade talks.
The State Department declined to comment on the proposed arms sales. The Treasury Department and White House National Security Council also declined to comment.
The deal for the F-16s, which are made by Lockheed Martin, would be the second batch of arms sales to Taiwan by the Trump administration this summer. However, it is much larger and more sensitive than the earlier sale.
On July 8, the State Department notified Congress that it was moving ahead with a sale of 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and other weapons to Taiwan, a package worth more than $ 2 billion. Unless Congress raises objections within one month of formal notification, the sale will go through.
After Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter decided to normalize relations with China, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to set guidelines for nondiplomatic relations with Taiwan. The act requires the United States "to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character."
China insists Taiwan is part of its territory, and Beijing has for years objected to the sales. That has prompted the United States to try to draw as little attention to the arms purchases as possible by approving them in intermittent batches. Taiwan has had a longstanding request for new F-16s, which has provoked especially vehement objections from Beijing, given that the jets could be used to bomb mainland China.
Some Trump administration officials have taken hard-line stands against China based on national security concerns. Others have argued that maintaining stable economic ties with Beijing is more important.
John R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, has long been an outspoken defender of Taiwan and a proponent of arms sales.
In a January 2017 opinion article, Mr. Bolton wrote that Mr. Trump should play the "Taiwan card" to counter China's hegemonic moves in Asia. Mr. Bolton even suggested that the United States should restore diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Mr. Pompeo has been less brazen on Taiwan policy, and his priority is to stay in step with Mr. Trump, but he has spoken about competing with China to keep it from spreading authoritarian ideas.
Economic advisers to Mr. Trump have refrained from taking tougher actions against China to avoid jeopardizing a potential trade deal, a goal that the president is eager to reach before the 2020 presidential election. The Treasury Department has objected to proposals to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for the detention of more than one million Muslims, according to administration officials.
Mr. Trump takes a transactional view of China. He started a trade war to push a deal that would narrow the trade deficit, but rarely if ever speaks of China as an adversary or strategic threat. In Osaka, Mr. Trump said he saw the United States and China as "strategic partners," and he constantly praises Mr. Xi.
The president has also suggested that any national security concerns over Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company, could be brushed aside if China enters a favorable trade deal with the United States.
"Trump does not see China as an enemy," said Michael Pillsbury, a scholar of the Chinese military at the Hudson Institute who has informally advised the White House. "In fact, he has shown remarkable restraint when it comes to China."
Three congressional officials said the F-16 sales were delayed after trade advisers appealed to Mr. Trump. One of the officials, who works for a senior Republican lawmaker, said he expected Mr. Bolton and perhaps Mr. Pompeo to press Mr. Trump this week to approve the sales, though Mr. Pompeo leaves for Thailand on Tuesday.
That official compared Mr. Trump's reluctance to embrace the sales to the White House's hesitation to impose sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of the Russian S-400 antiaircraft system. Mr. Trump has shown an affinity for strongman leaders, whether it is Mr. Xi or President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey or President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
"Using Taiwan as a bargaining chip in our economic relationship with China plays right into Beijing's hands and only leaves Taiwan more vulnerable to Chinese coercion," said Kelly E. Magsamen, the Pentagon's top Asia-Pacific policy official at the end of the Obama administration. "It's Taipei's worst nightmare. It means they could be on the table in bigger ways."
Taiwan has an aging fleet of F-16s, and had asked to buy new ones more than a decade ago. Neither President George W. Bush nor President Barack Obama approved the sales, but the Obama administration decided in 2011 to refurbish Taiwan's existing fleet. At the time, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, where the F-16s were made, said Mr. Obama's decision marked "a sad day in American foreign policy."
In April, Lockheed Martin announced it had moved F-16 production to South Carolina, the home state of Senator Lindsey Graham, a vocal Republican supporter of Mr. Trump, though the two sometimes clash on foreign policy.
Tensions between China and Taiwan have been rising this month.
President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, seen as an adversary by Communist Party leaders in Beijing, hosted a reception for United Nations officials on July 11 in New York on a trip to visit Caribbean nations, and stopped in Colorado on her way home. On July 14, Beijing announced that it would carry out military exercises near the Taiwan Strait.
The United States has been sending naval ships through the Taiwan Strait about once each month in freedom-of-navigation actions. In April, a French warship passed through, in a rare move encouraged by the United States.

Russia opposition leader possibly poisoned in jail

Texto completo: MOSCOW - The hospital treating Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny sent him back to prison Monday, despite the strenuous objection of his doctor, who said he had apparently been personel with a "toxic agent" in the wake of some of the largest anti-Kremlin protests held in Moscow for years.
The doctor, Anastasy Vasiyeva, said insufficient test had been conducted on he cause of Navalny's condition to return him to the place where she said the toxic exposure probably occurred. After being allowed to see him, Vasilyeva wrote on Facebook that Navalny was feeling better but needed continued monitoring.
Navalny, 43, the most prominent critic of President Vlidimir Putin and his government, was rushed to the hospital Sunday from his jail cel, suffering from swelling and hives, which officials described as an allergic reaction. He was sentenced last week to 30 days in jail for organizing an illegal protest, days before a demonstration he had called drew thousands of people in Moscow on Saturday.
Vasilyeva, who had treated him previously, said Sunday that Navalny might have been poisoned with an unknown chemical substance. The Interfax news agency quoted a doctor at the government hospital where he was admitted as saying that he had suffered from an attack of hives but had improved.
Unease among his fellow opposition members and supporters stemmed from the Kremlin's long history of eliminating its opponents, often by poisoning them.
Putin has tried to build an image of a powerful, united Russia, and anyone who would undermine that strength or point out that much of the country lives in poverty is often the target of official ire.
Independent journalists, rights advocates, opposition politicians, government whistleblowers and others are smeared in the media, jailed on dubious charges and, in some cases, killed. Navalny himself temporarily lost most of the vision in one eye when someone threw a caustic liquid into his face in 2017.

Texto completo: La semana pasada, 3,282 empresas de todo el país recibieron “Avisos de inspección (NOI)” de la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ), según el director interino, Matthew Albence .
El funcionario había adelantado a The New York Times que había investigaciones a ese número de empresas, pero no dio detalles.
Expertos de la firma Leech Tishman Fuscaldo & Lampl LLC indicaron que ICE envió “silenciosamente NOI” a las empresas, lo cual llamaron una “redada silenciosa” contra los empleadores.
“Las industrias que se vieron afectadas la semana pasada incluyeron restaurantes, procesamiento de alimentos, fabricación de alta tecnología y agricultura” , indicaron los expertos en un artículo en el sitio especializado en temas jurídicos lexology.com.
“La emisión de NOI no es sorprendente, dado que ICE ha aumentado hasta en cinco veces el número de las auditorías I-9 en el año fiscal 2018, y la reciente emisión de cartas de ‘no coincidencia’ de la Administración del Seguro Social esta primavera”, apunta el texto.
Los expertos brindan algunos consejos a los empresarios para mantener en orden su documentación, ya que los agentes se enfocan en buscar cualquier omisión que haga sospechar la contratación de inmigrantes indocumentados .
“Si una empresa ha recibido un NOI de ICE, solo tiene tres días hábiles para responder. Las multas por infracciones de la I-9 pueden oscilar entre $548 y $4,384 por delito para los infractores por primera vez”, advirtieron. “Las sanciones penales también pueden aplicarse a los dueños de negocios que a sabiendas emplean a trabajadores no autorizados” .
Los especialistas indican que estas revisiones se han vuelto más comunes y pueden tener consecuencias, ya que incluso los trabajadores con Autorización de Empleo pueden decidir renunciar ante el escrutinio.
“Responder a ICE le quita tiempo y recursos al negocio”, indican. “Las multas y cualquier noticia pública relacionada con la auditoría pueden dañar la reputación de la empresa. Es imperativo trabajar con un abogado experimentado en cumplimiento de I-9 y tener uno de guardia para que pueda estar preparado”.
Si un inmigrante es descubierto laborando con documentos falsos o robados será perseguido penalmente por fraude.

Marc Thiessen: Trump was wrong to attack Cummings, but right about Baltimore

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" — that is, if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story entitled "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. "'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita — more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 — up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing "American carnage."
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. Children are trapped in failing schools that can't teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions — we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics. In 2016, Trump visited a black church in Detroit and gave a major speech in Charlotte in which he promised black Americans, "Whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion." Last year, he was supposed to visit Baltimore to deliver a similar message but canceled. That would have been a lot more effective than a tweetstorm that only prompts Baltimore's beleaguered residents to rally around their incompetent Democratic leaders.

Texto completo: VIENNA, W.Va. - You might think that since President Donald Trump opposes abortion, he'd want to help young women get birth control to avoid unwanted pregnancy.
You might think that someone who claims to be "pro-life" would want to help young men and women get cancer screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
But new Trump administration regulations, part of the administration's broader war on family planning and women's health, curb access to birth control and are causing chaos in family planning clinics across America. At a Planned Parenthood clinic that I visited here in northwestern West Virginia, a worried 20-year-old student arrived for a chlamydia test: She had previously been treated and came for a three-month follow-up to see if the infection was gone. Normally the test would have been free, but because of the new Trump rules, she would have to pay $94.
"I can't afford that," she said, so she walked out untested.
A 17-year-old, Meredith, arrived for a birth control injection, which she gets every three months. But under the new regulations, the clinic could no longer use its stockpile of contraceptives in the supply closet, so instead it gave her a prescription for the pill, which she could fill at a pharmacy at her expense. Thus a West Virginia teenager had to change her birth control method to the pill because of the whims of a septuagenarian male president in Washington.
The Trump regulations limit Title X, a landmark federal program meant to support women's health for low-income Americans. The regulations bar Title X money from going to clinics that refer women to places to get abortions.
This Planned Parenthood clinic, the only one in West Virginia, does not perform abortions but does provide referrals. So it determined that it can no longer use Title X money or provide contraceptives that had been bought with Title X money - and that's why the 20-year-old couldn't get a free chlamydia test, and why Meredith couldn't get her injection.
"This helps so many women," Meredith told me, speaking of Title X. "I'm a 17-year-old with a job that doesn't pay well, and I can't worry about bringing a child into this world."
A Pap test to check for cervical cancer previously was free for low-income patients at the clinic; after the Trump regulations, it's $264. A clinical breast exam went from zero to $160. A contraceptive arm implant or IUD soared from zero to more than $1,000 in some cases.
"If we don't have access to birth control, then honestly, pregnancies are going to skyrocket," warned Linsley Myers, 23, a community college student who came to the clinic because, as she put it, "my vagina is acting up."
Since West Virginia gave Trump the highest margin of any state in the 2016 election, I asked Myers what she would say to Trump today. Her response: "Why attack women?"
Sarah Riddle, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood for the region, said that without Title X money, the organization may be forced to close the clinic.
Andrew Clovis, 53, a plant nursery manager, is gay and was at the clinic to begin PrEP treatment, which sharply reduces the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. If the clinic closes, he said, there will be no place nearby to receive the treatment.
Across the United States, a large share of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics are losing funding under the new regulations. Private gynecologists will still serve women with insurance, but those without insurance will be even less likely to get contraception or cancer screenings.
Title X is an odd target because it is the gold standard of cost-effectiveness. In 2010, a study found, publicly funded family planning averted 2.2 million unintended pregnancies, 99,100 cases of chlamydia and 3,680 cases of cervical cancer.
Why is a man writing about women's health? Partly because these are issues of health and fairness that we all have a stake in - gonorrhea has a way of spreading from one sex to the other. And partly because men, too, have an obligation to speak up when half the population is treated unjustly.
A 90-minute drive south of Vienna, I also visited the Women's Health Center of West Virginia, in Charleston, where Title X has paid for 80% of the patients needing birth control, cancer tests or gynecological care. The center also provides abortions, but Title X has never covered them.
"You want to put restrictions on abortion but not allow people the resources to prevent a pregnancy," said an exasperated Sharon Lewis, executive director of the center. "It's ludicrous."
The clinic will continue to provide abortions, Lewis said, but the loss of Title X funds might force it to stop providing family planning and other services for patients who lack insurance.
At the Women's Health Center, I spoke to Cassie, 27, who told me that since the age of 16 she has received birth control, breast exams, Pap tests and more from the clinic.
"If I would have gotten pregnant, I might have taken my own life," she said, and she broke down, tears rolling down her cheeks.
Her advice to President Trump and his aides: "You don't understand until you've been in someone's shoes. You've got to talk to these women."

Texto completo: U.S. women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe said in an interview published Monday that she doesn't think any of her teammates are interested in visiting President Donald Trump at the White House and she doesn't believe any conversation she could have with Trump would change his perspective on fundamental issues in which they disagree.
Rapinoe told The New York Times Magazine that her public back-and-forth with the president didn't cause any consternation within the U.S. women's national soccer team because her teammates largely shared her views. "I haven't done the roll call, but I don't think anybody's interested (in visiting Trump)," Rapinoe told the magazine.
She also said she doesn't see any value in meeting with Trump, even in an attempt to discuss their differences.
"A lot of people have said, 'Why don't you make a demand of the president that he'll sit down and talk with you if go to the White House?'" Rapinoe told The New York Times Magazine. "But I'm not going to be na ve and think that I'm going to sit down with Trump and he's going to change his mind. There are children locked up at the border who are dying, and that's not fazing him. So why would I faze him?"
In the interview, Rapinoe spoke at length about her reaction to Trump's now-famous tweet during the World Cup, in which he said Rapinoe should "WIN first before she TALKS" about not wishing to visit the White House, as is customary for sports champions. She also discussed her upbringing, the future of women's soccer and her penchant for political activism.
"In this incredible moment that I have, I would like to use this platform to unify people," she told the magazine. "That doesn't mean get everybody to the left, but I want to bring everybody to the conversation, and the basis of it is equal rights."

Texto completo: Megan Rapinoe has spoken volumes about her political and cultural beliefs, but it was perhaps her trademark goal celebration during the Americans' march to another World Cup title that spoke best. Arms extended wide, her face tilted upward with her chin defiantly jutting forward, she wasn't about to back down from anything or anyone, including President Trump.
"It was probably born out of a little arrogance. Like, are you not entertained? What more do you want?" she told the New York Times magazine in an interview published Friday. "And it was sort of saying to Trump - but more to detractors in general - that you will not steal our joy from us as a team, as the LGBTQ community, as America. It was kind of a [expletive] you, but nice. . . . What's the term? Give me all the smoke? Is that what the kids are saying? Like, 'I'm right here for it, ready to clap back.' "
She still is.
A celebratory trip to the White House, as she has long said, is not in her plans. Nor will she heed calls to visit 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to bring her message directly to Trump.
"A lot of people have said, 'Why don't you make a demand of the president that he'll sit down and talk with you if go to the White House?' " she told the Times. "But I'm not going to be naive and think that I'm going to sit down with Trump and he's going to change his mind. There are children locked up at the border who are dying, and that's not fazing him. So why would I faze him?"
What comes next for Rapinoe is instead a continuation of her advocacy. Rapinoe, who said "being gay has shaped my life's view," will continue to advocate for LGBTQ issues going forward and for equal pay for female soccer players, among other things, while exploring how to use her expanded national platform to prompt social change.
"In this incredible moment that I have, I would like to use this platform to unify people. That doesn't mean get everybody to the left, but I want to bring everybody to the conversation, and the basis of it is equal rights," she said.
"My big, I don't know, 'message' right now is that every person has a responsibility to be a participant in this society and make it a better place for everybody, in whatever capacity they can. And I'm just trying to do the best that I can to inspire people to feel confident that they have the ability to be an active participant in this country, in their community, in their family. And having hard conversations is the only way we can start to move forward."

Too busy for church? There’s an app for that.

Texto completo: Dallas residents Lincoln and Natalie Redmon spent two years bouncing from church to church. After marrying and moving to the city, they just couldn’t find the right fit. So late last year Mr. Redmon wrote down a goal: “Find a home church or have God answer that prayer in a different way.” 
Two days later, he saw an Instagram post from Judah Smith, lead pastor of the Northwestern multisite ministry Churchome. “We have a new location,” he said in a video post. “And that location is everywhere.” Mr. Smith announced Churchome’s new app, bringing pulpits and pews into pockets and palms.
The Redmons logged on. Soon, they started a local watch group – now with almost 60 members. Every Sunday, about 25 people visit their house and livestream a service together. 
“It makes you feel like you’re still a part of a local church even though you’re using technology,” Ms. Redmon says, adding that the app changed their definition of church itself. “When we wake up every day we think everything is church. So if we’re going shopping at the grocery store or if we’re driving our car and we’re singing worship music, all of that means church.”
The Redmons’ experience is increasingly the norm: Call it church, gone mobile. For many, digital tools are just the latest innovation in church history, no different than cathedrals or the printing press.
“When we think of the Great Commission – and going and making disciples – this is a different way of going,” says Lori Bailey, communications director for Oklahoma’s Life.Church, which has one of America’s largest online ministries. “There might be some people who go with their feet, and there might be other people who go with their keyboards.”
A “new front door” Like the rest of society, church leaders initially thought digital technology would change everything, says Tim Hutchings, professor of religious ethics at England’s University of Nottingham. But when the internet grew banal, so did online ministry. “The ways in which the internet has most changed society are the hardest to see,” he says. “They become an invisible part of how we do everyday life. You kind of forget that there was ever anything else.”
A 2016 study from Pew Research Center said nearly 60% of adults under 30 used the internet while searching for a new church, compared with just 12% of adults older than 65. Life.Church’s online services alone have recorded more than half a million unique visitors, says Ms. Bailey. Their Bible app, YouVersion, is approaching 400 million downloads. 
“The online is the new front door of the church,” says Ed Stetzer, executive director of Wheaton College’s Billy Graham Center.
This digital shift comes at a particularly vulnerable moment for U.S. religion. Gallup recently reported that church membership fell 20% in the past 20 years. A 2016 Pew study found that just half of Americans attend church once or twice a month. “Nones” are America’s fastest-growing religious group.
At the same time, the Pew research found that about half of those attending less frequently said their biggest obstacle was “practical difficulties,” such as work or travel. If some shrinking congregations stem from busyness rather than lack of belief, these churches hope, the convenience of church online could help boost attendance.
A real connection? Online churches are not without their critics, many of whom worry that technology allows people to keep religion at arm’s length. Laura Turner, a San Francisco-based writer, recently criticized the impersonal aspects of online churches last year in an opinion piece for The New York Times.
“A lot of churches seek growth at all costs,” she says in an interview with the Monitor. “For a lot of these churches, they’re trying to expand their imprint – and almost their brand – by creating apps, by putting services online, by counting their online campuses. And that comes, I think, at a real cost of having in-person community.”
If Christians find themselves too busy for Sunday service, Ms. Turner says, they shouldn’t change how they attend church – they should lead a less busy life. 
“In an age where people tend not to interact with other people as much, where it’s a lot easier to sort of arrange our lives so that we don’t have to interact with people ... I think putting church on our phones can be a dangerous thing,” says Ms. Turner.
Others, like Mr. Stetzer, support online ministry but still think church is done best in person. “My avatar always looks happy,” he says. “On my Instagram, I’m living my best life every day. So the challenge is if that’s not true, we need someone to weep with us and to laugh with us.”
But supporters of online ministry argue that in-person attendance doesn’t always promote community.
Mark Venti, executive pastor of central ministries at Churchome, says people can easily slip in and out unseen in stadium-sized buildings. The anonymity enabled through the internet actually allows many to better connect online. Mr. Venti says he has used the church’s app to reach people struggling with divorce or debating suicide – people he’s never met in person and likely never will. 
The internet allows the elderly or people with disabilities to attend without discomfort. People in countries where Christianity is banned can worship more safely. Those with weekend shifts can use online church to keep their job and their faith. 
Making church “addictive” In order to grapple with declining attendance nationwide, Mr. Venti and others at Churchome are trying to make their ministry “more addictive.” He wants to give church the same accessibility that makes him buy too much on Amazon. But that goal, he says, brings a new entrepreneurial mindset. Pastors listen to God; startups listen to the consumer.   
“We’re not in Silicon Valley nor are the people that we’re partnering with developer-wise, but it’s definitely changed our world,” says Mr. Venti. “And so we’re going to [ask] how can we use that mentality and those tools to help the church too.”
Around the turn of the century Life.Church’s most advanced technology was air conditioning, says Bobby Gruenewald, a pastor and the church's innovation leader. Their growth since then has come in part from one of their aligning values: “We will do anything short of sin to reach people who don’t know Christ.”
Mr. Gruenewald says the best thing they ever did for YouVersion was add a streak counter – à la Snapchat – that tracks the consecutive number of days you read scripture. With this focus on habit formation, he isn’t afraid that Life.Church is distracting people into their ministry. The Bible, he thinks, will change you no matter why you read it. 
“It’s trying to compete against the other bazillion apps that they have on their phone that have all the same kind of noise that’s vying for their attention,” Mr. Gruenewald says.
Same service in New Mexico and New York The Redmons say they use Churchome’s app at least once every day. On family trips to the West Coast, they’ve visited in person just to see what it’s like. But even in Dallas, Churchome is still their home church.
One of the first to embrace a multisite structure, Life.Church now has 33 locations, but only one pastor – at least only one who preaches. On Sundays, each Life.Church from New Mexico to New York streams the same prerecorded message from Pastor Craig Groeschel, based in Oklahoma City. 
The branch in Albany – which Barna Group listed as America’s sixth-least Christian city this year – can attract more than 60 congregants even on the fourth service of the day on a Sunday. 
Walking inside, visitors meet a T-shirt-wearing welcome team and Christian pop on the radio. Pre-service worship resembles a concert more than a choir. Hands raised and eyes closed, congregants sway and spotlights circle. Projected onto three screens, “Pastor Craig” interacts with the crowd from afar. Albany members laugh at his jokes. 
Their web-based Church Online offers 10 services a day – complete with worship, preaching, praying, tithing, and volunteer-staffed chat rooms. Many of the songs are similar. Mr. Groeschel preaches the same sermon. You can leave with a left-click.
“Church should be a little bit like ‘Cheers,’” says Mr. Stetzer, “where not maybe everyone knows your name, but at least several people know your name.” 
That, or your username.

Texto completo: The Florida Everglades can be a contentious place. Politicians, conservationists and farmers never seem to agree on much.
Debate among scientists tends to be collegial. But a new study on coral and the Florida Keys that gained national headlines last week has reignited a decades-old dispute over pollution and the Everglades.
The study, published in the journal Marine Biology by Florida Atlantic University marine biologist Brian LaPointe, concludes that water from the southern Everglades is harming reefs near Looe Key. LaPointe said water sampling he conducted over 30 years showed that big pulses of water from the Everglades' Shark River preceded the Keys' mass bleaching events over the years. He says the remote river is polluted with nitrogen from farms and urban development, which can harm corals.
"There is, you know, multiple lines of evidence showing that run-off from the Everglades is a contributing factor to algal blooms and nitrogen enrichment," LaPointe said.
But at least 16 scientists who work in the Everglades are raising questions. They say more widespread monitoring doesn't appear to support the findings of excess nitrogen. They're taking a closer look and plan to submit a formal rebuttal.
"That would be very surprising," said aquatic biologist Evelyn Gaiser, who leads a team of Everglades scientists as part of a longterm research project at Florida International University established by the National Science Foundation in 1980 and involving 29 institutions. None were asked to peer-review the article, she said.
"We have an incredible wealth of data that we can evaluate to help understand those trends and dynamics," she said. So far, they show nitrogen only spiking during natural events like tropical storms, cold freezes and hurricanes.
The South Florida Water Management District said in an email that its monitoring also failed to detect dangerous levels of nitrogen in Florida Bay outside severe storms.
Spokesman Randy Smith said the agency was also reviewing the findings.
The editor of the journal article, Sandra Shumway, a Universitiy of Connecticut marine biologist who specializes in shellfish, said by email she was traveling and unavailable for an interview.
Part of the complexity is understanding the dynamic between nitrogen and phosphorus, the two chemicals at play in the ecosystem. Seagrass thrives on a ratio of high nitrogen and low phosphorus. Reefs, which are disappearing at an alarming rate and now in the midst of an unprecedented disease outbreak, are the opposite.
If LaPointe is correct, the consequences could be major. Everglades restoration is based largely on the premise that flood protection has cut off the southern Everglades from the water that naturally flowed out of Lake Okeechobee, down the river of grass and out marshes into the vast seagrass meadows in Florida Bay. The meadows help maintain the kind of gin-clear water that reefs need to thrive by stabilizing the muddy bottom. They also provide food and habitat for the rich mix of marine life that lives on reefs.
Over the years, too little water has made Florida Bay's seagrass vulnerable to drought. In droughts in 1987 and again in 2015, the bay became too salty and triggered major die-offs. More than 60 square-miles of seagrass died by 2016. The 1980s die-off set the stage for catastrophic algae blooms that caused the bay to crash.
The state of Florida has spent millions, including $880 million for filtering marshes, to clean water and get it back into the the southern Everglades. But it focuses on phosphorus, the chemical in fertilizer coming off sugar fields and in water out of Lake Okeechobee. Too much phosphorus can cause cattails and other plants to grow in the sparse marshes and interrupt the flow of water and over-stimulate seagrasses. The state does not focus on removing nitrogen.
In 1999, Everglades scientists published findings blaming the drought for the die-off, a finding largely accepted by South Florida's scientific circles.
But LaPointe has long argued that elevated nitrogen flowing from the southern marshes, not the dead seagrass, caused the blooms. Four years after the 1999 study, he published comments saying seagrass biologists Jay Zieman and Jim Fourqurean overstated the impact from the drought and called their findings "untenable."
Zieman and Fourqurean fired back in a published response, saying LaPointe misinterpreted data from another scientist at Everglades National Park. They said his findings illustrated "a repeated lack of understanding of the geography and hydrology of the southen Everglades and Florida Bay."
The nutrient-starved Everglades remove most of the nitrogen from water flowing in to the bay, they said, and the Gulf of Mexico is likely a far larger source.
Scientists also say the data he relies on for this study measured Everglades nitrogen at the north end, near Tamiami Trail, not the mouth of the river.
LaPointe looked at nitrogen levels in water he sampled over 30 years at Looe Key, about 25 miles east of Key West. He also looked at chlorophyll-a to see what affect the nitrogen was having on water and at nitrogen levels in seaweed.
Leaky septic tanks and deadend canals have long been blamed for driving up nitrogen levels in water around the Keys. Monroe County has spent about $1 billion to convert the string of islands to a central sewer line. The county had planned to spend about another $700 million to clean up canals before Irma hit.
LaPointe said while it's clear that local sources provide some nitrogen, his research found it's likely carried from the Everglades as well. He said water sampling from 2010 and 2011 showed elevated levels of nitrogen at Shark River. Drifter studies also prove water flowing from the mouth of the river can reach Looe Key.
"This has been covered, this concern, this back and forth has been published in the New York Times, Nature Magazine and others," he said. At the time, he said Everglades scientists were criticized for ignoring the role of nitrogen.
"I'm one of those scientists that was really never part of that Florida Bay club," he said.
LaPointe's critics say he's cherry-picking his information in this latest study and ignoring the bigger picture. He relies on his own sampling from a single reef and water collected at Shark River over just two years. They say a broader picture captured by longterm monitoring by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Everglades research project at Florida International University should have been considered.
Given what's at stake, Gaiser said scientsts would normally confer with one another if data suggest unexpected findings.
"The way that many of us would react to that is to reach out to colleagues and build as robust of an analysis as possible to figure out what's going on," she said. "You have a result that isn't what most scientists would anticipate, then you would want to dig in more deeply and see if there might be some other explanation."
The team is now reviewing LaPointe's study. Their rebuttal will undergo the same peer-review as LaPointe's paper.

Texto completo: According to the New York Times, toll booths are being phased out on many toll roads in favor of electronic toll collection, including on the New York State Thruway and crossings such as the Whitestone bridge.
The reason? Electronic toll collection reduces traffic, pollution and crashes.
So, why is the Maine Turnpike Authority spending millions of dollars on a new York toll booth that will be outdated and an embarrassment to Maine by the time it opens?

Teacher feels stood up by Maine delegation
I was selected through a competitive process by the Friends of the World War II Memorial to participate in their teachers conference from July 16-20, that included breakfast inside the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
I am the first teacher from Maine to be selected for this educational program, where 40 teachers from around the country gather to learn about teaching the Second World War and its legacy. All but a handful of states sent at least one staffer, and most had a member of Congress attend this breakfast.
It was embarrassing for Maine that I was one of a few teachers to have no one from their state in attendance. Each member of Congress or staff who attended praised us teachers. I sat alone and watched as Rep. Brian Mast (Fla.), Rep. Vicky Hartzler (Mo.), and Rep. Donald McEachin (Va.) came by to chat with us.
I know members of Congress are busy, but what a lesson to bring back to my students that Chellie Pingree, Jared Golden, Susan Collins and Angus King are all so busy (or apathetic) about education and/or World War II that they couldn't even be bothered to send a staffer to meet with me for a few minutes in the Capitol.

Two political schools are meant to meet in middle Political divisions in America grow deeper and more distressing and are manifested in both public and private domains. Members of Congress spend much of their time attacking each other and not attacking our problems. Friends and families are estranged from each other over politics. "Social" media make it possible for us all to insult, publicly, people we have never met. It shouldn't and needn't be this way.
One interpretation of the history of American political thought is that American conservatism and American liberalism are both descended from the same liberal tradition, going back at least to John Locke of the 17th century, who believed that all of us, by nature, are free and equal. (This can be confusing, because the term "liberal" is used in two somewhat different ways.) In practical politics, we have usually oscillated between our versions of conservatism and liberalism and have found it difficult to settle on an optimal position in the middle. But we all share Locke's fundamental belief.
Conservatism and liberalism are not opposites; they complement each other. (The opposite of "liberal" is "illiberal.") "Liberalism" suggests freedom, generosity, tolerance.
"Conservatism" suggests stability, caution toward sudden change, preservation of what is good. We all share all of these values. We differ in how we prioritize them and in how we wish to use our government to express them, but our similarities are more fundamental than our differences.
With most controversial issues, there are good ideas and valid concerns on both sides. Liberals tend to bring idealism to the discussion, conservatives to bring realism. Both are needed to arrive at effective solutions. If our politicians understood it, they could accomplish more and better enjoy their work.

Collins' bill promotes energy innovation
Recently, Sen. Susan Collins introduced the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act and co-sponsored the complementary Promoting Grid Storage Act. As a member of the Portland business community working to advance clean and efficient energy generation and storage solutions, I appreciate the goals of these bills and hope Congress will work to enact them.
Energy storage is one of the keys to improving the efficiency and reliability of our electric grid, reducing energy costs, and promoting the further adoption of renewable resources. As an example, Introspective Systems, the company I co-founded in Portland, is at the forefront of the revolution to manage variable renewable energy.
Our Transactive Energy technology uses the market to control and manage electricity demand - putting consumers in charge is one of many ways to improve new technologies for the grid. Storage is another - our Isle au Haut microgrid project utilizes two types of energy storage (super-capacitors and thermal energy) to make the grid more responsive.
Advanced energy storage still needs government research to move the technology to the next level. The BEST Act is one way that we can do that.
These bills would help innovative American companies work toward the rapid commercialization of clean energy technologies, including grid-scale storage research. The BEST Act could help to improve the coordination and collaboration of the Department of Energy's energy storage research efforts with public and private entities seeking to expand their energy storage capabilities. Public-private partnerships are the most effective way to address climate change, spur job growth and strengthen national security.
Thank you, Sen. Collins, for empowering our country's emerging energy technologies.

'World's Smartest Dog,' Who Knew 1,022 Nouns, Dies at 15

Texto completo: Many owners struggle to teach their dogs to sit, fetch or even bark on command, but John W. Pilley, a professor emeritus of psychology at Wofford College, taught his Border collie to understand more than 1,000 nouns, a feat that earned them both worldwide recognition.
For some time, Dr. Pilley had been conducting his own experiment teaching dogs the names of objects and was inspired by Border collie farmers to rethink his methods.
Dr. Pilley was given a black-and-white Border collie as a gift by his wife Sally.
For three years, Dr. Pilley trained the dog, named Chaser, four to five hours a day: He showed her an object, said its name up to 40 times, then hid it and asked her to find it. He used 800 cloth animal toys, 116 balls, 26 Frisbees and an assortment of plastic items to ultimately teach Chaser 1,022 nouns.
In 2013, Dr. Pilley published his findings that explained that Chaser was taught to understand sentences containing a prepositional object, verb and direct object.
Chaser died on Tuesday at 15. She had been living with Dr. Pilley's wife and their daughter Robin in Spartanburg. Dr. Pilley died last year at 89.
Another daughter, Pilley Bianchi, said on Saturday that Chaser had been in declining health in recent weeks. "The vet really determined that she died of natural causes," Ms. Bianchi said. "She went down very quickly."
Ms. Bianchi, who helped her father train Chaser, said the dog had been undergoing acupuncture for arthritis but had no other known illnesses.
Ms. Bianchi said Chaser was buried in the backyard with the family's other beloved dogs and with some of her father's ashes.
"What we would really like people to understand about Chaser is that she is not unique," Ms. Bianchi said. "It's the way she was taught that is unique. We believed that my father tapped into something that was very simple: He taught Chaser a concept which he believed worked infinitely greater than learning a hundred behaviors."
Ms. Bianchi said that her father's experiment was "uncharted territory" in animal cognition research, pointing to news media coverage calling Chaser "the world's smartest dog."
"Her language learning is very high-level, powerful science," she said.
Chaser understood that words have independent meaning and understood common nouns as well as proper nouns, Ms. Bianchi said.
If Chaser had 30 balls, Ms. Bianchi said, she would be able to understand each one by its proper-noun name and also as a part of a group of objects. "She learned the theory of one to many and many to one, which is learning one object could have many names and many names can apply to one object or one person," she said.
Greg Nelson, a veterinarian at Central Veterinary Associates in Valley Stream, N.Y., said humans were learning that animals have a deeper understanding of the world around them.
"People have always been under the belief that animals respond to commands based on a rewards system," he said. "Learn limited commands and tricks, then get a treat."
But "they do have a language among themselves, spoken and unspoken," he added. "And it's apparent that they can understand the human language probably in much the same way as we learn a foreign language."
Ms. Bianchi said that Hub City Animal Project, an organization dedicated to animal homelessness, sponsored a bronze statue of Chaser that will be placed outside the Children's Museum of the Upstate in Spartanburg next year.
Dr. Pilley's footprints, also in bronze, will be placed beside the statue of Chaser, and a portion of a street near the museum will be renamed Chaser the Border Collie Boulevard, according to Ms. Bianchi.
Dr. Pilley told The New York Times in 2014 that "the big lesson is to recognize that dogs are smarter than we think, and given time, patience and enough enjoyable reinforcement, we can teach them just about anything."

Texto completo: As the summer will soon end, our children will return to school in a matter of weeks with changes coming. When we look back at the previous year, one fact has become unavoidable: Republican leadership has left a trail of manipulation and dishonesty.
Beginning the 2019 session, Senate President Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, removed Sen. Kenny Mann, R-Monroe, from his post as chair of the Senate Education Committee. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, a first- term legislator with no public education experience, replaced Mann as chair of the committee. Why?
To push for charter schools and educational savings accounts and serve as a shill for the Republican Party. Mann supported striking teachers in 2018, and his removal as committee chairman represents an obvious political retaliation.
GOP leadership then introduced Senate Bill 451 (the education omnibus bill) to allow for charter schools, ESAs and a number of other changes that would not assist students or teachers. GOP leaders consulted out-of

Texto completo: Like so many, I was transfixed with all the hoopla over last week's 50th anniversary of America's landing on the moon.
There were TV specials, a PBS documentary and the New York Times outdid itself with a special section that covered virtually every minute of that space flight that had America holding its breath for more than a week.
It also reminded me of the many contributions that this government project wound up contributing to America's businesses, consumers and the nation's economy.
Companies now produce and make profits from things like memory foam, space blankets, Dustbusters, freeze-dried foods, scratch-resistant glasses, cochlear hearing implants and up to 2,000 more byproducts that were either invented or created as part of the space program.
That's not been unusual throughout the country's history. Government has frequently been the catalyst that had the wherewithal the people working together to go places where private companies or individuals can't.
It's why I have to laugh when a letter writer lectures me that government has never created a job, or when a blowhard like Rush Limbaugh spouts, "With the exception of the military, I defy you to name one government program that has worked and alleviated the problem it was created to solve."
I know this might be too much to ask, but open a book, Rush, and do some research.
The obvious, of course, are the problems that government programs like Social Security and Medicare solved, lifting the elderly out of poverty and county-run old folks' homes and providing health care coverage they would otherwise not afford to have.But, the sport of belittling government, which began with Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, forgets how government has consistently worked as a partner with business and labor to better the lives of all Americans. That's been true since the claiming of the Northwest Territory after the Revolutionary War, which, coupled with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, provided land and resources for pioneer Americans .
Government pulled America out of the Great Depression of the 1930s, working to reform banking and creating jobs for the unemployed at a time when the country's future was dangerously bleak. The Interstate highway system that began in the 1950s under Dwight Eisenhower jump-started the auto and trucking industries and was, and still is, responsible for creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Government researchers helped develop the first polio vaccine. The nation's governmental health centers have made major breakthroughs that have helped doctors and hospitals fight disease and injuries. The National Institute of Health has funded university medical departments to find new cures. The Department of Agriculture has shared research on increasing crop yields and promoted conservation practices to prevent another Dust Bowl calamity.
All that is just for starters. One of the long forgotten, but among the most important government programs in the country's history, was the GI bill that, after World War II, was responsible for educating and assisting young former soldiers to begin a new life a program that created the nation's formidable middle class.
There are those who've made political careers out of scapegoating government, and many Americans are convinced that government can do no good.
While there surely are examples of government bungling our immigration crisis is one of them the truth is government programs typically work for all Americans.
We just celebrated one of them. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times: dzweifel@madison.com.

Recession? Really? This 10-year economic expansion won't just die of old age

Texto completo: Happy birthday to America’s longest-ever economic expansion. June marked 10 years of growth, matching 1991–2001 as the longest expansion in U. S. history. And the good news continues. Third-quarter numbers will set new records.
But rather than partying, most pundits are preparing eulogies. This expansion is too old, they fret. Wrong! Economic cycles don’t die of old age. The more folks fear that myth, the more I want to party.
Whatever finally kills this 120-month upswing, it won’t be the fact that it's more than twice as old as the 58-month average for U. S. expansions since World War II. To understand this, think globally.
Australia finished its 27th year of uninterrupted growth in 2018. It’s still running strong. Britain grew from 1992–2008 – a 16-year-long streak. That one, of course, got clobbered by the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Toyota Supra is back: Nurture beats nature with thrilling results

So, if age didn’t kill these longer expansions, why should it doom America’s now?
People think about many phenomena as they do about biological life, where relative old age within any species eventually kills – technically called senescence. Senescence is irrelevant to economies. Expansions die from multitrillion-dollar negative shocks. Historically, central banks, like our Federal Reserve, were often the culprit. They have often misread the tea leaves, feared an inflationary overheated reality and tightened evermore while the economy weakened. While I don’t think rate cuts are necessary now, that central banks globally are starting to cut shows they don’t fear overheating now.
Nor should they. This expansion has averaged quarterly GDP growth in the low 2% annual range. Sluggish! The postwar average pre-2009 was 3. 3% including recessions. Until last August, wage growth hit 3% year over year in just one month this entire cycle. Fed data show workers with only a high school degree (or less) fared worse, with wages falling 4. 2% in total from 2007 to 2013. They didn’t regain pre-recession levels until 2017. Nearly any economic metric you examine – inflation, loan and money supply growth, industrial output, consumer spending – shows slow growth.
Recession:The economic expansion is poised to be the longest ever.
Work opportunities: Economy adds 224,000 jobs, easing recession fears
The cause? The Federal Reserve and its early long executed “quantitative easing” –bond buying it wrongly called “stimulus. ” Why? That bond buying lowered long-term interest rates. Fed officials thought that would make for eager borrowers. But banks must supply those loans. Banks fund long-term lending by borrowing at short-term rates. Hence, that spread, between short and long-term rates – the infamous “yield curve” spread – is a proxy for new lending’s profitability. The Fed’s lowering long rates when short-term rates were near zero pinched the profitability of lending. So banks lent begrudgingly. Businesses struggled to get credit. The quantity of money didn’t grow, keeping inflation low and economic growth dragging. The Fed’s quantitative Quaalude turned an economic “boom” into a low, long, joyless trudge toward growth.
This longest, slowest expansion has another accolade: It is history’s most hated. Throughout, pundits have dissed growth. Early on, it was normal freaked-out skepticism, folks fearing a depression, double-dip or Japanese-style lost decade. Those fears never fully vanished. Every wiggly growth slowdown – typical variations within any economic cycle – spur recession fear to this day. See current worries over slowing manufacturing data. Pundits claim this wobbly old economic upswing is dying before their eyes.
As I detailed recently, other people's fears are your friend. They keep euphoria at bay and lower expectations. That makes positive surprise easier to attain, buoying stocks. That also explains why history’s longest bull market runs parallel to this long joyless expansion – twin long, slow ascents. Stocks’ 16% annualized return this time lags bull markets’ 21% historical average.
Forget fears of age killing this expansion. As long as folks hate this still-growing U. S. economy, stocks have room to climb.

Texto completo: The most successful people pause for a few seconds and then proactively decide how to respond. They recognize their internal instincts, but then thoughtfully consider a range of options before issuing a knee-jerk response. They think about what would be most productive in that moment.
We all get provoked. An angry associate; a cranky customer; a snarling spouse. In these cases, the primitive part of our brain designed to protect us in the wild kicks in and our autonomic response is to recklessly fire back. We lash out, hit below the belt and respond with uncontrollable emotion.
That's where the problems begin. We end up saying things we regret and damaging relationships. The impulsive reaction generally creates far more damage than good and can lead to the undoing of companies, families and careers.
Fortunately, we have a choice. No matter how aggressive the stimuli, we can respond deliberately. Think about your own breathing for a moment. You can control your breath (hold it, speed it up, pace it) or you can let your body run on autopilot. You have the identical choice to make when aggravated.
The most successful people pause for a few seconds and then proactively decide how to respond. They recognize their internal instincts, but then thoughtfully consider a range of options before issuing a knee-jerk response. They think about what would be most productive in that moment. They put their ego aside and deeply consider the path that will lead to the best outcome. They realize that they may not be in control of what comes at them, but are in absolute and complete control of their response.
In the game of chess, grandmasters think many moves ahead. When an opponent makes a threatening gambit, the master pauses and considers the full spectrum of possibility. She thinks about her next move, her opponent's various reactions and then which move should be made for each of the various what-if scenarios. While the game is combative by nature, strong players are deliberate and emotionless at every step of the way.
In the coming week, you will likely be provoked by someone or something. Why leave your response to caveman instincts when you can be the grandmaster of your own life? If each of us took that one small step – to pause, evaluate and carefully think before we react – imagine how much better our community would be.
When you choose your responses wisely, you elevate your game, both personally and professionally.

Romance-novel fans will swoon RomantiConn hosts 64 authors on Aug. 3

Texto completo: Kitty Berry's world is much like anyone else's. She lives in a modest house in a middle-class suburban neighborhood in Trumbull. She has a 9-to-5 job. She has three grown sons.
Her imagination, however, is something else. It holds an idealized world of fantasy men, intelligent but love-struck women, dramatic turns of events, heartbreak, cliffhanger endings and happily-ever-afters.
Berry is a romance novelist. She has published 15 books. Another three come out this summer. She loves the genre, the people (mostly women) who create it and fans (mostly women) who gobble it up.
Berry has organized RomantiConn, a one-day get-together of writers and readers in Trumbull on Aug. 3. Berry wants everyone at the Conn to glory in the world of starry-eyed daydreams put down on paper.
The RomantiConn eventbrite page describes Berry (her nom de plume) as an author of contemporary romance "with dirty words, sexy alpha-males, and sex! Lots and lots of sex!"
"Romance novels are about escapism. Everyone laughs about how far-fetched they are, but I have a real life. I cook. I clean. I have a husband. I have three kids. I don't want to read about real life," says Berry. "I write about things that are different, that are perfect."
A display case in Berry's home holds copies of all of her books: "Anatomy of Love," "Vines of Ivy," "You Are My Reason," "Second Chances" and others. Her shelves are full of books by authors she admires, including Jennifer Weiner, Candace Bushnell, Meg Cabot, Sophie Kinsella and, foremost, E.L. James, author of the "50 Shades of Grey" series.
"50 Shades" moved Berry away from an interest in "chick lit" into an interest in romance. Although the genres seem similar, they have differences.
"In chick lit, romance can be there but it doesn't have to," she says. "With romance, it's all about the relationship."
Different authors use various time-honored romance tropes - the billionaire, military men, doctors, best friends, second-chance, paranormal - and a few tropes have emerged from the shadows in recent years.
"Male-male relationships, female-female relationships and BDSM have always been there, but now they've gone mainstream," she says.
All of the books, however, need to have a happily-ever-after ending.
"If you write a trilogy that has cliffhangers, it might not be the happily-ever-after at the end of one book, but it will in the end," she says. "It usually goes they meet, all hell breaks loose when something happens. Usually it's the guy who does some dumb stuff. Then there is angst and they break up and then get back together."
Berry's specialty is "love stories that never end." All of her books, whether they are part of a series or outside of a series, have characters that recur from book to book. This allows readers to "check in" with their favorite couples from previous readings, if only for a moment.
A total sixty-five authors - 64 women and one man - and about a dozen vendors will be at the event. Other activities include author game shows and and Q&As, one-on-one author encounters similar to speed dating and a cash bar.
Other authors attending are Alicia Peek, Angel Rose, Angela Nicole, AR. Moler, B. K Leigh, Brittany Taylor, Cara Wade, CD Gorri, Char Webster, Christi Caldwell, Christine Michelle, CM Lally, Dakota Star, Elizabeth Barone, Elizabeth Chatsworth, Elizabeth Hayley, Elsa Kurt, Gail Ward Olmsted, Gianna Gabriela, Heather Anne.

BARNARD — A new survey of luxury hotels puts a southern Vermont resort in the top five most expensive nationwide.
The survey by Luxury-Hotels.com says Twin Farms in Barnard is the fifth-priciest, with a stay costing twice as much as a night at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills.
The Luxury-Hotels.com report used the lowest available price for a double room at each property this July and August.
Most of the most expensive hotels were in the West.
The costliest on the list was The Ranch at Rock Creek in Philipsburg, Mont., where a double room for one night, including taxes and fees, will set a guest back $3,600 this summer.
Next on the list were Amangiri in Canyon Point, Utah, at $2,661 per night; The Lodge & Spa at Brush Creek Ranch in Saratoga, Wyo., at $2,337 per night; The Point in Lake Placid, N.Y., at $2,327 per night; and Twin Farms at $1,882 per night.
A stay in a cottage, suite or room at Twin Farms comes with a hand-made wooden Stave puzzle for guests to take home; free luggage unpacking and packing services, free same-day laundry service, and access to a Tesla charging station, the resort says on its website.
While dogs are allowed at some of the cottages at the 300-acre Twin Farms, children are not. Guests must be 16 or over.
The resort won the Travel & Leisure reader poll’s “Top Hotel in the Northeast” in 2018.
Last year, people who live near the resort said they saw a Sikorsky S-76B helicopter with the “Trump” name on it landing there, and the New York Times and Vanity Fair reported that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were vacationing in Vermont.
Trump and Kushner reportedly were also aboard a Trump-branded helicopter that was spotted refueling at the Lebanon Municipal Airport on around the same time.
Twin Farms is the former homestead of Nobel Prize-winning author Sinclair Lewis and journalist Dorothy Thompson.

Texto completo: Theodore Roosevelt died a century ago in January, but his political legacy remains up for grabs -- today, perhaps, more than ever. Everybody wants him on their team. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, has repeatedly cited Roosevelt as her favorite president and her "dream" running mate because, like her, he pushed a progressive agenda that included taking on industrial trusts. "Man, I'd like to have that guy at my side," she told Ari Melber of MSNBC in March.
Roosevelt was, of course, a Republican, at least until 1912, when he ran as a third-party candidate. Still, many in that party continue to claim him as one of their own -- even as a forebear of President Trump. "I think the United States once again has a president whose vision, energy, and can-do spirit is reminiscent of President Teddy Roosevelt," Vice President Mike Pence said in 2017.
At a gathering earlier this month dedicated to building a nationalist conservative movement -- called, appropriately, the National Conservatism Conference -- Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri approvingly cited Roosevelt in a speech about the rising threat of "cosmopolitanism." Mr. Hawley, one of the many young Republicans jockeying to take over the party once Mr. Trump leaves office, knows what he's talking about: He wrote a well-received book about Roosevelt's political philosophy.
Like a handful of other figures in American history -- Washington, Lincoln, King -- Roosevelt inspires admiration across the political spectrum, in part because his own politics are so hard to place. Through his career and his voluminous writings, he can appear as a reformer, a nativist, an imperialist, a trustbuster, a conservative and a progressive -- often at the same time.
And it makes sense that Roosevelt is in such demand. He came to prominence in the late 19th century, a time marked by many of the same challenges we face today. Immigration was reshaping the population. Technology and globalization were tearing down old industries and building new ones. Corporate power was at an apogee. The Republican Party was at war with itself.
Roosevelt offered answers to all these challenges, and it's easy to see why a left-leaning Democrat like Ms. Warren would find them compelling. One of his first significant steps in office was to file suit against Northern Securities, a railroad holding company he claimed was illegal under the Sherman Antitrust Act. Though often skeptical of organized labor, he supported unions. He was, famously, America's conservationist in chief.
Roosevelt also backed significant expansions of the regulatory state, like the Pure Food and Drug Act. And he pushed for greater government control over a number of industries through the Interstate Commerce Clause, a tool later used by his distant cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt to build the New Deal.
His progressive zeal continued after he left office in 1909. A year later, Roosevelt delivered one of his most famous speeches -- "The New Nationalism" -- in Osawatomie, Kan. In it, he called for a generous minimum wage, a progressive income tax, an estate tax and laws that would essentially ban corporate interests from politics.
"The man who wrongly holds that every human right is secondary to his profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare," he said -- the sort of idea that, he noted, would surely get him branded a communist.
But if Roosevelt was a progressive, he was not a particularly liberal one, especially by today's standards. He had little patience for pluralism -- he derided what he deemed "hyphenated Americans" -- and he believed that America's future depended on constructing a unified, common culture, a call that echoes strongly among those pushing for a new conservative nationalism today.
At the National Conservatism Conference, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, picked up on one of Roosevelt's core themes in his speech, "Why America Isn't an Idea." Like Mr. Lowry, Roosevelt believed that America's political culture was rooted not in universal principles about things like liberty and individual rights, but in the specifics of its history, its landscape and the experience of its people -- which to Roosevelt meant predominantly Northern Europeans.
That's one reason Roosevelt, like many of today's conservative nationalists, endorsed restrictions on immigration. In his 1905 message to Congress, he said: "It will be a great deal better to have fewer immigrants, but all of the right kind, than a great number of immigrants, many of whom are necessarily of the wrong kind."
Especially in his later years, Roosevelt's nationalism, already problematic, became overtly racist. He proposed subsidies for white Americans to have more children and endorsed sterilizing the poor and mentally handicapped -- a eugenic natalism that Senator Hawley writes in his book, "Theodore Roosevelt: Preacher of Righteousness," was "not entirely dissimilar to that pursued by the German Third Reich."
In the book, Mr. Hawley takes pains to criticize Roosevelt for his racism, which he concedes was central to Roosevelt's vision for America, and not just an artifact of his time and place. Roosevelt's welfare-state agenda, he writes, was not an end in itself; it was a means to facilitate the growth of a culturally homogeneous nation, dominated by the descendants of Anglo-Saxon settlers. Ms. Warren may dream of having a trustbuster as a running mate, but probably not one who refers to white people as the "forward race."
Still, Roosevelt's nationalism presents an even bigger problem for the right. Like Roosevelt, Mr. Hawley and others at the National Conservatism Conference endorsed a long list of ideas to facilitate a common American culture -- breaking up big business, protecting domestic labor, rebuilding heartland economies.
But all of that requires a powerful, centralized federal government, rooted in an expansive executive branch -- the kind that Roosevelt favored and Ms. Warren supports, but that sits at odds with the main currents of national conservatism and its belief that the federal government has been captured by "cosmopolitan" elites.
It's a problem that Mr. Hawley concedes in his book. "In the long run, then, Roosevelt's tenure represented not so much the arrival of the imperial presidency as it did the birth of a fourth branch of government whose existence has strained the constitutional order," he writes.
To be fair, Roosevelt is not yet a poster boy for the nationalist right. But even if they don't fully embrace him, his attitude toward public policy illuminates the difficulty faced by any movement that eschews both big government and big business. In both practical and political terms, it's hard to see how you can tame one without the resources of the other.
Perhaps, then, the question is not whether Roosevelt belongs to the right or the left; rather, it's why anyone today wants to claim him at all. There is a lot to admire about Roosevelt, and also a lot to abhor, and in the end perhaps the best to be said is that he was a man of dynamic intellect and sometimes despicable ideas who drove his country forward until he, inevitably, fell behind the curve.
One thing is sure, though -- Roosevelt would have laughed at the thought of anyone picking apart his legacy to partisan ends. "There are on each side unhealthy extremists who like to take half of any statement and twist it into an argument in favor of themselves or against their opponents," he wrote in 1900. "No single sentence or two is sufficient to explain a man's full meaning."

Texto completo: The head of Border Patrol in El Paso, Texas — who drew criticism this year over conditions for migrants in his care — has been transferred to Detroit, where he will lead the federal law enforcement agency in Michigan and some other northern states.
Aaron Hull, the Chief Patrol Agent for Border Patrol in the El Paso sector in western Texas, will start Monday as the interim Chief Patrol Agent for Border Patrol for the Detroit sector on temporary duty assignment, according to an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The official said that "multiple members of the Border Patrol's senior leadership team are currently rotating on" temporary duty "assignments in both Headquarters roles and senior field positions nationwide."
Hull will oversee the Detroit sector of Border Patrol, which includes all of Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. The area he is responsible for has 863 miles of international border with Canada.
Hull has drawn criticism for how Border Patrol has housed migrants in the El Paso area in Texas, which has seen an influx of migrants, mainly from Central American countries. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General issued an alert about what it called "dangerous overcrowding" in migrant centers in the El Paso area that Hull oversaw.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and 13 other Reps. visited Border Patrol centers in El Paso and Clint earlier this month and described what they said were poor and unsanitary conditions. Tlaib told the Detroit Free Press earlier that the migrants she met in the Border Patrol centers seemed scared, with some unable to shower or get clean water and medical attention.
NBC News, which first reported the news of Hull's transfer to Detroit, said Hull is known as a "law and order" Border Patrol Chief, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. A New York Times report said "Hull is known among colleagues as tough and law-enforcement oriented," citing two Homeland Security officials.
The transfer of Hull has caused some concern among regional immigrant advocates. Lynn Tramonte, Director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said Hull's transfer to Detroit is "very bad news for Ohio & Michigan."
Border Patrol did not comment beyond a statement saying that Hull will be sent to Detroit. In an interview with CNN earlier this month, Hull said "I would dispute that the conditions are so bad as have been reported."
After the visit of Tlaib and other Reps, Border Patrol said in a statement that the migrants are getting three meals a day and clean drinking water. A Border Patrol spokesman said they have invested "in additional restroom and shower facilities, hygiene products, increased medical support and expanded transportation capabilities."
While the Detroit border area does not face the type of influx seen at the southern border, it has sizable immigrant and minority communities who have expressed concern about how Border Patrol in Michigan operates. Latinos, including those who are U.S. citizens and born in the U.S., have said they are targeted by Border Patrol.
Almost one in three people processed by Border Patrol agents in Michigan are U.S. citizens, according to data obtained by the ACLU. About 82% of foreign citizens stopped by Border Patrol are Latino, the data showed. Less than 2% of foreign citizens stopped in Michigan have a criminal record.

In our opinion: United States has no excuse to to play with election security

Texto completo: Given all the warnings from credible sources, the United States has no excuse for taking the security of elections for granted next year. A new bipartisan report by the Senate Intelligence Committee this week added a further wakeup call on this issue, concluding that all 50 states were targets of Russian hacking attempts in 2016, although it appears no results were compromised.
Preparing for 2020, each county and state, as well as the federal government, needs to find ways to assure American voters that no foreign country will seize hold of our electoral system and thwart the will of the people. Evidence suggests Russia won’t be the only problem. Iran, North Korea and China may attempt to interfere, as well, even if just using cleverly disguised propaganda or by planting false stories to a gullible audience on social media.
Congress could play a bigger role in this, although its role should remain limited to funding and general rules. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell continues to block consideration of any Democrat-sponsored bill that would provide more resources to states for new voting equipment, or that would set minimum standards for paper printouts of votes or other systems that would allow for independent audits of final results.
Election tampering has, unfortunately, become a political issue, with some Republicans worried that any admission of Russian efforts in 2016 would delegitimize Donald Trump’s election as president. This consideration may well have been part of the calculus baked into foreign election interference, but it is dangerous for national security.
The election-related bills Democrats are sponsoring should not be considered final versions. If McConnell would allow debate, they could be tempered by Republican concerns, leading to compromise legislation that helps states deal with an enormous task in a reasonable way.
The genius of the U.S. election system is that it is spread among more than 3,000 counties, parishes and boroughs, each with its own voting procedures and methods. This makes the wholesale hacking of a national election in the United States complicated and difficult.
But many states and counties are strapped for cash and continue to use antiquated equipment. A lot of the electronic voting machines, including those in Utah’s largest counties, are not connected to the internet and require a separate transfer system for moving results from machines to central tallying points. But in many places, including Utah, databases containing voter registration information are more vulnerable, although security measures are in place.
One more thing — if the United States is to protect itself thoroughly from foreign interference, Washington has to be as clear as possible about the threats and the recommended counter-procedures. Much of the report this week was blacked out for national security reasons, including recommendations. The New York Times reported that one section was titled only, “Build a Credible ...,” with the rest of that sentence and the next two paragraphs stricken.
Future reports are pending regarding Russian interference through social media. We hope these are more explicit and helpful.
Regardless, no election official or politicians in the land should be ignorant of the ongoing assaults on the nation’s complicated election system. The nation’s enemies understand well that public trust is vital to the operation of any free and democratic society. The question is whether the United States can rise above its petty political squabbles to understand this, as well.

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Virginia ‘Jinnah’ Kelson, ‘fierce advocate’ for Utah women, dies at age 90

Texto completo: The women were all set to work in Tooele coal mines. They were trained. They were going to make a good salary. Plus, they enjoyed the job, Virginia Kelson said.
But in just a few months, all the women quit.
The reason, Kelson said, was criticism from their families. Their relatives “did not like their assertiveness” and “felt that it was improper to be taking ‘men’s jobs,’” she said.
Kelson, who had helped prepare the women for mining jobs, spent decades challenging social norms and advocating for the empowerment of Utah women. Described in her obituary as “a pioneer in women’s equality in the workforce,” she died July 14 at her Salt Lake City home at the age of 90.
An open house is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday at Forest Glen Clubhouse, located at 2560 Elizabeth Street in Salt Lake City.
Kelson, commonly known as “Jinnah,” recounted the story of the failed mining experiment and other moments from her career for an oral history project with the University of Utah in 1988.
“She was really someone who I think really helped lift all women,” said Debra Daniels, director of the Women’s Resource Center at the U. “...I knew how to be a community activist by watching her be a community activist.”
Kelson established the Phoenix Institute in Salt Lake City in 1971, which helped women secure nontraditional jobs. She also founded Network Magazine, a women’s publication that circulated primarily in Utah.
She went on to help with federal and state legislation. She worked on the Displaced Homemakers Act in 1986, which assisted Utah women who had previously stayed home and wanted jobs. She supported the Equal Rights Amendment, to ensure people would not be discriminated against based on their sex. And she was on Sen. Orrin Hatch’s women’s advisory committee and worked with the Utah Republican on child care issues.
“Jinnah Kelson was a soft-spoken but fierce advocate and voice for women,” former Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Christine Durham said in an email.
Former Congresswoman Karen Shepherd, who was Network’s editor and publisher from 1978 to 1988, and former state Rep. Genevieve Atwood, who was on the Phoenix Institute’s board, estimated that Kelson must have helped thousands of people over her career.
“Our family is very proud of my mother's accomplishments, her legacy in the community and her voice in changing our culture’s perception about the role of women,” Leslie Kelson-Probert said in an email. “As Jinnah’s daughter, I was influenced by her strength and dedication to the things she believed in and worked toward.”
Empowering women
Kelson studied history at the U., but said she planned to “do what every other young woman did” in the 1940s. “I believed that I was going to be a homemaker, and I wanted to have lots of children, and I didn’t aspire to a career,” she said.
She married her husband, A.W. Kelson, shortly after graduating in 1950. They had two children, and Kelson also helped raise her sister’s children.
When Kelson was 40, she returned to school to study business. She was one of the few women in the program, and “we stood out like sore thumbs,” she said. But it was a moment during this time that Kelson said sent her down her career path.
When Kelson asked a male instructor why she had received a grade of C+, after routinely scoring higher on work, he told her she didn’t need a higher grade, she said. She later realized that “what he meant was because I was a woman, I didn’t need it.”
“It was the first time that I ever felt discrimination, and that was key. … That was the beginning of an interest in civil rights, discrimination and equal opportunity that led to the founding of the Phoenix Institute,” Kelson said.
Kelson helped women train to work in nontraditional roles, such as electricians and mechanics. This was partly to help them get higher pay, she said, but also because not all women fit into traditionally female jobs, such as a secretary or waitress.
She stressed that economic independence was “by far the biggest issue in the whole women’s movement.” If a woman is dependent on her husband, she can’t leave a bad relationship, Kelson said.
“If she knows that she can sustain herself and her children with or without him, then she willingly is in the relationship with him because they both have power,” Kelson said.
Kelson ran multiple programs at the institute. Daniels worked for Kelson helping adolescent girls. Kelson also held a class to teach women assertiveness.
“She realized that women don’t get anywhere unless they have confidence. And they don’t have confidence if they don’t know how to speak with confidence,” Shepherd said.
Paving the way
Kelson knew that by helping women succeed, it helped everyone in the community, Atwood said. Kelson had a talent for uniting people around a cause, she added.
In her oral history, Kelson recalled a watershed meeting in 1977 at the Salt Palace that was part of International Women’s Year activities. Thousands of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints attended, “responding to their church’s call to insure the support of ‘correct principles,’” The New York Times reported. From that, Kelson realized “we had to have a better way of communicating our problems and our positions on things,” she said, which resulted in Network Magazine.
“She kept her pulse on every avenue and opportunity that she could give to women through her connections, through grant writing, through mentoring, through education, to help them ... find the organizations that they could go and get trained and be treated with respect,” Daniels said.
Kelson said she believed that “it’s only through the education of the next generation that we will get some changes.”
“I never would have tumbled into it if I hadn’t come back to school,” Kelson said. “I wasn’t born into it. I had to be discriminated against to feel it.”
People in 2019 may think that women’s issues are “all taken care of,” Shepherd said, but “in those days, nothing had been taken care of.” Women like Kelson “were doing it from scratch,” she said.
“Many of the strides Utah women have made in the last several decades have been built on her work,” Durham said.

Texto completo: The Baltimore City Council's budget committee voted Thursday to approve $10 million to cover the information technology department's costs to recover from a ransomware attack that brought down city computer networks.
More than half the money already has been spent on consultants, equipment and overtime pay, and the legislation is being fast-tracked so it can be finalized at the council's next meeting in August.
The city's budget office has calculated the cost of the attack at $18 million, adding $8 million in lost revenue to the price of the recovery. Hackers broke into the city's networks and locked up files on May 7. They demanded a ransom equivalent to $76,000 to turn over the digital keys, but the city refused to pay.
City officials disclosed last week that they have so far spent $2.8 million hiring security consultants and other companies; $486,000 on technicians to set up new computers; $112,000 on overtime for city staff, and $1.9 million on new hardware and software. At Thursday's hearing, IT department officials said invoices were coming in still.
Although the committee agreed to forward the legislation to the council for consideration, Democratic Councilman Isaac "Yitzy" Schleifer said he wanted more information before he would vote in favor of the money. He requested copies of invoices and details about how the remaining funds would be spent.
"You could buy the neighborhood I grew up in for $10 million," Schleifer said.
Democratic Councilman Eric Costello, the committee chairman, used the hearing to press the city's IT leaders on whether they had a written disaster response plan before the attack. After being asked several times, IT director Frank Johnson acknowledged they did not, something the mayor's office previously acknowledged. Officials said it could take nine months to produce a plan, a timeline Costello said was concerning.
The origin and method of the attack remain unclear. Officials have declined to discuss the matter in detail because it is under investigation by the FBI. But an FAQ the city posted last week on its website rebutted a report by The New York Times that a tool developed by the NSA known as EternalBlue played a role.
"Our independent computer forensic experts have found no evidence that EternalBlue was a factor in the Baltimore city ransomware attack," the FAQ reads.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Scheduling five inmates for execution, including a trucker convicted of molesting and killing his 2-year-old daughter in Texas, Attorney General William Barr announced Thursday that the U.S. government will resume administering lethal injections in December.
Barr also ordered the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to use a lethal dose of pentobarbital, abandoning a three-drug combination in favor of a method used by more than a dozen states, including Texas since 2013.
“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law, and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr said.
The last federal execution took place in 2003, and only three inmates have been put to death since the U.S. government reinstated the death penalty in 1988 — including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, who was executed in 2001.
The policy shift is likely to raise the political profile of the issue heading into the 2020 general election.
Most Democratic candidates for president oppose the death penalty, while President Donald Trump has spoken often
— and sometimes wistfully — about capital punishment and his belief that executions serve as an effective deterrent and appropriate punishment for some crimes, including mass shootings and the killings of police officers.
“I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue,” Trump said last year after 11 people were gunned down in a Pittsburgh synagogue.
Among Democrats, former Vice President Joe Biden this week shifted to call for the elimination of the federal death penalty after years of supporting it. The lone Democratic White House hopeful who has publicly supported preserving capital punishment is Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, who has said he would leave it open as an option for major crimes such as terrorism.
After a botched state execution in Oklahoma in 2014, then-President Barack Obama directed the Department of Justice to conduct a review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs.
That review has been completed, the department said, and has cleared the way for executions to resume.
In Thursday’s announcement, Barr said he directed prison officials to schedule executions for five death row inmates convicted of killing “the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly.” All five inmates had exhausted their appeals, Barr said.
Set for execution at the federal prison in Terra Haute, Ind., were:
• Daniel Lewis Lee, convicted of killing a family of three, including a gun dealer and his 8-year-old daughter, in Arkansas in 1996, in a plot to steal guns and cash in hopes of establishing a whites-only nation in the Pacific Northwest. Execution date: Dec. 9.
• Lezmond Mitchell, who prosecutors say stabbed a 63-year-old grandmother to death in Arizona, then forced her 9-year-old granddaughter to sit beside her body as he drove about 40 miles before slitting the girl’s throat in 2001. Execution date: Dec. 11.
• Wesley Ira Purkey, sentenced to death for raping and killing a 16-year-old girl in Kansas City in 1998 before dismembering, burning and dumping her body in a septic pond. He also was convicted in a Kansas court of using a hammer to kill an 80-year-old woman who had polio. Execution date: Dec. 13.
• Alfred Bourgeois, a trucker from Louisiana, was convicted of killing his young daughter while making a delivery in Corpus Christi in 2002. The girl had been physically and emotionally abused and sexually assaulted before her death, prosecutors said. Execution date: Jan. 13.
• Dustin Lee Honken, who shot and killed five people — two men who planned to testify against him and a single mother and her 10-year-old and 6-year-old daughters — in Iowa in 1993. Execution date: Jan. 15.
Additional executions will be scheduled in the future, the Justice Department said.
There are 61 people on the federal death row, according to Death Row USA, a quarterly report of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
High-profile inmates on federal death row include Dylann Roof, who killed nine black church members during a Bible study session in 2015 at a South Carolina church, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who set off bombs near the Boston Marathon’s finish line in 2013, killing three people and wounding more than 260.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "The Sad Lesson From California" (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, July 16):
While Miriam Pawel is right to praise the grass-roots organizing of the Florida-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers (recipients of the 2003 R.F.K. Human Rights Award), she is wrong that the historic victory represented by New York's new farmworker bill of rights "may prove to be largely symbolic."
Signed into law this month, the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act will be transformational for New York's 100,000 agricultural workers. Those who pick our apples, harvest our vegetables and provide the milk for our lattes will see their wages increase and their working conditions improve. It will finally be illegal in the Empire State for farmworkers to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week without overtime pay, a day of rest, disability, workers' compensation or paid family leave.
Rather than a more than 40-year-old law in California that bears little resemblance to New York's hard-won legal protections, the achievements of the United Farm Workers to pass protective heat regulations (2015) and overtime pay (2016) in California provide more apt comparisons to the types of tangible improvements that are now on their way to farmworkers in New York.

India's Water Crisis
To the Editor:
Re "India's Terrifying Water Crisis," by Meera Subramanian (Op-Ed, July 16):
As a naturalized American who hails from India, I remember serious water shortages almost 30 years ago in Mumbai, where I grew up. Water was scarce and precious during scorching summers, and there were times when water tankers had to be called to fill the overhead water supply tanks of the fairly new building where my middle-class family resided. Mumbai, then called Bombay, was a teeming metropolis of about 10 million people. It now has a population of about 23 million, a lagging infrastructure and an inadequate water supply.
Other mega-cities like New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Bangalore may be even worse off. India, with more than 1.3 billion people, is set to surpass China soon as the most populous country in the world. Sadly, water problems, which have been aggravated by global warming, extreme weather patterns, deforestation and rising temperatures, have become critical in most parts of India.
Unfortunately, the pursuit of aggressive industrial growth has taken the driver's seat, and inadequate attention has been paid to environmental pollution and water scarcity, which are casually treated as collateral damage. Unless the Indian government goes on a war footing and establishes water conservation and rainwater harvesting across the country, worse water crises will be inevitable.

Out of Touch With the Real 'Middle Class'
To the Editor:
At best, the "The Middle Class and Its 'Extraordinary Burden"' (Sunday Review, July 7), which featured several ostensibly middle-class families, was overly generous with its definition of "middle class." At worst, it was horribly out of touch with the struggles of working-class Americans, justifying critics' cries that New York Times contributors are out-of-touch coastal elites.
The household income of the featured families was in the $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 range, the $ 120,00 to $ 200,000 range, and one in the $ 75,000 to $ 100,000. A Federal Reserve report in May showed that nearly four in 10 Americans can't afford a $ 400 unexpected expense, and more than 25 percent eschewed necessary medical care last year because they couldn't afford it. I doubt that any of the families from the article fall into either category, considering the most recent median household income figure is $ 61,372 (2017).
The article's point, that Americans of all stripes still have fears of instability, was lost on me because of this skewed sampling of the middle class.

Texto completo: MINNEAPOLIS -- Look up when you enter Birchbark Books & Native Arts and you'll spot a handcrafted canoe hanging above the table of current and favorite books.
An intricately carved Catholic confessional hugs a wall, although according to the store's frequently asked questions page, it was renamed a "forgiveness booth" after it was rescued from becoming a bar fixture.
At Birchbark, located at 2115 West 21st Street in Minneapolis's Kenwood neighborhood, there is much to see even before you start browsing its stacks and shelves. "It's one thing to have algorithms keep suggesting the same books to you, but it's another thing to walk in," said the store's owner, Louise Erdrich. "People are looking at you, and you're looking at actual books, so that you can be inspired and attracted by a physical book."
Erdrich, 65, has a wide range of experience with physical books. For one, she's written many of them: a memoir, children's books, poetry collections and 15 novels, including "The Round House," which won the 2012 National Book Award for fiction. An admirer of bookstores with personalities since her college days, she started Birchbark because she wanted to do something with her daughters.
"It was the year 2000, and they were at these great ages where they were very excited about books," she said. Though she had no idea how to start a bookstore, she jumped in and opened Birchbark in 2001.
The store sells mainstream fiction, nonfiction and children's books, but Native American titles, crafts and culture are its specialty. Erdrich is a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (her grandfather was its tribal chairman). She gave a shout-out to Native people in Ojibwe during her National Book Award acceptance speech, and her daughter, Persia, is an immersion teacher in the language.
"A large part of our mission has to do with uplifting and supporting Native communities," Carolyn Anderson, the store's operations manager, said. "We purchase contemporary and traditional art prints, cards, jewelry, crafts, skin care and food items directly from Native American artists and artisans usually from this region."
The shop's décor also incorporates genuine birch trees. As Erdrich recalls, her contractors found a batch of blown-down birches in Wisconsin and transported them by pickup truck to Minneapolis to be put up in the store -- much to the confusion of the local avian population.
"We've had birds just fly in," she said. "We've had woodpeckers come in and try to figure out why there are trees in the space."
Many of those resurrected trees can be seen in the store's loft area, designed as a toy-filled nook where children can play while their adults browse the shelves. On those shelves, Birchbark dedicates a section to keeping indigenous languages alive through learning guides and dictionaries. It mainly stocks instructional materials for Dakota, Lakota and Ojibwe, three tribes local to the region, Anderson said, but also sells pocket-size dictionaries in Cree, Oji-Cree, Dene and Inuktitut.
Anderson, a Diné/Navajo member whose mother went to an American Indian boarding school, feels that the exposure to indigenous culture and community through stores like Birchbark has helped people become more curious and aware of perspectives outside the mainstream. Those resources also provide comfort for Native Americans, she said. "One of those tools for healing is through research, writing, storytelling, learning our traditions, our history and our languages."
The Birchbark website is managed by the store's book buyer, Nathan Pederson, selling mostly Native American-related adult and children's titles for those who can't make it to Minneapolis. The store supports Native authors through book events, poetry readings and musical performances, often at the nearby Bockley Gallery.
Just below the gallery, at 2101 Penn Ave South, lies a new expansion area for Birchbark. Dubbed The Understory, the space sells graphic novels, L.G.B.T.Q. literature, puzzles and other amusements, all while offering a place to sit and read.
[ Looking to explore the town after a round of shopping? Check out "36 Hours in Minneapolis." ]
Erdrich, who has a new novel called "The Night Watchman" scheduled for spring, pops into the store occasionally, but she leaves the day-to-day business to Anderson, Pederson and her other colleagues. When she's not writing her own books, she does take time to contribute to Birchbark's handwritten recommendations, taped to shelves all over the store.
"That's the thing about bookstores," she said. "Bookselling becomes a way of life and something you do as a human being."

Texto completo: DES MOINES - Allyson Felix has won six Olympic gold medals and 11 world championships. In her mind, Thursday night's race will stand alongside those accomplishments, even if she barely squeezed into the semifinals of the women's 400 meters at the USATF Outdoor Championships. What mattered was that she ran at all.
Felix, one of the greatest American athletes of her generation, returned to track and field after 13 months away, running her first race since she gave birth to her daughter, Camryn. She ran once around Drake Stadium's blue oval in 52.20 seconds. She bent at the waist and placed her hands on her knees. Felix placed fourth in the first heat, forcing her to wait to see whether she would advance as a time qualifier. She did.
"Tonight, I'm just grateful," Felix said. "I'm grateful to be back racing. Even though it wasn't a great result for me, it's a starting point. My biggest goal is next year. I know that I'm capable. Now I have time on my side, and I can get where I need to go."
Felix, 33, aims to make her fifth Olympics next summer in Tokyo. Thursday night was a step in a long road. On Nov. 28, 2018, Felix delivered Camryn at 32 weeks via an emergency C section owing to a severe case of preeclampsia.
She wasn't sure whether she would be able to compete again until she returned to training, and even as she has come back, the physical toll remains. She experienced "tears, frustration and doubt," she said. At times it felt as if the world were against her.
"Things that were once very easy for me are now pretty challenging," Felix said.
As she worked her way back into shape, Felix used her platform in a way she never had before. In May, in a New York Times op-ed, she denounced Nike for not supporting her maternity. She said Nike refused to promise it would not punish her if she performed worse after her pregnancy and offered her a contract worth 70 percent less than her old deal.
"I wanted to set a new standard," Felix wrote. "If I, one of Nike's most widely marketed athletes, couldn't secure these protections, who could?"
Felix said she is running "unattached," without a sponsor, and she ran in a black shirt without a logo. But she has talks "in the works" with a company. (During her post-race scrum with reporters, Felix wore Nike shoes.)
Felix will race again Friday night, but she will be at work before the semifinals start. She brought Camryn to Iowa, which means more washing bottles and changing diapers in the hotel room, another reminder of the balance between motherhood and her profession. "It's hard," Felix said. "It's very hard. I'm kind of getting the hang of it more."
Felix's time Thursday night was almost three seconds slower than her personal best of 49.26 seconds, set at the 2015 world championships in Beijing. She felt "rusty," she said, which she expected. Felix ran comfortably for 300 meters, putting herself in position to secure a semifinal spot by finishing in the top three. But in the final 100 meters, she appeared to tire and could not overtake Briyahna DesRosiers. She stayed on the track to watch the final three heats, but even after speaking with reporters, she didn't realize she had made the semis.
But one of the best ever at crossing the finish line found victory in simply getting to the start line. On Thursday morning, she posted to Instragram a picture of herself standing in front of Camryn resting in the NICU. "I'm far from my best," she wrote. "But I'm grateful."
Huddle wins 10,000 Molly Huddle won her fifth consecutive national title in the women's 10,000 meters, holding off training partner Emily Sisson with a wicked finishing kick to finish in 31:58.47. . . .
The most impressive performance of the championships' first day may have belonged to Lopez Lomong, who defended his 10,000 title with a startling showing. His rain-soaked 27:30.06 shattered his personal best by more than 50 seconds and dusted second-place Shadrack Kipchirchir by nearly 17 seconds. . . .
Sam Mattis won the national title in men's discus with a throw of 66.69 meters, sending the 25-year-old to his first world championships. Mattis won despite having recently recovered from a torn pectoral muscle.
"It's been years of frustration at championship meets, just little things going wrong or not stepping up quite at the right time," Mattis said. "It's just awesome to finally make a team."
Brian Williams finished second and also made worlds.

Texto completo: In November 2018 two musicians lost their home and recording studio in a wildfire in Southern California outside Los Angeles, and since then they've decided there is no better time to load up and tour.
The Deltaz will perform their first local show at Old Martina's Hall in Ranchos de Taos at 9 p.m. today (July 25).
Brothers Ted and John Siegel along with bass player Adam Zanoff from Southern California will be sharing the stage performing Americana, folk and blues. Ted, the guitarist and lyricist, as well as John on drums, and Zanoff doing vocals and playing harmonica will be playing songs from 2018's album "Barrelhouse Boys" and new material for the album they haven't been able to record due to the loss of their property.
"We've got most of our instruments and we have our music. We can go out on the road. It's never been a good time as ever to be out on the road when you don't have a home to go back to," said Ted Siegel.
"It's a tough break, but we'll be alright, at the end of the day it's just things," he said.
The Deltaz have been a band for eight years and have been touring both cross-country and internationally for six. Armed with three full-length albums as well as several singles and compilations, they will be returning to familiar landscapes. These fellows are no strangers to the Land of Enchantment, in fact many songs from the last album were written in Ramah, New Mexico.
"We have some friends that own some property in Ramah, south of Gallup where the Zuni and Navajo reservations are," said Ted Siegel. "Almost every tour we stop in Ramah and play. It's one of the only places in the country where we take a couple of days off to hang out there, I actually wrote a lot of our last album there."
They will be playing 1970s Rodger drums and a '50s Harmony Rocket guitar on songs such as "Wild Mustang," "Creekbed" and "Fireline." "We write lots of songs about home and where we're from," Ted Siegel said. The Deltaz have an evocative and narrative style to their lyrical diction and musical fashion.
"Wild Mustang" is a literal and metaphorical piece about raising wild horses received from the Bureau of Land Management as well as learning to handle life when it gets rowdy and uncontrollable."It's about having wild mustangs and the process of taming a wild animal -- also about life, wild and out of control, you have to get your hands around it and deal with it," Ted Siegel said.
Prior to the fire in 2018, The Deltaz wrote "Fireline," a tribute song for female inmates, one in particular, who died defending their property in another fire in 2016 with firefighters. California supplements fire crews with incarcerated volunteers. The Deltaz had heard about the woman after the fire was successfully extinguished. Based on an article they read they wrote about her life on the line to protect their home.
"We read a really good article about her in The New York Times , a really interesting article about this woman Shawna Jones and we were the only home threatened that night by the fire," Ted Siegel said. "We lost our home and now we play the song and it has this whole different meaning to us."
"Creekbed" is about the canyon and the river near their home surrounding Agoura and Thousand Oaks California. When the Siegel brothers were children they often played in the river, it was always flowing then. However, for the past few years the riverbed was dry.
"One winter we had this flash of rain that was very unusual and all of a sudden the creek beds filled up with water again, it hadn't rained in such a long time the land acted kind of strange," Ted Siegel said. "There was sediment and rock in the water, so instead of running clear and white, the river ran red with this really intense color." The brothers had witnessed more flora and wildlife and the song was inspired. The superbloom soon dried and became fuel for another fire.
The songs are in a series about their home in Southern California, the drought and the fires. "The songs are connected in a strange story," Ted Siegel said. "The music is complicated. You share your experiences with people - it's therapeutic, cathartic."
The Deltaz have a unique stage presence including retro slide guitar and John Siegel who sings, plays drums and harmonica all at once. The brothers have a definitive harmony and rock 'n' roll influence. They will be touring for two and a half months in the states stopping in Oklahoma and Tennessee prior to the show at Old Martina's Hall before heading to Europe to play a music festival in Germany and to continue touring.
Doors open at 8 p.m. the event is open to all ages. The cover is $10.

Texto completo: The City of Coachella and Burke-Rix recently held a Southern California Cannabis Summit that featured interesting and competent speakers and drew over 500 attendees, providing a great showcase for the Coachella Valley.
The interest in becoming a cannabis cluster with the potential of creating nearly 10,000 jobs was on many minds. Most of the current needs to launch greater Palm Springs to the leadership in cannabis cultivation are all about infrastructure and business models that will generate profits for investors pouring money into the valley.
When California voters approved recreational pot use, expectations were high and plans were made on how to spend the expected windfall. The windfall has not lived up to expectations. California projected the first year would net $1 billion in taxes.
Two business models attracted Ganjapreneurs to the modern gold rush. The first is the business of cultivation and the Coachella Valley has a plethora of people making efforts to enter that business.
Vessel Logistics, a San Francisco-based cannabis distribution company, published that existing legal growers could produce 9 million pounds of cannabis every year, but the permitted wholesale market can realistically support only 1.8 million to 2.2 million pounds.This means there is already a mismatch between the supply and the demand of over 300%, yet the new grow facilities continue to sprout up like Amazon fulfillment centers.
Cannabis dispensaries have blossomed in the Coachella Valley. The costs of regulatory compliance, taxes, staff and facilities make competing with illegal suppliers difficult. According to the New York Times, illegal cannabis businesses that offer their products openly are thriving. With legal tax rates between 30% and 50% plus the cost of establishing and maintaining a legitimate business, buying illegally can easily save a customer well over 50% when compared to legal options.
The challenges of having a sustainable cannabis business that operates at a profit are moving targets. They are not insurmountable if taxes are adjusted to reasonable levels and illegal operators are kept out of the market like moonshiners are prevented from competing with alcohol.

Texto completo: "Shakespeare for Kids" returns to the Pennsylvania Shakespeare Festival for an 11th year, with Erin Sheffield transforming the Bard's "Macbeth"' with sock puppets, sing-a-longs, and the Shakespeare Hokey-Pokey into a high-energy, one-hour production designed for ages 4-10.
"Shakespeare's tragedies teach us great lessons about right and wrong and, most importantly, how to be a good friend to your family and community," Director Matt Pfeiffer says. "In S4K we use some of the scary elements of Macbeth to have fun and play, hopefully providing kids a chance to get Shakespeare's medicine with just the right amount of sugar.
MJ Bird, Brandon Edward Burton, Arrianna Daniels and J. Dane McMichael guide the audience along in this trip, where we see a brave Scottish general named Macbeth receiving a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and pushed along by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself. Then after taking the thrown, he is wracked with guilt and paranoia.
Performances are at 10 a.m. Tuesday through Saturday, through Aug. 3. There also will be a sensory-friendly performance at 2 p.m. July 31.
The play is on the Main Stage of the Labuda Center for the Performing Arts at DeSales University, 2755 Station Ave., Center Valley. Tickets are $10 for children; $11 for adults. Tickets: 610-282-9455, pashakespeare.org.

Texto completo: Cuomo right to sign climate legislation
I applaud Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's signing the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, and at the same time, giving the initiative the means to start doing its work by announcing significant new wind projects ["Wind to fuel a clean break," Editorial, July 19].
We should all be proud to live in a state that is a leader in fighting the climate crisis, especially since a shift to renewable power is going to bring so many economic opportunities. I hope you're right that the momentum of wind power, and the desperate need we have for climate action, will overcome the power of Long Island NIMBYists who have the ability to hijack important projects.
We need to work together for a safe and livable future.
Joseph Tonini,
Mineola  
Providing health care to immigrants
As a Christian, I want to respond to two letter writers who brought religion and Christianity into the discussion of providing health care to immigrants in the country illegally ["Which way next for Democrats," Letters, July 2].
Their premise is that if you are a true Christian, you will support this insane idea. Let me ask you this my benevolent friends. If every night of the week 40 immigrants here illegally forced their way into your house through your broken kitchen door, demanding food, clothing, medical care and a bed, and the law of the land said you had to house them, what would you do? Then the next night, if 40 more show up and every night thereafter, what would you do?
I know that many of you would reject this idea and demand that this travesty be stopped by the government. Jesus said, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's." In other words, follow the laws of the land and pay your taxes. In assisting others, it doesn't make sense to destroy yourself in the process.
Gayle Palmer,
Williston Park  
Regarding July 2 letters on the position from Democratic presidential candidates that immigrants should receive health care, those critics are missing three points:
1) It is law. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The law requires hospitals to treat patients in need of emergency care regardless of their ability to pay, citizenship or even legal status.
2) It is practical. Non-treatment of illnesses is a public safety hazard. Look at the recent measles outbreak as an example.
3) It is moral. America doesn't turn away refugees in need. It is the basis for what this country stands for. So in that light, the tone of those letters comes from a dark, ugly place that doesn't solve any issue.
James Babbo,
Lindenhurst  
Wind farms in waters off the Hamptons
The article "Change of course on wind farm" [News, July 14] is causing confusion.
The article, about a developer dropping tentative plans to build turbines in waters off the Hamptons, fails to mention that plans for the South Fork Wind Farm - the state's first offshore wind farm - are still moving forward. The project will be located at least 35 miles east of Montauk in an area that already has been leased to Denmark-based Orsted and its partner on the project, Eversource. This omission caused many readers to think the project being withdrawn is the South Fork Wind Farm project, which is incorrect.
The two prospective lease areas discussed in the article are within call areas designated by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority did not recommend in the first place, following an extensive stakeholder outreach process.
David Posnett,
East Hampton  
Letter on Trump, rocket unnecessary
Was this letter necessary?
If I submitted a letter and substituted the name of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as someone who should be tied to a rocket and sent into space, would you publish it? I doubt it ["Landing on the moon 50 years ago," Letters, July 23]? I also would add that Newsday cartoonist Matt Davies has not published one cartoon that is positive of President Donald Trump.
Your editorial board is too liberal for me, but I don't have any choice on Long Island.
Pat Murray,
Seaford
Could you please tell me what this letter has to do with the Apollo 11 program? It is letters such as these that only serve to further separate Americans from each other. It has no redeeming value and certainly does not belong in Newsday.
Gail Berkes Starkie,
Southold
Bush v. Gore was right decision
In his quest to praise the late Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, Washington Post contributor Harry Litman referred to Bush v. Gore as an "abhorrent opinion" ["Justice Stevens' independent streak," Opinion, July 18]. The New York Times conducted an investigation and confirmed seven months later that George W. Bush did win the State of Florida in the 2000 presidential campaign.
Abhorrent? Not really. It turned out to be correct decision.

This Tool Is Indispensable for Her Job: The Will to Log Off

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Amanda Hess, a critic at large who writes about the internet, discussed the tech she's using.
What tech tools are most important for doing your job?
Is logging off a tool? Signing out is important.
I cover the internet for my job, but I'm also very easily seduced by it, and that can be a dangerous combination. Procrastination can always be plausibly reframed as work. So I have technology that I use to mitigate other technology. Wearing an Apple Watch means that I don't have to pick up my phone every time I get a Medicare scam call, which inevitably sucks me into scrolling mindlessly through every app on my phone. I have strapped an unsightly Apple product to my body in an attempt to keep another Apple product away from me. ᾗ4
You write about internet culture, which is a broad topic. How do you decide what to write about?
My beat is even wider than that: I'm a critic at large, which means I end up writing about television, music, movies, theater and books, too. My job is to identify themes across the culture, and I find myself investigating ideas more than platforms. I always have a few baby story ideas hanging around in my brain, and they steer my internet activity into one direction or another.
I do a lot of old-timey research. I read academic studies and nonfiction books, and most of them are not specifically about the internet. I want to draw links between Instagram branding and Naomi Klein, between YouTube conspiracy theorists and Richard Hofstadter, and between Hollywood's insatiable thirst for sequels and social media's infinite scroll. Google Scholar is a huge resource for me.
I'm often asked to explain what makes internet culture different from some previous mode of human experience, and the maybe boring answer is that it is not always so different. There is a temptation to overemphasize the novelty of internet culture, but our media, economic system and values did not spontaneously appear in, like, 1996. I sometimes think about the internet as a fun house mirror, a tool for stretching and magnifying existing dynamics.
How would you sum up the state of internet culture today compared with what it was in the 1990s, when the internet was just becoming a thing?
Back then, people on the internet thought that the internet was very good. At least, the most influential internet writers and architects did -- the people who were setting the boundaries and terms for what it could be. Tech coverage was dominated by fan service and libertarian fantasy.
I think often about John Perry Barlow's "A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace," in which he declared the internet "the new home of Mind" and wrote: "Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth." That did not come to pass, obviously.
The links between the "home of Mind" and our bodily experience -- whether it's the shuttered local toy store that can't compete with Amazon or the woman harassed by her ex on Facebook -- have never been clearer. It's still easy to be charmed and moved by the materials that actual human beings contribute to internet culture, but we're more wary of the platforms they're hosted on. The defining mood of internet culture is a lot more ambivalent.
What do you predict the internet will look like in five years?
I have no idea! I try to stay out of the prediction business. I do think that the fate of the internet is tied up with politics in a more urgent sense than other cultural products are. If Elizabeth Warren became president, we could see a significant rethinking of the power of the internet's biggest platforms. Or we could see Amazon, Google and Facebook tighten their grip.
Outside of work, what tech product are you personally obsessed with?
Bitmoji. I have a very strong bond with my cartoon avatar. She has my nose and my glasses and my freckles and my forehead lines but she is not quite "me." She's probably a better version of me. I can honestly say that she's expanded my emotional palette. She's made it easier for me to express sadness and anger and tenderness. She's made me more human. I will never leave her.
Deepfakes. Trolls. Misinformation. Fake reviews. Bots. These are just a few of the internet's problems. Have we hit a low point or will things get better?
Oh, I think it could definitely get worse. Or maybe it's hit a low point and also it will never get better? Something to think about!

Amadou Diallo's mother still fights 'this good fight'

Texto completo: NEW YORK - In the months after her son was killed in the Bronx by four police officers, she was consumed by grief each time she walked the unfamiliar streets of New York City. She wept often.
While riding the subway, she would think, "Did he take this train when he was alive?"
But now, 20 years after that life-altering event, the woman, Kadiatou Diallo, no longer dreads visits to the city. She comes to New York at least once a year to advance her charity and advocacy work or to spend time with other mothers who have also lost children in law enforcement-related incidents - a support system she didn't have two decades ago.
"She's my hero," said Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, who was killed by police officers in Queens in 2006, hours before his wedding. "What she went through, and to stand firm for her son, she's still doing it now."
On Tuesday, Diallo paused for a few seconds during a telephone interview after she was told the breaking news that the Justice Department would not prosecute a New York City police officer accused of killing Eric Garner five years ago in Stateh Island.
Diallo recalled the infamous video showing Garner being put in a chokehold by officer Daniel Pantaleo during his arrest and uttering the phrase, "I can't breathe," 11 times before his death.
"The world has watched those images," Diallo, 59, said from her home country, Guinea, in western Africa, where she was doing charity work. "I remember when that happened, I saw the video. I was down on the floor. It was so shocking and difficult to watch."
It was a painful reminder of what she had experienced.
On Feb. 4, 1999, her son, Amadou Diallo, was killed in the vestibule of a Bronx apartment building by four New York Police Department officers who had been searching for a suspect in a rape case. The officers - who fired a total of 41 shots - said they believed Diallo, 23, had reached to grab a gun when they approached him. Instead, Diallo had grabbed for his wallet.
The president of the NAACP at the time, Kweisi Mfume, called the shooting "excessive force at its worst." Diallo's death led to protests in the city, resulting in a politically fraught time for former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Nearly 14 years before the start of the Black Lives Matter movement, Diallo's death became the rallying cry for those who believed the Police Department operated with racial bias.
Kadiatou Diallo arrived into this tense environment from Guinea five days after her son was killed. She cried his name while being helped to the crime scene by the authorities. The young mother was immediately immortalized in New York newspapers and on television and computer screens. She toured the country with the Rev. Al Sharpton, decrying police brutality.
But Diallo soon appeared hesitant to become a symbol for a narrative she did not totally understand.
"I didn't even know about race issues," Diallo said. "Everything was happening so quickly. I didn't have that someone who went through that experience. But I was able to stand up and just speak for my child. It was an awakening for me."
She had a reported rift with Sharpton, partly regarding who would represent her in a lawsuit against the city and the officers. The pressure on her to fight for a larger cause was immense. Diallo just wanted to move on, heal and seek reconciliation with the mayor and the Police Department.
"I came back to my senses, because the anger and the agony were gone," she told The New York Times Magazine in early 2000. "I don't want to do that anymore - the speeches and things."
Instead, she started the Amadou Diallo Foundation.
The four officers involved in the shooting were indicted almost two months after the shooting. But in February 2000, a jury acquitted them of all charges.
Diallo and her ex-husband received a $3 million settlement in 2004 to their lawsuit against the city and the officers. Kadiatou Diallo was given half.
After the settlement, she completed a memoir, "My Heart Will Cross This Ocean," built a school in her son's name in Guinea and ran the foundation.
In the 20 years since her son's killing, Diallo has become the type of leader many had wanted her to be in the months after the shooting, and she's done it with little or no publicity. She's also mended her relationship with Sharpton.
When he holds events about policing, "he always reaches out to me," she said. "We also have a relationship, personally, because I attended his daughter's wedding. On Mother's Day, he always calls me."
She has also befriended people like Gwen Carr, Garner's mother. Diallo said Tuesday that she planned to call her to offer support.
"I know what Gwen is going to tell me: 'Kadi, I'm ready to fight this. I cannot give up,'" Diallo said.
She added: "Our sons haven't received justice that they deserve to have. All we want is good policies, good laws to be passed, and if someone did wrong - they have to be accountable for what they did."
Diallo is also involved with the Justice Committee, a New York grassroots advocacy group. One of its efforts is a campaign urging Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to sign an executive order to appoint a special prosecutor to handle cases like Garner's.
"It's a setback, but it gives us more strength to carry on to change," she said of the ruling regarding Garner's case. "The history of the civil rights didn't happen overnight. This is our new civil rights."
Diallo attended Garner's funeral in 2014, but personally met Carr later that year at Riverside Church in Harlem, when both women were on a panel. Carr, in an interview earlier this year, said that she felt "a real connection" to Diallo immediately, and that they have talked every week since.
Carr said she appreciated Diallo's presence after her son's death. "I was in a dark place," she said.
Carr said she vividly remembered following the news of Amadou Diallo's death and its aftermath, watching and reading about how Kadiatou Diallo navigated the chaotic time.
"I remember hearing one of my friends say, 'That is such a tragedy. I will never carry a wallet again,'" Carr said. "That wrenched my heart. I had such sympathy for her."
Diallo runs her foundation on her own, though a consultant helps to organize an annual fundraiser.
The night before her son's death, Diallo said she spoke to him by phone. "Mom, I'm going to college!" she recalled him announcing. (She acquired a trademark on that phrase, and has used it for the foundation.)
Diallo was in New York earlier this year to preside over the first three scholarships awarded by her foundation to students at Guttman Community College in Midtown Manhattan who plan to pursue computer-related careers, just as Amadou had hoped to do.
Diallo said she has never felt "revengeful" toward the police.
"Let's move forward in one direction and fight for this good fight so we can save the children. That was my mission," said Diallo, who has a daughter and two other grown sons and is a grandmother of three.
"That's what I still do. The other people who were cynical then, how do they see me now? This is 20 years later. I didn't run from it. I stay the course and I do what I can without bashing the police, without being revengeful."

States with higher rates of gun ownership have more gun-related domestic homicides, study finds

Texto completo: States with higher rates of gun ownership have significantly higher rates of gun-related domestic homicides, according to a study published online Monday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
Unexpectedly, the study did not find a similar link between state gun ownership rates and non-domestic homicides — those involving friends and acquaintances (including employers and co-workers) and strangers.
The risk of being murdered in a domestic dispute rises for both men and women living in a home with a gun, but women are particularly at risk, the study reports.
“While personal protection is a commonly cited reason for owning a gun, our research shows that firearm ownership also confers significant risks to loved ones, as they are more likely to be killed if there is a gun in the household, said Aaron Kivisto, the study’s lead author and a forensic psychologist at the University of Indianapolis, in a released statement.
“Our findings highlight the importance of firearm removal in protecting victims of domestic violence, the majority of whom are women,” he added.
There were 39,773 gun-related deaths in the United States in 2017 — the highest rate since the mid-1990s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two-thirds of those deaths were suicides, which have been increasing at an alarming rate since 2000.
A study published earlier this year reported, however, that gun-related domestic homicides are also on the rise, climbing 26 percent between 2010 and 2017.
How the study was done
For the current study, Kivisto and his colleagues used data from a variety of government agencies to compare household gun-ownership rates with annual homicide rates in all 50 states for the years 1990 through 2016. They analyzed data from 1990 through 2016, a period in which 316,000 people across the United States died in a gun-related homicide.
The researchers dug down into the data to see if the state-level gun-ownership rates were linked to homicides rates within certain relationships — intimate partners, other family members, friends/acquaintances and strangers.
Gun-ownership rates in the states ranged from 10.4 percent in Hawaii to 68.8 percent in Wyoming, the data revealed. The rates varied by region, too, with more people owning guns in the south and west and fewer owning them in the northeast.
Minnesota’s rate was 38.8, which was close to the national average of 39.2.
States in the highest quartile in terms of firearm ownership had a 65 percent higher rate of gun-related domestic homicides during the period studied than states in the lowest quartile, the researchers found. The association was most pronounced among southern states.
Each 10 percent increase in the household gun ownership rate was associated with a 13 percent increase in the incidence of family members being the victim of a gun-related murder.
States with higher rates of gun ownership did not have much higher rates of non-domestic homicides, however.
Each 10 percent increase in the household gun ownership rate was associated with a 2 percent increase in the incidence of gun-related homicides in which the victim and the shooter were not related.
“It is plausible that nondomestic firearm homicides are driven more by street-related violence where perpetrators are more likely to illegally obtain their weapons, which are frequently traded across state lines,” Kivisto and his colleagues write.
As Kivisto explained to New York Times reporter Sarah Mervosh, “These might not be gun owners as we tend to think of them, but gun obtainers.”
Limitations and implications
The study comes with several caveats. Most notably, it is an observational study and therefore can’t prove a direct connection between state-level gun ownership and domestic homicides. In addition, the data sources used in the study often lacked information about the relationship between homicide victims and their assailants, so the study’s authors had to use an indirect method to fill in that missing information. That data may therefore contain inaccuracies.
Also, the category of intimate partners did not include people the homicide victims had previously dated — a factor that likely resulted in an underestimating of the prevalence of intimate-partner homicides.
Still, the study’s findings are in line with those of previous research that has shown that people living in households with guns are at significantly greater risk of dying from a gun-related injury.
Kivisto and his colleagues say their findings “support the need for state firearm legislation directed toward protecting victims of domestic violence, as access to firearms uniquely increases the likelihood of homicide among this population.”
“Research has consistently shown that states with higher levels of gun ownership tend to have higher rates of firearm homicide and suicide,” Kivisto told Newsweek reporter Kashmira Gander. “What our findings suggest is that the increased risk of firearm homicide attributable to firearms isn’t equally shared across all potential victims.”
While around 1 in 4 homicide victims are women, they account for about 3 in 4 victims of intimate partner homicide, he pointed out.
“This tells us that an increased risk for homicide victimization associated with gun ownership has a disproportionate impact on women,” said Kivisto. “At the same time, our results also showed that the incidence of domestic homicide victimization increases for both men and women as gun ownership rates go up.”
“The narrative about gun ownership and personal protection tends to ignore the risks associated with firearm ownership, including the risks to others in the home,” he added. “Gun owners should weigh up these perceived benefits and risks and engage in safe storage and other practices to reduce the risk of a domestic incident becoming fatal. “

Texto completo: Melania y Donald Trump anunciaron el lunes que celebrarán su segunda Cena de Estado en septiembre, celebrando su tercer año en la Casa Blanca. Para ese momento, los Obama ya habían celebrado cinco .
La primera dama Melania Trump, a última hora de la tarde del lunes, no había tuiteado sobre el evento, pero el anuncio de la Casa Blanca decía: “El Presidente y la Primera Dama darán la bienvenida al Primer Ministro de Australia y a la señora Morrison a la Casa Blanca el 20 de septiembre de 2019 para una visita oficial, que incluirá una cena de estado”.
Se espera que Melania Trump, quien recibió algunas críticas sobre cómo planeó la primera Cena de Eestado para el presidente francés, Emmanuel Macron , y su esposa, siga la tradición y se haga cargo de la segunda cena de estado también.
“La Primera Dama y su personal son responsables de la elaborada planificación de la ceremonia de la cena estatal” , afirma un artículo de la Asociación Histórica de la Casa Blanca. “Estas cenas formales implican la creación de invitaciones y listas de invitados, menús, flores, mesas, asientos y entretenimiento para la noche. La Primera Dama trabaja estrechamente con su secretaria social, el personal de la residencia ejecutiva y el Departamento de Estado para coordinar cada detalle. de este evento muy especial”.
“La visita celebrará la estrecha amistad y la historia compartida de nuestros dos países y reafirmará nuestra visión común para la paz mundial, la seguridad y la prosperidad”, indica la publicación de la Casa Blanca.
Melania Trump fue criticada en abril de 2018 por la corta lista de invitados de la primera Cena de Estado, que no incluía miembros demócratas del Congreso.
La entonces vocera de la primera dama, Stephanie Grisham, desmintió las posibles dudas sobre el éxito de Melania Trump en la planificación del evento.
“Probablemente no vamos a obtener el crédito que merecemos, pero sé que este equipo es excelente y ella sabe que este equipo es excelente”, dijo Grisham a The New York Times. “No hemos fallado, y ella no ha fallado”.

Texto completo: Ham salad from a tube. Apricot cereal cubes. Thermostabilized cheddar cheese spread.
These delicacies and more were packed inside Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s lunar lunchbox when Apollo 11 hurtled them into space 50 years ago this month, landing humankind on the moon for the first time.
A little unpalatable, perhaps, but it was enough to get them through their eight-day excursion in space.
The next time astronauts make a giant leap in space travel, it could be with a mission to Mars, making the question of nutrition a lot more difficult. The round-trip journey is expected to take up to three years, and the astronauts may have to grow some of their own food.
Enter the Espanola pepper.
As the race to the red planet heats up - NASA hopes to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, and a private rocket venture, SpaceX, is aiming for sooner - scientists are working on building a garden in space. The goal is to grow fresh produce to supplement packaged foods.
NASA has harvested a variety of edible leafy greens, grown without earthly gravity or natural light. Soon, researchers plan to expand to a more difficult crop - Espanola improved chiles - in their quest to answer one of the most pressing questions of a Mars mission: How will astronauts get enough nutritious food to survive years in the unforgiving depths of space?
Scientists believe the project, if successful, could open the door to growing similar crops in space - think tomato plants and strawberries - and perhaps eventually to more advanced foods, like potatoes.
“This is the most complex crop we have done to date for food purposes,” said Matthew W. Romeyn, who is leading the pepper experiment for NASA.
The peppers are being tested on Earth, he said, and could be sent to space as early as next spring.
Scott Kelly, a retired astronaut who set an American record in 2016 when he returned after spending 340 days in space, said he received a shipment of fresh fruit and vegetables every few months while on the International Space Station. But that would not be possible on a trip to Mars.
“It’s not like you can just run out to the store,” he said. “To have fresh food, it helps with nutrition. It also helps with morale.”
Options have changed
The first moon landing took place in the “tube and cube days” of space food, when a typical menu included items like peanut cubes, turkey and gravy wet packs and brownies that were described as an “intermediate moisture bite.”
The beverage Tang also had a long association with spaceflight. Many people mistakenly believe NASA invented it.
Today, about 200 food and drink items are available on the International Space Station, according to Stephanie Schierholz, a NASA spokeswoman.
The food, which is much like camping food and has to be reheated or rehydrated with water, ranges from your basics, like cereal and eggs, to more complex dishes like chicken fajitas, macaroni and cheese and blueberry crumble. “Shrimp cocktail is a longtime popular dish,” she said.
Tortillas are also a staple, Schierholz said, because NASA does not use bread in microgravity in order to avoid pesky crumbs.
While scientists use the space station as a test kitchen for long-term space travel, there is another necessity to consider: water.
The station uses a sophisticated water recycling system, which collects humidity, sweat and even urine and turns it into drinking water. (In 2008, a New York Times reporter was brave enough to test it: “How does distilled urine and sweat taste? Not bad, actually.”)
Schierholz said the system would need to be smaller and to work more reliably on a mission to Mars, because there would be no option to send shipments of water from Earth. But the same ethos would hold true: “Yesterday’s coffee,” she said, “is tomorrow’s coffee.”
No matter how many options there are, packaged food alone would not be enough to fuel a mission to Mars.
Certain vitamins break down over time, leaving astronauts at risk of inadequate nutrition, said Gioia D. Massa, a scientist who works on space crop production for NASA.
“We don’t really have a food system that we are confident will be good for the entire duration of a Mars mission,” she said. “We feel plants are a very good way to help solve that problem.”
Growing goodness
Scientists have experimented with growing plants on board the International Space Station for years. The Russians grew peas in the early 2000s, for example. More recently, NASA harvested red romaine lettuce, which had been nurtured under the purplish, LED lighting of a special vegetable garden known simply as “Veggie.”
For a tasting in 2015, astronauts used extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dress the leaves. “Kind of like arugula,” Kelly said at the time.
NASA has since grown other types of leafy greens, including Chinese cabbage and mizuna mustard.
The Espanola improved chile, a durable pepper native to New Mexico, represents the next frontier.
The peppers are, in many ways, the perfect test case: They are more difficult to grow than lettuce. They are a good source of vitamin C. And they pack a punch in spice, great for astronauts who have reduced senses of smell and taste in space.
If this space gardening plan works, scientists say, it could help combat “menu fatigue” among astronauts, who typically lose weight while spending months in space.
Maintaining a garden could also serve as a hobby for crew members during monotonous months. “It’s kind of like, why do people like flowers?” Kelly said. “When you are living in an environment that is very antiseptic or laboratory-like, or on Mars, it would be pretty devoid of life with the exception of you and your crewmates. Having something growing would have a positive psychological effect.”
And it could also help the crew become more autonomous, in case something goes wrong.
“If the next supply ship from Earth doesn’t land properly, can you do enough with your own systems already in place?” said Raymond M. Wheeler, a plant physiologist at NASA.
So what might a menu for Mars look like one day?
It is a little soon to tell, but it would probably include a variety of packaged food, with fresh greens on the side.
“It might be having some lettuce on your cheeseburger,” Massa said, “or having a handful of tomatoes to go in your hummus wrap.”

What is facial recognition's purpose?

Texto completo: Current and former Vermont officials have differing explanations for the original purpose of a facial recognition tool that outside agencies accessed over 400 times.
The program was used from April 2013 until May 2017 when, due to questions about its legality, Gov. Phil Scott mandated an end to the program.
According to two current Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles officials, the program was developed as an internal tool to protect Vermonters from fraud and identity theft.
"From my understanding, it wasn't, 'We're going to put the program in for law enforcement,'" head of enforcement for the DMV Col. William Jake Elovirta said. "The focus was our own in-house system."
However, internal DMV documents obtained by the Free Press show the department was proactively offering the use of the facial recognition program to outside law enforcement agencies as a resource.
This was confirmed by former Governor Peter Shumlin, who said the program was specifically developed to help law enforcement.
"Every governor in the country was going to a facial recognition system that was encouraged by the federal Department of Transportation as a tool to promote public safety when you were looking for violent criminals," he said. "I mean, that was really the hope, to be a help to law enforcement at the time."
Recent articles from the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Vermont was one of at least three states to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a wing of the Department of Homeland Security, to use the state's facial recognition database.
The articles failed to capture just how many times outside agencies used the database.
In total from April 2013 through May 2017, there were 429 searches performed by various law enforcement agencies on the local, state and federal levels.
What exactly was this program? In most states across the country, DMVs have similar databases to prevent fraud.
When someone walks in to get a license, their photo is uploaded into a system.
However, Vermont took an extra step, putting facial recognition software to use. Shumlin said many states across the country were moving in this direction and the real problem now is not the program, but the President of the United States.
"Now you have a new Attorney General and a new President of the United States, and Vermont now has reason to be concerned about facial recognition," he said. "Because we have a president that sees undocumented workers as rapists and murders, that wasn't the case when I was governor."
Here's how the program worked: When someone would go in to get a license or ID card, the DMV would take their picture and then run it through the database using this software.
The software scanned all the logged pictures to compare a number of identifying facial features to the applicant's picture, according to an internal DMV bulletin sent to law enforcement agencies on December 26, 2012.
But according to Elovirta, there were problems from the start. The system was so sensitive that it would flag twins and triplets, as well as those who didn't change their maiden name when they got married.
Why was it created? According to Elovirta, the department started using the database in April of 2013 as a way to deter identity fraud in the state.
However, documents provided to the Burlington Free Press by the department reflect that the program was seen as a potential tool for law enforcement from the start, which was confirmed by Shumlin.
According to the bulletin, sent to law enforcement agencies both in the state and out of state, the agency began utilizing facial recognition software to "identify situations of fraud and/or identity theft."
But in the last paragraph of the document, Glendon Button, the head of enforcement at the time, encourages law enforcement to utilize the tool:
"There may be situations in which FR [facial recognition] may be of assistance to you during a criminal investigation," Button stated. "If you feel this tool may be of use to you; please contact staff in the DMV Enforcement and Safety Division."
In 2013 the department posted a question and answer section on their website regarding the facial recognition program. At the time, the DMV told the public they wanted to "protect your identity from being stolen."
However, whether the Q&A made the full extent of the use of facial recognition clear is up for debate.
"I can see how it could be misleading," said Michael Smith, current DMV Operations Director and acting Commissioner. "I would say that that was a poorly written first statement."
This was the question and answer:
Q: Who has access to facial recognition data specific to my DMV record?
A: No one outside of DMV. Only specially trained DMV employees have access to your record.
"No one outside of DMV," appeared in bold on the webpage, but this caveat in small text followed below:
"Authorized Law Enforcement agencies may submit images of suspects in crimes for analysis by DMV Investigators. No outside Law Enforcement agency has direct access to DMV FR system."
Shumlin confirmed that from the start, the program was built for law enforcement, beyond the scope of preventing fraud at the DMV.
"My involvement with the program was to make sure we used it as a tool for law enforcement," Shumlin said.
Additional records obtained by the Burlington Free Press reveal that early on in the database's life span in 2013, the FBI signed a legal agreement with the Vermont DMV.
The FBI signed similar agreements with multiple states throughout the country, according to testimony given to Congress in 2019 by Kimberly J. Del Greco, Deputy Assistant Director of the Criminal Justice Information Services Division of the FBI.
Each time an agency requested to use the service, the DMV could have denied them access but continued to authorize searches until it was shut down by Gov. Phil Scott.
Elovirta said one of the benefits of the program was preventing identity theft, and now there isn't a foolproof system in place to do that.
According to Shumlin, the program was helpful in looking for violent criminals.
Why did it shut down? After the Vermont chapter of the ACLU raised concerns about the database in 2017, Attorney General TJ Donovan reviewed the program and decided Vermont shouldn't use it, a decision he stands by today.
"I have every expectation that the program remains suspended, and if it's not then there's going to be a big issue," Donovan said Monday in an interview with the Free Press. "I don't support it and I don't support sharing the info with ICE."
In May 2017, at the direction of Gov. Phil Scott, the program was shut down. According to Elovirta, the DMV has not updated or shared the database with anyone since.
Who used it? Over the course of the 429 searches, both in-state and out-of-state agencies utilized the database, according to DMV documents.
The leading user of the system was the FBI, which performed around 297 of the 429 searches.
Homeland Security agencies including ICE searched the database at least three times.
In one instance, the U.S. Marshals searched for a "Hispanic Male," whom they alleged had violated supervised release.
In two of the requests to use the database, agents and analysts from the Department of Homeland Security were looking for two white males and a white female, all for financial crimes.
Other federal agencies like the Department of State and Diplomatic Service also used the database.
According to records from the Government Accountability Office, 21 states and the District of Columbia allow federal investigators to look through similar databases.

Texto completo: Andrew Dibner was shaving one day in the early 1970s when he had a moment of inspiration that would save countless lives. If someone who is disabled or elderly falls, he wondered, what if some technology could summon emergency assistance, even if a phone were out of reach?
He was a psychologist and a Boston University psychology professor at the time, and it took a few years for his inspiration to become an invention — and ultimately a ubiquitous phenomenon.
The medical alert system he pioneered with his wife, Susan Schmidt Dibner, and the Lifeline Systems company they cofounded to market the device, led the way for other manufacturers to enter what is now the field of personal emergency response systems. At the outset, however, persuading investors was difficult.
“We had no money," Dr. Dibner told the Globe in 1988. “I found an unemployed engineer who built the first model, then a small manufacturer who made burglar alarm equipment. It was hard to get venture capital."
Dr. Dibner, whose inspiration created a segment in the health care industry, died July 6 in a memory care facility in Peoria, Ariz. He was 93. His daughter Dr. Robin Dibner told The New York Times the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease.
He and his wife, Susan, a sociologist who died in 1988, were partners in Lifeline Systems Inc. The system they devised provided at-risk people with transmitters that are worn as pendants or bracelets. Someone who is immobilized by a fall or an illness can press a button on the transmitter, which sends a signal to a console linked to a home telephone, which in turn automatically dials a central monitoring station.
Once the connection is made, an operator can assess the situation, possibly by speaking to the person through the console's speakerphone and then calling for help from a designated neighbor or relative or, ultimately, an ambulance.
The Dibners believed the device would offer comfort and reassurance to people who might otherwise have to live in nursing homes or who felt vulnerable after being discharged quickly from a hospital.
“Even if they didn't use this," Dr. Dibner told the Times in 1984, “people will have the psychological assurance that they're not alone."
Reassuring those in medical need had been on his mind since he was young.
As a boy, Dr. Dibner had often turned to his grandmother for encouragement, he recalled in a 1988 interview with Jean Dietz, the Globe's Senior Set columnist. When he was 12, he awoke one night to find his grandmother in the hall. She was having a heart attack and clutching her chest.
Subsequently, he added, an older family friend had a stroke while living alone. Four days passed before she was discovered by a neighbor. The family friend was still alive, but too much time had elapsed for successful treatment. “She died within six months in a nursing home," he told the Times.
In a 1983 Globe interview, he described Lifeline Systems as initially a “mom and pop" operation that the couple launched with a $12,000 stake.
For their accomplishments in health and education, the Dibners were among recipients of the Charles A. Dana Foundation's “pioneering achievements" award in 1986. They received $10,000.
Andrew Sherman Dibner was born on May 30, 1926, in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Harry Dibner and Masha Goldberg, immigrants from Russia. His father sold insurance, and his mother was a seamstress.
After serving stateside in the Army during World War II, Dr. Dibner enrolled at Brooklyn College. He did not do well in engineering courses and, guided by an aptitude test, shifted to psychology. After receiving a bachelor's degree, he attended the University of Michigan, where he graduated with a master's and a doctorate in psychology.
He moved between teaching and clinical work for a decade before settling at Boston University in 1964 as a psychology professor. He was a founder of the school's gerontology center.
An engineer built the first Lifeline prototype. But 25 venture capital firms turned down the Dibners for financing. “They liked the idea," Dr. Dibner told The Wisconsin State Journal in 1983. “They didn't trust us as managers."
After they brought in an experienced businessman as the company's chairman, venture capital money came in.
Initially, Lifeline's target customers were not users but institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, and health care agencies, which would buy monitoring stations and charge fees to individuals who wanted the service. The business model was eventually augmented to include selling directly to consumers.
Dr. Dibner continued to teach at Boston University until the mid-1980s.
He also was among the so-called BU Five — faculty members who refused to cross picket lines set up by striking clerical and technical workers in 1979. Instead, they held classes on lawns or off-campus sites.
Then-BU president John R. Silber and the university's administration announced their intent to fire or suspend the five faculty members. In November 1979, Silber said that the five — who included Howard Zinn and Caryl Rivers — could avoid disciplinary action if they submitted written apologies. All refused. A few months later, BU decided not to seek sanctions against them.
Lifeline went public in 1983, and Dr. Dibner remained with the company until retiring in 1990. In 2006, when Lifeline had more than $100 million in annual revenues, 470,000 individual subscribers, and business relationships with many health care organizations, it was acquired by Royal Philips Electronics for $690 million.
The company, now called Philips Lifeline and based in Framingham, says it is the leading medical-alert service in the United States.
Dr. Dibner's invention has evolved since his retirement to include modern twists such as a technology that can detect falls and send help even if the person can't push the transmitter.
In addition to his daughter Robin, a rheumatologist, Dr. Dibner leaves his wife, Jean Proulx Dibner; his son, Steven; two other daughters, Nina Dibner and Lora Dibner Garcia; two stepdaughters, Jennifer and Suzanne Proulx; two stepsons, Thomas and Jonathan Proulx; five grandchildren; and 10 step-grandchildren.
His first marriage, to Iris Miroy, ended in divorce.
Lifeline prompted other companies to enter the business, most famously LifeCall, whose well-known TV commercial featured an older woman lying on the floor, saying, “I've fallen and I can't get up!"
Dr. Dibner credited that ad with boosting his company's sales, because it brought national attention to the growing market for Lifeline.
“I feel very fulfilled," he told the Globe in 1986, “because I was able to come up with an idea that turns out to be so helpful to people."

Texto completo: Sting is coming to St. Paul with his musical “The Last Ship.”
The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts will host the regional premiere of the show April 8 through 19. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is set to star as shipyard foreman Jackie White.
Tickets are priced from $157 to $75. Subscribers to the 2019-20 Broadway at the Ordway series can purchase tickets to “The Last Ship” starting July 22. Patrons who buy tickets to the Ordway’s production of “42nd Street,” which opens Tuesday, will also have access to the presale. Remaining single tickets will go on sale in the fall. For details, call 651-224-4222 or see ordway.org.
Sting wrote the music and lyrics for the musical, which was inspired by his own childhood experiences and the shipbuilding industry in England. John Logan (“Gladiator,” “The Aviator,” “Hugo”) and Brian Yorkey (“Next to Normal,” “If/Then,” “13 Reasons Why”) wrote the book, which has since been rewritten by Lorne Campbell.
The first reading of “The Last Ship” took place in Manhattan in 2011 and the full production premiered in Chicago three years later. It moved to Broadway in September 2014 and ran through January 2015. It earned a pair of Tony nominations, for best original score and best orchestrations. It has since been staged in Salt Lake City and Finland and it toured the United Kingdom and Ireland last year. St. Paul is one of several cities it will visit in 2020.
The New York Times called it an “ambitious, earnest musical … (that’s) buoyed by a seductive score that ranks among the best composed by a rock or pop figure for Broadway.”
Sting’s 11th solo album, also titled “The Last Ship,” features songs written for and inspired by the musical. Most of the show’s songs are originals, although it does feature four of his previously recorded songs: “Island of Souls” and “All This Time” (from “The Soul Cages”), “When We Dance” (from “Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting 1984–1994”) and “Ghost Story” (from “Brand New Day”).
Currently touring Europe in support of his latest record, “My Songs,” Sting will also headline a Las Vegas residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace starting in May.

Texto completo: During a June 12 speech at George Washington University, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders offered what he said was a stark example of income inequality and its real-world consequences.
"In 2014, for example, in McDowell County, W.Va., one of the poorest counties in the nation, life expectancy for men was 64 years, Sanders said. "In Fairfax County, Va., a wealthy county, just 350 miles away, life expectancy was nearly 82 years, an 18-year differential. The life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years.
Was Sanders right? We took a closer look. (Sanders' campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)
Let's start by noting that the two counties are indeed at opposite ends of the income spectrum.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, McDowell County, in the heart of Appalachian coal country, has a median household income of $25,595, about 44 percent of the national median household income of $57,652.
By contrast, Fairfax County, located in the affluent suburbs of Washington, D.C., has a median household income of $117,515, or slightly more than double the national median.
So median household income is more than four times higher in Fairfax County than it is in McDowell County.
What about life expectancy?
The longest-running data on life expectancy by county in the United States is compiled by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. We used the institute's interactive database to find the most recent data for both of the counties Sanders mentioned.
The data shows that life expectancy is a few years longer than Sanders said for men in McDowell County - 67 instead of 64 - which in turn makes the gap for men between the two counties 15 years, rather than the 18-year figure Sanders cited.
For women, Sanders also is slightly off - there's an 11-year gap rather than a 12-year gap.
But while Sanders is a bit off on the numbers, his overall point is sound. In fact, not only can people in Fairfax County expect to live longer than those in McDowell County, but the gap between the two has been widening for nearly four decades.
It appears that Sanders' comparison actually emerged more than five years ago, in a New York Times article by Annie Lowrey. She wrote:
Fairfax County, Virginia, and McDowell County are separated by 350 miles, about a half-day's drive. Traveling west from Fairfax County, the gated communities and bland architecture of military contractors give way to exurbs, then to farmland and eventually to McDowell's coal mines and the forested slopes of the Appalachians. Perhaps the greatest distance between the two counties is this: Fairfax is a place of the haves, and McDowell of the have-nots.
One of the starkest consequences of that divide is seen in the life expectancies of the people there. Residents of Fairfax County are among the longest-lived in the country: Men have an average life expectancy of 82 years and women, 85, about the same as in Sweden. In McDowell, the averages are 64 and 73, about the same as in Iraq.
Our ruling
Sanders said, "In 2014 ... in McDowell County, W.Va., one of the poorest counties in the nation, life expectancy for men was 64 years. In Fairfax County, Va., a wealthy county, just 350 miles away, life expectancy was nearly 82 years, an 18 year differential. The life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years.
A few of these numbers are slightly off, but Sanders' overall point that there is a large gap in life expectancy between the two counties is solid. We rule his statement Mostly True.

Scott D. Pierce: Mia Love and CNN are a perfect match

Texto completo: In Mia Love, CNN got exactly what it wanted — a conservative that other contributors can bash. And Love has made it easy for them.
In an appearance on Monday, Love refused to weigh in on whether Donald Trump’s tweet calling on four Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came” was racist.
Asked that question directly, Love deflected and obfuscated, offering a mealy-mouthed non-answer.
“You know, I. Racist is a very. I take that word incredibly seriously,” she hemmed and hawed. “I don’t. I’m not in the president’s head. I do not think that these comments help. I am not going to, uh, get into whether, whether he is racist. Uh, I don’t think that the comments help him. I don’t think that the comments help his narrative.”
Bingo! Exactly what CNN was hoping for — a comment (or, rather, a non-comment) that other panelists could attack. And attack they did.
“Let’s stop dancing around this issue,” said Bianna Golodryga, a CNN contributor and former co-anchor on “Good Morning America” and “CBS This Morning.” “It’s a racist comment. ... There’s no other way to define it than racist.”
Frank Bruni of the New York Times was even more direct: “All due respect, I have no idea why [Love is] dancing around calling these comments racist. She’s no longer in Congress and she still seems unwilling to call out the president’s behavior for what it is. Those were racist comments.”
(Maybe Love is going to run for the seat she lost to Ben McAdams last year and she doesn’t want to draw Trump’s ire?)
An indignant Love fired back: “I’m sorry, don’t tell me how I should feel about what somebody says about me because I have grown up as a black woman in America my entire life. I have been taught, I do not let anyone make me a victim. So I call it like it is.”
Except that she didn’t. Love never answered the question about Trump’s tweet. So much for her vow, when she took the CNN job, that she would give viewers “a different, principled and unleashed perspective.”
Oddly enough, when asked directly on CNN in January 2018 whether Trump’s comments about “s---hole countries” was racist, she eventually said, “Yes.” So ... maybe she is going to run for Congress again and doesn’t want to cross Trump?
It’s also worth pointing out that, after she lost her reelection bid, Love didn’t hesitate to say Democrats “targeted me because I am a black female Republican,” while defending Trump against charges of racism.
This past Monday on CNN, after being asked repeatedly, Love eventually said that Trump’s tweet could be interpreted as racist, but she wasn’t going to make that call.
“I did not run away from it,” she said, running from it as fast as she could.
Her non-answers didn’t stop there. Asked if, as a woman of color, she’d ever been told to go back where she came from, Love played dumb. “Oh, gosh,” she said. “The country I came from was the United States, the country I was born in.”
We knew that. That’s why you were asked the question. Which you didn’t answer.
Most of us who aren’t politicians would lose our jobs if we were this non-responsive. Particularly if we’d been hired to express our opinions.
But the only thing that would have worked better for CNN is if Love had answered “no” to the is-the-tweet-racist question. The end result would have been the same, although it might have been louder.
That’s the CNN formula — a few minutes of news followed by a panel talking about it, expressing opinions and arguing with each other.
CNN thinks it’s great TV; I find it unwatchable. That’s why I tend to change the channel whenever one of those panels appears.

Texto completo: La historia de amor de Emma Coronel y Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera tuvo su más reciente capítulo el último día que se vieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Nueva York, con sede en Brooklyn, pero tuvo diversos momentos en que ella le envió mensajes de apoyo incondicional.
Lo primero que hizo el líder del Cártel de Sinaloa al ver a su esposa el día de su sentencia fue un “saludo militar” y enviarle un beso con la mano, pero luego no dejó de buscarla con la mirada, incluso en momentos clave, como cuando una de sus víctimas Andrea Velez , narraba que el mexicano intentó matarla.
Durante ese último día, la exreina de belleza portó joyas estimadas en $86,000 dólares , incluido un juego de pulseras Cartier de la colección Love, creada en 1970 por el diseñador Aldo Cipullo, que supone un mensaje “mensaje secreto” a su esposo sobre el amor que le tiene.
La casa Cartier define a su colección Love como un símbolo “de amor eterno”, tienen pequeños círculos formados por dos semicírculos que simbolizan la unión de los enamorados y supone un símbolo entre parejas cuyos sentimientos no pueden romperse , afirma la revista Quién.
La relación entre Guzmán Loera y Coronel ha sido complicada ante las condiciones de encierro del primero, aunado a que han decidido no escribirse más, luego de que sus primeras cartas no fueron entregadas por los fiscales federales y utilizadas como pruebas.
Sin embargo, la exreina de belleza ha enviado varios mensajes a su esposo para mostrarle su amor, todos en público, señales que parecía que solo ellos podrían entender, pero que fueron evidentes.
Uno de los momentos clave fue cuando decidieron lucir el mismo tipo de saco, uno de terciopelo color púrpura, como una forma de confirmarle al mundo que estaban juntos a pesar de cualquier situación . Lo lucieron cuando declaraba Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López , mejor conocida como la “ Chapodiputada ”, examante de Guzmán Loera.
Coronel también envió mensajes a su esposo en Instagram, aunque difícilmente él podría verlos, ya que no tiene acceso a internet.
“Todo va estar bien, tal vez hoy no, pero sí con el tiempo” , escribió a pocos días de iniciar el juicio.
Una vez iniciado el proceso en la Corte de Brooklyn, Coronel volvió a escribir.
“Cuando de ti se trata, la luna siempre será mi cómplice” , publicó Coronel en su cuenta en noviembre, a pocos días de iniciado el juicio.
Hay diversas interpretaciones sobre los mensajes “ocultos” que ella ha enviado, pero para José Reveles, autor del libro El Chapo, Entrega y Traición, podrían ser una forma de para mostrar al mundo que la vida sigue para una mujer joven .
“Tal vez quiere demostrar una liberación de que su vida más allá de lo que pueda pasar con su marido”, consideró.
En una entrevista a The New York Times, Coronel expresó que admiraba a su esposo y que lo amaba, un mensaje que es claro y ella no ocultó al acudir casi todos los días al juicio.

12 ways Iowans have beaten the heat throughout the years

Texto completo: For those who believe "listicles" became a popular mode of article writing with the rise of the internet and Facebook, Des Moines Register writer Josephine Lowman would like to disagree with her 1954 column "Heed These Rules; Beat The Heat," in which she lists six rules for staying cool during the heat waves of summer.
With the number of days spent in the 90s set to increase and in the spirit of Lowman's practical guidance, the archives of the Register (and the Tribune) have been scoured for all the tips, tricks and pics of Iowans finding ways to beat the heat over the past century or so.
Go swimming The hottest day of July on record in Des Moines came on July 25, 1936, when the temperature reached 110 degrees. One notable story of cooling down was included in that morning's Register, which reported that 95-year-old Civil War veteran John T. Gager of West Union swam with his great-grandchildren in a filled-in gravel pit on the family farm.
On Aug. 20, 1972, temperatures climbed up into the 90s, getting so hot that those at the Iowa State Fair that year sought out water wherever it could be found, including Victor, the wrestling bear, who took periodic dips in his pool.
From the Birdland pool on Des Moines' north side to the now-gone Sunset Beach, Iowans have always taken to the water wherever they can find it to cool off when the mercury starts to rise.
Eat the right kinds of food In Lowman's 1954 column, she cautions against eating "high calorie and energy foods." In 2002, a reporter also cautioned to avoid protein and to eat small meals in a piece on how to stay cool.
Whether it's the 19th or the 20th century, it seems common sense says the same thing: don't over-eat or you'll overheat.
Cook the right kinds of food There's nothing worse than making an already hot house or apartment even hotter by turning on an oven. And, as has already been established, there are certain foods that are better for the heat-enduring body than others. There are a lot of recommendations from throughout the years on what hot-weather food is best to make at home.
Sausage peanut-pilaf was the recommended mix-and-serve casserole to make when it's difficult for the cook "to become enthusiastic about anything more involved than cold cuts and iced tea" in July 1955. The following year, an article recommended making meals on the skillet.
In July 1960, the Register published a full-page feature on tuna, the perfect meal for cooling down, along with recipes for Lime-Tuna Ring, Hawaiian Tuna Salad and Tuna-Vegetable Salad.
By 1986, Dominoes was offering "Beat the Heat" specials, where you could get a six-pack of Coca-Cola for 99 cents with the purchase of a pizza, cutting out the need for tuna entirely.
Wear the right clothes Wearing light clothing with white or bright colors is nearly universally recommended as an easy way to avoid getting overwhelmed by the hot temperatures.
Lowman advises "pedal-pushers and sundresses and halters." Over a decade later, she again told Register readers to wear cooler clothes, specifically cotton underwear over polyester and that shorter hair was cooler than longer, complex hairstyles. A column of hers on keeping cool from 1972 advises women to put waterproof makeup on their legs instead of wearing tights.
Styles have changed quite a bit in the intervening decades, thankfully. In the early 2000s, the Register reported "lightweight, light-colored clothing" and a hat as the recommendations for hot weather wear.
Nearly two decades later, it's safe to say that you should definitely consider your clothing before heading into the heat.
Wear suits made of asbestos Please don't actually do this.
In 1956, the Register published a special dispatch from New York on a suit made of "woven asbestos the consistency of a light tweed with a coating of aluminum." It could reportedly withstand temperatures of 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
Needless to say, this did not become a popular way to fight back against the heat.
Seek out air conditioning whenever possible Despite the New York Times article published earlier this month titled "Do Americans Need Air Conditioning?" air conditioning is very much the preferred way for most people to cool down and a necessity for the very young and the very old.
A 1962 summer report of teenagers, a demographic that knows the value of escaping the summer doldrums than most others, reported that they used swimming to cool down more than any other activity, but air-conditioned environments were a close second. Without climate-controlled office buildings to retreat to like many adults, teenagers of this period turned to bowling alleys and theaters instead.
Avoid the outdoors when the temperature is highest It seems like common sense, but it really does help to be outside early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun isn't bearing down quite at its peak power.
This sort of mindset can only be taken as far as your fellow community members allow. In June 1953, a Des Moines man tried mowing his lawn at 4:50 a.m. and got a visit from the police after the neighbors decided it was too early for that kind of thing.
Mexsana powder Advertisements for Mexsana topical powder can be found throughout the Register in the 1940s, when air conditioning was not quite as common or efficient as it is today. The powder, which mostly works to absorb moisture from your skin, is still available for purchase.
Chill out, dude Register columnist Marian Matthews reminded her readers in 1955 that the best way to stay cool was to prepare for the heat, a task she defined as taking more "mental than physical effort."
Along with wearing cool clothes and bathing in cool water, Matthews also recommended you "keep your emotions and temper under control" in order to regulate the outer temperature's effect on your inner feeling.
Throw a party 1955 was an especially interesting year in the Register's tips for keeping cool. An article from that summer by Jean Tallman advises remedying the summer boredom and excessive heat by fixing an ice-filled pitcher and calling the neighbors.
Wear a bandana Register writer Susan Kreimer reported a growing trend of people, mainly outdoor workers, using water-soaked bandanas as a way to keep cool in 1999.
Ignore it or accept it Iowa summers are hot and humid, sometimes exceptionally so, and there's not much that can be done about it. As a community long based around agriculture, the state has a culture of acceptance around the weather and meteorological events.
When asked how she was dealing with a heat wave, Mrs. Charles Welter told the Register in 1956 that she and her husband "weren't trying to get away from it" and that they "were waxing the floors."
"I just take it, "I.J. Hawbaker of Adel told the Register in 1968. "There isn't much you can do about it."
"Are you really asking me this for The Register?" Becky Machovic of Mason City said when asked how she keeps cool that same year. "Keep cool? I don't, I really don't."

Texto completo: Headnote A STAR IN THE MAKING
NORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. - College basketball's familiar faces - Mike Krzyzewski, John Calipari, Roy Williams, Tom Izzo, Jay Wright and on and on - convened last week at a recitation center here in South Carolina, as they have for years in mid-July, to scout the best high school talent in the country.
But none of them were present for the biggest draw on Court 5 one day last week at the Peach Jam tournament, where hundreds of spectators lined up three hours before an afternoon game that featured players 15 and younger. The crowd squeezed into the court's wooden bleachers and the balcony above - standing five deep and eventually drawing the attention of the local fire marshal - to get an early glimpse at a player who has not yet entered high school.
He does, however, have a household name: LeBron James Jr.
While college coaches bided their time to get a peek at LeBron Jr., who goes by Bronny, others could not wait.
Dozens of fans rose, cellphones aloft, each time he shot a 3-pointer, and the games carried an unusual degree of intensity, even for showcases that sort out the pecking orders of adolescent alpha dogs. When Team Final, a group based in Philadelphia, had beaten Strive for Greatness, with Bronny on a roster of players from California, Arizona, Utah and Nevada, the celebration was so vigorous that one expected confetti to drift down from the rafters.
As the final seconds ticked away, Enai White, a 6-foot-5 forward who will be a sophomore this fall at Imhotep Institute Charter in Philadelphia, waved his arms at the fans behind his bench to get them to cheer even louder.
"It was crazy," Enai said of the atmosphere. "I've never seen nothing like this for a 15-U AAU game."
He smiled.
"I'm not going to lie," he added. "It made me feel like a little celeb."
If there was anyone in the gym who seemed to greet the environment with a shrug, it was the young James himself. At 14 he was one of the youngest on the court, but he was also often the most composed - calmly passing the ball out of traps, stepping in to break up a confrontation that resulted in double technicals, and in one game looking unperturbed as he listened to chants of "overrated" while he stood at the foul line in the final minute.
He missed both free throws, but that has been known to happen.
Paul Biancardi, an ESPN recruiting analyst and a former college coach, said Bronny's poise was not much different from his father's when he was a high school phenomenon.
"He's been taught by the absolute best," said Biancardi, who as an assistant at Ohio State had recruited LeBron James.
Though James did not attend the tournament, two of his close friends did; Chris Paul and James' former teammate Mike Miller each watched Bronny play.
At one game, Paul sat next to James' wife, Savannah, and the couple's young daughter in a corner of the gym that was near an exit and well fortified by security guards. Bronny's grandmother and other members of the family circle watched, too.
One of Bronny's games last summer had to be shut down because of a fan who was heckling James, which may have explained why there was also a security guard stationed on the Strive for Greatness bench.
"He's been well prepared for this - as well as anyone can," Miller said. "It's been a group effort, by his mom, his grandmother, the whole family."
Bronny, who is listed as 6 feet 2 inches, resembles his father in many ways: His smile, facial expressions and slightly duckfooted gait are familiar - as are his pass-first sensibilities, which is a largely recessive trait in the grassroots basketball world. And yet there are signs that he is his own young man - his tinted hair is grown out more than his father's ever has been, he wears the uniform No. 0 (not his father's 23 or 6), and he can skillfully juggle a basketball with his feet.
In this orbit, Bronny is more complementary player than chosen one. Though his jump shot is much more refined than his father's at a similar age, his physical gifts are playing catch-up with many of the elite players his age.
James lamented last year that he had passed his name on to his eldest child, though his intentions were honorable. "When I was younger, I didn't have a dad," he said on "The Shop," his HBO show. "So my whole thing was like, whenever I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Junior, I'm going to do everything that this man didn't do."
James is not shy about sharing stories of his children on social media, which might explain why Bronny has 2.7 million followers on Instagram.
There were other scions in this tournament, which featured 15-, 16-, and 17-and-under divisions: Kenny Lofton Jr., Jamal Mashburn Jr., Larry Hughes Jr., Adrian Griffin Jr. and the grandson of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Their careers may be tracked by the basketball cognoscenti who filled the small gyms, but those who attended Bronny's games - or hoped to - were largely fellow teenagers.
When security guards closed the doors to the gym before Bronny's final game here, they slammed shut on Mark Abduo, 21, and the four high school players he had driven down from Pittsburgh to watch the tournament. They had skipped lunch and waited three hours in line to get in.
"They need to change the location," Abduo said. "The next four years, it's just going to get bigger and bigger."
That much seems certain. Bronny will enroll as a freshman this fall at Sierra Canyon, a private school in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he will join Dwyane Wade's son Zaire on the basketball team.
At the moment, among his peers - gangly and still developing - Bronny seems a good player among more talented ones.
"Definitely a Division I player," Biancardi said, be it Duke or Duquesne. That will be determined with time, he said - and plenty of people watching.

MYSTERIOUS MAN BEHIND 'STORM AREA 51' JOKE EVENT STEPS FORWARD

Texto completo: It's all fun and games until you accidentally incite a giant mob to raid a top-secret military base.
The internet has been buzzing with excitement about a Facebook event titled "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us," with 1.6 million people having clicked "Going" and another 1.2 million indicating they're "Interested."
Hitherto cloaked in mystery, the man behind the legend has stepped forward.
On June 27, Matty Roberts, who lives in California, created the Facebook page as a joke, not realizing that millions would rally behind his battle cry to "see them aliens" at the Air Force facility in Nevada.
Most, but not all, knew the desert congregation scheduled for Sept. 20 was in jest, as the page included instructions such as "If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens." (For the uninitiated, "naruto run" is a reference to a type of running in a popular anime show.)
A pinned post on the page attempts to cover its bases, reading "Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet." But as the event has gained traction - inspiring dozens of memes and jokes - the profile of the situation has risen, so much so that the Air Force has been made aware of the potential impending raid.
"I waited for like three days and there were like 40 people and then it just completely took off out of nowhere," he told CNN affiliate KLAS-TV in Las Vegas. "It was pretty wild."
Mr. Roberts told KLAS he'd declined interviews as interest was skyrocketing because he thought if he revealed his identity he might have FBI agents showing up at his door.
"I was just like, the FBI's going to show up at my house, and it got a little spooky from there," he said.
Mr. Roberts said he came up with the idea for the meme page after podcaster Joe Rogan interviewed Area 51 whistleblower Bob Lazar and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell. Mr. Lazar claims that he worked with an alien spacecraft while he was employed in one of Area 51's underground facilities.
Before coming out to KLAS, Mr. Roberts communicated with NPR via Facebook messenger under the pseudonym Val.
"I just thought it would be a funny idea for the meme page," he wrote.
Mr. Roberts/Val also said that, although he doubted he'd have an actual army gathered to run into Area 51 this September, he'd been in touch "with some pretty great people" to plan a safer, yet still out-of-this-world desert event.
Military 'stands ready'
For its part, the Air Force told The Washington Post that Area 51 is an "open training range for the U.S. Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces. The U.S. Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets."
The Air Force says that it does not discuss its security measures and that the test and training range provides "flexible, realistic and multidimensional battlespace" for testing and "advanced training in support of U.S. national interests."
Some people may be taking the event seriously. The Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, Nev., which is close to Area 51, has gotten an unusually high number of reservations for a certain date.
"Oh, it's insane," Connie West, a co-owner of the inn, said in an interview on Sunday. "My poor bartender today walked past me and said, 'I hate to tell you, but every phone call I've had is about Sept. 20.'"
She added that many people had mentioned the Facebook post when they called to reserve the inn's rooms and recreational vehicles, all of which are now booked for that date - even though the Facebook post invited people to Amargosa Valley, which is hours away from the Little A'Le'Inn by car, and on the opposite side of Area 51.
"They're pretty serious," Ms. West said. "They're coming. People are coming."
The New York Times and The Associated Press contributed.

Texto completo: Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'AM I A TERRIBLE PERSON?' at Under St. Marks (July 25, 7 p.m.). This showcase finds comedians ostensibly asking themselves the titular question, through their own jokes and revelatory stories. Chelsea White hosts with Babe Parker and Davey Stevey Dave, and Dave Hill, Vanessa Hollingshead and Tarik Daniels spin some yarns.
212-777-6088, horsetrade.info/under-st-marks
'BIT TANK: COMEDY MEETS CAPITALISM' at Littlefield (July 19, 8 p.m.). In this parody of "Shark Tank," ABC's competition for entrepreneurs, jokes are pitched and sold as comedians offer up new routines to a panel of better-known comedians in front of a live audience. ImpossibleOdds provides music to add to the excitement, and Micah Sterenberg hosts.

'DOUGLAS' at the Daryl Roth Theater (July 23-Aug. 24). Hannah Gadsby claimed she was quitting comedy in her previous show, "Nanette." Then it captured the world's attention through Netflix last year and earned a Peabody Award this year. Her follow-up show, "Douglas," has almost sold out its first week of performances at Union Square, but her Off Broadway run continues into August, so get tickets while you can.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'HOW DID THIS GET MADE?' LIVE at the Beacon Theater (July 24, 7:30 and 10 p.m.). The comedy couple Paul Scheer and June Diane Raphael and their funny friend Jason Mantzoukas have appeared in many popular TV shows and movies. Their long-running podcast explores and makes fun of films that tanked at the box office but continue to capture our collective imagination, and now they're taking their cinematic criticism on the road and to the Beacon. The show at 7:30 p.m. has sold out, but tickets remain for the one at 10, during which they dissect "The Master of Disguise," the 2002 movie starring Dana Carvey.

CARMEN LYNCH at the Creek and the Cave (July 19-20, 7 p.m.). In 2017, Lynch released the album "Dance Like You Don't Need the Money," which Jason Zinoman of The New York Times called "punchy and quick, shifting with alacrity from bits about family to dating." Since then, Lynch took her show "Lynched" to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and toured Europe. Find out what she's joking about now before she presents her newest hour of material in Montreal next week at the Just for Laughs comedy festival.

THE STAND'S GRAND REOPENING (July 18, 8 p.m.;July 19-20, 8 and 10 p.m.). After six years in Gramercy, this intimate comedy club closed in June 2018 to relocate to a bigger space near Union Square. The move took longer than anticipated, but the Stand reopened on Monday night at 116 East 16th Street. Among those on hand this weekend to christen the downstairs stage are Judah Friedlander, Ari Shaffir, Kevin Brennan, Sherrod Small, Emmy Blotnick, Sam Jay and Petey DeAbreu. The new club also has a second stage at street level that hosts live podcast recordings, such as "The Legion of Skanks," which will be taping there on Monday at 9:30 p.m.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
Previews & Openings
'BROADWAY BOUNTY HUNTER' at Greenwich House (in previews; opens on July 23). "Be More Chill" may have announced its closing date, but that show's composer, Joe Iconis, will warm up Off Broadway with this tale of a longtime triple threat with a side hustle as a vigilante. Reviewing a 2016 production, The New York Times called it "a sweet if slight goof of a musical." Annie Golden reprises her starring role.

'DOUGLAS' at the Daryl Roth Theater (performances start on July 23). In "Nanette," the one-woman sensation that became a Netflix special, Hannah Gadsby announced a plan to quit comedy that has obviously failed. Now Gadsby returns with this new show, named for her dog. She jokes -- with laughs that come easy and hard -- about the response to "Nanette" and her recent autism diagnosis.
800-653-8000, hannahgadsby.com.au
'LITTLE GEM' at the Irish Repertory Theater (in previews; opens on July 25). In Elaine Murphy's alternating monologues, written in a style a New York Times review of an earlier production called "vivid, natural and particular throughout," a mother, daughter and grandmother survey the rugged terrain of an Irishwoman's life. Marc Atkinson Borrull's revival stars Marsha Mason, Brenda Meaney and Lauren O'Leary.

'MIDSUMMER: A BANQUET' at Café Fae (in previews; opens on July 24). The lunatic, the lover and the poet can eat together in this new production from Third Rail Projects and Food of Love, which presents Shakespeare's comedy alongside a multicourse supper. The director and choreographer Zach Morris transforms Willem de Kooning's former studio space into a fairyland as the food designer Emilie Baltz prepares the snacks.

'MOULIN ROUGE' at the Al Hirschfeld Theater (in previews; opens on July 25). Raise a glass of absinthe to the Broadway adaptation of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 jukebox musical film. Directed by Alex Timbers, the show stars Karen Olivo, Aaron Tveit and Danny Burstein, with choreography by Sonya Tayeh. Reviewing the show's Boston incarnation last summer, Ben Brantley called it a "smart, shameless and extravagantly entertaining production."

SUMMER SHORTS SERIES A AND B at 59E59 Theaters (performances start on July 19). Quick! How fast can you make theater? In this annual festival, playwrights premiere new, brisk one-acts. Two series run in repertory and include plays by Neil LaBute, Nick Payne and Sharr White. The plays limn strangers, friends, family and one long-estranged couple.

Last Chance
'FRANKIE AND JOHNNY IN THE CLAIR DE LUNE' at the Broadhurst Theater (closes on July 28). Arin Arbus's revival of Terrence McNally's 1987 drama, with Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon as unlucky-in-love lovers, plays its final notes. "What begins as a basic inquiry into the nature of love," Jesse Green wrote, "slowly transforms into something deeper and eerier as the couple decides how, or whether, to proceed."
212-239-6200, frankieandjohnnybroadway.com
'THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES' at the Linda Gross Theater (closes on July 21). A buzzy Off Broadway musical, based on Sue Monk Kidd's best seller, puts away its hives. A tale of a runaway housekeeper and her runaway charge, this story, set in the civil-rights-roiled South, has a book by Lynn Nottage, music by Duncan Sheik and lyrics by Susan Birkenhead. "Though the result doesn't yet cohere," Jesse Green wrote, "it is a serious and honorable first draft."
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'A STRANGE LOOP' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on July 28). Michael R. Jackson's thrillingly solipsistic work closes its Off Broadway circle. About a black, queer musical theater writer (played by Larry Owens) writing a show about a black, queer musical theater writer, the play "burrows so deep into the shadows of its hero's tormented mind," Ben Brantley wrote, "that you wonder if it will ever emerge into the light." All performances have sold out, but you can add your name to the waiting list one hour before each performance.

Donald Trump Hates America

Texto completo: So apparently Donald Trump wants to make this an election about what it means to be American. He's got his vision of what it means to be American, and he's challenging the rest of us to come up with a better one.
In Trump's version, "American" is defined by three propositions. First, to be American is to be xenophobic. The basic narrative he tells is that the good people of the heartland are under assault from aliens, elitists and outsiders. Second, to be American is to be nostalgic. America's values were better during some golden past. Third, a true American is white. White Protestants created this country; everybody else is here on their sufferance.
When you look at Trump's American idea you realize that it contradicts the traditional American idea in every particular. In fact, Trump's national story is much closer to the Russian national story than it is toward our own. It's an alien ideology he's trying to plant on our soil.
Trump's vision is radically anti-American.
The real American idea is not xenophobic, nostalgic or racist; it is pluralistic, future-oriented and universal. America is exceptional precisely because it is the only nation on earth that defines itself by its future, not its past. America is exceptional because from the first its citizens saw themselves in a project that would have implications for all humankind. America is exceptional because it was launched with a dream to take the diverse many and make them one -- e pluribus unum.
The Puritans settled this continent with visions of creating a future city on a hill. They had an eschatological dreams of completing God's plan for this earth. By the time of the revolution it was well understood that America was the land of futurity, the vanguard nation that would lead all of humanity to a dignified and democratic future.
"I always consider the settlement of America with reverence and wonder," John Adams declared, "as the opening of a grand scene and design in providence, for the illumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth."
American life is so raucous and dynamic because people are inflamed by visions of creating a heaven on earth. As George Santayana put it, Americans often don't make a distinction between the sacred and the profane. In building material wealth, they see themselves creating a country that will redeem humanity, that will become the last best hope of earth.
This sense of mission has often made Americans arrogant, and somewhat dangerous to be around. But it has also made us anxious. The country was built amid a wail of jeremiads: Providence assigned us a mission to serve the whole planet, but we, in our greed and sin, are blowing it! "Ah my country!" Ralph Waldo Emerson lamented, "In thee is the reasonable hope of mankind not fulfilled."
But the American mission survived its failures. Herman Melville summarized the ethos in his novel "White Jacket": "God has predestined, mankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel in our souls. ... We are the pioneers of the world; the advance-guard, sent on through the wilderness of untried things, to break a new path."
Again and again, Americans have felt called upon to launch off into new frontiers -- to design a democracy, to create a new kind of democratic person, to settle the West, to industrialize, to pioneer new technologies, to explore space, to combat prejudice, to fight totalitarianism and spread democracy. The mission was always the same: to leap into the future, to give life meaning and shape by extending opportunity and dignity to all races and nations.
This American idea is not a resentful prejudice; it's a faith and a dream. The historian Sacvan Bercovitch put it best: "Only 'America,' of all national designations, took on the combined force of eschatology and chauvinism. Many forms of nationalism have laid claims to a world-redeeming promise; many Christian sects have sought, in open or secret heresy, to find the sacred in the profane; many European Protestants have linked the soul's journey and the way to wealth.
"But only the 'American Way,' of all modern symbologies, has managed to circumvent the contradictions inherent in these approaches. Of all symbols of identity, only 'American' has succeeded in uniting nationality with universality, civic and spiritual selfhood, sacred and secular history, the country's past and the paradise to be, in a single transcendent ideal."
Trump's campaign is an attack on that dream. The right response is to double down on that ideal. The task before us is to create the most diverse mass democracy in the history of the planet -- a true universal nation. It is precisely to weave the social fissures that Trump is inclined to tear.
Americans have always been divided on where they came from, but united in their vision of their common future. They've been bonded by the vision of creating a pluralistic home in which everybody can belong and be seen. Or as Langston Hughes wrote: "America never was America to me/And yet I swear this oath/America will be!"

Texto completo: Las grandes redadas en 10 ciudades programadas por agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) desataron el temor de inmigrantes, pero ante la cobertura mediática y las alertas enviadas por activistas, la agencia ha organizado pequeñas movilizaciones, en busca de objetivos específicos.
Sin embargo, como ocurre en otros operativos, es posible que “La Migra” detenga a otras personas en su camino a hallar a inmigrantes con órdenes de deportación.
“La administración ahora dice que planea llevar a cabo varias redadas de menor escala durante la próxima semana” , publicó The Atlantic, el cual destacó que los operativos serán en viviendas, donde los agentes aplican tácticas disuatorias o coercitivas.
“Los agentes de ICE ingresan a sus hogares mediante el uso de medios coercitivos, incluso forzando su entrada” , cita ese medio un reporte el Proyecto de Defensa de Inmigrantes. “Levantando sus armas, y amenazando con arrestar a todos en la casa”.
The New York Times y CNN habían confirmado que los grandes operativos de ICE anunciados por el presidente Donald Trump serían más discretos, debido a la cobertura mediática y para lograr sus objetivos.
Altos funcionarios del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ( DHS ) descartaron ofrecer detalles a los medios de comunicación sobre sus acciones, pero confirmaron que las motilizaciones continuarían.
“No esperaría una gran movilización que coincida con la histeria que hemos escuchado en los últimos días” , dijo el funcionario.
Los operativos están programados en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans, Nueva York y San Francisco , zonas donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados.

Texto completo: The Arlington Heights Memorial Library celebrated FanCon’s fourth year as more than 800 residents of all ages stopped by the annual comic book and pop culture convention on Saturday, June 13.
Fans were dressed up in all sorts of fun costumes as they made their way throughout the library, participating in more than 20 different activities. From an intense Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Tournament hosted by The Age of the Geeks that had 78 participants to fan-themed crafts, there was something for everyone at this year’s FanCon.
New York Times bestselling author and illustrator Jarrett J. Krosoczka, who is known for the popular Lunch Lady and Jedi Academy book series and his recent graphic memoir Hey, Kiddo, was one of the biggest highlights of the day as he met fans while hosting an illustrator’s workshop, two book signings and an author talk.
"The best part of FanCon is having the author here," said Tania Fraser, who attended FanCon with her 10-year-old son Scot. "My son just came out of the illustrator’s workshop and he drew characters from his books. […] I think it’s great that the library does this."
Other popular activities included Nerd Trivia, which tested people’s pop culture knowledge in a game show-style format, an appearance from the characters of Alice in Wonderland who hosted a Mad Tea Party and a photo op session, a Create Your Spidersona: Drawing Workshop and Artist’s Alley, which gave convention-goers the opportunity to meet nine different artists and exhibitors.
"I think it’s very entertaining to see [everyone] having fun. With all the different costumes, it’s a different environment for the boys," said Joseph Urizar Sr., who attended FanCon with his mother and two sons. "My mom noticed that it’s the diversity that sticks out. It’s a welcoming environment for all."

Texto completo: Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Donald Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent and Illinois native, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee, has lamented the current state of affairs. In November Roberts pushed back on Trump. Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that Kavanaugh drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13 McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, wanted the president to quickly name presumptive nominee Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve for just such a moment.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later. Senators never held a hearing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Shelley Jackson was 7 years old the first time she heard it.
In the early 1970s, Ms. Jackson was among a group of 40 black children who were bused from one side of Los Angeles to integrate a majority-white school across town. One day, a playground squabble ended in a white classmate telling her to go back to Africa.
"That day was the first day that I became aware that maybe we weren't supposed to be there," Ms. Jackson, who was born in California, said in an interview, "or that wasn't our place."
On Sunday, President Trump used a version of a well-worn insult to tell four congresswomen to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done." All but one are American-born, but all are women of color.
The president's words reflected a love-it-or-leave-it sentiment that experts say has animated a sense of xenophobia since the dawn of the republic.
But fresh examples persist. Along with more than 4,800 other people who wrote to The New York Times to share their own experiences with the phrase in the hours since Mr. Trump wrote it on Twitter, Ms. Jackson said his words served as a cutting reminder for scores of people who had encountered some version of that phrase throughout their lives, usually when they were speaking out in predominantly white spaces.
"It's like having a cold glass of water thrown in your face," Ms. Jackson said, adding that she feels Mr. Trump has emboldened a culture where "you get a pass now to just say the things you only thought before."
Those who study language and rhetoric say the president's "go back" comments -- or, at least, the sentiment behind them -- have roots beginning as far back as the 1600s, when dissidents were banished from American colonies for advocating total religious freedom. Later, a set of laws passed in 1798 allowed the deportation of noncitizens who were considered dangerous, were from hostile nations or had criticized the federal government.
Amos Kiewe, who studies rhetoric at Syracuse University, guessed that the president's tweet was most likely meant to sow divisions in the Democratic Party -- and perhaps kick-start another news cycle that reporters would breathlessly follow -- but that it had the side effect of surfacing a phrase with a history that is particularly racially divisive.
"There has always been this xenophobia, fear of the other," Mr. Kiewe said, "the foreigner, the person who looks different. It has hit different minorities for many decades."
It was there in 1882, when the Chinese Exclusion Act sought to curb the number of Chinese workers and families entering the United States to find day-labor work, from building railroads to doing laundry. And it was there in the 1840s, when anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment in the United States led to the creation of a nativist political party designed to weed out foreign influence.
One of the prime examples of the "go back" sentiment has roots in the American Colonization Society, a white-led organization that sought to send freed slaves back to Africa. Fodei Batty, an assistant professor of political science at Quinnipiac University, wrote in a 2016 Washington Post analysis that some freed slaves went willingly because they were "disillusioned with the prospects of racial equality in America," while others who wanted to stay argued that the effort to resettle slaves was a thinly veiled way to purge the United States of black people.
Descendants of those who stayed, Mr. Batty said in an interview, are now familiar with the sort of knee-jerk "go back" slur meant to immediately single out someone from a group where one trait -- usually whiteness -- is the default.
"You're making this claim only to adopt a sense of place," Mr. Batty said, "to put someone in a sense of place and give a sense of the other, that someone is different, without even having an understanding of the implications of those words."
For African-Americans, the idea of returning to Africa, originally advocated by some whites as a better alternative than servitude, now persists as an angry slur. Outside a Trump rally in Cleveland in 2016, a man was filmed shouting "go back to Africa" at a black woman who was there to protest Mr. Trump.
"Y'all brought us here," the woman retorted.
From the 4,800 responses The Times received, a common theme seemed to be encountering the slur when speaking up in white spaces, with the targets not limited to African-Americans. Samantha Edwards, a 47-year-old administrative assistant who grew up in Las Vegas, also wrote to The Times to share her story.
In the mid-1990s, she said she and her mother were chased out of a restaurant by two white men who screamed at them to "go back to Mexico." She said she and her mother had been speaking together in English before the men chased them. Ms. Edwards, who was born in the United States but is of Mexican descent, said her parents avoided teaching her Spanish so she could avoid some of the discrimination they felt.
"It's frustrating to have a leader of your own country talking like that," Ms. Edwards said, referring to Mr. Trump. "He's supposed to represent all of us and he's not."
Alanna Daniels, a 33-year-old business analyst from Waco, Tex., said that she often heard different variations of the taunt as a child, depending on which country people thought she was from. Ms. Daniels, who is mixed-race American with a white mother and a black father, said Mr. Trump's tweet reflected back a version of a "kindergarten, exasperated" insult she has heard throughout her life.
She highlighted the irony that a president who has spent much of his campaign and presidency criticizing his country, often referring to it as a "laughingstock," is turning that argument back on four congresswomen who have criticized it for other reasons.
"It was almost him saying that 'this discourse is not for you,"' Ms. Daniels said. "It was almost saying 'this isn't yours, you have no skin in the game -- literally."'
On Monday, speaking at a Made in America event showcasing American-made sandals, hot sauce and motorcycles at the White House, Mr. Trump defended himself against assertions that what he said was racist, and that white nationalists were finding common ground with him.
"It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me," Mr. Trump said. "All I'm saying is that if they want to leave they can leave. It doesn't say leave forever."

Texto completo: She grew up in Canada, but like many children of immigrants, dreamed of reclaiming her heritage.
So Hodan Nalayeh, a journalist, founded an online show, Integration TV, to chronicle life in her country of birth, Somalia and in the Somalian diaspora. Then in December, she moved back there, newly married.
Nalayeh's reporting steered clear of politics, her friends and colleagues said, focusing instead on the lives of women and young people, on the struggles of the poor to make ends meet, and on the natural beauty of the country.
"She never spoke about the ills of the country," said Fadumo Qasim Dayib, a Somali expatriate who met Nalayeh a few years ago. "She tried to stay neutral so that she wouldn't be seen as a threat."
In the end, that proved no protection. Nalayeh was killed in a terrorist attack over the weekend on a hotel in the southern port city of Kismayo.
Responsibility for the attack, which began Friday night, was claimed by the al-Shabab, an Islamist rebel group with links to al-Qaida. Al-Shabab has killed thousands across East Africa in its bid to overthrow Somalia's Western-backed government.
The attack lasted more than 14 hours before troops shot dead all attackers inside the hotel compound, Col. Abdiqadir Nur, a local police officer, told The Associated Press.
Nalayeh's husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, a hotel developer and former minister in the regional government of the surrounding area, was also killed. The two married last fall, and Nalayeh was pregnant. She had two young sons from a previous marriage.
Twenty-four other people, including Tanzanians, Kenyans and a Briton, were also killed in the attack, and 56 more were injured.
Nalayeh, who was 43, was one of 12 children, according to a Facebook posting from her family. The family moved to Canada when she was 6, her producer and cameraman, Simon Taveta, said in a telephone interview.
At first, Taveta said, Nalayeh did her show from Nairobi, traveling to Somalia for the reporting. But in December, she moved back home because "she wanted to be in a country with her people, telling the positive stories," he said.
Nalayeh racked up a large following in Somalia and across the world, with more than 87,000 followers on her prolific Twitter account, and more than 145,000 on her Facebook page. Her show was popular on YouTube.
Zahra Shirwa, a Somali-American and the former head of Global Somali Diaspora, said Nayaleh had an "unparalleled optimism" and drive that made her a role model for other Somalis, both at home and abroad.
Nayaleh was not interested in the rich and powerful, Shirwa said.
"She chose instead to report on the woman selling tea or the young fisherman, to show both their struggles and their determination to making a living despite all the odds against them," Shirwa said. "This was her quiet way of holding authority accountable."
Nalayeh was impressed by the resilience and determination of her countrymen, but "floored" by the abject poverty she saw after relocating to Somalia, Shirwa said.
Nalayeh tried to navigate the dangers of Somalia by avoiding controversial topics. In her show, she tended toward the idyllic: a pristine beach with gulls flying overhead. A young fisherman flashing a toothy grin. The perfect cup of tea.
"People save all their lives to have a retirement by the beach," she wrote while reflecting on a recent reporting trip. "Yet, we have plenty of it and cannot see its value. Let's appreciate the beautiful blessings we have."
Recently, Nalayeh produced a series of videos about things for visitors to do in her hometown, Las Anod, which is in the semiautonomous region of Somaliland. Her father held government positions there.
Nalayeh posted clips of her family drinking fresh camel milk, attending a groundbreaking ceremony for a new library, and climbing the highest peak in the city. But she also shared snippets of daily life.
"This is why our culture is beautiful," she wrote with one photo from her trip of a young man helping his elderly father. "We value our parents. We value the elderly. We value kindness."

Texto completo: Gran desconcierto y temor generó el anuncio de grandes redadas de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) en 10 ciudades, a comenzar el 14 de julio, pero hasta ahora no hay reportes de capturas masivas.
Los planes de la agencia se modificaron, según The New York Times, debido a la cobertura mediática.
“Los planes para la operación se modificaron en el último minuto, después de que los informes de noticias dijeron a las comunidades de inmigrantes sobre qué esperar” , indicó el diario.
Sin embargo, un alto funcionario de inmigración confirmó a CNN que la lista de ciudades e individuos objetivo sigue siendo la misma y podría impactar al menos a 2,000 familias; agregó que la movilización comenzó el sábado y se extenderá a otras ciudades sin precisar, además de que los operativos se harían discretamente.
“No esperaría una gran movilización que coincida con la histeria que hemos escuchado en los últimos días” , dijo el funcionario.
Los operativos se programaron en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans, Nueva York y San Francisco , zonas donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados.
IMPORTANTE: Los 5 principales consejos para enfrentar redadas de ICE
Defensores y activistas han reportado las tácticas que ICE podría estar utilizando para lograr las capturas.
“Puedo confirmar. ICE fue a la casa de un cliente vistiendo camisas que decían ‘POLICÍA'” , indicó el abogador Aaron Reichlin-Melnick . “Le mostraron a su sobrina adolescente una foto de un hombre al azar que, según dijeron, había robado la identidad de su tío y la hizo llamarlo para que regresara a casa. Cuando llegó a casa, lo detuvieron frente a ella. Ella estaba traumatizada”.
Can confirm. ICE went a client's home wearing shirts that said "POLICE."
They showed his teenage niece a picture of a random man they said had stolen her uncle's identity and had her call him to come home.
When he got home they arrested him in front of her. She was traumatized. https://t.co/3aDtacM8pj
— Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) July 15, 2019
También se destaca que los agentes migratorios podrían estar esperando a sus objetivos fuera de sus viviendas, para evitar alertarlos y lograr capturarlos.
“Los agentes de ICE deben esperar a que sus objetivos salgan de sus hogares voluntariamente para arrestarlos” , indica Daniel Nichanian, miembro de la organización The Justice Collaborative. “Usan tácticas como llevar fotos de señuelos, mostrarlas por las ventanas… simulando estar buscando a alguien más”.
Cabe destacar que ICE nunca especifica cómo, cuándo y dónde realiza sus operativos contra inmigrantes, pero sus propios reportes de diversas movilizaciones indican que movilizaciones nacionales, como el que ocurre en 10 grandes ciudades del país , pueden tardar mínimo tres días o incluso semanas.

Texto completo: Alexander Acosta's decision to step down as secretary of labor means there's another vacancy in the president's administration
There's a lot of "acting" amid the revolving door of the Trump administration: acting secretary of labor, acting secretary of defense, acting secretary of homeland security. Even the president's chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, still is described as "acting."
There are acting officials in other departments and agencies as well, but you get the picture.
"I like 'acting' because I can move so quickly," Trump said earlier this year on CBS' "Face The Nation." "It gives me more flexibility."
But it also raises questions about the stability of the administration, as well as congressional oversight -- how did some of these people ever get confirmed in the first place?
Acosta, for example, was confirmed as head of the Labor Department, where one of his jobs was to oversee human trafficking laws. Earlier as a U.S. attorney, however, Acosta had given what is now seen as lenient treatment to Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy money manager who stands accused of sex trafficking. Acosta, then the federal prosecutor in South Florida, negotiated a deal with Epstein's lawyers in 2008 that allowed Epstein to leave jail six days a week to continue to make money. Acosta also kept the deal secret from Epstein's victims.
Interest in the Epstein case was resuscitated last fall when Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown went back over the case and interviewed many of Epstein's victims, many of whom were as young as 14 when they were sexually abused.
It was difficult, arduous work, but Brown and a colleague, Emily Pichot, persisted.
"This is a search for the truth," Brown recently told the New York Times. "This is about sexual abuse and power and people who cover it up. Sexual abuse doesn't discriminate on political party."
It's also the kind of investigative work that should have been done by the White House, which advanced Acosta's nomination, and by the U.S. Senate, which has the power of advice and consent over appointments made by the president. Both branches have armies of staff attorneys and investigators who are supposed to do this work, but they obviously didn't, at least not at the breadth and depth required.
Instead, it was left to two dogged reporters.
Two crucial observations here: Congress, a co-equal branch of government, needs to do a much better job overseeing the Trump administration and its appointments. And there will always be significant importance to citizens in journalism that watches, questions and reviews our governmental institutions and elected and appointed officials.

Texto completo: Jose Rodriguez stocked his food cart with fewer fresh fruit cups Sunday, figuring many in Santa Ana’s Latino community might stay home for fear of much-touted immigration raids.
But his sales were brisk.
Immigration arrests were not.
“I wasn’t expecting any crowds,” said Rodriguez, who has worked his cart at the same corner for 26 years, selling fresh fruits, cold drinks and Mexican treats. “There’s been so much fear in the community.”
That fear, for a day at least, seemed to be unfounded.
Immigration rights advocates from around the region said Sunday they hadn’t heard of any large operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. And while some arrests occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside and Lake Elsinore over the past few days, it’s unclear if those were related to the announced sweeps or part of typical ICE work.
President Trump this month announced, initially on Twitter, that on Sunday, July 14, ICE agents would pick up some 2,000 immigrants around the country who are living in the United States illegally and have deportation orders.
He’d made a similar claim in June, saying “millions” of people would be removed from the country. The June raids never happened.
The plan slated for Sunday would focus on criminals and recent arrivals from Central America. They could also include “collateral” arrests of people who happen to be in the area of the intended targets, according to news reports.
The publicized sweeps were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Miami, New York and San Francisco. Two other cities originally on the list, Houston and New Orleans, were reportedly postponed because of tropical storm Barry.
It’s possible the raids were only delayed, not abandoned.
Instead of a large, simultaneous sweep, immigration officials created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week, the New York Times reported Sunday. Individual ICE field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin those sweeps.
Immigration officials have declined to say what their plans are, saying it could threaten the safety of agents and jeopardize their operation.
In Southern California, immigration arrests, they pointed out, are made every day.
“This is what we are. We are a law enforcement agency,” Lori Haley, an ICE spokeswoman based in Orange County, said Friday.
Many immigrant-rights advocates said they were not surprised by the low-key rollout of the so-called sweeps.
“I think they’ll do their usual ops today. They want that element of surprise,” said Jennaya Dunlap, deportation defense coordinator for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.
Even through 2,000 arrests or so – spread across Los Angeles and the other cities – are not necessarily unusual for ICE raids, the president’s words and the media’s coverage of his plan have created considerable anxiety, advocates said.
“It’s not about the numbers. It’s about the fear,” said Guillermo Torres, who spearheads the immigration campaigns of the Los Angeles-based Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice.
“Words are powerful and they impact families. And that’s what this president has done, for political purposes, because he’s running for re-election,” Torres said.
In downtown Santa Ana, the number of visitors appeared typical. Some said business was a little slow, but most said it was about the same.
In other heavy Latino locations, some residents were reportedly keeping a low profile.
“We were in Lake Elsinore yesterday (Saturday, July 12,) and the stores were empty. People were telling us they don’t come out until evening,” said immigration rights advocate Dunlap.
“That’s the kind of fear people are living” with, she added.
On Sunday, Dunlap was at a swap meet in Winchester, a small town close to Hemet in Riverside County. Normally, the swap meet would be very crowded – but not this Sunday.
“We’ve come here before and given out a couple of thousand hotline cards,” Dunlap said. “But I’m standing here and literally no one is walking past.”
Another swap market that had much lower attendance Sunday was one outside Cypress College, said Anaheim resident Dariana Diaz, whose father has a stand. “People are scared of the raids.”
In Indio, Coachella and Moreno Valley, advocates noted that local supermarkets frequented by Latino customers had considerably fewer shoppers on Sunday, according to Luz Gallegos, community programs director for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC) Legal Center.
Yet, at least 160 people turned out Sunday for information forums in Perris, Coachella and Victorville, she said. A few attendees had deportation orders.
“People were very interested in identifying the official documents and understanding the difference between an ICE warrant and a search and seizure warrant signed by U.S. magistrate judge,” Gallegos said.
In recent weeks, starting after Trump initially tweeted about deportations, local groups have held numerous seminars, sometimes called “know your rights” forums, telling immigrants how to handle potential contact with ICE officials and how to prepare their families, legally, in case adults are removed from the country without their children.

Texto completo: A few days ago, I went to Lagoon with a friend. It had been years since I’d been to the amusement park. I rode Cannibal for the first time. The roller coaster was fun, even though the 8-year-old next to me said he wished the screaming would stop.
“I know,” I said. “That amount of screaming is really rude.”
“It was you,” he said.
“I’m pretty sure it wasn’t,” I said.
“I have video,” he said.
The kid was never seen again. But his phone was found, smashed beyond repair.
Even though the Lagoon parking lot was full, the lines to the most popular attractions were short. We barely had to wait, except when it came to the Terroride. You know the ride, you Lagooners. It very slowly propels you through dark corridors and subjects you to creepy animatronics, strobe lights and a loud horn that makes me scream every time because I hate you, horn, and you are the worst thing ever!
While we were in line, a father in front of us was trying to calm his young son. The toddler had obviously never ridden the Terroride because he was scared.
At this point, my friend (who has no children of his own) said to me, loudly, “I heard this ride is the scariest ride this side of the Mississippi.”
“Shhh,” I said, eloquently.
“Did you read that news article about that kid who died on this ride?” my friend said.
Then I punched his arm, eloquently.
Anywho, yes, my friend was joking about a scary story that wasn’t true.
But what about the scary stories that are true? Hold on to your seats. Reader discretion advised.
My family owns a condo in Midway, a small town just outside of Park City. My co-authors and I stay there often to write our books. The condo has three bedrooms, three bathrooms and is basically nondescript, except the cupboard doors in the kitchen seem to always be open.
So, my co-authors and I did some research into the criminal history of Midway, because we are kind of obsessed with true crime stories.
Fast forward to the next Halloween, and my parents, my kids, and my nieces and nephews are sitting around a campfire in Midway.
The grandkids were telling scary stories, like “click-shaw” (the serial killer who was in a wheelchair, and had hooks for hands) and the Lady in Blue (who, supposedly, haunted the Salt Lake City Cemetery).
Then it was my turn, and I decided to tell a true story.
Here’s how it went:
“Once upon a time, there was a family who lived in a condo in Midway. It was a father, a mother and two adorable children: one daughter, one son. In the winter of 1989, a snowstorm hit, and dumped a record amount of snow. To this day, residents say they had never seen, and would never see, such a deluge.
“The entire town was confined to their quarters. The streets weren’t accessible to snowcats, let alone cars. The City Council provided food and necessities to the residents, using a government-issued ‘super-snowcat’ once a week.
“It was a time when, if you were smart, you’d stay indoors.
“This family in the condo followed the rules. The mom spent most days on the second floor playing with the children. But the father, whose name was Jerry, was a trifle claustrophobic, and the weather was really getting to him.
“He was lonely. For conversation, he started talking to the walls. But the walls refused to talk back. His cabin fever and frustration grew. Why weren’t the walls answering him?
“One day, as he was making himself coffee, he opened a cupboard. And finally, the wall answered back. ‘I am not real. You are imagining me.’
“In order to keep the conversation going, Jerry opened all the cupboards, and spent his days making sure they were never closed.
“His wife did not understand this ‘need’ to keep the cupboard doors open. She spent many days closing cupboard doors. She taught her children to do the same.
“Days later, police found the wife and children dead, the kitchen cupboards open, and the father hanging from a rope that was thrown over the third floor balcony.”
I finished with this doozy to my mom: “Our research proved to be correct. This actually happened. And that’s why you got the condo for such a fantastic price.”
There was a long silence around the campfire. The younger children sniffled and wiped away tears. The older children mentioned that it would be cool to stay in tents instead of sleeping in the condo. They had most definitely seen the open cupboards.
My mother tried to settle everyone else’s minds. “Children, I promise that when we bought the condo, we had the place spiritually cleansed.”
She spoke with authority, which was slightly undermined because her voice was shaking.
That night, we all slept outside under the stars.
It wasn’t until the following morning that I, hesitantly, told everyone that I had made the entire thing up.
And this is why I no longer have any family. Does anyone out there have room in their families for a woman with lots of creative stories?

Texto completo: Federal judges are supposed to be neutral decision-makers. But any pretense of neutrality has slipped away as the appointment process for Supreme Court justices and prominent lower-court judges has become mired in political partisanship.
President Donald Trump seems to expect his appointees to automatically side with him, just as he expects judges selected by President Barack Obama to be against him. His administration has allowed conservative advocates to play an outsize role in picking nominees. And the Senate, with its power to confirm or reject those choices, has sunk deeper into partisan score-settling.
Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to today's hyper-politicized process. But nothing approaches the muscle that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell exerts. McConnell thwarted Obama's opportunity to replace the late justice Antonin Scalia in 2016 and, once Trump took office in 2017, began directing the swift approval of a record number of appeals court judges, as well as two Supreme Court justices.
In his new book, "Confirmation Bias," journalist Carl Hulse delves deeply into recent confirmation battles, describing the Senate's advice-and-consent power as "corrupted to what appears to be the point of no return."
The book is an absorbing, if dispiriting, look at the maneuverings of inside players like McConnell and Donald McGahn, Trump's first White House counsel, and outside advocates like Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who appears to have steered judicial selection as much as anyone at the White House.
Hulse, a New York Times correspondent and Illinois native, probes moments of escalation over the years and the backroom machinations of the Trump strategy now transforming the courts and the law. Inevitably, he covers previously reported ground, but "Confirmation Bias" is an important guide at this crucial time for the stature of America's judiciary.
Chief Justice John Roberts, himself a Republican appointee, has lamented the current state of affairs. In November Roberts pushed back on Trump. Roberts issued a statement saying: "We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."
Yet individual judges have sometimes reinforced the notion that they are bent on favoring the president who appointed them. Of equal concern, the selection process appears patently designed to produce men and women who will do just that.
Tracing the origins of the Trump plan for the federal bench, Hulse recounts McGahn's early interaction with the candidate. They were introduced by David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. Trump inscribed a copy of "The Art of the Deal" to McGahn's young son, Don III, writing, "You've got a great dad." McGahn then helped draw up Trump's spring 2016 list of possible Supreme Court nominees.
Once Trump became president, McConnell and McGahn formed an early partnership to place ideological soul mates on the bench. McGahn engineered the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court. In 2018 he managed the resignation of Justice Anthony Kennedy and his replacement by Brett Kavanaugh.
Back in 2008, Kavanaugh, then an appeals court judge, swore in McGahn after his confirmation to the Federal Election Commission. "That guy's going to be on the Supreme Court someday," McGahn said privately. Nearly a decade later, in 2017, Hulse writes, McGahn confided to Trump strategist Steve Bannon his continued interest in Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court choice.
During the televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last year, McGahn coached the nominee on his response to Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation. As Ford testified before senators, Hulse reveals, McGahn received "worried texts from his circle" and then urged Kavanaugh to respond aggressively: "He wanted to see the nominee push back, cut off his interrogators, and turn their questions back on them." Kavanaugh denied Ford's allegations dating back to their teen years in suburban Maryland, chalked them up to partisan critics and challenged senators about their drinking habits after they suggested that Kavanaugh drank to excess as a young man.
For decades, Republicans in Washington, dismayed at the judicial liberalism of the 1960s and 1970s, have made judicial appointments a higher priority than Democrats have. There have been exceptions, of course, when Democrats went on the offensive. In 1987 the Democratically controlled Senate rejected Robert Bork, and in 2013 Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid instigated a change in filibuster rules to win confirmation of stalled Obama nominations. A decade earlier, Reid helped block several nominees of President George W. Bush.
Yet Republicans such as McConnell have more recently been in control and ready to play hardball, partly as retribution. On Feb. 13, 2016, when Scalia died, McConnell received early word. When the death became public, McConnell was ready with his statement that an appointment to the seat should be saved for the next president, to be elected in November. On that same Feb. 13 McGahn called Trump to advise him on addressing the vacancy and offering names of possible successors.
Hulse writes of the ensuing angst among some on Obama's team that the president moved too slowly on a successor. Ron Klain, then chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, wanted the president to quickly name presumptive nominee Merrick Garland, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit. The well-regarded moderate's name had been kept in reserve for just such a moment.
Within a few days of Scalia's death, Hulse reports, Klain told White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough: "The president ought to go to the Rose Garden tomorrow and name Merrick Garland. Tomorrow. Not a month from now. Tomorrow. Every day that ticks by is a day that you are letting McConnell consolidate his position."
Obama announced the Garland choice a month later. Senators never held a hearing.

Texto completo: It didn't come to me right away, but finally I recognized the model for Joe Biden's unusual campaign, the former president whose pitch Biden's most closely resembles:
George W. Bush.
I'm referring to Bush's first presidential bid, in 2000, which is remembered mostly for its surreal climax: the seesawing returns on election night, the Florida recount, the Supreme Court ruling that effectively decided the contest in his favor. To the limited extent that political junkies recall his slogans and stump speeches, the phrase "compassionate conservative" comes quickest to mind.
But Bush's strategy and success arguably hinged less on selling himself as a new kind of Republican than on being seen as a tested, trusted, traditional brand. His surname did much of that work, and he augmented it with a sustained oratorical emphasis on propriety. He pledged to "restore honor and integrity" to the White House in the wake of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and subsequent impeachment.
Biden's core promise is to end the much greater melodrama and expunge the infinitely darker shame of Donald Trump's presidency, also by returning to what preceded it: Barack Obama's administration.
Obviously there are big, glaring differences between Biden and Bush, and not just ideologically.
But Biden isn't exactly campaigning on his three and a half decades in the Senate, not when you consider all the chapters - his fury over busing, his treatment of Anita Hill, the crime bill, the invasion of Iraq - that he wishes voters wouldn't dwell on.
No, Biden is campaigning on his eight years as vice president. He's also campaigning on the nostalgia of his surname, the familiarity of his presence and the comfort of his aura.
The last two Democrats to win the presidency, Clinton and Obama, didn't take a tack anything like Biden's. Clinton was the man from Hope, Arkansas, who was determined to give liberalism a modern makeover and set the Democratic Party on a more profitable course. Obama was hope and change - not to mention the audacity of hope .
Both men were under 50 when they attained the presidency, and both were in keeping with the Democratic Party's flattering (and not quite accurate) image of itself, from John F. Kennedy onward, as youthful, innovative, visionary, trailblazing. But Biden, 76, isn't about exploring uncharted paths. He's about following breadcrumbs back to where we lost our way.
This isn't a bad thing. It's a Trump thing. For many Democrats, Biden included, the insult of Trump is so immense and the threat that he poses so profound that 2020 isn't a year for experiments and idealism. It's a year for survival.
And from that mindset springs Biden's campaign, drab in the abstract but unorthodox in the context of Democratic proclivity and precedent.
Unorthodox in respect to his rivals, too.
Bernie Sanders, with his call for Democratic socialism; Kamala Harris, with her intensifying emphasis on racial disparities; Elizabeth Warren, with her encyclopedia of plans; Pete Buttigieg, with his husband and his mere 37 years on Earth - the election of any one of them would be a bold statement, a milestone.
Biden, in contrast, is trying to get Democrats to do something that Republicans have more practice at: choose a nominee who's due over one who's new.
He has his raft of policy positions - many of them echoes or adaptations of Obama's - but they're not what his supporters think of first. They're not what he thinks of first, either.
That was clear inhis recent interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo. Asked about Harris' attack on his civil rights record, he signaled surprise and hurt.
"She knows me," he protested.
A few beats later: "The American people think they know me and they know me."
And one more time, during that same 30-second span: "People know who I am."
That's the message. It might as well be the bumper sticker. At most other junctures, it would be fatally underwhelming. At this one, there's no telling.

Texto completo: Facebook has agreed to pay a record $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission after a yearlong investigation into the company's privacy practices, according to multiple reports Friday.
Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that the FTC this week voted to approve the settlement, which was born out of last year's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal involving the personal data of Facebook users. If the reported amount is correct, it would be the biggest fine ever imposed by the United States on a tech company. It would dwarf a $22 million FTC fine on Google in 2012.
The FTC reportedly voted 3-2 on the settlement, with the agency's Democratic commissioners opposing the deal because they were pushing for more restrictions on the company. Facebook has been under fire for years over how it protects and shares the data of its more than 2 billion users.
An FTC spokeswoman said Friday that the agency would have no comment. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company was not confirming the reports and would have no comment.
After the news last year that political data consulting firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the personal information of up to 87 million Facebook users without their explicit consent, the FTC opened an investigation into whether the Silicon Valley tech giant had violated a 2011 settlement regarding its privacy practices.
In April as it reported quarterly results, Facebook said it was setting aside $3 billion in anticipation of a fine, which it expected to reach up to $5 billion.
Facebook critics, including advocacy groups that have decried the company's privacy and other policies, were quick to slam the reported deal.
"A fine no matter how large is not enough," David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress Education Fund, said in a statement Friday. "It is clear that Facebook has too much power and is too big to manage. A Federal Trade Commission that was serious about its job would push for structural reforms like spinning off Instagram and WhatsApp that would create competition in the social media space and make Facebook more likely to respect its users."
The privacy mess involving Cambridge Analytica a now-defunct firm that was co-founded by Steve Bannon and used by the presidential campaign of Donald Trump prompted Congress to summon Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Washington last year and shareholders to call for him to step down as chairman of the company's board. The scandal sparked closer scrutiny and further criticism of the tech industry from advocacy groups, politicians and others, some of whom have called for breaking up Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. Last month, after reports that the federal government is considering antitrust investigations into tech giants, House lawmakers said they were also looking into possible anti-competitive behavior by the companies.
"Despite Republicans' promises to hold big tech accountable, the FTC appears to have failed miserably at its best opportunity to do so," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement Friday. "The only way to assure Americans that our private data will be protected is to pass a strong privacy bill, like the one I plan to introduce in the coming weeks."
But another advocacy group, the Center for Democracy and Technology, held off on criticizing the settlement, noting Friday that the deal could include more restrictions on how Facebook handles user data.
"The FTC has put all companies on notice that they must safeguard personal information," Nuala O'Connor, CDT president and CEO, said in a statement. The group accepts funding from tech companies, including Facebook.
Any settlement would need approval from the Department of Justice, which does not usually reject FTC decisions.
Shares of Facebook, which had closed Friday up 1.8% to $204.87, were up slightly in after-hours trading.
"This was expected by Wall Street," said Laura Martin, analyst for Needham & Co., on Friday.

Texto completo: Maybe President Donald Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country.
Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America - except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," The Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea - the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 - just two decades ago - that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.'"
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Mr. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Nancy Pelosi is right: A social media fan club isn't real-world influence

Texto completo: In an age of constant connectivity, politicians use social media to their great advantage. While some may utilize it only when campaigning or for infrequent updates, others access it regularly as a means of communication with the general public. For all the benefits associated with Facebook, Twitter, and the like, these online destinations are still bubbles unto themselves that give users, well-known or not, the feeling of power and some portion of sway. Reality tells a different story.
Both President Trump and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez use Twitter to speak to their audience and to make waves in the news world. They both have a penchant for tweeting that which will cause a rise out of others. It can be an effective tool. But while the response to their musings is seen both online and offline, the belief that tweets make a real-world difference is shaky at best.
Recently, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi chastized Ocasio-Cortez in a New York Times interview by insisting that popularity in the online world (in this case, Twitter) is not synonymous with offline power. Pelosi, a California progressive, has a habit of being wrong. In this case, she was absolutely right, much to the continued chagrin of her younger, inexperienced colleague.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” the California Democrat said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”
This statement is a blow to the millennial sentiment that online superiority translates to real-world dominance in some form or fashion. Certainly, retweets and likes make any social media user feel they are reaching the masses. But these metrics are only reactions in a personally curated echo chamber located within a slightly larger echo chamber called Twitter. In the first quarter of 2019, the number of monthly active Twitter users in the U.S. reached roughly 68 million. That's well and good, but it's still less than half the number of registered voters in the United States, a figure that stands at 153 million. Of all eligible voters in the country (which includes those registered or not), only 50.3% showed up on midterm election day to cast a ballot. This percentage is better than other years, but still, many who can vote simply aren't.
For Ocasio-Cortez, it matters little if she makes waves in the world of Twitter. Only eligible voters in her district have any say as to whether she spends more years touting her far-left ideology in Congress. Even if voters elect her again, her influence is still only one vote and a long way from any leadership position held by her experienced nemesis, Pelosi.
While actual tweets themselves may not do much in the online world in which they exist, the news about said tweets can often reach far and wide. This is especially evident with President Trump, whose words on Twitter reach those who couldn't care less about the platform. Instead, they prefer to watch cable news. The same can be said for Ocasio-Cortez whose cocky, and sometimes entirely incorrect, Twitter and Instagram Live rants become the subject of articles and roundtable discussions.
Like it or not, we're still in the beginning stages of a world where social media is a major focal point. What is a fixture now will surely undergo changes, big and small, in the years to come. Platforms will continue to emerge and serve as competitors to long-standing ones. But regardless of the influence they provide, an online world where politicians like Trump and Ocasio-Cortez can command attention and persuasion still does not have an identical twin in the unplugged world. Pelosi is correct to imply that such a thing must still happen organically.
Online tools and networking platforms can be useful for politicians from either party who want to create a brand. But lasting power and influence in government still require hard work that can only take place away from the glow of a screen.

Incredible kidneys, photogenic toxins, delusional Brits, and more from the week online

Texto completo: ORGAN FAILURE
Look, we've all been there: Stayed up too late, slept in too late, coffee not working, and suddenly you're expected to discuss a new kidney health initiative before a large assembly. Easy enough, right? Just Wikipedia some kidney stuff in the Uber over, copy some stats into a blank note, anchor some sentiments about the critical importance of kidney health with some personal experience (which you likely have given how common kidney disease is), knock back another coffee, and you're ready to dazzle. Or, if you're the president , just waltz up to the podium and sweet-talk the organ as though it could hear you: “The kidney. Very special. The kidney has a very special place in the heart. It's an incredible thing." Indeed, truly incredible. What were we talking about again? Ah yes, kidneys. (All that coffee is really bad for them, you know.)
POSING DANGER
Elsewhere in filtered toxins, a New York Times story highlighted a wildly popular spot for Instagrammers in Siberia (not a typo) colloquially known as the “Maldives of Novosibirsk" but more technically known as a massive man-made waste pool for a nearby electrical plant. The abundance of calcium salts, metal oxides, and other toxins in the “water" lend it an iridescent blue hue, luring selfie snappers desperate for the perfect faux-tropical shot to its shores (and sometimes even into the slurry itself). And according to locals, the third arm is like having a natural selfie stick. 
SAY WHAT?
A runaway Twitter thread this past week collected what one contributor called “read-it-never-said-its" — i.e. words you learn by reading but fail at properly saying. Like “Epitome but like it rhymes with home" (that's Lin-Manuel Miranda , btw), or “banal, and it was embarrassing,"  or “Meme. Certain it was, 'me me'," or my own trouble with biopic — which still conjures up what sounds like a painful medical procedure when I see it. Or GIF, which we will never agree on, so let's just keep moving, even though it's clearly pronounced /jif/. I said keep moving. 
NO LOVE LOST
And lastly this week from the crazyverse, one in eight British men (i.e. 12 percent of the population) responded in all seriousness to a YouGov poll that, given an opportunity, they believed they could win a point against 23-time Grand Slam title winner Serena Williams . And should you require an additional punch line, let's go with, “Turns out not everything said with a British accent sounds smarter."

The Latino community in Delaware is bracing for possible immigration raids planned across the country this weekend.
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials would neither confirm nor deny a New York Times report about raids targetting 2,000 illegal immigrants planned for 10 large cities starting on Sunday.
Activists in Delaware are gathering to support local immigrants and protest the ICE raids.
Lights for Liberty: A Vigil to End Human Detention Camps will take place in Rodney Square Friday night.
"Let's unite and protest together for the inhumane things that are happening in this country," said Charito Calvachi-Mateyko, co-chair of the Delaware Hispanic Commission.
They hope to educate immigrants on what to do if they encounter an ICE agent and explain their rights.
That education includes helping families plan for the care of their kids if they are detained, said Maria Matos, head of the Latin American Community Center.
Latinos account for close to 10% of Delaware's population or 92,000 people, according to the Census Bureau. The population continues to grow.
Jose M. Somalo, publisher and owner of the Spanish-language publication Hoy en Delaware, said even citizens who appear Hispanic are fearful of being approached by an ICE agent.
Pew Research reported there were 30,000 undocumented immigrants in Delaware in 2016.
A large number of immigrants live in rural Delaware working on farms and in chicken processing plants.
Many of those workers are concerned for their safety, Somalo said.
Delaware falls under the ICE Philadelphia Field Office, which also covers Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Philadelphia ICE officials could not be reached for comment.
President Donald Trump said two weeks ago that he would delay nationwide raids for two weeks to give Congress time to develop an immigration plan. Trump's hard line on immigration has been a recurring theme in his presidency and is expected to take center stage in his 2020 reelection bid.

Trump's ICE raids went from targeting 'millions' of illegal immigrants to just 2,000, and they may not even happen

Texto completo: There’s no reason to believe President Trump intends to follow through with the supposedly planned raids on 2,000 migrants living illegally in the U.S.
Like one reporter said Thursday on CNN, Trump's immigration rhetoric is “more bark than bite.”
The administration is once again making a big show about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement is set to spread through 10 cities and round up a bunch of illegal immigrants who have been served notice for deportation and who failed to show up for court hearings.
Unnamed administration officials told the New York Times that the raids will likely even result in the “collateral” detention of illegal immigrants who aren’t targets of the operation but who happen to be at the scene of those ordered for deportation.
Wow, that sounds like the hard-line approach Trump was ready to take just a couple weeks ago when he initially threatened the raids. Oh, but wait, he stopped them before they even began.
It sounds like the time he put his foot down, ready and “proud” to own the government shutdown at the beginning of this year. Oh, but he eventually relented on that, too.
The aggressive “raids” even sound like the law-and-order “no tolerance” position Trump’s Justice Department took on illegal border crossings. But after CNN got angry, he caved on that as well.
When Trump teased the raids the first time, he said they would target “millions” of illegal immigrants. Now it’s just 2,000. And the first time, he called the raids off, giving Congress two weeks to work out legislation that would end the asylum chaos at the border.
Two weeks have come and gone and there is no deal. It’s not even clear that there was an attempt at a deal. During a press conference Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said two weeks wouldn’t have been enough time to address the border issue with any new laws, and she didn’t seem too bothered by it.
Why would she be? "Millions" has become 2,000. Besides, on immigration, Trump is more bark than bite.Story URLPhoto Caption:In this Feb. 9, 2017, photo provided U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE agents at a home in Atlanta, during a targeted enforcement operation aimed at immigration fugitives, re-entrants and at-large criminal aliens.

Texto completo: During an Iowa campaign stop, Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock called the pay disparity between national men and women soccer players unacceptable.
The female World Cup champions are fighting for higher pay, saying in a March lawsuit that winning U.S. Women National Team members would only earn about 38% of the pay provided winning U.S. Men's National Team members.
"It's horrible. Horrible," Bullock said. The second-term Montana governor making his sixth visit to Iowa since announcing his bid in May.
"When you look at the stars on that team and how they represented our country, I think the soccer industry has to get it together," he said, adding that many other industries also need to work on eliminating gender pay discrepancies.
Nationally, women earn about 75 cents for every dollar a male makes working a comparable job earns, Bullock said.
The governor said he created an Equal Pay for Equal Work Task Force to close the gender pay gap in Montana six years ago. It asks businesses to sign a pledge that commits them to eliminate pay discrepancies, among other initiatives.
Here are some other questions Bullock fielded during his two-day Iowa swing:
Death penalty Bullock was the only presidential candidate in the New York Times' survey of 21 candidates to say he supports a death penalty.
While Montana has capital punishment, Bullock said it hasn't been used while he was the attorney general or governor.
"What I said was I wouldn't take it off the table for the most heinous crimes like terrorism," he said, acknowledging that there are economic and racial disparities when it comes to the death penalty.
Campaign finance Bullock has made his fight against "dark money," or contributions funneled through committees that allow donor names to be hidden, a key part of his campaign.
But the Center for Public Integrity questioned that, saying a Washington, D.C., lobbyist — whose clients include those who make dark-money donations — will hold a fundraiser for Bullock in August.
"When I got in this, I said there would be no corporate PAC money taken. No super PACs," Bullock said in Des Moines, when asked about the story. "Everybody who gives to my campaign for the reportable limits, I'll ask for full transparency."
Election vacation Bullock called public lands, voting and public education "three great equalizers" Americans have to improve their lives.
"No matter who you are, hopefully, you're given that shot" at a good education, he said.
"The other is public participation in a representative democracy," Bullock said. "Folks don't recognize that there's one day when we're as important as a Koch brother, and that's on Election Day."
And with public lands, "no matter how wealthy you are, how much your family has, well all own these things equally," he said, adding that he invited President Donald Trump last year to "see what really makes America great — like spend a night outdoors."
Asked if he would make Election Day a national holiday if he becomes president, Bullock said: "Heck, yeah. It's a holiday in Montana. ... I think we should do everything possible to get people to vote."
Montana Gov. and Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller walk to Bullock's campaign office in Des Moines. Bullock says about the pay disparity between the U.S. soccer teams: "I think the soccer industry has to get it together."

Texto completo: Speaker has publicly criticized Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, Pressley
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admonished Democrats for personally attacking one another, warning in a closed-door meeting Wednesday that the party's fracturing was jeopardizing its majority.
Without naming names, her target was clear: the four liberal freshmen known as "the Squad."
"You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it. But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just okay," Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Democrats.
But "the Squad" - Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) - is convinced it is Pelosi who is being the bully.
The four are struggling with the speaker's moves to isolate them in recent weeks, according to interviews with the lawmakers, congressional aides and allies. Pelosi has made at least half a dozen remarks dismissing the group or their far-left proposals on the environment and health care. More recently she scorned their lonely opposition to the party's emergency border bill last month.
And she defended those comments Wednesday, saying, "I have no regrets about anything. Regrets is not what I do," doubling down on her claim that the group has little power in the House.
"When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm's distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood," Ocasio-Cortez told The Washington Post. "But the persistent singling out . . . it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful . . . the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color."
The four women are trying to figure out how to respond, texting one another and weighing whether to confront Pelosi to ask her to stop. But for now, they are focused on their congressional duties, even as they defend their votes in the House that have drawn Pelosi's ire.
"Thank God my mother gave me broad shoulders and a strong back. I can handle it. I'm not worried about me," said Pressley, who called Pelosi's comments "demoralizing." "I am worried about the signal that it sends to people I speak to and for, who sent me here with a mandate, and how it affects them."
The tensions underscore the political and generational divide between the most powerful woman in American politics, who has led House Democrats for more than 16 years, and the new band of liberals clamoring for change and trying to push the party left. Pelosi has spent more than 30 years perfecting an inside game to secure wins for her party, most notably the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The four freshmen lawmakers, by contrast, have built a massive online following and leveraged their power on the outside, including in the 2020 presidential race.
Their ability to work together - or refusal to - will have major implications for Democrats as they seek to oust President Trump and retain their majority in next year's election. Pelosi knows that fate of her majority rests with the moderate Democrats who captured Republican-held seats in last year's midterm elections.
"A majority is a fragile thing," she said, according to two people present for the remarks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meeting, adding that members should show "some level of respect and sensitivity" to more moderate colleagues: "You make me the target, but don't make our [moderates] the target in all of this, because we have important fish to fry."
The speaker's allies say concerns about the next election is driving her moves to isolate these four women.
"Sometimes a leader's got to take positions to keep the team [united]," said Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.). "She knows what got us here and what's going to keep us here."
Pelosi suggested to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd in an opinion piece published Saturday that "the Squad" had a limited following inside the House. She specifically pointed to the example of the House-passed Democratic border bill in late June, which the group opposed.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said in the New York Times interview. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."
Several in the caucus were uncomfortable with Pelosi's comments. Congressional Progressive Caucus leaders are expected to talk to Pelosi about her comments, according to two officials familiar with the plan. Other women of color in the House have similarly expressed concerns.
"I can't tell the speaker to apologize, but I was taken aback by it. Because we're all here to work together," said Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), the first black woman to represent her state in Congress.
Notably, Hayes, Ocasio-Cortez and Omar appeared together with Pelosi smiling on the cover of Rolling Stone in a photo taken in January.
While some of the four enjoy more diplomatic relationships with Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez's relationship with the speaker has been chilly from the start. After she upset Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.) in the Democratic primary, Pelosi moved to immediately downplay her victory, saying it was a one-off event.
Still, Pelosi tried to create a bridge with the New Yorker: During their first face-to-face meeting just before the midterm elections, Pelosi spent nearly two hours trying to convince the liberal that she was just like her, touting her background. It was around that time that Ocasio-Cortez agreed to not only back Pelosi as speaker but also vocally defend her against rebels trying to keep her from the gavel.
Now, half a year later, virtually all communication between the two women has ceased. The two have not spoken one-on-one since February when Ocasio-Cortez declined Pelosi's personal request that she join her select committee on climate change, according to individuals who know both lawmakers.
Just days after, during a private Progressive Caucus meeting, Pelosi singled out Ocasio-Cortez in front of her colleagues, calling her out for rejecting the select committee offer. Ocasio-Cortez had publicly criticized leadership for refusing to give the committee the power to directly draft legislation.
Since then, Pelosi has made several dismissive remarks about Ocasio-Cortez, calling her Green New Deal "the Green Dream or whatever," and suggesting that a "glass of water" running as a Democrat could win in districts as liberal as hers.
"The third and fourth time [she insulted me], it was like, 'This is unnecessary, but I'm not going to pick a fight over it. Whatever, I'll be the punching bag if that's what they want me to be,' " Ocasio-Cortez said. But now people are telling the freshman to talk to Pelosi. She doesn't want to, however.
"There hasn't really been a relationship, to be frank," she said. "It's difficult."
Omar, according to people close to her, has been similarly disappointed. The lawmaker from Minnesota looks up to Pelosi and has enjoyed a positive relationship with the speaker, despite her criticisms of Israel that caused a major stir in the party. Even then, however, Pelosi gave Omar a heads-up before chiding her publicly.
In one of her first conversations with Pelosi after she won her primary, Omar told Pelosi that she couldn't vote on the floor because of a headwear ban in the House. Pelosi promised to change the rules so she could wear her hijab in the Capitol.
For Tlaib, Pelosi's latest comment amounted to a mixed message - one that seemed to contradict the advice Pelosi gave in a meeting early in her tenure. "Represent your district," Tlaib recalled Pelosi telling her. "And that's exactly what I'm doing."
Yet some lawmakers and aides believe Pelosi's treatment of the group is having a quiet effect on them. Many activists thought the group would band together to form a type of Freedom Caucus to deliver wins for the left, but they haven't done so and appear almost on the defensive when Pelosi criticizes them.
They also have not tried to whip votes against a major leadership priority such as the border bill, nor muscled House support for impeachment, an idea Pelosi rejects. And they have declined to call Pelosi out by name as she sidelines liberal policy priorities such as Medicare-for-all and the Green New Deal, dismissing them publicly as "enthusiasms" and "exuberances" rather than viable policy prescriptions.

Texto completo: In the time of tumult that was the American Revolution, enslaved and free blacks found themselves on both sides of the conflict.
The stories of how African Americans shaped and were shaped by the American Revolution are told in "Forgotten Soldier," a new special exhibition at the American Revolution Museum in Yorktown that opened June 29.
The exhibition provides a fuller picture of the American Revolution by drawing attention away from the marquee names of white generals and statesmen such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and focusing on the less well-known black people who also lived during those times.
"What we really want to do is shift your gaze to see history though a new lens," special exhibition curator Katherine Gruber said. "It's important to tell stories that are rarely told."
Those stories are told through rare artifacts and documents, interactive exhibits and artwork. Together, they paint a picture of the experiences of African Americans - some siding with the rebels to establish an independent country, and others remaining loyal to the British.
The power and responsibility of choice is a cornerstone of the exhibition - as with Washington and Jefferson, enslaved and free blacks were forced to make choices about how they would navigate a war that nobody could say with certainty how it would end. Oftentimes for enslaved people in the colonies, the choice boiled down to what an individual thought was the best chance for personal freedom, Gruber said.
Among the experiences explored in the exhibition are those of Crispus Attucks, a formerly enslaved sailor who died in the Boston Massacre, and Thomas Carney, who was born free and served in the Continental Army.
Dunmore's Proclamation of 1775, a document by Virginia's last royal governor that promised freedom to all enslaved blacks owned by patriots who took up arms on behalf of Britain, is among several significant loaned artifacts included in the exhibition.
Also on view will be Article Seven of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolution. The article ordered British forces to withdraw from the newly independent colonies "without causing any Destruction, or carrying away any Negroes or other Property of the American inhabitants."
In the exhibition's interactive activities, visitors will be able to learn about James Lafayette, an enslaved patriot spy, and objects used to pass spy messages, as well as items used by black soldiers in the Continental Army.
Original artwork by contemporary artist Titus Kaphar will lend a modern flavor to the exhibition. Kaphar, a 2018 MacArthur Fellow, will debut a commissioned sculpture that allows visitors to more fully consider the black soldiers who are often overlooked in historical accounts of the American Revolution.
The decision to include a black contemporary artist was made to tell the story of the people highlighted in the exhibition in a different way.
"This can be difficult history. We were looking for a way for folks to help tell this story," Gruber said.
Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, which operates the museum, found a willing partner in Kaphar. Kaphar uses his work to ask the viewer to consider history in a new light, one that places a larger emphasis on the contributions of African Americans to American history. The foundation commissioned the sculpture that appears in the exhibition.
Kaphar's paintings and sculptures have been featured in exhibitions and permanent collections at institutions including the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. The artist has also been profiled in The New York Times.
Gruber said the exhibition will hopefully fill a gap in American history, reminding modern-day Americans that the Revolutionary generation was made up of people not dissimilar to themselves, and included people of diverse backgrounds and experiences.
"There's a serious part of the story that's missing," she said.

Texto completo: Now we know why the Democrats were so upset about President Donald Trump speaking on the Fourth of July. It was not because it was political or partisan. It was patriotic, and that is what annoys the left the most.
Days before the speech, we heard that Trump was hijacking Independence Day and turning it into a campaign rally. But Trump never mentioned the 2020 campaign in his speech. We heard that Trump's desire to have tanks on the National Mall was an out-and-out authoritarian performance art. But that wasn't the issue. Neither was the fake outrage over the cost.
There was no mention of political opponents and no mention of the fake news media. And this wasn't Trump co-opting the nation's birthday to celebrate himself. In fact, for a man who loves to talk about his accomplishments, he never mentioned himself.
Trump did something far more dangerous to the left. He gave America a strong dose of patriotism. He gave Americans a history lesson of the past 243 years.
Last week, The New York Times ran a video arguing that America isn't the greatest nation on earth: "The U.S. is really just OK."
Without mentioning The Times or the video, Trump proceeded to tell us about America's greatness for nearly an hour interrupted only by applause, flyovers and military songs: "Today, we come together as one nation with this very special Salute To America. We celebrate our history, our people and the heroes who proudly defend our flag — the brave men and women of the United States military!"
'The fate of unborn millions' Trump told the story of Gen. George Washington as he readied his troops to fight the British. Trump said, "Washington's message to his troops laid bare the stakes. He wrote, 'The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army. ... We have, therefore, to resolve to conquer or die.'"
In reminding America of the great acts of past generations, Trump brought it to the present by honoring our first responders and all of the men and women of law enforcement. Trump also honored the Gold Star families who made the ultimate sacrifice.
He introduced NASA legend Gene Kranz and told him that we're going back to the moon, and that we're going to plant our flag on Mars.
He also introduced civil rights icon Clarence Henderson, who was 18 in 1960 when he took part in a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina. "He sits tonight in a seat of honor," Trump said. "Clarence, thank you for making this a much better place for all Americans."
I found it very unifying, but there were some triggers for the left.
A new tradition Trump said, "This country (is) the most exceptional nation in the history of the world." American exceptionalism annoys the left.
"We are one people, chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny," Trump said. "We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God." Mentioning God annoys the left.
I think this should become a tradition for every president from now on. With all of the partisan political fights, it was nice to be reminded of America's amazing heritage. It was inspiring, and that's what we need.
For one day, Trump put partisan politics aside and focused the eyes of America on our past, present and to our future. Thanks, Mr. President.

Bourbon makers ignore African-American market

Texto completo: Who is the typical bourbon drinker? Judging by the marketing for most whiskeys, a safe guess would be a white man, middle age and Southern by birth or at least aspiration. It could be a blonde woman in full Kentucky Derby pastels, holding a mint julep.
Many people would probably not picture someone like Samara Rivers, because African Americans like her are almost completely absent from bourbon marketing.
That's why Rivers founded the Black Bourbon Society, a national organization for African-American whiskey fans that has grown to more than 4,700 members since its creation two years ago. In late April, Rivers led 35 of them on a weekend tour through Kentucky, beginning with private tastings at distilleries like Woodford Reserve and Buffalo Trace and ending with a Sunday brunch in Louisville, where they honored the history of Black horse jockeys.
"There's this big hole in the market," said Rivers, 38. "What do Black consumers look like? We're teaching brands how to engage with fans like us."
While white people make up about three-quarters of all bourbon consumers in the United States, according to a survey by the media company Gravity, the details are more complicated. African-Americans are the most likely demographic group to prefer spirits like whiskey or cognac over beer or wine, according to Nielsen research. But while they constitute 13% of the total population, they are just 9% of bourbon drinkers.
That is a significant gap in the market, one that may grow more pronounced as the number of nonwhite consumers - what marketers call the multicultural demographic - continues to expand with America's rapidly diversifying population.
These realities hold for other types of spirits, like Scotch and vodka. But bourbon sales are on a decade-long tear, growing at 6% or more a year, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. That has American whiskey companies scrambling to create or expand their marketing efforts to people of color, and rethinking how they approach Black consumers in particular.
"The growth is all coming from multicultural," said Ryan Robertson, the head of multicultural marketing for Diageo, the British spirits company that produces bourbon brands like Bulleit and I.W. Harper. "For our brands to be sustained in the future, we have to absolutely start with a multicultural lens."
For many Black bourbon drinkers, the change isn't coming fast enough. They say that most brands, when they do reach out, still pigeonhole African-American consumers with outdated plans aimed at the "urban demographic" - industry jargon for lower-income, younger Black consumers who supposedly gravitate toward sweeter spirits like cognac and flavored whiskey.
"Don't promote to me with honey flavors or some hip-hop star," said Jamar Mack, 36, an African-American bourbon fan in Louisville. "My race is not my palate."
Like Rivers, a few years ago Mack found himself falling in love with premium bourbons like Woodford Reserve, but he was frustrated by the lack of attention paid to minorities at the events sponsored by his favorite brands.
In 2017, he founded Kentucky's Original Black Bourbon Enthusiasts, a Louisville-based club that has since added several thousand members, some as far away as West Virginia.
"We did a survey of our members, and 98% of them are college graduates, and 70% make over $150,000 a year," Mack said. His events regularly attract 100 members or more, he added, but until recently, he had trouble getting distillers to send ambassadors to lead tastings, a common practice in the industry.
Such differential treatment is something Kurt Maitland, the founder of the Manhattan Whisky Club and the author of "Drink: The Ultimate Cocktail Book," knows all too well. Maitland, who is Black, said he had no problem getting distillers to send a representative to his monthly events in Midtown Manhattan. But in the Bronx, where he lives near Yankee Stadium, premium bourbon is almost nowhere to be found, in bars, stores or advertising.
"There are groups of people in my neighborhood who I know are interested in high-end whiskey," said Maitland, 47. "But they aren't exposed to it in their regular life." He isn't going to wait for the brands to catch up: Maitland plans to open a spinoff of his whiskey club in the Bronx this year.
Bourbon makers aren't the only ones in the alcohol industry trying to attract nonwhite consumers. Some craft brewers and winemakers have made concerted efforts to diversify their workforces and their marketing appeal beyond their middle-class white base.
But when it comes to race, the bourbon industry has a particularly fraught history. Up to the 1950s, brands were often marketed with explicitly racist imagery, depicting Black men as minstrels, fools and servants. Some popular bourbons, liks Rebel Yell - named for a Southern battle cry from the Civil War - even played on Confederate imagery to win over Southern whites.
But as the civil rights movement raised the industry's awareness of Black middle-class consumers, whiskey makers began to reach out to African-American drinkers. They filled the pages of Ebony magazine with advertisements tailored to the magazine's readers: One, from 1966, showed a stylish Black couple touring the Old Taylor distillery; another, produced by Jim Beam in 1977, featured Ella Fitzgerald.
With the precipitous decline in bourbon sales between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, though, marketing of American whiskey virtually disappeared. The few advertising dollars still available were spent on the industry's core white-male audience - a group that, critics say, remains the focus today, even as the consumer base has grown and diversified.
"These brands are not necessarily innovative in their marketing." Maitland said.
One of the few to take a different approach is Uncle Nearest, founded in 2016 by Fawn Weaver and named for Nearest Green, the former slave who became Jack Daniel's first master distiller.
Weaver, 42 and African American, said that when she was starting her business, the most common advice she heard was to focus on white men ages 29 to 55 - advice she quickly rejected. But she is also wary of people who assume that just because she is Black, and her whiskey celebrates a Black distiller, she is making a product exclusively for Black consumers.
Instead, she wants her brand, and whiskeys generally, to eschew race-based marketing in favor of a broader approach.
"As an African-American, I don't want to be targeted, but I do want to be included." she said. "For many brands, in their marketing you'll see all white folks, and then a separate campaign that only appears in places like Atlanta or Washington, D.C."
Some of the established companies are starting to get the picture. In 2018. Brown-Forman, which owns Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve, restructured its multicultural team; in the past, it was siloed away from the brand-specific marketing efforts, but now it acts as an in-house consulting operation, helping the groups working on Jack Daniel's and other products to improve their outreach to consumers of color.
"Multicultural used to be thought of as a niche," said Tracey Johnson, the company's multicultural marketing manager. "Now we say it's everyone's responsibility. Our goal is to have our message be relevant across cultures."
Diageo has likewise expanded its multicultural initiatives. It has hired more minorities for its marketing teams - including Robertson, the company's head of multicultural marketing. Its I.W. Harper brand, which bills itself as a drink for refined hipsters (Diageo calls them "fashionable gents") is one of the few bourbons to include mostly African-Americans in its ads and social-media postings.
"They may skew African-American, but the brand is meant to be inclusive," said Robertson (though the women left out of the "fashionable gents" might disagree).
Fivers of the Black Bourbon Society said that for all the industry's missteps, she saw a genuine desire to get it right, if only because in a diversifying society, "it's bad business not to be diverse in your marketing." And she hopes that the success of grassroots groups like hers will persuade bourbon brands to move beyond ill-fitting stereotypes about the urban demographic.
"We're here," Rivers said, "and we bought products without any marketing. Now, imagine what you could do with some awareness."

Soft path to a hard peace in Afghanistan

Resumen: The first talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban may have achieved some progress because of a mood of empathy that was created by the sharing of personal sorrows during 18 years of war.

Texto completo: If forgiveness is key to ending a conflict, then the long war in Afghanistan just saw a merciful ray of hope. On Sunday and Monday, Taliban and Afghan officials held talks for the first time, even issuing a joint “road map” toward national reconciliation. Yet with the hard details still to be negotiated, it was the moments of softhearted sharing that may have set the tone for reaching a final deal.
During the talks in Qatar, more than 50 Afghan politicians and civil society activists and 17 Taliban members recognized the mutual suffering of others in the room as a result of the ongoing 18-year war. They told tales of relatives and friends lost to either Taliban attacks, U.S.-led airstrikes, or imprisonment. The sharing of personal sorrow set a mood of contrition and an opening for compromise. The joint statement stressed that all of Afghanistan is “suffering daily.”
Nader Nadery, chairman of the Afghan civil service commission, said he acknowledged the suffering of Taliban officials who had been held for years in detention. “I have the courage to forgive, as I know your members have suffered, too,” he told the group.
Many wept at the stories. “The pain from all sides, whether it is the night raids or the bombings, that is why we are here,” Suhail Shaheen, a member of the Taliban delegation, told The New York Times.
Such tender moments may help dispel the mistrust, fear, and hatred that drive the war. As often happens in negotiations to end armed conflicts, the two sides found some empathy. According to participants, there was great patience in listening to each story. Their newfound vulnerability and humility may yet create a capacity to forgive the violence of the past and move toward peace.
The two sides are a long way from finding common ground on basic issues of governance, women’s rights, and the role of other countries in Afghanistan. A parallel set of talks between the Taliban and the United States has made more progress. Yet this intra-Afghan negotiation has broken ground on essential virtues necessary for an agreement. “It is not easy for me to sit across from people who have killed my father,” said Abdul Matin Bek, an Afghan Cabinet member, according to the Times. Yet in a sign of forgiveness at work, he added, “But we have to end this.”

Texto completo: Nancy Pelosi took aim at the progressives in her own party again.
The House speaker, without naming them, wrote off Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) - four House Democrats who recently voted against $4.6 billion in emergency border funding.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi told The New York Times. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people and that's how many votes they got."
Pelosi was referring to their votes against the border bill, which President Trump signed into law Monday and failed to provide any funding for humanitarian assistance.
The longtime Democrat has gone after the progressive portion of her party before - in April, she relegated Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues to "like, five people" during an interview on "60 Minutes."
She also dismissed Twitter followers as irrelevant in an interview, saying the only thing that matters is "large numbers of votes on the floor of the House."

JOHN ROBERTS AND POLITICAL JUDGES A NEW BIOGRAPHY WADES INTO THE DEBATE ON A POLITICIZED JUDICIARY

Texto completo: America's longstanding debate about the politicization of the judiciary is by now so familiar that we have lost sight of its enigmatic character. Practically everybody, left and right, agrees that courts should somehow be above politics. At the same time, however, practically everybody can point to numerous instances of what they sincerely regard as egregious examples of politicized judging - important cases that courts have determined according not to law but to the political preferences of the judges. It is strange to find a phenomenon that is apparently prevalent despite being almost universally condemned.
This enigmatic problem is illustrated by the public career of America's most famous - and perhaps most enigmatic - judge: John Roberts. Chief Justice Roberts is famously associated with the claim that judges should not be political. During his confirmation process he insisted that judges should be only "umpires" and not players in the game of politics. At the same time, Justice Roberts has not been able to shake the accusation - made by his enemies, and sometimes even by his friends - that he himself is a political judge, that he has let considerations other than the Constitution and the laws determine the outcome of important cases.
This difficulty - Justice Roberts's desire to avoid politics while perhaps being unable to do so - is a key theme of Joan Biskupic's new biography. Ms. Biskupic covers Justice Roberts' whole life. The book includes revealing accounts of his youth and education, his work in the Reagan administration, his distinguished career as an appellate litigator, his brief service on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and his early elevation to chief justice of the Supreme Court. Ms. Biskupic's principal concern, however, is how Justice Roberts's work as a judge is influenced by his politics - both by his own political conservatism and by his concern for the court's public reputation.
As the author of previous biographies of Justices Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor, Ms. Biskupic is an experienced observer of the Supreme Court. As a result, "The Chief" is unfailingly informative and engaging. Nevertheless, the book's account of the nexus between law and politics is marred by two defects. These defects might be considered fortuitous, however, insofar as they help to illustrate the difficulties involved in grappling with the problem of politicized judging.
In the first place, Ms. Biskupic's account is somewhat biased. This is not to say that the book is malicious. Ms. Biskupic seems to respect and like the chief justice. But she is part of the liberal legal establishment, and it shows. The book seems to be organized more around her own preoccupations than around those of its subject. Issues that involve race - such as voting-rights cases and challenges to affirmative action in higher education - receive extensive treatment, while other, no less interesting and important questions are scanted or ignored.
It is hard to suppress the suspicion that Ms. Biskupic has lavished attention on areas of the law where she thinks she can plausibly suggest that Justice Roberts has allowed his legal thinking to be shaped by politics, but she has studiously avoided those areas where it would look like the liberal justices were guilty of the same thing. This is a commonplace fault of most arguments about what is often called "judicial activism." Political judging is a real problem, but the criticisms of it often turn out to be "political" or partisan themselves.
This brings us to the book's second defect. To get a clear understanding of how political considerations influence the work of the courts, we would need judges to speak candidly and publicly about this question. This they are famously reluctant to do, however, and Ms. Biskupic has not succeeded in piercing their reticence.
Here again, however, the defect itself is instructive. If politics should not and did not influence the courts, then judges would be able to say so publicly and convincingly, even about important and controversial cases. Or, if it were unremarkable and permissible for politics to influence the courts, judges would be able to say this publicly and explain how the process works. That they do neither suggests that something is wrong.
America is now in a position in which its leading jurists really cannot give a candid and credible account of how the courts do their work. That should be troubling to anyone of any political persuasion. Ms. Biskupic's "Chief" offers a timely reminder of this problem, even if it cannot itself point the way to a solution.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump and his top immigration officials on Sunday contested reports that migrant children were being held in horrific conditions in federal detention facilities, as the administration argued that the government was enforcing oversight standards even as it struggled to house and care for an influx of migrants.
Accounts of disease, hunger and overcrowding have multiplied in recent days, but Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, and Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, maintained that the facilities were safe.
Pressed on a report by The New York Times and The El Paso Times in which Border Patrol agents and others who had visited a facility in Clint, Tex., described crying children, cases of chickenpox, scabies and shingles, and inadequate medical care, Mr. McAleenan dismissed the details as "unsubstantiated."
"What I can tell you right now is that there's adequate food, water," he said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "For over a year, there's been showers there."
Still, he and Mr. Cuccinelli acknowledged that the government's resources had been strained by the surge of migrants seeking asylum at the southwestern border.
"It's an extraordinarily challenging situation," Mr. McAleenan said. "I'm not denying that there are challenging situations at the border."
Speaking to reporters, Mr. Trump called the report about the Clint facility a "hoax."
"The Fake News Media, in particular the Failing @nytimes, is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the Border Detention Centers," he wrote on Twitter. "First of all, people should not be entering our Country illegally, only for us to then have to care for them. We should be allowed to focus on United States Citizens first. Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job."
The Times said in a statement that it stood by the article. "We are confident in the accuracy of our reporting on the U.S. Border Patrol's detention centers," the statement said.
With Congress set to return on Monday after a weeklong recess for the Fourth of July holiday, lawmakers are preparing to confront the accounts of squalor in the border facilities and reports of current and former Border Patrol agents deriding migrants and making vulgar remarks about Democratic lawmakers in a private Facebook group.
Mr. McAleenan and Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, have been called to testify this week before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to discuss the concerns.
Mr. Cuccinelli, speaking on "Fox News Sunday," asserted that the detention facilities he had personally visited were safe and being run well. He focused partial blame on lawmakers, who struggled for months to reach an agreement on $ 4.6 billion in humanitarian aid for agencies and officials working at the southwestern border.
"If they keep coming, people in the House come down and complain about them keep coming while not helping fix the problem," Mr. Cuccinelli said, referring to a group of Democratic lawmakers who toured Texas border facilities last week and shared troubling accounts from migrants held there.
"It's the height of hypocrisy," he added.
With the long-delayed aid approved before Congress left for its recess, Mr. McAleenan said the ability of the Department of Health and Human Services to care for migrant children had improved.
Within the Democratic caucus, however, the debate over the allocation of that funding left wounds, with several members objecting to approving the money without more oversight. Congress still needs to pass legislation to fund all of the agencies and departments into the next fiscal year.
"He can say throw more money at a broken system, at an inhumane system," said Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and one of the lawmakers who visited Texas last week, referring to Mr. McAleenan's remarks. Her vote against the aid, she said, "was because we knew this was not the choice that we needed our country to move forward on."

Texto completo: When Megan Shoemaker’s boyfriend proposed to her in February 2017, he knew better than to purchase a classic engagement ring dominated by a glittering white diamond.
Instead, he selected a gray marquise-cut – sometimes called a boat-shaped – diamond set in sterling silver, because he knew that Shoemaker, a Jeweler’s Row designer, would want to customize the rest.
“I’m not a very traditional person,” Shoemaker said, tilting her hand to show off tiny diamonds that flanked the gray centerpiece on her white gold band. She had gotten the extra stones from her mom. “I just never saw myself with the round, brilliant-cut white diamond, even though they’re absolutely gorgeous. It’s just not me.”
In a continuing trend of bucking tradition, a growing number of young couples are opting for “alternative” engagement rings – replacing the standard Tiffany’s fare with colored gems, locally designed bands, or ethically sourced stones. For some, it’s a way to save money. Others want to tailor their rings to their personalities. In all instances, it’s shaking up the jewelry industry.
“It can be exactly how you want it to be”
The rise of Pinterest, Instagram and Etsy has papered the internet with glam shots of rings with black diamonds, knife-edge bands, oval sunstone rings, even coffin-shaped stones, shattering the idea of what a ring can look like. Besides standard white, diamonds come in varying shades of gray, brown, blue, and more – tinged by the presence of elements like nitrogen and boron. Galaxy diamonds, flecked with black and white imperfections, have a salt and pepper appearance.
Forget diamonds altogether and the selection expands: Sapphires and rubies are a good pick for durability. Opals, pearls, and morganite (a pink-colored stone that’s a variety of beryl) have a refined look, but steer away from them if you lead an active lifestyle; they’re softer and more easily scratched.
Like online shoppers, jewelry store customers also have a better idea of what they want, according to Lauren Priori of Philadelphia’s L. Priori Jewelry.
“People are getting married a little bit older, so they have more confidence in their own sense of style,” she said.
“(They) have a broader understanding of what’s possible. It can be exactly how you want it to be.”
When she consults with clients, Priori asks questions to suss out what kind of ring they want: What does their lifestyle look like? Do they see themselves wearing the ring every day? Do they see themselves wearing an engagement ring at all a couple decades from now? (Some past clients have only planned to wear a wedding band down the road and prefer an engagement ring that’s more fun and reflective of their youth.)
Going against the “three month rule”
Talk to someone about buying an engagement ring, and they’ll probably mention the “three month rule” – the idea that the partner proposing has to spend three months of gross salary on the bling. But that rule, which stems from a 1930s marketing maneuver by the De Beers diamond cartel, has grown outdated. According to a New York Times poll this year, most people spend two weeks’ pay on a ring, or between $500 and $3,000.
According to Shoemaker, a one-karat brilliant-cut diamond of good quality will easily run $3,000 to $4,000. Choose an alternative stone and the price comes down: A black or gray diamond of the same size and quality might go for less than $1,000.
The same is true of bands – go with an independent jeweler and you stand to save.
Michelle Lattner of Keta Metals in South Philly works with people who purchase their own stones and come to her for the rest of the ring. At 27, she’s at an age where her peers are talking about getting engaged. Spending several months of salary on a ring seems impractical when more expensive life goals loom on the horizon, she said.
“It’s like, ‘I have to put away $500 (a month) for this engagement ring that I’ll get a year down the road,’ “ Lattner said. “I would rather spend that $500 on a really awesome trip or a down payment on a house.”
Using 3D-printed models and metalworking tools, Lattner can usually craft a silver ring for under $100 and gold for under $200. While commercial jewelry uses CAD (computer aided design) to make precise, tiny settings with perfect prongs, Lattner’s lower-tech approach translates to settings with fewer prongs and a more natural-looking shine to her rings.
“It feels more intimate,” Lattner said. “I think that people these days are recognizing the appeal of natural, imperfect things.”
A former classmate of Lattner’s, Mary Pohlod, noticed her work on social media and commissioned her to make both an engagement ring and the rings for her September 2019 wedding.
For her engagement ring, Pohlod bought a two-karat champagne topaz for around $200. Then she worked with Lattner to finalize the design of all the bands. For three rings, the total came to around $500, including the stone.
“It was kind of a no-brainer for me,” Pohlod said. “Any stones that aren’t diamonds are way less expensive, almost absurdly so. I wanted to put that money toward our life together.”
A different type of diamond
Thanks in part to pop culture and politically active performers, today’s ring shoppers are more conscious of the origins of diamonds and metal. A growing number of couples seek out conflict-free diamonds, ethically mined, with no connection to terror or opposition groups.
There has also been a rise in awareness of the environmental effects of their extraction. Irresponsible mining practices often result in stagnant water in open pits, creating a breeding ground for diseases. Dust blasted out of mines pollutes nearby water sources, and the destruction of habitats leads to decreased biodiversity.
And some couples opt out of the system entirely, buying lab-created diamonds.
That’s what 27-year-old Penn medical student Daniel Xu did when he bought an engagement ring for his now-fiancée.
“I found out that they were a thing a few years ago,” Xu said. “From what I understand, they’re indistinguishable to a jeweler. And I had always felt that the demand for diamonds is the result of market manipulation, so that left a bad taste in my mouth.”
Synthetic diamonds have been around since 1954. Technology has improved over time, making lab-created diamonds identical to their mined counterparts. The preferred process today (chemical vapor deposition) grows carbon atoms from a tiny diamond seed that’s kept under extreme heat and pressure for several days. The resulting stone generally costs 30% less, Priori said.
For Xu, the real struggle was finding a reputable website that sold lab-created diamonds in the right quality and size. He purchased a round-cut diamond set in 14-karat white gold from Clean Origin for about half of what he would have paid in a store, he estimates.
“I don’t think I had the same sort of reticence some people have about buying lab-grown diamonds,” Xu said. “The fact that they’re more ethical and cheaper made the decision even easier.”

Dine Out Maine: A good bistro-steakhouse is in there waiting to get out at Odd Duck FSE The new Brunswick restaurant serves some perfectly decent food. It just needs to chill.

Texto completo: "Here you go. This is really yummy," our server says to my guest as she hands over his crimson Port Royal Punch cocktail ($12). Then, with a smile, "I'll come back in a couple of minutes so you can tell me that I'm right."
When she does, my guest fibs to her politely. The drink contains little rum and is too sweet, very likely from the triple whammy of pineapple juice, orange juice and house-made grenadine. "You know, if she hadn't insisted on how delicious it was, it probably wouldn't have been as much of a disappointment," he says to me quietly after she leaves.
But "telling, not showing" seems to be the m.o. at Odd Duck FSE, a bistro-steakhouse that opened this January in Brunswick. It belies an insecurity that isn't totally warranted - there's a good restaurant here if you can look past the spin doctoring.
Over-explanation commences with the name of the restaurant. First, there's "FSE," appended to it like an obscure academic credential. I couldn't work out what the letters meant until I spoke on the phone with three Odd Duck staffers. "It stands for food, spirits and entertainment," general manager Richard Ferraro told me. The first two make obvious sense, but the third? Could it be the glossy black piano that sat unused during my recent Saturday visit?
Perhaps at this stage, that last designation is mostly aspirational. The closest to entertainment I could find was a contemporary jazz playlist blaring into the already clamorous dining room. "There are definitely things we aren't doing that we want to do in the future, probably in the ballroom event space upstairs: a murder mystery, a burlesque show, Brunswick's Got Talent," executive chef Ashley DeSilva said.
Then there's the notion of oddness. You don't even have to speak to anyone in the restaurant before you spot "embrace your subtle weirdness" (an excerpt from the Odd Duck's mission statement) stenciled over the entrance to the kitchen.
Just as with the abstract "E" for "entertainment," peculiarity isn't yet much in evidence at Odd Duck.
Take the dÃ©cor. When Ferraro told me that the building recently housed a biofuels business and a bookstore, I thought I understood - the owners hadn't had time to fix up the space, so they just made do with what they had. Perfectly reasonable.
But then I learned about the restoration of the unstable third-floor ballroom, a soup-to-nuts buildout of the kitchen and a full-scale renovation of the split-level, 80-seat dining room. As recently as last year, the building was a blank canvas of studs and drywall. And somehow, it still wound up dull, with glue-on black rubber base molding, drab walls and gray carpet tiles that make the space look like a rented corporate building in a suburban office park. The whole enterprise feels ad hoc, like one of the battling businesses in the "Restaurant Wars" episode of every season of "Top Chef."
Attempts to introduce a little oddness into the menu also fizzle, like the slice of singed, unripe peach inserted like a blackened poker chip into the smoked peach margarita ($13) or adding extremely savory Bayley Hazen bleu cheese to a potato gratin ($7) already chockablock with other salty cheeses.
So too, the steamed Chinese bao dough used in the pork belly steamed buns ($9). More like a sticky, jaundiced dumpling than a fluffy white wrapper for tart "banh mi" slaw, slow-roasted pork belly and a spicy-sweet, Korean-style glaze, the bao lets down what is otherwise a lovely, fiery appetizer.
Or sweet rhubarb cake served as one of the many components on chef de cuisine Elizabeth DiFranco's excellent pre-appetizer bread plate. The cake itself is a wonderfully dense, fruity treat and deserves a spot on the menu ... the dessert menu.
I wish I understood Odd Duck's gimmicky and unnecessary quirk-propaganda. The restaurant is (as servers and staff will tell you, when pressed) just a steakhouse and bistro. That ought to be enough because, by those standards, it's actually a pretty good one.
The best evidence of this is the 6-ounce filet mignon ($36). Sourced from nearby Archer Angus and charcoal-grilled simply with salt, pepper and a basting of butter, this steak is among the best-prepared pieces of beef I have eaten so far this year.
And while I think the Marjolaine cake ($11) probably dried out a bit after being kept too long in the walk-in, it is a prime example of DiFranco's baking talents. A riff on a layered Fernand Point classic from the 1960s, DiFranco's version juxtaposes fudgy chocolate "blackout" cake, milk chocolate buttercream, custardy caramel cheesecake and pulverized hazelnut praline with a jiggly dollop of excellent chocolate mousse.
I'm also a big fan of the potato bun she bakes to frame the Odd Duck Burger ($19). Inside, DeSilva's hybrid patty is made from a fine grind of equal parts duck and pork belly. When grilled, it has a tight, pleasing, almost ptÃ©-like consistency. The sandwich tilts dangerously toward the greasy, especially when you add a few slices of house-cured bacon and a slathering of amarena cherry aioli, but the extra fat balances out the lean duck splendidly.
There's also a bit more richness than normal in the dressing for the Odd Caesar ($9/$13), although here it comes from whisking colossal duck-egg yolks with Worcestershire, olive oil and lemon juice. With anchovy and pecorino to finish the salad, it's a mild - but successful - departure from tradition. But nothing you'd really notice unless you were paying close attention. It certainly isn't, as our server described it, "weird."
You get the sense that the staff and owners of Odd Duck are aiming for a Steve-Martin-level of "wild and crazy guy" wackiness. But what they achieve is more Steve from Accounting who listens to REO Speedwagon and keeps a worn copy of "Born to Pun" at his desk.
But really, as long as you can get the fundamentals right, there ought to be no shame in embracing your subtle tameness.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES – A major supplier of body cameras to law-enforcement agencies across the country has decided to forgo selling facial-recognition technology with its products.
Axon, which supplies 48 police departments in major cities with body cameras, made the decision after the company's ethics board concluded the technology was not accurate enough to be implemented in the field and could potentially cause major trust issues between law-enforcement officials and their communities.
In a 42-page report, the ethics board detailed concerns with the inaccuracy of the software, saying results showed it was less accurate when identifying women, younger people, and "worsens when trying to identify people of color compared to white people, a troubling disparity that would only perpetuate or exacerbate the racial inequities that cut across the criminal justice system."
The board is composed of experts from different professions, including law enforcement, robotics and policy, and advises Axon on the potential effects its technology could have on society.
"Some police departments are sophisticated and would understand the limitations on (facial recognition) and would put their own guardrails in place around the use of that technology by their officers.
"But there are some police departments that would not take those same precautions and may not appreciate the implications of using a technology that's not ready yet for prime time," said board member Jim Bueermann, who was a police officer for more than 30 years and is now president of the National Police Foundation.
Axon CEO Rick Smith said the company is "moving cautiously" because of these implications.
"There are companies out there actively promoting using facial recognition on body cameras," Smith said. "From our perspective, we believe taking the time to do the ethical analysis up front in the product design process will have much better outcomes in the long haul."
Smith says the company might reconsider incorporating the technology in their products in the future once the inaccuracies are solved, but must balance that with privacy and safety and put in "safeguards" to avoid misuse of facial recognition.
"We don't believe that the right answer is that the police should deploy face recognition with no controls and go wild with it, but similarly we don't believe that it makes sense to say police should never use face-recognition technology because there's many cases where it's pretty universally known that it will be a good thing," Smith said.
Facial recognition has been a hot-button topic around the country as concerns about privacy and accuracy have made some cities skeptical of the technology, leading San Francisco to ban it altogether, with cities such as Oakland and Berkeley considering following suit. California may enact a statewide ban if Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the Body Camera Accountability Act this summer. The Somerville City Council in Massachusetts banned facial recognition just last week.
While these cities are turning their backs to this technology, others are welcoming it. The Orlando Police Department is testing Amazon's 'Rekognition' software, although not in public or for investigative use.
According to The New York Times, Detroit signed a $1 million deal to set up facial recognition in the city's surveillance cameras with broad rules on how law enforcement can use the footage.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, compares facial-recognition software to when law enforcement started using DNA testing as an investigative tool.
"There was a lot of concern then as well about 'the government is going to have my DNA, they're going to know all about me, how is this going to be used?' and I think today those fears have generally gone by the wayside," Johnson said.
Johnson says facial recognition can be used in the same way DNA testing is — to confirm identities, solve crimes and exonerate the innocent.
"I don't think it's providing the government any more identification (information) than they already have," said Johnson. "I think if people are concerned about surveillance, they've kind of missed the boat."
Facial recognition is being used by more than law enforcement.
The New York school district will be the first in the country to deploy the software for added security, including to identify potential school shooters and sex offenders.
"AI is so powerful, it is going to be either the greatest or the worst thing we as a human species has ever developed, and using such a powerful tool, I think the developers of that should have a mechanism of objective, interested people they can rely on to say, 'Just because we can do this, should we?'" Bueermann said.
Privacy fears have made some cities skeptical of facial recognition.

Texto completo: Al menos 20 trabajadores inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump a principios de este año están solicitando una reunión en la Casa Blanca.
A través de una carta firmada por 21 de las mucamas, jardineros, personal de cocina y otros exempleados de cinco de los clubes se pide al presidente que “haga lo correcto” y les dé la oportunidad, para explicar las razones por las cuales no deberían ser deportados.
“Somos personas modestas que representan los sueños de los 11 millones de hombres, mujeres y niños indocumentados que viven y trabajan en este país”, dice la carta. “Sabe que somos trabajadores y que no somos delincuentes ni buscamos un viaje gratis a Estados Unidos. Todos pagamos nuestros impuestos, amamos a nuestra fe y a nuestra familia, y simplemente queremos encontrar un lugar para que nosotros podamos mejorar a Estados Unidos”.
Según Associated Press, la misiva ya tuvo respuesta de la Casa Blanca, resumida en que fue recibida la notificación y que se estaba “revisando” la solicitud.
Los exempleados enfatizaron sus años de servicio a la familia Trump, señalando que su labor permitió a los clubes que “sean un éxito y para mantener felices a sus miembros y visitantes”.
La Organización Trump ha despedido a cerca de 20 trabajadores indocumentados de sus clubes de golf en los últimos meses, como resultado de una auditoría realizada, después de que The New York Times informara en diciembre sobre indocumentadas que trabajaban como empleadas domésticas en la propiedad Bedminster, en New Jersey.

Kamala Harris reimagines herself as a ‘progressive prosecutor’

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – For most presidential candidates, the path to the White House is a decades-long process of rising through the political ranks, building alliances and raising money. A few candidates might wake up and say, “Heck, I’m going to run for the presidency,” but most serious contenders are driven by lifelong ambition. Our president is an exception, but that only reminds us of the rule.
Kamala Harris clearly has had lofty ambitions for years as she moved from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general to our state’s junior U.S. senator. She no longer can be dismissed as a longshot after her successful Democratic debate showing and rising numbers in the polls. As Joe Biden looks like yesterday’s news, Harris now is among those candidates with a genuine shot for the nomination.
This should be a troubling prospect not only for conservatives, but for the progressive wing of Harris’ party. It should also disturb those whose main goal is to replace the current White House occupant. Donald Trump might have an otherworldly sense of reality (it is whatever he says it is), but Harris is pitching a carefully constructed narrative that seems to be at odds with the record.
Forget about all her predictable liberal positions. Every Democratic candidate is going to promise a bevy of lefty policies, ranging from “free” health care to loosened immigration restrictions. To gauge the character of each candidate, voters must look at how each one behaved in prior office. They should look askance at last-minute conversions.
Biden, for instance, supported a war in Iraq that was popular at the time, but now is viewed as a disaster. He authored a crime bill that ramped up sentences. Both measures were products of the time, but they show Biden to be a go-along, get-along guy. Likewise, Harris spent her career as a prosecutor, and there’s no indication she was anything but an enthusiastic backer of the law-and-order status quo.
That’s a crucial issue, because criminal-justice reform now is a core concern of the Democratic base. It’s not only Democrats. President Trump last year signed a justice-reform bill. Many Republicans agree the nation’s tough-on-crime policies, created when fear of crime was a top concern, have gone too far. The pendulum has swung back dramatically in the last couple of years.
Harris now depicts herself as a “progressive prosecutor,” who has made decisions based mainly on her sense of justice. But as professor Lara Bazelon opined in the New York Times earlier this year, “Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reform…, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent.” She “fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors.”
I still recall that video of Harris laughing as she recounts telling her coworkers to “look really mean” when they threatened to send a poor mother to jail because of her kids’ truancy. Harris now strikes the right progressive stances, but during her career she acted like a tried-and-true drug warrior. There’s no evidence that she in any way resisted the zeitgeist.
“By 2005, Harris was also turning against the city’s decade-old Drug Court, which allowed some people arrested on nonviolent possession and small-time sales charges to go to a city-run addiction treatment program…,” wrote Reason’s Elizabeth Nolan Brown. Harris now says she would decriminalize prostitution, but Brown notes, “As a prosecutor she ramped up stings in immigrant communities… spread misinformation about human trafficking, ignored sexual misconduct by police, and aggressively targeted websites where sex workers advertised.”
Harris defended the death penalty in court (although she personally opposes it), resisted releasing a man the Innocence Project found not to have been guilty, backed expanded asset forfeiture (whereby police confiscate property even if its owner wasn’t convicted of any crime), and seemingly served as the cat’s paw for police unions. Perhaps some conservatives will be cheered by this record, but that’s not the point. It’s that her past actions bear no resemblance to her new persona.
My theory is she served as a prosecutor in an era when law-and-order policies were popular. She wasn’t going to cross some of the most powerful lobbies in the state. This approach would inoculate her from the main “soft on crime” jab that conservatives hurl against liberals, but then a funny thing happened on the way to the presidency. The criminal-justice paradigm shifted quickly and unexpectedly, so now she’s left reimagining most of her political career.
Harris’ current claims about her career speak volumes about her nature. She’s received criticism from progressives who are serious about justice reform, but it’s not keeping her from the prize. That’s the most depressing lesson. A candidate can totally rewrite her record even though that record is easy to examine – and pay no apparent price for it in the polls.

Texto completo: Let Hartford’s police chief do his job unimpeded
In reference to the pending Fair and Impartial Policing policy amendment under discussion in Hartford, we encourage the town manager, the Selectboard and the people supporting this amendment not to micromanage our police chief.
For four years, Phil Kasten has done the job he was hired to do. He has led his department with integrity and honesty, taking personal responsibility and bringing a change of mindset. It wasn’t an easy job to start with, and staff changes must have added to the challenge.
We have worked closely with Kasten on several projects and have known him to always be looking out for this community. He is smart, thorough and caring and has proven over and over again that Hartford could not have picked a better man for the job. Let him do it — unimpeded.
Staffing remains an issue and the way this amendment has been discussed isn’t likely to help. Concerns should not be hastily moved to a Selectboard vote, no matter the sensitivity of the matter. The real fears of some community members should only ensure that people are given the time needed to prepare a knowledgeable response.
Kasten understands that a large part of his job is to alleviate fears in his community. We trust this man — he has never done anything for us to feel otherwise. He knows the law. We would rather trust him than police him. Isn’t that how we all would rather live — trusted to do our jobs and, in turn, trust our neighbors to do theirs? The police department lives with the dangers of policing every day. Do you? Are you even aware of just what they do on a daily basis — the counseling and community support they give? We say, show him and his staff the respect they have earned. Hold them accountable, but let them do their job.
Let the town manager and Selectboard know how you feel. Show up for the next meeting if you can.

Proposed waste facility won’t make Claremont better
Claremont has made great strides in revitalizing and we have a bright future. We have new businesses, new attitudes, a wonderful senior center, thriving churches, a downtown development project, a forward-looking mayor and City Council and a general feeling of hopefulness.
But recently, a new hazard appeared on our horizon. RSI/Acuity Inc. has approached the Claremont Planning Board with a proposal to build a waste facility on Industrial Boulevard. The facility is a proposed open slab operation that would import unwanted waste from areas outside of Claremont, 500 tons per day on 50 trucks. Construction and demolition debris would be rough sorted in the open, creating hazardous dust and water runoff. The site is within 1,000 yards of an elementary school and there are more than 200 homes within a half-mile.
This facility would irrevocably change the neighborhood around Claremont Junction and would impact the whole city. The junction is where our train depot is located, a valuable asset for Claremont’s future and a gateway to the city.
In the master plan, the citizens of Claremont said they want to improve the standard of living in Claremont, improve the quality of life and discourage land use with negative environmental quality impacts. The Planning Board must consider the master plan and fight for the citizens of Claremont in protecting their health, property values and environment.
If this concerns you at all, please call the Claremont Planning and Development Office, at 603-542-7030 and register your concerns. Contact all of your city representatives at www.claremontnh.com. To get involved, you can send your contact information to abetterclaremont@gmail.com and someone will get back to you.
Please come to the next public hearing on this issue on July 22 in the Claremont City Hall Council Chambers at 6:20 p.m.

‘Back path’ is closed again
I guess I spoke too soon about the opening of our back path from Hillcrest Terrace down to the old Miller Auto site in White River Junction (“Our ‘back path’ is open again,” June 25). Since I last wrote, the heavy rains came and, as always, water made its own way down the hills and made a mess of man’s work.
Folks who don’t live in this area have no conception of what happens on this hill. Folks who live on hills in other areas know exactly what goes on.

Should impeachment begin over rape allegation? My question to Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Rep. Annie Kuster is, should impeachment hearings be initiated against President Donald Trump over an accusation of rape?
As Chris Matthews of MSNBC pointed out, Trump took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the death penalty for five black and Latino teenagers in connection with a rape committed in Central Park in 1989. (In 2002, DNA evidence and a confession by a convicted rapist exonerated the five, their convictions were erased and they received a $41 million settlement.)
Now, the president has been accused of raping a woman in the mid-1990s in a dressing room of a Manhattan department store within sight of Central Park.
Forget for a moment obstruction of justice allegations. Should anyone in America want a man in the White House who has been credibly accused of rape? (Oh, I forgot. You can get a permanent seat on the Supreme Court while being credibly accused of the same. My mistake.)
Guess we should just let this pass.

Perhaps then we’ll get what we need
During President Donald Trump’s recent re-election bid rally, one of the songs playing in the background was the Rolling Stones’ You Can’t Always Get What You Want.
So the question is: Will Americans settle for Donald Trump again in 2020 in lieu of a better choice, or will they be presented with one?

A HUMAN BEING, OF A SORT
Play by Jonathan Payne. Directed by Whitney White. Presented by Williamstown Theatre Festival. At Nikos Stage, Williamstown, through July 7. Tickets: 413-458-3253, www.wtfestival.org
WILLIAMSTOWN — At the start of Jonathan Payne's “A Human Being, Of a Sort," a half-naked black man stands in a cage, gripping its bars and gazing out at the audience. At the base of the cage are the words “Primate House."
It's hard to think of a more jolting or troubling image than that. While the dramatic tension of that silent tableau is not always maintained during the rest of the production, now at the Williamstown Theatre Festival under the direction of Whitney White, this is a play that gets under the skin.
The year is 1906, the place is the Bronx Zoo, and the diminutive man in the cage is an African from what was then called the Congo Free State, named Ota Benga. Payne's play was inspired by a real-life story: This obscene spectacle — the display of a human being as part of an exhibition on “the African Pygmy," for audiences to gawk at — actually occurred. Benga, a member of the Mbuti people, is superbly played by Antonio Michael Woodard, who got his MFA at Brown University and appeared in last year's Trinity Repertory Company production of “Ragtime." Woodard's portrayal of Benga is a skillful blend of sharply inscribed details that convey Benga's intelligence, defiance, wit, and desperation.
Guarding the cage, and increasingly troubled by his duties, is another black man: Fred Engelholm, nicknamed Smokey, who is played by the one and only André Braugher (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine," “Homicide: Life on the Streets," “Men of a Certain Age"). The bewhiskered Braugher delivers a penetrating characterization of Smokey that opens a window onto the guard's inner turmoil as he grapples with the dilemma of working within a system that has treated him unjustly.
Smokey has served three years on a prison farm for stealing two apples from a roadside vendor in Tennessee — a Jean Valjean-like sentence all out of proportion to the crime. If the guard assignment at the zoo goes well, Smokey will be granted his freedom; if not, it's back to the prison farm for him. That proposition becomes complicated, and creates tensions in the relationship between Benga and Smokey, when Benga asks the guard for the freedom to walk around the park.
Woodard and Braugher do a skillful, subtle job delineating the step-by-step construction of that relationship between two men who come to realize how much they have in common — and the multiple forms captivity can take in a society built on racial injustice. (Their shared plight invites us to ponder the high levels of black male incarceration that are of urgent concern today.) After witnessing Smokey's interactions with the white director of the zoo, William Temple Hornaday (Frank Wood), Benga tells the guard: “You become like me: Invisible." And, later: “They laugh at you like they laugh at me."
Alas, “A Human Being" goes slack whenever the focus shifts away from Smokey and Benga. As the insufferably smug and odious Hornaday, who asserts that Benga “is not our prisoner" but rather a “guest," the normally reliable Wood delivers a curiously passive performance, so his exchanges with Braugher's Smokey do not crackle with the necessary voltage.
Also lacking in electricity, mainly due to stilted dialogue, are the scenes involving three black clergymen (played by Sullivan Jones, Keith Randolph Smith, and Jeorge Bennett Watson) who confront Hornaday, intent on halting the exhibit, rescuing Benga from the zoo, and giving him a home and an education. The mayor of New York at that time refused to meet with the ministers, according to The New York Times, for which Hornaday lauded him, writing to him: “When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."
The contrast could not be clearer between a moral imbecile like Hornaday and the two men (Benga and Smokey) he subjects to humiliating treatment. Playwright Payne has crafted a finale that takes us back to the moment when Ota Benga's freedom was snatched from him. In real life, the end of his story came in 1916, a decade after the events depicted in “A Human Being, Of a Sort." That was when Benga, longing to return home to Africa but stymied from doing so, shot himself to death.
A HUMAN BEING, OF A SORT

Texto completo: Callous politicians who have refused to expand Medicaid are the primary threat to access to quality health care in rural states.
I’ve been making that case about Wyoming since 2013, when the state Legislature first rejected expansion under the Affordable Care Act and left nearly 18,000 low-income residents without access to health insurance.
Paul Krugman, New York Times columnist and winner of the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences in 2008, has now drawn the same conclusion on a national level.
“Much of the collapse of rural health care could have been avoided, and could be easily reversed, if so many state governments hadn’t chosen to impose misery on their own rural constituents,” Krugman wrote in a June 24 column.
Wyoming is one of only 14 states – all controlled by Republicans – that have not expanded Medicaid.
Krugman compared the health-care situations in Kentucky and Tennessee to make his point. Kentucky expanded Medicaid and did everything it could to make the ACA work for its residents.
The result was a two-thirds drop in the uninsured rate in Kentucky. But in Tennessee, which bypassed Medicaid expansion, adults are now twice as likely to be uninsured as their neighbor.
The results in Wyoming are even more indicative of the high cost the state has paid by failing to insure low-income, childless adults under Medicaid. For adults age 18-64, Wyoming’s uninsured rate ranks 42nd in the country, according to the Commonwealth Fund Scorecard on State Health System Performance issued last month.
Another statistic that jumps out in the scorecard directly relates to the Medicaid expansion issue: Wyoming ranks 48th for its age 18 and older population without a usual source of care.
People who work two or three part-time jobs in Wyoming almost never receive employer-paid health insurance benefits. The vast majority don’t regularly see a doctor, so they don’t have access to preventative health care. When they do get sick, their only option is treatment at hospital emergency rooms, where they can’t afford to pay.
That drives up the cost of hospitals’ uncompensated care, which the Wyoming Hospital Association estimates at more than $100 million per year. Hospitals make up that growing expense by increasing their rates for patients who have insurance and can afford to pay.
What do insurance companies do in response to the higher costs? Jack up their health premiums, of course.
Voters who think they’re not affected by the Legislature’s decision to not expand Medicaid – which the Department of Health now estimates could bring health insurance to 23,000 low-income residents – are impacted by higher insurance rates.
So how have conservative legislators responded to the demonstrably abject failure of their six-year-old policy? They’ve responded by doing nothing positive. And why wouldn’t they: They keep getting re-elected, despite hurting sick people, hamstringing our hospitals and other health-care providers and costing the state about $120 million annually in federal Medicaid funds.
Over six years, that’s nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.
No, they continue to portray the population that would be eligible for the federal program under the ACA expansion as shiftless, lazy bums who want to take advantage of hard-working taxpayers. The reality is that more than two-thirds work at low-paying jobs, and the vast majority of those remaining can’t work because of medical conditions.
Krugman noted rural America is facing a health-care crisis in large part because “gratuitous political cruelty has denied health insurance to millions who could have had it with a stroke of a pen.”
“Some of it may reflect the general meanspiritedness, the embrace of cruelty, that was already infecting the GOP even before Donald Trump, and has now become one of the party’s defining traits,” Krugman wrote. “Yes, that’s harsh, but you know it’s true.”
I’ve spent a lot of time wondering why Wyoming voters have been caught in the trap of supporting politicians who continually vote against their best interests on many issues, especially health care.
“Rural voters often complain that national elites don’t care about their needs,” Krugman believes. “Well, one way to make people feel hostile toward those elites is to block their access to federal benefits and hope they don’t realize who’s actually causing their misery.”
Politicians like state Sen. Charles Scott, R-Casper, who railed against Medicaid expansion and predicted that the federal government would renege on its promise to pay for most of Medicaid expansion, have been proven wrong.
I don’t expect Wyoming to ever expand Medicaid, but voters should know this: You’ve been lied to for years about this vital health-care issue. Some of you have seen your own health deteriorate, and according to the Wyoming Department of Health, 111 of your fellow residents have died prematurely each year without Medicaid expansion.
Hospitals that could have used federal Medicaid expansion funds to improve and expand services have instead been forced to scramble for ways to keep their doors open in the face of the skyrocketing costs of uncompensated care.
And if you don’t believe me, ask the economist with the Nobel Prize on his mantle. That guy knows what he’s talking about.

Many in Serbia unhappy with Djokovic-Ivanisevic partnership

Texto completo: BELGRADE, Serbia – Novak Djokovic is again under scrutiny in his native Serbia – this time because of inviting Goran Ivanisevic to join his coaching team at Wimbledon.
Serbia’s state-controlled tabloids called it a “scandalous” partnership between the top-ranked Serb and the former Wimbledon champion from Croatia.
Croatia fought a bloody war for independence from Serb-led Yugoslavia in the 1990s and nationalist sentiments still run high in both countries.
“Goran comes from Croatia, I’m from Serbia. We both come from the country that was once called Yugoslavia,” Djokovic said, explaining his decision to recruit Ivanisevic. “When I was small and started watching tennis, I watched his match against (Pete) Sampras. Everyone in the region supported him (Ivanisevic).”
Djokovic, whose mother was born in Croatia, had faced similar public criticism when he said he would support Croatia after Serbia exited last year’s soccer World Cup at the group stage. Croatia went on to the final where it lost against France.
Pro-government Belgrade tabloid Informer quoted former NBA center Darko Milicic as saying that Djokovic’s move to hire Ivanisevic is “an insult to his fans.”
Milicic said that whenever Djokovic “displays outbursts of love for Croats” he should think of his Serbian fans “who have gone through harassment, expulsions and loss of their loved ones during the war.”
The tabloids printed an interview Ivanisevic had with the New York Times during the war in which he was quoted as saying he wished “to have some Serbs standing in front of me” while he had shooting practice with a gun.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, a former ultranationalist, took a softer line: “It is good for our country that Novak Djokovic has good relations with Ivanisevic so that the past clashes are overcome.”
Ivanisevic, who won the men’s singles title in 2001, has told Serbian media he received “a rather unexpected call” from Djokovic ahead of the grass court tournament.

Texto completo: Coco Gauff was probably destined to be the biggest story in sports at some point in her life, but nobody could have anticipated that it would happen on a Friday in July of her 15th year on Earth.
What started as a Wimbledon curiosity and a cool, niche story has now become a real thing — a real, big thing — as Gauff advanced to the Round of 16 with a rousing comeback to beat Polona Hercog, 3-6, 7-6, 7-5.
No matter what happens from here, life will never be the same for Gauff — not just because she’s into the second week of a Grand Slam at age 15, but because of how she's done it: with incredible athletic ability and mental toughness and a maturity that has captivated an American audience often indifferent to tennis.
Which is all the more reason why everyone around Gauff and the Women’s Tennis Association must resist the urge to speed up this process.
Under the current WTA age restrictions, Gauff can only play 10 professional tournaments (with some merit-based flexibility) between her 15th and 16th birthday next March, with the limits increasing each year until she turns 18. Gauff’s father, Corey, has been pushing for the rule to be relaxed and made some solid points earlier this week in an interview with The New York Times.
But tennis is a sport that has too often chewed up its prodigies before they’re fully-formed adults, leaving a trail of burnout, chronic injury and family dysfunction. And as Gauff ascends into a stratosphere of fame that seemed unlikely this early, it’s all the more reason for tennis to be extra careful about not screwing this one up.
From all indications, the Gauff family seems to get it. Corey, a former college basketball player at Georgia State, has been careful about his daughter’s path up to this point. He says he’s spent years studying the flame-outs, the success stories and everyone in-between to chart a course for Coco that will allow her a long pro career and the best chance at maintaining balance. In the player box, Corey and his wife, Candi, have given the appearance of being supportive and extraordinarily normal, which isn’t always the case with tennis parents.
But it’s inevitable now that things are going to change for the Gauffs. Though people within the niche tennis world have known about Coco Gauff for awhile — Roger Federer’s management company, Team 8, signed her in late 2017, and New Balance became her apparel sponsor last October -- everything is different when you break out as a mainstream star. It’s possible that she made millions of dollars in sponsorships based solely on what she did Friday afternoon on a holiday weekend with millions of Americans being drawn in.
And clearly, she has enough tools to play like a legit pro, having beaten Venus Williams, the 139th-ranked Magdalena Rybarikova and the 60th-ranked Hercog to get into the fourth round.
But it’s also worth remembering that Gauff -- whose ranking will rocket from No. 313 to at least No. 139 even if she loses to Simona Halep on Monday -- hasn’t had much success at the highest level of pro tennis prior to Wimbledon. Gauff has made a couple of deep runs at developmental-level ITF events, but in the big WTA tournaments this spring at Indian Wells and Miami, she won just one match -- against 221st-ranked Catherine McNally.
In other words, until this week, her results have been typical of what you’d expect from even a great 15-year-old.
Corey Gauff argued in The Times that the age restriction, while well-intentioned, has in fact put too much pressure on his daughter to play well in those tournaments because she knows there are limited chances. He suggested the WTA should look at changing the rule from limiting the number of tournaments to total matches, which might have some merit.
WOW: Coco Gauff, 15-year-old American, storms back for another Wimbledon upset
MEET COCO: Who is the 15-year-old who beat Venus Williams at Wimbledon?
“I think anytime a rule is 20-something years old, it needs to be looked at,” he said.
Even Federer told reporters he's lobbied the WTA to relax the restrictions, noting how good it was for the sport when Martina Hingis won the Australian Open at 16 years, 3 months, starting a four-year run as the best player in the sport.
But it’s also true that Hingis had to retire by age 22 due to injuries, although she did come back later as a successful doubles player. And it’s also true that Jennifer Capriati struggled to handle everything that came with being a prominent 14-year-old pro and spiraled into burnout and drug addiction before later reinventing herself as a champion. And it’s undeniable that some of the young women with tremendous promise on tour have struggled to stay healthy over the last few years, which may or may not be attributed to the increased physicality of the pro game that has skewed the prime window for most players into their mid-to-late 20s.
So regardless of the specifics of Gauff’s situation, the rules generally make sense. While it's great for Gauff and for tennis that she’ll have a chance to play a handful of tournaments on the heels of this Wimbledon run, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to put a 15-year-old on tour full time to play against adults week in and week out while she’s still developing physically and emotionally.
Sometime when this run ends, the Gauff family and the women’s tour will undoubtedly be tempted to strike while the iron’s hot. Every tournament will want her in the draw, and sponsors will want her on TV, wearing their logo at every opportunity. The WTA will be under extreme pressure to let her play more events.
But if Gauff is really destined to have a special career, it’s wise to take a deep breath and let it happen slowly. The history of tennis tells us that with a talent like Gauff, trying to speed things up is the riskiest path of all.

Texto completo: Chris Cline, billionaire coal mining entrepreneur from West Virginia, died in a helicopter crash that killed everyone aboard in the Bahamas on Thursday. He was 60.
Six other people also died in the helicopter that crashed off Grand Cay island on its way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Bahamian police said.
A statement from the Royal Bahamas Police Force said the helicopter went missing shortly after leaving Big Grand Cay and authorities and local residents later found the crash site two miles off Grand Cay.
According to a Facebook post by West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Evan Jenkins, Cline’s daughter also may have been one of the seven passengers who died in the crash.
“His selfless and generous support for programs and projects throughout the state improved the lives of countless West Virginians,” Jenkins wrote on Facebook. “His life’s story was one of hard work, love of family and caring support for others. ”
Heartbreaking: Newlyweds killed in helicopter crash while leaving their wedding in Texas
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice and Jerome A. Gilbert, president of Cline’s alma mater Marshall University, also expressed their sympathies on social media.
“Today we lost a WV superstar and I lost a very close friend,” Justice tweeted Thursday. “Chris Cline built an empire and on every occasion was always there to give. What a wonderful, loving, and giving man. ”
“Our hearts are heavy with the terrible news this evening of the passing of prominent Son of Marshall Chris Cline,” Gilbert wrote on Twitter. “Chris’s generosity to our research and athletics programs has made a mark on Marshall University. I am praying for his family. ”

Bahamian police did not provide a cause of the crash but said an investigation with civil aviation authorities was underway.
Cline began working in the coal mining industry in West Virginia in 1980 at the age of 22, according to The New York Times. He founded the Cline Group in 1990, an energy development group, and Foresight Energy in 2006, the Times reported.
In addition to creating a coal mining empire, he was also a well-known philanthropist and donor to the Republican party.
He donated $1 million to President Donald Trump’s inauguration event, according to the Open Secrets site run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations. He also donated $1 million to a super PAC supporting the presidential campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in 2015, according to Bloomberg News.

Texto completo: Providing comprehensive health coverage to undocumented immigrants has long been nothing more than a wouldn't-it-be-nice item on the far left's wish list. But in the crowded field of candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, nearly everyone supports it.
Almost all of the 19 candidates who responded to a recent New York Times survey on health care positions said "yes" to a question about whether undocumented immigrants should be covered under a "Medicare for all" system, a public option or other government health programs. And during the second night of the Democratic debates last week, the idea received a unanimous show of hands in support.
President Trump was gleeful, predicting that the response would prove politically toxic for his opponents.
"All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare," he wrote on Twitter. "How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That's the end of that race!"
Politics aside, here's what health care for unauthorized immigrants looks like now, and what providing comprehensive coverage to them might involve.

Can undocumented immigrants get health care now?
People in the country illegally are generally barred from enrolling in Medicaid or Medicare. They are also prohibited from buying insurance through the marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Undocumented children do not qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program, commonly known as CHIP.
But six states and the District of Columbia have expanded their Medicaid programs to cover children through 18 years old (California recently approved coverage through age 25), regardless of immigration status. About 16 states cover income-eligible pregnant women, also regardless of residency status.
Many illegal immigrants receive primary care and prescription drugs for a sliding-scale fee at 1,400 federally funded health care centers spread across 11,000 communities. Those centers are required to treat anyone, regardless of ability to pay, and administrators do not ask patients about their citizenship status.
The centers serve some 27 million people, but do not have estimates on how many are undocumented.
Of course, when undocumented immigrants arrive at hospitals for medical emergencies, they will be treated.
Some undocumented residents receive coverage through their own or a spouse's employer-provided plan, though they are less likely than legal residents or citizens to have jobs with employer coverage.
Do other countries provide health care to undocumented immigrants?
If the United States were to begin providing comprehensive health coverage to undocumented immigrants, it would be an outlier, health policy experts say. Even countries with universal, government-run coverage like Norway place tough restrictions on health care for undocumented immigrants. Most immigrants can get emergency care but have to pay other costs. Thailand, with waves of migrant workers, is considered to offer one of the most generous programs, screening immigrants for diseases and allowing them to buy into the national health insurance.
How many undocumented immigrants need health coverage in the United States?
According to the Pew Research Center, in 2017 there were about 10.5 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. According to estimates, 5.5 to 6 million still need coverage.
How much would it cost to provide them health care?
Neither the Congressional Budget Office nor independent experts have worked up a cost estimate. Some economists say that the expense of providing primary care would eventually pay off, because it would keep people from waiting until they were very sick to seek treatment.
Some studies have found that undocumented immigrants tend to be younger and healthier (therefore potentially cheaper) than the overall American population, particularly because they were able to survive arduous travel for weeks to come to the United States.
Other research suggests that they are disproportionately poor, with high rates of diabetes, obesity and hypertension.
On the debate stage last week, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said that unauthorized immigrants contributed to society by paying property and sales taxes. Although many undocumented workers are paid off the books, others do have taxes withheld by employers and therefore help fund health care programs for which they are ineligible.
Do undocumented immigrants use the health care available to them?
They tend to underuse health care, especially since the Trump administration has cracked down through raids and deportations. Fear has been keeping them away.
"The majority of their children are United States-born citizens who may qualify for Medicaid and CHIP coverage," said Samantha Artiga, who directs the disparities policy project for the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. "But parents are often fearful of enrolling their children, even though they are eligible, because they don't want to put the rest of the family in jeopardy."
Has the Trump administration actively tried to prevent immigrants from getting health care?
The federal government can deny legal residency status (commonly known as a green card) to anyone considered likely to become a "public charge"-- meaning a drain on public resources.
Under longstanding policy, Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people, was not considered a public benefit for these purposes. But last year, the Trump administration proposed a rule, now in its final stages, saying that Medicaid use would be a "heavily negative factor" counting against someone trying to obtain a green card.
Would more migrants come here if they could get free health care without documentation?
No one seems to have envisioned a program that would allow for medical tourism. Some independent experts have suggested a residency requirement before people can apply for Medicaid, to prevent the appearance of health care as an immigration incentive.
Randy Capps, a senior researcher at the Migration Policy Institute, said: "They are driven primarily by work opportunities and, more recently, dire climate, economic and security conditions. Health coverage is unlikely to change the equation given these much bigger migration push and pull factors."
But Linda J. Blumberg, a health policy fellow at the Urban Institute, argued that a single- payer system, such as the one proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, could indeed create "strong incentives for people with serious health problems to enter the country or remain longer than their visas allow in order to get government-funded care."
So what would a health care program for undocumented immigrants look like?
The devil is in the details, and the details seem to be in short supply: No candidate has yet offered a blueprint.
"As good-hearted as anyone is, it's very challenging," Dr. Blumberg said.
Instead, she said, a more pragmatic approach would be to identify providers, hospitals and community centers that disproportionately serve these populations: "Giving them additional funds to make that care more accessible seems to me an important place to start."

Texto completo: The swimsuit reflects the underbelly of society: It privileges superficiality, has been used to police cultures and values increasingly irrelevant norms of gender and sexuality.
Yet, it survives and lives unstably in the public imagination, vacillating between our collective affection and disdain. Last June, Miss America ended its nearly 100-year-old swimsuit competition. "We are moving it forward and evolving it in this cultural revolution," Gretchen Carlson, the organization's chairwoman, said at the time.
In April, Halima Aden made history as the first Muslim model to wear a hijab and burkini in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
It's hard to say when the garment came to be, but attitudes have certainly changed over time. Early rules about swimwear were governed almost exclusively by modesty; women wore long skirts and men were required to wear T-shirts; and progress was glacial.
In 1866 (one of the earliest mentions in this paper), the Times referred to swimsuits, or at least a variant, as "dresses for sea-bathing" and recommended that women wear "a tunic and knickerbockers of a stout brown holland." The best material for this look was still up for debate.
It wasn't until 1925 -- almost two decades after Annette Kellermann, an Australian swimmer who famously wore a form-fitting one-piece bathing suit -- that the mayor of Atlantic City Beach ruled that women could wear "one-piece suits with skirts and bare legs."
But even with this new relaxed policy, the mayor asked women not to "go beyond reason in their beach attire," and, according to a New York Times article about the rule, there would be men and women "beach censors" to enforce the dress code.
With these positions, it's difficult to imagine that an even more scandalous item -- the bikini -- came on the scene in 1946. Louis Réard, a French automobile engineer, designed the two-piece, naming it after the nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, according to his wife, Michelle.
The design shocked, and Mr. Réard could find only one person to model the suit, Micheline Bernardini, a 19-year-old nude dancer. The bikini was not an instant hit, particularly in the United States; it chafed against the moral barometer of the day, and celebrity endorsements from the likes of Brigitte Bardot confirmed its immodesty.
The Times has dutifully, if not always intentionally, tracked the evolution of swimwear. In the archives are personal essays describing the dreadful ordeal of swimsuit shopping; the advertisements of carefree women announcing significant sales; and unexpected articles with quotations from young women, one saying that if her teachers at her Catholic school in New Rochelle saw the cut of her swimsuit "they'd probably go crazy."
The articles in the archives reflect the swimsuit's slippery definition and suggest that perhaps this garment's survival is less about its meaning and more about its role as a vehicle for enjoying life's low-key pleasures: water and the sun.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Nora Keegan, a 13-year-old from Canada, had a question: Do hand dryers hurt children's hears? She decided to investigate, and ended up getting her study published in the journal Paediatrics & Child Health.
For more than a year, Keegan traveled around Calgary, her hometown, investigating and measuring hand dryers in public restrooms. Her quest began because of personal reasons -- she noticed early on that her own ears hurt after using hand dryers.
"In Grade 4, I noticed that my ears kind of hurt after the hand dryer," Keegan told the Calgary Eyeopener. "And then later, at the start of Grade 5, I also noticed that my ears were hurting after I used the hand dryer. So then I decided to test it to see if they were dangerous to hearing, and it turns out they are. "
Keegan first looked online to see if hand dryer companies disclosed how they measured noise estimates for their products. They didn't, so she proceeded to take things into her own hands.

Keegan went to several bathrooms that children frequent and collected a total of 20 measurements per hand dryer. She found that many dryers were much louder than their companies claimed, exceeding 100 dBa, which is the loudest noise level Canada allows for toys. At 100 dBa, hearing loss is possible after 14 minutes.
"This study suggests that many hand dryers operate at levels far louder than their manufacturers claim and at levels that are clearly dangerous to children’s hearing," Keegan's study concludes.
Keegan told The New York Times the experience has taught her perseverance.
“I’ve learned to never give up, because if I had given up then it would never have come to this,” she said. “And also, I’ve learned that if you see something that you question, you should go for it and don’t stop. ”
David Keegan, Nora Keegan's dad, said accompanying her on her hand dryer-testing adventures was "fun and wild. "
"It was cool to see her determination to get this out there," David Keegan told USA TODAY.
David Keegan said he and his wife have loved helping Nora Keegan pursue her scientific passion.
"I think any parent is thrilled to be able to support kids following their passion," David Keegan said. "I’m really impressed with the work she did on this, and we’re really proud of her. "

Editor of Paediatrics & Child Health Joan Robinson said the fact that Nora Keegan's study was clear and concise, coupled with its originality, led her to accept it. Robinson said it's beneficial for younger people to investigate scientific questions.
"Younger people tend to think outside the box," Robinson said. "They have a different point of view, and so different things stem from that. They have way more potential. "
Lauren Durinka, a pediatric audiologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital, said Nora Keegan's focus on hand dryers was not something she'd thought of before. She said she was impressed by the points Nora Keegan made about how companies test hand dryers.
"It is definitely not something that I have ever thought about," Durinka said. "And I think she brought up a really good point, because you just expect that these companies are doing their due diligence and testing their products, but they also test them in rooms that aren’t public bathrooms. "
Durinka also applauded Nora Keegan raising awareness about hearing loss in children, saying that especially in a noiser, more technological world, noise exposure can affect hearing longterm.
"I think it’s great younger people are paying attention to that, this is not something that just happens to old people, it happens to kids too," Durinka said. "Being aware of how loud sounds may damage their hearing is really important. "

Texto completo: On Thursday, President Donald Trump will deliver a Fourth of July address at the Lincoln Memorial. Critics say the event, which is expected to include tanks, a flyover of military jets and Air Force One, will politicize a nonpartisan celebration.
Americans already act like subjects
By James Bovard
President Donald Trump’s plan to give an Independence Day televised address from the Lincoln Memorial has outraged many pundits and plenty of normal Americans, too. There has rarely been a shortage of political buncombe on July Fourth but Trump could, as usual, break all records.
For Trump’s extravaganza, the Pentagon is bringing out of mothballs some World War II-era Sherman tanks. Though the gun turrets look impressive, Allied soldiers nicknamed Sherman tanks “Ronsons” because they were death traps that "light first every time” in clashes with better built German tanks. But that painful fact, like many others, will be swept under the rug.
The Washington Post condemned Trump’s “gaudy display of military hardware that is more in keeping with a banana republic than the world’s oldest democracy. ” Regrettably, the Post’s indignation over a few tanks does not extend to the fact that American troops are now fighting in 14 foreign nations. But the real problem is not the military relics; it's exalting government power and politicians on a day meant to celebrate individual liberty. The Fourth of July in Washington has been going downhill ever since 9/11.
In his first draft of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson scratched out the word “subjects” and replaced it with “citizens. ” But on Independence Day 2003, I wondered whether that had been an editing error. I saw long lines of people awaiting outside government checkpoints around the National Mall, kowtowing for permission to celebrate independence according to the latest edicts. Police and security agents continue to have a far heavier presence in Washington and many other places than in earlier times. Three years ago, police urged people heading for the National Mall on July Fourth to sign up for a free emergency text alert system called NIXLE. (Subtext: “All your email addresses belong to us!”)
How many Americans recall that the Fourth of July originally consecrated independence achieved thanks to resistance to a corrupt, oppressive regime? Facebook, that bellwether of cluelessness, last year censored a Texas newspaper’s reposting of a portion of the Declaration of Independence because it went against its standards on hate speech.
Patti Davis: Founding Fathers would be ashamed of Trump's egocentric, militaristic July 4th
The Founding Fathers carved the First Amendment to ensure freedom of the press after the crown’s appointees muzzled criticism of King George’s regime. The Second Amendment, recognizing the right to keep and bear arms, was spurred by British troops seeking to seize firearms at Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches because British agents with general warrants would ransack any colonist’s house. The Fifth Amendment’s eminent domain provision was written after British agents claimed a right to seize without compensation any pine tree in New England for British navy ship masts.
Nevertheless, the battles our forefathers fought to secure our rights have long since been forgotten amidst a deluge of abuses at the federal, state and local government level. There are good reasons why less than 20% of Americans trust the federal government nowadays.
The hubbub around Trump’s speech should spur Americans to take their Fourth of July to higher ground. What matters is not what politicians say on any given day but the principles and values that Americans choose to live by. Regardless of how often government agents violate the Constitution, citizens retain all the rights for which our forefathers fought.
Federal Judge Learned Hand warned in 1944: “Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it. ”
On this Fourth of July, Americans should nourish that spirit of liberty by taking a long walk, drinking a good beer, or maybe simply giving a hearty verbal thrashing to the politician of your choice.

What others are saying
Renée Graham, The Boston Globe: "It’s President Donald Trump throwing his own party, with fighter jets roaring overhead. With his love of military symbolism, it’s always worth restating that Trump had no similar affection for actually being in the military. When his country called him to service in the Vietnam War era, he did what he has continued to do as president — he turned his back. Trump was not a conscientious objector, but a rich man’s boy accustomed to having Daddy’s money as a cushion for life’s hard landings. "
Chris Core, WTOP radio, "Core Values with Chris Core": “There are certainly a lot of things to complain about President Trump. But his idea of shaking up the Fourth of July celebration is not one of them. He wants to speak on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Fine — he’s our president, like him or not. He apparently would like Air Force One to fly over the mall. Sounds like fun. The fireworks will be shot off from West Potomac Park instead of the Mall, might be a really pretty change. And frankly, the Fourth of July celebration has been pretty much the same year after year after year. This will bring some new life to it. "
Michelle Cottle, The New York Times: "For decades, Washington’s Fourth of July tribute has aimed to play down or paper over political divisions and celebrate America — not any particular leader or party. Recognizing their power to distract, not to mention incite, presidents have opted to absent themselves from the events. . . . This is far from the most significant political norm that Trump has shattered in the course of his presidency. It is depressing nonetheless. The greatness of America does not reside with its president, but with its people. It is this spirit that the annual celebration in the nation’s capital has endeavored to preserve. Until now. "
What our readers are saying
We spend millions on military flyovers at sporting events each year. We can certainly send some tanks and planes for our nation's birthday in our own capital. We should not be embarrassed; we should be very proud!
— Bob Zimmerman
How pathologically insecure does one have to be to co-opt our nation's most patriotic holiday and conflate it with self-promotion?
— Tim Donovan
He's the president of the United States. Who better to commemorate the occasion? This has nothing to do with the campaign.
— James Daniel Rogers
Now being patriotic and proud of your country is a bad thing for people.

Texto completo: At noon Wednesday, Maine mothers in Portland, Bangor, Augusta, Biddeford and Caribou staged "play date protests" with their children at the congressional district offices of Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.
The action was part of a national effort organized by Mainers for Accountable Leadership, and was conducted to protest the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" border policy, including family separations, and the ongoing crisis of the detention camps at the border.
"Protest is intergenerational," said Marie Follaytar, co-director of Mainers for Accountable Leadership. "This is not a time to be silent or remain inactive, and we need to teach this norm to our children."
The protesters numbered between 50 to 100 over the course of the rally in Portland, according to several estimates. Protesters cycled in and out of the senator's office while children drew pictures, sang songs and made posters.
Six protesters were spotted at Collins' Bangor office.
Reports of unsafe and unsanitary conditions at the border have been steady. Last month, it was reported that detained migrants lacked hygienic items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes and shampoo. The Department of Homeland Security's independent watchdog said that "overcrowded, squalid conditions are more widespread along the southern border than initially revealed," the New York Times reported Tuesday, finding children with few spare clothes and no laundry facilities and adults kept in standing-room-only conditions for a week.
U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, visited border facilities in El Paso and Clint, Texas, earlier this week, tweeting that detained migrants were being forced to drink from toilets as their only water source.
On Monday, a stunning report from ProPublica described a secret Facebook group comprised of 9,500 current and former Customs and Border Protection agents -- a number nearly half of its active force -- engaging in racist and sexist commentary. It was later condemned by the U.S. Head of Border Patrol.
A press release from Mainers for Accountable Leadership, a PAC coordinating Wednesday's protest, said: "These conditions are the product of a cruel and intentional strategy by the Trump administration to terrorize immigrant communities, criminalize immigration, and dismantle our asylum laws. From imprisoning children in inhumane detention centers, threatening widespread raids to break up families, and covering up reports of migrants dying in U.S. custody, we must come together to permanently end family detention and separation, ensure all families are reunited, and close the camps."
Dini Merz, a co-director of Mainers for Accountable Leadership, said that the organization has asked their members to contact Collins and independent U.S. Sen. Angus King, as well as Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, asking them to offer more than "bold statements" to pressure the administration to improve conditions at the camps any way they can. But Collins is a strategic choice.
"We want Sen. Collins more than anyone because she has some sway in the Trump camp, because he has needed her help in pushing forward his agenda," Merz said. "That's why we are having this particular action focused on her."
Last week, the Republican-led Senate passed a $4.6 billion aid package that President Donald Trump said would deliver aid to the southern border. The bill reportedly contains $1 billion to shelter and feed migrants detained by the border patrol and nearly $3 billion to care for unaccompanied migrant children who are turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services. Earlier, the Senate rejected a House version of the bill that included new health and safety standards for jailed migrants. The Senate bill provides additional funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Defense Department.
In a statement to the Bangor Daily News, a spokesperson for Collins said that the senator "has been appalled by reports about the conditions many children have been experiencing in custody at the border, including a lack of basic personal hygiene products like soap and toothpaste, and she has heard from many Mainers who share her concern."
The statement also said Collins "believes we need comprehensive immigration reform, a better way of handling asylum claims, more immigration judges, a sensible system for guest workers, and a long-term solution for DREAMers, along with stronger border security."
Collins voted to confirm two of the primary architects of the Trump administration's border policy, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Director of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, who was removed in April. King also voted to confirm Nielsen. Acting Customs and Border Commissioner John Sanders announced last week that he would be leaving his position effective July 5.

Texto completo: The federal government has begun sending immigrant girls to a facility west of Lake Worth Beach, bringing the immigration crisis that has been roiling the U.S. southern border to Palm Beach County.
As many as 141 children described in zoning documents as “unaccompanied minors” can be placed into the facility at 4445 Pine Forest Drive off of Military Trail south of Lake Worth Road.
The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a group founded in 1911 to advance the interests of immigrants, is managing the facility through a contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement.
The term “unaccompanied minor” has generally been used to describe children who have left their homes and attempted to gain entry into the United States on their own. It it not known whether the facility will house only such immigrants or if it also will be used to house children separated from their parents at the border.
The policy of separating children from their parents has outraged critics of the Trump administration, whose officials have both denied it is carrying out the practice and, conversely, acknowledged its use as a deterrent to those fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.
Father Frank O’Loughlin, the executive director of the Guatemalan-Maya Center in Lake Worth Beach who reached out to the facility’s operators, said he’s been told that middle school-age girls will be housed at the facility.
It is not clear where the girls are from, though O’Loughlin said he believes some are likely to be indigenous children from Central America.
Palm Beach County Commissioner Gregg Weiss, whose district includes the facility, said he was happy to have his staff help facilitate zoning changes in November, which he saw as an opportunity to provide a clean, safe place for children while
their immigration status is determined.
He said he opposes separating immigrant children from their parents. “They told us it was going to be unaccompanied minors,” Weiss said. “I don’t support children being separated from their parents at all. That’s unacceptable.”
Weiss said his view of the facility would change if he learned children separated from their parents were being housed there.
“It would definitely be a big difference to me,” he said.
The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants got zoning changes from the county in late 2018 that allowed it to make temporary use of an additional 68 beds at the Pine Forest Drive facility, which initially had 93 units when it was approved in 1988 as a nursing home.
Minors can now be housed at the facility through Sept. 30, 2021. The committee sent a letter to Weiss on Dec. 13 thanking his staff and other county employees for their help in approving the zoning changes.
“Because of the extra effort of these folks and those copied below, many vulnerable children will find a safe place,” wrote Lee D. Williams, the committee’s senior vice president.
Conditions at private, for-profit immigrant detention centers along the southern border have sparked outrage at the Trump administration, which has separated children from parents seeking asylum in America. The Trump administration has been unable to reunite all of the children separated from their families. And recent reports of children being housed in cages without bedding and toothbrushes renewed rage at a president who has made illegal immigration a focus of his administration.
Trump has said mass deportations of illegal immigrants will begin next week, a threat that has sent waves of fear through some immigrant communities.
In May, reports surfaced that federal officials would transport 1,000 immigrants per month from Texas to Broward and Palm Beach counties. The next day, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said they would not send them “at this time” and instead were sizing up processing capacity across the country.
In the days before and after the Democratic Party’s first presidential debates last week in Miami, candidates trooped to an immigration detention facility in Homestead to decry the administration’s policies.
The candidates were not allowed to enter the facility.
Likewise, a reporter for The Palm Beach Post was not allowed entry to the Lake Worth-area facility.
A woman and man who answered the door Monday said visits would have to be approved by the federal government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.
Asked how such approval could be streamlined, the pair suggested the reporter contact “a congressional person.”
U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, whose district includes the facility, said her office “has been in touch with the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants and I have requested a tour.”
Frankel added: “I look forward to speaking with the children at this center, hearing their stories and finding ways I can continue advocating for them in Congress.”
A spokeswoman for the committee said its contract with HHS bars it from speaking to the media. She referred questions to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which did not respond to requests for comment.
According to some of the zoning paperwork, Alzheimer’s patients will remain at the facility, but they and the immigrant children “shall be clearly separated from each through the necessary acceptable means established by the State or FL Building Code.”
Youth Co-Op, a social service provider in Palm Springs, is working with the committee to provide services such as English language classes.
An official with that organization would not answers questions from a Post reporter, referring inquiries to the committee.
News that the federal government was planning to house migrant children in Lake Worth was first reported last week by The New York Times.
The 60,000-square-foot facility on about 8.5 acres opened in 1988 as a 93-unit nursing home.
Property records indicate it is owned by Volunteer Properties of Lake Worth LLC, which is linked in state records to K.C. Cross, a nursing home executive.

Texto completo: Rep. Dan Crenshaw criticized the New York Times for publishing a video he said presented a "dismal" and "ungrateful" view of America.
"Wow. What a dismal, cynical, ungrateful, and context-less depiction of America. Just remember NYT: as you criticize the US for not being perfect, your misguided speech will always be protected," the Texas Republican said Tuesday on Twitter.
Tweet
The New York Times ran a video by senior producer Nayeema Raza and Taige Jensen saying America is not great but "OK."
"It's gotten to a point where I think there are specific times and places where you can confuse America for a developing country as elections are tampered with, water can't be drunk from taps, citizens don't trust uniformed officers, infrastructure is crumbling, and where a dual system is emerging when public services are for sale for the highest bidder," the video said. "You see this in countries like Pakistan or Nigeria where the rich don't worry about the sad state of electricity or police because, well, they have generators, private security. Or in America where the Kardashians rent their own firefighting force."
"How great America is really depends on how rich you are," the video continued. "America may once have been the greatest, but today America: We're just OK."

Andy Ngo's commentary doesn't undermine his news reporting

Texto completo: As disturbing as it is predictable, the media and Portland apologists have begun to make excuses for antifa brownshirts' apparent rule over the Rose City. They now blame this masked group's violent assault on journalist Andy Ngo upon the fact that he also writes political commentary.
In a piece that buries antifa's quick-drying cement attack on Ngo, and the brain bleed with which they sent him to the hospital, the New York Times cites Brian Levin, the director at "the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism" at California State University in San Bernardino.
"He’s a political pundit who certainly makes the most out of his conflicts, which sometimes turn violent on him. But to his credit, I’ve never seen him be the physical aggressor in the posts that he’s made generally," said Brian Levin.
Levin's obfuscation is simple, effective, and terrifying. Here he attempts to erase Ngo's extensive work as an objective news reporter, implying that because he's written commentary at mainstream opinion pages such as the Wall Street Journal, he cannot engage in anything less than clickbait gonzo journalism and he practically deserves to be attacked.
Watch any of Ngo's videos and just try to find an Alex Jones style stunt of him screaming in bystanders faces. You won't find it. The soft-spoken Quillette editor does what local news reporters are supposed to do: objectively document public events of community interest. If thugs willfully parading and pillaging the streets of Portland don't want to be caught doing so, they can stop at any time. His offense is bringing transparency to the situation.
On CNN, Ngo said that he appreciated Levin's recognition that he was not the "physical aggressor" in the conflict. He shouldn't. Even this insinuation that Ngo might have been an "aggressor" is intended to undermine his integrity as a journalist — to blame him for an extremist hate group's violence because he was there covering it in the first place.
Opinion pieces by journalists at other outlets discard the mask altogether. At Haaretz, Ngo's assailants are credited with "self-defense" from "fascist videographers." Mike Stuchbery at the Independent reminds you, "don't worry about Ngo," who appeared on national television visibly bruised and disturbingly slow from that itty bitty brain hemorrhage.
"Instead, start worrying about the growing power and influence of figures on the far right who use propaganda and bad faith arguments to demonise anyone who opposes them," Stuchbery writes, as though getting sent to the hospital had been Ngo's plan all along. And as if opposition to violent hate groups such as antifa constitutes fascism. Ridiculous!
Opinion journalism is also journalism. Ngo and others who write commentary don't forfeit their ability to find and report objective facts, nor obviously do they forfeit their right to safety in public places. Indeed, Ngo's case is illustrating that so many of those journalists and commentators claiming the free press is on life support are actually part of the problem.Story URLPhoto Caption:Andy Ngo.

Federal wealth taxes and the incremental erosion of liberty

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

Texto completo: What's on TV
DIVORCE 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. When this pitch-black comedy about the aftermath of a messy divorce debuted in 2016, critics gave it mixed reviews. Some found it too painful to enjoy, and the characters weren't exactly a likable bunch. But its second season showed signs of improvement, mostly because we saw better sides of Frances (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Robert (Thomas Haden Church) as they moved on to different partners. In Season 3 (spoiler alert!), tensions rise as Robert's wedding draws closer and he and Frances butt heads over their parenting styles. On the sidelines, Diane (Molly Shannon) searches for independence while her husband sits in prison, and Dallas (Talia Balsam) wrestles with a midlife crisis. Writing in The New York Times, James Poniewozik said the show isn't "going to reinvent the breakup comedy or the HBO comedy. Its goal is more modest and midlife-appropriate: to tell one more story of two people trying to reinvent themselves."
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
UNDER THE SILVER LAKE (2019) Stream on Amazon. This labyrinthine mystery follows Sam (Andrew Garfield), a jobless 30-something man in Los Angeles who finds a purpose when his neighbor Sarah (Riley Keough) disappears in the middle of the night. He's convinced that he can find her with the help of conspiracy theories and hidden messages, many of which are steeped in pop culture, and sets out on a trippy search that involves a billionaire mogul, Hollywood parties and a roving dog killer. Most critics have praised the movie's cinematography, but some found its story too convoluted. "There are some moments of humor and surprise embedded in the overwrought intricacies and long slack stretches of the plot," A.O. Scott wrote in his Times review. "But beyond the coy nostalgia and the timid satire is a feeling of bottomless exhaustion."
VERONICA MARS Stream on Hulu. For a more satisfying mystery, revisit this beloved teen drama about a high school student who cracks cases big and small in a fictional California town. The lovable and plucky Veronica (Kristen Bell) dove into detective work after the murder of her best friend; in an especially timely subplot, her pursuit of justice is also partly driven by her desire to find the man who drugged and raped her at a party. The series ran for three seasons, from 2004 to 2007, and nearly a decade later, fans managed to crowd-fund a movie. The show makes yet another comeback on July 26: In an eight-episode revival on Hulu, Veronica, now the principal of Mars Investigation, goes after a serial killer.
NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT PERSIAN CATS (2010) Stream on Hulu; rent on Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Two indie rock musicians (Negar Shaghaghi and Ashkan Koshanejad) host and perform in underground concerts in Tehran -- where playing rock in public is outlawed -- in this moving drama by the director Bahman Ghobadi.

Texto completo: The family sitcom "One Day at a Time" will be revived next year on the cable television channel Pop TV, the network announced on Thursday, months after fans began protesting Netflix's decision to cancel it.
Netflix announced in March that the multicamera comedy about a Cuban-American family, which originated as a Norman Lear sitcom in the 1970s and ran for nearly a decade, would end after its third season because its viewership wasn't large enough.
The show had received enthusiastic support from Hispanic viewers who rarely saw their family lives reflected on television, and fans, using hashtags like "#SaveODAAT," launched a social media campaign to make their feelings known. Netflix executives weren't swayed.
Now, a 13-episode fourth season will air in 2020, exclusively on Pop TV, which is owned by CBS and is known for the comedy "Schitt's Creek." It will be produced by Sony Pictures Television.
One of the showrunners, Gloria Calderón Kellett, celebrated the news on Twitter, thanking fans for their role in bringing back "One Day at a Time."
"Three months ago, I was heartbroken with the news of our beloved One Day at a Time's cancellation," Lear, now an executive producer on the show, said in a news release. "Today, I'm overwhelmed with joy to know the Alvarez family will live on."
The first three seasons of the Netflix show told heartfelt stories involving three generations of women: a divorced veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder (played by Justina Machado), her lesbian teenage daughter (Isabella Gomez) and her widowed immigrant mother (Rita Moreno). The show, which debuted in 2017, took on subjects that aren't commonly dealt with in family sitcoms with a studio audience, including issues surrounding L.G.B.T. life, immigration and recovery from drug addiction.
After its cancellation, James Poniewozik, a New York Times television critic, wrote that the show "combined a classic TV form -- the studio-audience family sitcom -- with a sensibility that was utterly of the moment."
"It was one of TV's best laughs and best cries," he continued.
The president of Pop TV, Brad Schwartz, said in the news release that he was proud that the channel would be telling "heartwarming stories of love, inclusion, acceptance and diversity."
The first three seasons will stay on Netflix and will also come to Pop TV. After the show's run on Pop TV, the season will be broadcast on CBS, which aired the original in the 1970s and '80s.
A Netflix spokeswoman did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. In March, the streaming service said that it had been a "very difficult decision" to cancel the sitcom but that, ultimately, "simply not enough people watched to justify another season."
After the announcement on Thursday, fans swapped the "#SaveODAAT" hashtag for "#MoreODAAT," and the show's stars reveled in the news.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Roll up the sidewalk

Texto completo: On a summer afternoon in 1894, William Barkalow had a drink or three and got on his horse. He rode it down the central sidewalk of Long Branch, N.J, where horses were, even in those primordial days of traffic regulation, definitely not supposed to go.
Barkalow rode among the foot traffic like an electric scooter before its time. The next day's New York Times reported that he paid no heed to a police officer's shouts, nor the billy club flung at him. And while Barkalow didn't trample anyone, his breach of sidewalk etiquette proved so intolerable that the officer finally shot him between the shoulder blades.
The turn of the century was a rough time in the history of the sidewalk. Ubiquitous strips of not-street were squeezed thinner and thinner to make way for horses, trolleys and eventually lanes of automobiles. The footed masses fought with vendors and construction crews for the leftover pavement as if it were some Mesopotamian riverbed. "The pedestrians now, as formerly, must spend their time in a hurdle race over skids, climb platforms, dodge moving boxes or else run the risk of being crushed under horses' hoofs in the street," the Times complained in 1896, as part of its newly launched "crusade against the sidewalk grabbers."
There's a new kind of sidewalk-grabber today - more agile than Barkalow's horse, popping seemingly from nowhere at 10, 15, 20 mph into the paths of pedestrians. Thousands of rentable electric scooters have taken over pavement from Washington to Santa Monica, Calif., and Austin to Chicago. They clog narrow sidewalks, startle us from our ambulatory texting sessions and lay strewn in the middle of crosswalks. It's hard to recall a time in living memory when it was this nerve-racking to attempt a stroll.

The physical injuries are one thing: A 75-year-old man tripped over an abandoned scooter in San Diego and shattered his knee. A 7-year-old boy near Los Angeles reportedly had his teeth knocked out by a scooter rider. A 44-year-old woman was hit by a Bird scooter in a Cincinnati intersection. The assailant's Bird account was suspended, while the woman got a $1,000 medical bill. And on the other side of the gutter, car-on-scooter fatalities are becoming almost commonplace.
But for every broken tooth, there are countless jostled states of mind, as pedestrians discover the placid streams by which they travel have been invaded en masse by machines with names like Bird and Jump and Spin and Skip.
Jacob Hege, 22, has walked to work a bit more cautiously since he emerged from a crosswalk on 16th Street NW in Washington and felt something thwack him from behind. He turned to see a woman on a Bird scooter, which like several other brands in the District can be found on almost any block and rented for a few dollars.
"We both got knocked to the side," Hege said. "She had AirPods in, and she looked at me with such anger and said, 'Move!' and scooted away. And I stood looking at her like, 'What?' "
Once again, there's a people's crusade to restore the sanctity of the sidewalk, with anti-scooter vigilantes appearing wherever the machines do. Scooters are piled into dumpsters, chucked into rivers, thrown through windshields, set on fire and hung from bridge posts like apparatchiks of a deposed regime.
In Hoboken, N.J. - the state's first major beachhead for scooters - an anonymous Twitter documentarian records riders buzzing by strollers and smashing into each other. In Atlanta, a man in a wheelchair who calls himself John Plantaseed has taken to knocking down rows of scooters like chains of dominoes, yelling triumphant obscenities as they clatter to the pavement.
Cities are trying to mitigate the backlash. Washington will begin experimenting with solar-powered charging docks, hoping to break riders' habit of dumping the scooters wherever they happen to stop. But sometimes no balance can be found. Nashville's mayor is seeking to evict scooters from the streets.

We could use some perspective, because this is not the first sidewalk war by any means.
The first known sidewalks were laid in central Anatolia around 2000 B.C. - a millennium or two after the invention of the wheel, according to the book "Sidewalks: Conflict and Negotiation over Public Space." They remained rare luxuries in most of the world until the 19th century, when big cities like London and Paris built hundreds of miles of the stuff.
But it took decades of social conditioning before "walk" became the operative syllable in sidewalk. For most of human history, vehicles, pedestrians, vendors, musicians, drinkers and strolling lovers all mingled in the same amorphous muck of the avenue. It's only in the last century or so that those corridors have been divided up, stratified, painted with lines and regulated in the name of more efficient movement.
Jaywalkers - a word that did not exist until the early 20th century - were shamed and fined for straying into the street. Non-walkers were similarly penalized for clogging up the precious sidewalks.
"City after city started issuing ordinances prohibiting or regulating a number of sidewalk activities from street vending to political and commercial speech, from the display of wares on the sidewalk to loitering, panhandling, and prostitution," reads the book. Detroit went so far as to paint "huge yellow footsteps" on its sidewalks in the 1920s, lest any pedestrian fail to get the message.
This social order worked fine, except when it didn't. Bicycles, newspaper boxes, mass homelessness, plodding iPhone gazers - all these things disturbed the fiction of a street neatly divided into walkers and cars. Cities simply invented regulations and lanes to restore the peace, which worked until the next disruption came along, and here we are today in scooter hell.
But is it a hell made by scooters, or just made apparent by them?
"I see this conflict more as an outcome of bad decisions and bad design," said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, co-author of "Sidewalks" and an urban planning professor at the scooter-saturated campus of the University of California at Los Angeles. "Cities kept widening the streets and narrowing the sidewalks, and downgrading activities to accommodate only walking. . . . I don't mean to say sometimes scooter drivers are not obnoxious. But I'd say it's a less obnoxious use than cars."
Loukaitou-Sideris expects cities will find a way out of this jam, whether by restricting scooters or squeezing yet more lanes into the finite space between buildings.
Sidewalk disputes always resolve one way or the other. Just ask William Barkalow.

Prosecutors: Ala. district attorney may not pursue charges against Jones

Texto completo: Prosecutors may not pursue manslaughter charges after an Alabama woman was arrested for the death of her unborn child, who was shot and killed during a December 2018 fight.
Marshae Jones was arrested Wednesday after a local grand jury indicted her on manslaughter charges, igniting a firestorm across the country. But District Attorney Lynneice Washington's office urged caution in a late Thursday news release, saying the office has not yet decided whether to pursue the manslaughter charge, reduce it or drop the case altogether.
"Foremost, it should be stated that this is a truly tragic case, resulting the death of an unborn child," the release stated. "We feel sympathy for the families involved, including Ms. Jones, who lost her unborn child. The fact that this tragedy was 100% avoidable makes this case even more disheartening."
Jones' case is odd and, some say, unprecedented. According to al.com, 23-year-old Ebony Jemison was initially charged in December 2018 after a shooting in Pleasant Grove led to the death of the unborn child.
But investigating authorities alleged the pregnant Jones, not Jemison, initiated and instigated the attack. Jemison told BuzzFeed News she fired a gun as a "warning shot" after Jones and a group of friends attacked her over a relationship issue.
The grand jury declined to bring charges against Jemison, the DA's office said, determining that she acted in self-defense.
The DA's office has not yet returned request for comment. Efforts to reach both Jones and Jemison on Friday were unsuccessful.
But Jones' charge appears to contradict a portion of Alabama's Criminal Code. Though the code does include "fetal homicide" language, which defines an "unborn child in utero" as a human being, regardless of viability, the code also states that the prosecution of "any woman with respect to her unborn child" should not be permitted under criminal homicide charges like manslaughter.
"It's the plain language of the statute," said Andrew Skier, a Montgomery-based criminal defense attorney.
Skier has no ties to Jones' case, but he said when he first saw the story he believed the manslaughter charge was "quite a stretch" under Alabama law. Manslaughter, recklessly engaging in conduct you know includes a risk, is a tough thing to prove from the outset.
But after reviewing the state code, Skier said he would file a motion to dismiss if he were involved in the case, "based on that statute" alone.
"That is 100% a bar to this prosecution," Skier said. "It seems to me that whoever indicted this case didn't read this statute."
Abortion and reproductive rights groups this week quickly raised Jones' case as a cause célèbre, marking it as an example of prosecutorial overreach on the heels of a near-total abortion ban in Alabama. The new law — which could go in effect in November but is expected to remain tied up in federal lawsuits — would criminalize anyone who performs an abortion in the state. Though the law does not criminalize women who receive abortion care, opponents of the legislation argued it would create a slippery slope for reproductive rights and pregnancy loss.
"The prosecution of Marshae Jones is absolutely reprehensible," said Staci Fox, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast, in a statement. "It is more proof that Alabama will do everything in its power to criminalize pregnancy — especially for Black women."
Jones' case, however, is not directly related to the abortion ban.
Alabama in the past has used new legislation to pursue prosecutions of pregnant women. In 2006, state lawmakers passed a chemical endangerment law intended to prosecute adults who expose children to volatile meth labs. It was later seized by some prosecutors to target women who take drugs while pregnant, according to an investigation by al.com and ProPublica.
Though the indictment of a woman for her own pregnancy loss is unusual in Alabama, it is not unusual for prosecutors to charge people with murder even if they never killed anyone. Felony murder doctrine allows for murder prosecutions if someone dies in the course of a felony crime.
In December, Montgomery police charged a high school student with felony murder in a convoluted hit-and-run that killed 15-year-old Keiauna Williams. Police allege Terrance Webster fired a gun while a large group of teenagers were gathering in a parking lot after a party. Williams, fleeing the gunfire, was struck and killed.
Last year, an Alabama teenager was sentenced to 65 years in prison under Alabama's accomplice liability law after a local police officer shot and killed one of his friends.
Prosecutors argued Lakeith Smith was one of five teenagers who burgled two homes in Millbrook in 2015. In an exchange of gunfire, 16-year-old A'Donte Washington was killed by an officer.
An Elmore County grand jury cleared the officer who fired the fatal shots. But because Smith was allegedly committing the criminal act of burglary at the time of his friend's death, he was held responsible.
Though some states such as California, Hawaii and Kentucky have moved to restrict or abolish felony murder doctrine laws in recent year, they are still active in the majority of the U.S. The New York Times in 2018 reported the U.S. is the last country to maintain felony murder doctrine.

'SHE'S NOT MY TYPE' CLINTON USED CRASS DEFENSE BEFORE TRUMP

Texto completo: She's not my type." Many people must have done a double-take when they heard President Donald Trump's first defense against writer E. Jean Carroll's claim that he assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.
His words are startling for two reasons: One, because the kind of sexual assault Ms. Carroll alleges has nothing to do with attraction and everything to do with power; and two, because an American president has used this defense before.
The New York Times' article on the latest Trump scandal carried this headline: "'She's Not My Type': Accused Again of Sexual Assault, Trump Resorts to Old Insult'."
But this "old insult" - very significantly - pre-dates Donald Trump. Those of us who remember the 1990s know, courtesy of the Starr Report, that President Bill Clinton used the same logic to dismiss Kathleen Willey's claim he assaulted her near the Oval Office. According to Monica Lewinsky, the 22-year-old intern with whom he was having an affair, he said the allegation "was ludicrous because he would never approach a small-breasted woman like Ms. Willey."
I'm confused: Is there one type of woman men seduce and another type they assault? Is there still a type of man out there who thinks "seduce" and "assault" are synonyms?
While The Times omitted this not-so-distant history, history may help explain why Mr. Trump seems - so far - to be impervious to yet another troubling accusation. He has been immunized twice: by the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape and by Bill Clinton.
Just before the October 2016 presidential debate, a recording surfaced, made en route to a taping of a TV show, of Mr. Trump speaking in blunt, gross terms of how aggressively he would approach women. He survived the ensuing uproar and, four weeks later, defeated whom?
Hillary Clinton, the woman who notoriously derided and sneered at the women who accused her husband of similar conduct.
Back in the '90s, though, public opinion eventually moved in Mr. Clinton's favor. Voters knew of his behavior, thanks to tabloids and "60 Minutes," before electing him. After years of scandal - the Lewinsky affair, Paula Jones's lawsuit, Juanita Broaddrick's accusation of rape and, finally, impeachment - Mr. Clinton left office with approval ratings as high as ever.
Is Mr. Trump following a similar path? Voters knew about his sexual history before the 2016 election and put him in office anyway. He's never been as popular as Mr. Clinton, and his style could hardly be more different, but do his supporters look at the newest allegation, after years of attack, as just more piling on?
Are we all suffering from scandal fatigue? #MeToo overload?
As Elle's longtime advice columnist, Ms. Carroll is droll, unpredictable and pretty fierce - the only "must-read" in any women's magazine. The incident she alleges with Mr. Trump in the mid-'90s is not just assault, it's rape. In some ways, she is Mr. Trump's Juanita Broaddrick - strong and credible, though silent for years.
It's significant, though, that when Ms. Broaddrick did come forward, NBC News investigated her claim, gathered much corroborating testimony and then quashed the story for weeks - until after Mr. Clinton had been impeached and acquitted.
These are different times - and this president fronts a different political party, of course.
Mr. Trump's denials sound confident - though as jarring as all his utterances. And there are Ms. Carroll's flaky moments even in friendly interviews, plus the fact that she's speaking out only as she launches a new book.
What are we to think?
Waves of history are colliding here. How the Clinton and Trump presidencies are judged will largely depend on the politics of those judging. How their lives are judged depends on forces one unleashed and the other must navigate.
Two men born just two months apart have woven stories so sordid that we must weigh the worst that could be said of them. This rough justice may be all anyone in these sad stories gets.

Texto completo: Elizabeth Cecily Paton and James Paul Wise were married June 28 in a civil ceremony at Sibton Park in Suffolk, England. Becci Sharpe, a registrar in Saxmundham for the Suffolk County Council, officiated.
On June 29, the couple took part in a celebration ceremony, also at Sibton Park. Sir Nigel Carrington, the bride's uncle, led the ceremony.
The bride, 32, is the Styles correspondent in Europe for The New York Times and is based in the London bureau. She has a master's degree in English literature from Balliol College, Oxford University.
She is a daughter of Julia M. Paton of London and the late Hugh Paton. The bride's mother is a psychotherapist in private practice in London. Her father was a managing director at JPMorgan Chase, also in London. The bride is also a stepdaughter of John Studzinski of New York. Her stepfather, who works in New York, is a managing director and vice chairman of Pimco, the global investment management firm.
The groom, 33, is a partner in Balderton Capital, a venture capital firm in London, and a founder of the Social Business Trust, a London-based charity. He received a master's degree in politics, philosophy and economics at Christ Church, Oxford University.
He is the son of Paul Wise of Cheshire, England, and Kay Fitchew, also of Cheshire. The groom's father owns a car dealership in South Manchester, England, that bears his name. The groom is also the stepson of Jonathan Fitchew.
The couple were introduced at a dinner in New York by a mutual friend in August 2013 when the bride was working as a news reporter for The Financial Times in New York and the groom was based in London.
Despite attending the same university and sharing many friends, they had never met. They soon embarked on a long-distance relationship that became considerably shorter in January 2015, when the bride moved back to London.
The groom proposed in October 2018 on the rooftop of the Ludlow Hotel on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where their relationship began.

Boeing's Dreamliner Plant Is Said to Face U.S. Inquiry

Texto completo: The Department of Justice, which has been looking into problems with Boeing's 737 Max jet, has broadened its investigation to include the production of the company's 787 Dreamliner, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Federal prosecutors recently subpoenaed Boeing for documents related to production processes at the Dreamliner plant in North Charleston, S.C., the people said.
In April, The New York Times detailed allegations of shoddy work and flawed quality control at the factory that threatened to compromise safety. The article, based on hundreds of pages of internal emails, company documents and federal records, revealed that debris was regularly left inside aircraft. A ladder was found in a plane's tail and a stray bolt in an engine.
[Read The Times's investigation of safety lapses at the Dreamliner plant.]
Several employees said that in the rush to complete jets on time, managers ignored safety concerns raised by workers.
The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed three safety complaints lodged by employees at the plant since September, according to an F.A.A. official and an internal agency email.
Boeing declined to comment on the inquiry by the Justice Department. The investigation into the Dreamliner was reported by The Seattle Times.
Federal prosecutors and investigators at the Department of Transportation's inspector general have been looking into the development of the Max after two of the jets crashed within five months, killing 346 people. The new focus on the Dreamliner is a sign that the investigation is widening into engineering development and production at Boeing factories in Washington State and South Carolina.
A month after the New York Times article, the executive in charge of the troubled plant, David Carbon, stepped down. An internal Boeing memo said Mr. Carbon was leaving "to care for his family" after several years as vice president for 787 operations at Boeing South Carolina.
Many of the employees said Mr. Carbon had fostered a culture that at times made speed a priority over safety.
An inspector for American Airlines found so much debris inside Dreamliners made at the plant that he began collecting it in small plastic storage bags to show Mr. Carbon. The inspector once discovered a bolt inside an engine of a plane that had gone up for a test flight. He also found Bubble Wrap near the pedal that pilots used to control the plane's rudder.
In response to the allegations, Boeing said its planes go through multiple safety tests before they begin flying.
"Boeing and the F.A.A. implement a rigorous inspection process to ensure that all our airplanes are safe and built with the highest levels of quality," Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, said.
But current and former employees at the plant told The Times that it had been plagued by problems for nearly a decade. They described metal shavings being left underneath floorboards, near critical electrical systems that control the Dreamliner. A ladder and a string of lights were left inside tails, dangerously close to the gears that control the horizontal stabilizer. Defective parts have been installed on airplanes.
Officials believe that the metal shavings may have caused damage to an airplane that was already in service in 2012, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The F.A.A. is also investigating an incident in which a manager at the Charleston plant inappropriately pressured an employee involved in certification. The Boeing employee is a member of a team designated by the F.A.A. to help certify aircraft.
In a letter sent to Boeing on June 6, the F.A.A. said that the employee "experienced interference from management." The letter, portions of which were reviewed by The Times, also said that rules for delegating certification to Boeing "are not being followed, or alternatively are being subverted."
Boeing production managers are not allowed to intervene in the work of employees who are supposed to represent the F.A.A. At the Charleston plant, the employee had two managers, one within the designee program and another outside it, according to F.A.A documents. Such a reporting structure is typically considered a violation of agency rules.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Ashton: How a visit to the town Calamity Jane and Wild Bill made famous got me thinking about the 2020 presidential race

Texto completo: What do presidential debates and Deadwood have in common?
Not much. Unless you count blustering rhetoric, overbearing personalities and guns drawn.
I mention Deadwood because I just returned from a research trip there. I’m writing a book about Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok, and this famous South Dakota town will be forever associated with the notorious duo.
Research expeditions are the best part of my job. It was an epic road trip with my co-authors. We got to see a wolf pack prowling, two bears wrestling and prairie dogs chirping. And that was just in the minivan in front of us.
We also stopped by the Old Style Saloon No. 10, where Wild Bill Hickok was shot and killed by the coward Jack McCall, who was later hanged for the act. Wild Bill is buried near the town, next to Calamity Jane, whose tombstone has a Jack Daniels bottle permanently attached to it.
We went to the grizzly bear discovery center, and while we were waiting for the bears to emerge, we saw a zookeeper in khakis, in his natural habitat.
“Notice how he follows his animal instinct and wears socks underneath his crocs,” we said quietly to the tourists next to us. “Look at how he prowls as he trips over that log, losing his sunglasses and placing himself in a precarious position as the ravens circle.”
The tourists slowly moved away from us.
There was a sign at the front of the visitor center: “Save food for the bears: Children 5-8.”
We could only imagine that it meant we should save food to feed the bears, and they preferred children ages 5-8. The lady at the desk corrected us and told us it was a safety class for children 5-8. But we just laughed and said, “Where do we pick up our kid to feed to the bears?”
With a blank expression, she handed us our tickets.
We returned home from our trip just in time to watch the first Democratic presidential debates, and I realized our political world isn’t so different from the Old West. So, here are the top 10 ways the Deadwood of the Old West Dakota Territory is like politics today:
1. Spontaneous gunfights broke out in Deadwood, while spontaneous Español broke out in the first democratic debates.
2. In Deadwood, Americans trespassed on Lakota territory, while in the debates, Bill de Blasio trespassed on other candidates’ answers.
3. Within a year of the discovery of gold, Deadwood’s population exploded to roughly 5,000, while within a six-month period this year, the democratic candidates for 2020 exploded to roughly 5,000.
4. In Deadwood, it was safest to keep your back against a wall, while in politics, it’s safer not to enter.
5. Deadwood was known for its lawlessness, while the White House is known for its... um... large white pillars.
6. Today’s politicians spoon-feed us their policy ideas, while vendors on the streets of Deadwood handed out free commodes.
7. The wolves routinely circle around the weakest prey, waiting to pounce, while the same thing happened in the Old West.
8. In the Old West, bearing arms on the frontier was sometimes a highly regulated business, and towns like Deadwood, Tombstone and Dodge required you to check your guns in with the sheriff as you entered. Today... well... I’m slowly backing away from this sentence. Nothing to see here.
9. Also, did you know that due to a lack of “facilities,” the streets of Deadwood were paved with stuff that definitely wasn’t gold? Or even mud? This is not a comparison. Simply a fun fact. #themoreyouknow
10. And finally, the Old West was filled with tall tales, propagated by writers like Deadwood Dick. Conversely, today, politicians never lie. Phew.
Good luck to you all getting through the next year and a half. I know I’m going to need it.
*gets ready for election season*

Fact-checking Night 2 of the 2020 Democratic debates

Texto completo: Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.
KAMALA HARRIS
and JOE BIDEN
HARRIS : "Vice President Biden, do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America, then?"
BIDEN : "I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That's what I opposed."
That's hairsplitting by Biden
Biden is claiming that he only opposed the US Education Department's push for busing to desegregate schools because he didn't want federal mandates forced on local school boards. But in the early and mid-1970s, those were the fault lines in almost every US community, from New Orleans to Boston, where there was stiff opposition to busing. If you were a politician opposing federally enforced busing, you were enabling any local school board or city government that was fighting against it. As a senator in the late 1970s, Biden supported several measures, including one signed by President Jimmy Carter, that restricted the federal government's role in forced busing.
BERNIE SANDERS
"Eighty-three percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent"
That statistic is not close to true now.
The Vermont senator is referring to 2027, not the present day. He didn't include that critical context in his statement. His figures come from an analysis by the Tax Policy Center . That analysis found that in 2027 the top 1% of earners would get 83% of the savings from the tax overhaul signed into law by President Donald Trump. Why is that? Simple: Most of the tax cuts for individuals are set to expire after 2025, so the benefits for everyone else simply go away. The 2017 tax overhaul does disproportionately favor the wealthy and corporations, but just 20.5% of the benefits went to the top 1% last year.
SENATOR MICHAEL BENNET
“Bernie mentioned the taxes that we would have to pay. Because of those taxes, Vermont rejected Medicare for all."
Mostly true.
Vermont enacted a law in 2011 to establish something close to a single-payer health care system. The plan was not rejected by voters or the legislature, but it was abandoned in 2014 by then-governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat. He blamed the “enormous" new taxes the plan would have required, including an 11.5 percent payroll tax on all Vermont businesses and a sliding-scale income tax of up to 9.5 percent. In all, he said, the plan would require about $2.5 billion in taxes annually, in a state that raises only about $2.7 billion in taxes annually. “These are simply not tax rates that I can responsibly support or urge the Legislature to pass," Shumlin said at the time.
ANDREW YANG
“We automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs due to automation."
This is disputed.
Yang's figure likely comes from a 2015 study from Ball State University. It estimated that the United States lost 5.6 million manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, about 4.9 million of which were due to increases in productivity. Other research, however, shows other factors were in play. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has contended that trade is the main culprit. A 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics brief cited competition with China, a skills mismatch between employers and workers, and a decline in cross-regional migration.

Texto completo: Among the 24-strong 2020 Democratic primary brawl, self-help author and activist Marianne Williamson has branded herself a lover of peace.
“We have to fall in love again with what this country can mean,” Williamson said in her campaign announcement video. “We need to embrace it, we need to devote ourselves to it, and then bequeath to our children as other generations have done to us.”
The Houston native is the co-founder of the Peace Alliance, an organization dedicated to restoring peace to national discourse and foreign policy. The alliance’s most recent campaign, the creation of a U.S. Department of Peacebuilding, would promote and teach nonviolent alternatives to war.
Williamson, 66, has made this the cornerstone of her campaign, advocating for the creation of a Department of Peace “as the first step in dismantling our systemically entrenched perpetuation of violence.”
Williamson, a practicing Jew, experienced a spiritual awakening after reading A Course in Miracles, a three-volume work that teaches acceptance of God’s plan as the key to achieve miracles and happiness. She cites this spiritual awakening as a moment of clarity that allowed her 20-something self to turn her life around.
After this pivotal moment, she sought to provide others with the same experience. Williamson began writing. In 1992, she published her first book, A Return to Love, and shot to stardom. Oprah Winfrey featured the New York Times best-seller on her show and heavily endorsed the book. Williamson has been called Winfrey’s “spiritual adviser.”
At the onset of the AIDS crisis, Williamson served as a counselor for HIV patients. In 1989, she founded Project Angel Food, a meals-on-wheels type program that serves AIDS patients in the Los Angeles area.
In 2014, the Los Angeles resident ran as an independent for California’s 33rd congressional seat. Though her bid was unsuccessful, she was endorsed by Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, former representative Dennis Kucinich, and celebrities, including Kim Kardashian.
The self-help guru, who raised 29-year-old daughter India on her own, recently came under fire after she called vaccine mandates “draconian” and "Orwellian.” She likened mandatory vaccinations to the abortion debate, saying “the U.S. government doesn’t tell any citizen, in my book, what they have to do with their body or child.”
She later apologized for her comments, noting how important vaccines are to public health and reiterating her skepticism of Big Pharma propaganda.
Williamson also took flak for joining the growing chorus of Democrats likening U.S. immigration facilities to concentration camps during the Holocaust. She told Vice that Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids deport immigrants “to places so dangerous that it actually is no different” than the Holocaust.

Texto completo: First it was Amazon’s “Good Omens.” (So dark but funny! So English! So addictive.)
Then, Netflix’s “Dead to Me.” (I can’t even. You’ve just got to watch it. Like, yesterday.)
And now we’re days away from Netflix’s third season of “Stranger Things” (Hot sheriff! Monsters! The upside down!) and Bag Lady is going for a previously unfathomable binge-watching trifecta.
Since that’s a lot of time to commit to the couch in a matter of weeks, it only seemed fitting this week to shop for binge-able snacks that won’t leave me, or you, a helpless blob at the end of all that excellent viewing.
Bottom’s up!
<img class="size-full wp-image-6781904" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/06/Beet-puffs.jpg?resize=194%2C259&ssl=1" alt="" width="194" height="259" data-recalc-dims="1" />
• Vegan Rob’s beet, Brussels sprout or cauliflower puffs, 3.5 oz, Axis Natural Foods, $3.25
I know, I know. But before you what-the-heck or blech , 138 customers on Amazon have collectively given these cheese-puff-replacements 4.3 out of 5 stars! They’ve left reviews like, “Deeeeelicous!!!!” and “life changing” and “not gross.”

“Not gross” will forever more be among the highest of compliments.
• Stacey’s cinnamon sugar pita chips, 1 oz., Hannaford, $3.49
These are so good and just as sweet and crispy as you’d imagine. Don’t attempt to share a bag. It won’t end pretty.
• Whole Cuts potato snacks, lightly salted or sea salt and vinegar, 4 oz., Hannaford, $1.99
According to the packaging, these are made from russet potatoes, cut in a French fry fashion but “crunch like a chip.” Are they potato sticks 2.0? Maybe, but that doesn’t sound like such a bad thing.
• Alternative Baking Co. vegan cookies, 4.25 oz, Axis, $2.15
Sizable cookies in flavors like snicker doodle and chocolate chip that are also dairy, egg and hydrogenated oil-free. They had me at sizable.

• Green seedless grapes, Blackie’s Farm Fresh Produce, $1.49/pound
A nice cookie palate cleanser.

• Seneca caramel apple chips, 2.5 oz., Blackie’s, $1.79
Sure, you could eat an actual apple, but when 455 customers have also given this 4.3 out of 5 stars AND there’s caramel involved, there’s no contest.
• Plum tomatoes, Blackie’s, $15 for 25 pounds
Make a giant batch of salsa! Have me over! We’ll have the most spoilery talk! Everybody wins.

Best find: Jolly Time’s The Big Cheez ultimate cheddar popcorn, three microwavable bags, Hannaford, $1.99
Sure, we can debate the merits of “cheez,” but this could be the perfect sweet spot between beet puffs and Drake’s Fudge Dipped Devil Dogs which OMG I want to try, but I also want to live a few more decades?
Think twice: About passing up “Dead to Me.”
It starts with a violent hit-and-run and in a slow, “Twin Peaks”-ian way, unravels to reveal more and more of the story with characters you want to hug, slap, feel for and laugh with.
I believe the New York Times declared it, “Not gross.”

Want to save more in your 401(k) retirement plan? Ditch these stock market myths

Texto completo: Making investment decisions based on seasonal proverbs could squash your 401(k) retirement savings.
U. S. stocks dropped more than 6% last month – their worst May since 2010 and second-worst since 1962. That sour four-week stretch seemed to prove the old adage, “Sell in May and go away. ”
But don’t let coincidence fool you. Markets don’t heed calendars.
Seasonal myths like “Sell in May and go away” have lingered for eons. Bedfellows include “The January effect,” which argues January’s returns (or its first few days) predict the year. Then comes the "Santa Claus rally," which 2018 disproved, and “financial hurricane season” – which supposedly means awful September and/or October returns. All of these proverbs work occasionally. None work often enough to help you.
Sell in May at least started with logic. Its original name – sell in May and go away until St. Leger Day – came from U. K. stockbrokers traditionally taking summers off until a famous September horse race (the St. Leger Stakes). The reduced liquidity supposedly brought sharper swings and weaker returns. Avoiding the summer months dodged this problem.
But decades of stock returns destroyed this logic. Modern sell-in-May thinking argues that avoiding the six months from April 30 to Halloween spells success. Yes, stocks’ average returns over that period – 4. 2% since 1925 – trails returns from Halloween through April 30, which are 7. 4%. But 4. 2% isn’t negative. If you want the stock market's 9. 9% annualized return, you need those spring and summer months along with autumn and winter. Otherwise, your return will be lower and reaching your retirement goal harder.
Seasonal adages “work” just often enough to sustain their myths. January predicted full-year returns in 65 of 92 years – a 70. 6% success rate. April 30- Oct. 31 was negative 28. 3% of the time. September stunk 47. 8% of the time, while October sank 39. 1% of years. The Santa Claus rally paid off an amazingly high 78. 3% of years.
Calendars didn’t drive any of these past returns. Consider January. Stocks are positive on a yearly and monthly basis more often than not, making it logical that good Januarys would happen in "up" years. And the bad? It's normal for a "down" January to occur during a bear market. That's a coincidence, not causality.
And what happens when seasonal myths overlap? While the six-month “sell in May” stretch is lackluster, July is the calendar’s best month. So if you sell in June, you’ve sold too soon! Do you sell in August to avoid “financial hurricane season” in September and October, then buy in November? September’s average – a negative 0. 6% return – might seem to support that. But that is dragged down by a handful of awful Septembers in the 1930s and 2008. Is it wise to stake your retirement on a few outliers? Or is it better to remember September and October are both positive more often than not?
Short-term timing your 401(k) generally puts your retirement savings at risk, especially if you invest based on calendar trivia. What happens if you sell after a down May, like in 2019, but the rest of the year is fine? That happened in 2010, when U. S. stocks fell 8% in May, then went on to climb 16. 8% from May’s end through Dec. 31.
So ignore seasonality. Always think long term. Your 401(k) needs to provide for your lifetime.

Texto completo: Jenny Slate may be a movie star, acting in big-budget films like “Venom" and most recently voicing a character in “The Secret Life of Pets 2." But one person who wasn't familiar with her work was Gwen Lynch , the lone student at a commencement speech the Milton native gave earlier this month.
Slate stopped by “Late Night With Seth Meyers " on Tuesday to talk about the speech she gave for Lynch, the sole graduate of Cuttyhunk Elementary School, which is located on Cuttyhunk Island, a speck of land 12 miles south of New Bedford with a year-round population of about 10 people. Slate told Meyers that she found out in The New York Times that Lynch had some other requests for commencement speakers who ranked a bit above her.
“I heard from the Times that she wanted Michelle Obama , and they were like, 'Well no, you can't have that. She's busy,' " Slate said. “And she was like, 'OK, got it, I want Oprah .' And they were like, 'Yeah, she can't come here. There's like, two ferries a day. She's too busy.' "
Slate said that Lynch didn't know who she was before the actress was announced as the commencement speaker, but the two got to know each other on a walk around the island beforehand.
“We took a walk and I got to know her, and she's wonderful," Slate said. “And also the main fact is that she lives on an island and goes to school by herself, and still has more friends than I had as a teenager."
Meyers and Slate also had a little fun at the expense of the Vineyard Gazette, joking that Slate's commencement speech qualified as major news for the island publication, and discussing Meyers's own personal experience with the newspaper.
“My father-in-law had a pet goat that died and it got an obituary longer than a president's," Meyers said. “They interviewed other people, like, 'What'd you think of Raisin?' 'Well, you know, he was like most goats, but I guess we'll miss him.' "

Texto completo: What's Streaming
ANIMA Stream on Netflix. The director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a break from his collaborations with the Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood here, but he doesn't stray far. In this short film, Anderson works instead with the Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke. The film is set to music by Yorke, stars Yorke and is being released alongside Yorke's new solo album of the same name. The teaser trailer for the film offered little indication of what it's actually about, which is both in keeping with the Radiohead frontman's enigmatic tendencies and catnip for fans.
LAURENCE ANYWAYS (2013) Stream on Amazon, Kanopy and Tubi; Rent on Amazon. Xavier Dolan was in his mid-20s and already well-respected when he debuted this transgender melodrama, his third feature as a writer-director. The film covers the male-to-female transition of Laurence (Melvil Poupaud), a novelist, and the relationship between Laurence and Frédérique (Suzanne Clément), Laurence's girlfriend. That transformation of person and relationship brings deep performances, particularly from Clément. "It's a searing, utterly convincing performance that gradually eclipses that of a co-star whose personality blurs alongside his transitioning appearance," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The New York Times. Catsoulis called the film "a big, beautiful, rambling immersion in a passion whose heat is fueled primarily by its impossibility."
THE MAN WHO KILLED DON QUIXOTE (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "I don't like reasonable people telling me to be reasonable," Terry Gilliam said in an interview with The Times earlier this year. That attitude yielded the existence of this Cervantes adaptation, a longtime passion project of Gilliam's. The famously troubled road to the film's release stretched out over three decades, and included an attempt to shoot it in 2000, with the French actor Jean Rochefort and Johnny Depp playing the leads. (Neither appear in the final film, but that period is covered in "Lost in La Mancha," a 2003 documentary about the movie.) The version that was ultimately released instead stars Jonathan Pryce and Adam Driver. "Surely a movie so long in gestation, inspired by a doorstop-thick novel that has beguiled and baffled readers for several centuries, would turn out to be either a world-class catastrophe or a world-historical masterpiece," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "With a mixture of relief and regret, I must report that the movie is neither."
What's on TV
THE STORY OF G.I. JOE (1945) 10 p.m. on TCM. This movie was considered a pinnacle of realistic war films when it came out in the waning days of World War II. That's largely thanks to the fact that it was based on the writings of the Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle, whose articles reflected the experiences of front line soldiers. The movie was nominated for four Academy Awards, but Pyle didn't know that -- he was killed before its release, while covering the Battle of Okinawa.

We spoke with Neff about the palate of Lancaster County, Hunger-n-Thirst's various themed food events and what he is drinking on his own time.
Hunger-N-Thirst just celebrated six years in business. How has it been thus far?
It’s been great. The surrounding community has changed drastically in six years. The saturation point for restaurants is pretty ridiculous at this point. Food-wise, it’s been pretty great, because I’ve had the same chef, Wilson Lopez, for over five years. So, we’ve been able to work on tons of different things together. His background is Culinary Institute of America, working in hotels in New York City in the ‘90s, he was cutting his teeth before he moved to Lancaster.
You mentioned a saturation point of restaurants in Lancaster. How do you keep Hunger-n-Thirst different on a regular basis?
To me, it’s about attention to detail and quality. Just being intuitive and listening to the customer base. We change everything, too. Everything is fresh and changed seasonally. Our craft beer list changes on a weekly basis, nothing just stays on there, ever. We also do a lot of research on the industry. That’s a big part of these food events; when we do this stuff, it’s usually things that are trending somewhere in the industry. For example, last summer, we did a sake and food flight paring. We try to do that stuff on a year-round basis to keep it both interesting for ourselves and to give people something different to try.
What was the idea behind your “Food for the Soul” series?
We just thought it was really fun to look at specific areas in the world and see what they eat for comfort food. You want that euphoric reaction to food that’s very familiar and comforting. It’s something that we’re planning on doing once a month, picking a different city or region and making their soul food, essentially. Right now, we’re going month to month to figure out what the themes will be so we don’t go too far over people’s heads and palates. Some things will catch you off guard with how popular they are, and with others, it’s like, “Wow, nobody wanted this” [laughs]. It goes both ways. Like, when we did the Jamaican curry, that one wasn’t that popular. Chef makes an amazing yellow curry, Jamaican-style with jerk chicken and I was surprised that wasn’t a little more popular.
What’s the process for choosing these different themed food events?
It’s a lot of reading, and a lot of eating [laughs]. I really do love to eat. Before my wife and I moved back here to open up Hunger-n-Thirst, we were in New York for 10 years, and we lived in Queens. That borough is, bar none, the best food place on the East Coast, and maybe even the country. It’s just so diverse. You can walk six to eight blocks and be in a whole other country, food-wise. There’s lots of great little mom-and-pop restaurants. They’re not necessarily in the New York Times – well, some of them are. Living there, we got exposed to so many different kinds of food. So, a lot of times when I’m doing these events, I try to focus on different types of regional cuisines. We look at what’s traditional and try to put our own twist on it and make it a cultural experience.
Not to pick favorites, but have you had a certain food event thus far that has more or less lined up with your specific palate?
Oh, jeez. For me, when I’m cooking at home, I’m cooking mostly Asian food. So, when we do the Asian food events, I’m a little partial to them. But also, I love Mexican food, so the mezcal event we did last summer was phenomenal. There’s some things we haven’t done because we’re…a little trepidatious about certain cuisines with the local palate, because we really like spicy food. Some people are a little afraid of the heat.
Are there certain food nights that you haven’t been able to do, whether it’s because of the local palate as you say, or maybe something as small as not being able to get certain ingredients here?
It’s mostly the palate thing; in the 21st century, you can get almost anything shipped to you if you work hard enough [laughs]. Some things you’d definitely want to be fresher than others, though. We grow a lot of stuff here - like, I have a lime tree and lemongrass. The only ingredient we wanted to use one time that ended up being entirely too difficult was agave. We were doing a Oaxacan night, and one dish required agave leaves. The problem was that we would have had to buy them by the flat, so we did banana leaves instead.
Hunger-N-Thirst has hundreds of beers that change out weekly. What is the process like for choosing which beers make it onto shelves?
I’ve always handled all the beer ordering because I’m sort of a nerd for it. In the last few years, Jeremy Barr, who works in the bottle shop, has started to take on some of that responsibility. He’s a really good home brewer and has a lot of strong opinions; he’s really knowledgeable. A lot of it is research compiled over the last 10 years. Some of the industry changes, but some doesn’t. With European brewers, that stuff doesn’t change, it’s tradition. A lot of the import stuff is the same, the problem is just getting some of it because of the low quantities.
As far as beer goes, what are you currently drinking after work or on a night off?
I’ve been really into ciders recently, that’s a new thing for me. I’ve been really enjoying stuff from Adams County, like Ploughman and Big Hill. For beer, it’s Belgians for the most part. I really like saisons, trippels and German lagers. So good in the summer, especially.
How would you describe the Lancaster palate for food and drink?
Culturally, there’s more of a German background. It’s much more of a steak and potatoes kind of diet. Salt, pepper, saffron, some basic spices. That’s the majority of people, but obviously, that’s not everyone. Going to McCaskey, we had tons of friends from Puerto Rico and we’d go to their houses and eat all the time. I’d say Puerto Rican food is definitely part of the local cultural cuisine at this point. For beer, it’s actually changed quite a bit over the last six years. Beer has become so popular now that its shifted away from the meat and potatoes mindset. Lately, the hazy IPAs have taken over like crazy at this point.
Since you see it every day, is there a particular reason for that? Is it just a trend or fad, or is it just what’s popular now?
It’s hard to say. Culturally speaking, for the whole United States, it’s a lot of different trends lining up. A lot of it has to do with people finally starting to can beers again. It kind of became this kitschy nostalgia beer thing with cans. I’d say beer traders have a lot to do with it, as well. There’s value for people with rare beers, and that’s crept into the mainstream now, which is interesting. When I was first starting, that was a very small thing, and now there’s whole Facebook pages dedicated to trading beer all the time. Hoppy beers have always been popular in the U.S., though. I feel like the beginning of the craft beer movement was when Sierra Nevada took off in the ‘90s, and pale ale was really hoppy for beers at that time. There’s been so many things over time that sort of led to where we are now.
Keep up with Hunger-n-Thirst's busy events calendar here, and check the hazy IPA takeover tonight, June 27, at 5 p.m.

Texto completo: When Robert Simonson shifted from theater journalist to cocktail writer around 2006, it felt like a major move.
"I thought I was doing something completely different that had nothing to do with theater," said Simonson, 54, a Milwaukee native. "It was years before I realized some of the parallels, the theatricality, the bar as the stage, the bartenders as actors."
Simonson felt that connection keenly earlier this month at the Door Kinetic Arts Festival in Door County, where he hosted his second annual cocktail competition. It was held this time at Hatch Distillery in Egg Harbor, and a barista (Ryan Castelaz, from discourse: a liquid workshop in Sister Bay) took the top spot.
For more than a decade, Simonson's has been the most prominent voice for Wisconsin's cocktail culture, not to mention the cocktail boom everywhere else.
Born in Milwaukee and raised in Eagle, Simonson moved to Brooklyn in 1988. Since 2006 he has covered the rebirth of classic cocktails in publications like the New York Times, Saveur, Imbibe and Punch, where he writes the Bar Review column.
His first cocktail book, "The Old-Fashioned" (Ten Speed Press, 2014), includes a recipe from The Old Fashioned in Madison. ("Korbel is important if you want to drink authentically," he writes). He's written books about three-ingredient cocktails and a history of the craft cocktail movement, "A Proper Drink" (Ten Speed Press, 2016). "The Martini Cocktail" is forthcoming from Ten Speed this September.
The Cap Times caught up with Simonson in Baileys Harbor:
Cap Times: Food trends are so global. Do you see more regionalism in cocktail culture?
Robert Simonson: Globalization has been a good thing in many ways. It used to be you couldn't get a Sazerac anywhere but in New Orleans and now you can get them everywhere. That's a good thing. That's a beautiful drink.
I get happy when I go to a place and find out about a drink they drink there. Wisconsin's always been very rich in this area, which is one of the reasons I like it so much.
We drink so many things here that are not drunk anywhere else, not just brandy old-fashioneds and brandy Manhattans. Tom and Jerry (similar to egg nog) continues to live on here, you see that during the winter.
There's Nelson's Hall on Washington Island where they have the bitters club and people drink shots of angostura. The bloody marys with the crazy garnishes, that's a thing that is native to here. The idea that when you order a bloody mary there's a little pony of beer on the side, that's Wisconsin.
After 13 years of covering the cocktail resurgence, what trends do you see now?
Drink trends used to come pretty fast and furious. There was a new one every month, it seemed. That's because bartenders were rediscovering their past and rediscovering their ingredients. Now they've cycled through all that stuff.
I see three big trends from the last three years. One is low ABV cocktails. People who got all on board with cocktails and loved it suddenly realized, "Gosh, I can only drink a few of these. How about something that's a little lighter?" There's a history of spritzes from Italy and vermouth-based cocktails.
The second is no-ABV cocktails and mocktails. I thought this was going to come and go. I thought it was a trend where people want to be healthier and want to extend that to cocktails, drink skinny margaritas, stuff like that.
But it's not going away, in fact, it's increasing in popularity. A lot of people want to go to cocktail bars but don't necessarily want to drink that night. They want an option besides ginger ale.
And the third trend?
The third thing is Japanese style bars. Cocktail culture never died in Japan, in Tokyo. They adopted the classic cocktails. They honed them to perfection and worked in a vacuum.
The Japanese style bar has a great attention to decorum, to the details of the drink, dialing in a Manhattan or daiquiri until they feel it's perfect. Presentation, all the details, the napkins, the silverware, the greeting, the way you present the cocktail to the customer it's a different sort of feel.
Drinking culture has a dark side. Have you addressed that in your work?
For so many people drinking means getting drunk, but that's never how I looked at it. There's a way to drink that involves adult behavior, adult conversation, adult pleasures. This, too, can be drinking. I still have to convince my family of this kind of thing.
I was once invited by a priest to give a speech at the University of Notre Dame to graduating seniors about how drinking was a privilege and a responsibility. You go about it with the same sense of ethics and morality that you would any other part of your life. I was not telling them, "Don't drink," but "Drink correctly." Be an adult. Don't be a child.
Certainly you can not drink. That's a healthy choice and you'll be just fine. I think you're denying yourself a distinct pleasure.
You're at the cocktail bar in heaven. What's your order?
I used to say the old-fashioned, because it was my favorite drink. Because of the martini book I've been drinking a lot of martinis and I've come to really appreciate them. I'd probably pick a martini at this point. I picture heaven as being very silvery and white and a martini is going to look great up there. CREDIT: By Lindsay Christians - The Capital Times

Texto completo: The National Rifle Association’s second-in-command Chris Cox has reportedly resigned after a lawsuit alleged he was part of former NRA President Oliver North’s effort to oust chief executive Wayne LaPierre.
Cox resigned from the powerful gun rights organization Wednesday, just days after details of the lawsuit were brought to light, according to a reporter for the New York Times.
The lawsuit, filed last week, alleges that text messages and emails found that “another errant NRA fiduciary, Chris Cox — once thought by some to be a likely successor for Mr. LaPierre — participated” in what the gun-advocacy group described as a conspiracy.
The 49-year-old Cox has worked with the NRA since 1995 and has led its lobbying efforts since 2002. He is a well-known figure within the 5-million-member association. Cox had previously denied the allegations.
“The allegations against me are offensive and patently false. For over 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization,” Cox said. “My efforts have always been focused on serving the members of the National Rifle Association, and I will continue to focus all of my energy on carrying out our core mission of defending the Second Amendment.”
LaPierre, who has served as CEO since 1991, accused North in April of threatening to blackmail him.

Drag Queen Story Hour prevails at UNF

Texto completo: While some drag queens spend their time reading other queens -- a term used in LGBTQ culture to describe publicly calling out a person's flaw and caricaturing it -- Beatrice Palmer spent her day Tuesday actually reading to children.

Just a day after the Jacksonville Public Library announced its cancellation of a pride event geared toward teenagers, citing security reasons, the University of North Florida's Thomas G. Carpenter Library hosted Drag Queen Story Hour with Palmer front and center.

Palmer, who goes by the stage name Bebe Deluxe, is a 20-year Jacksonville resident and well known drag queen. She sat in front of a group of about 65, dressed in a neon green beret to match her neon green, angled bob, a black and white striped and checkered three-piece outfit and mile-long lashes.

"LGBTQ people deserve to have spaces where they can gather and be themselves," said Mandi Barringer, assistant professor of sociology. "We decided Beatrice would be the perfect person to do this because she's helped so many people feel affirmed in her community as a leader."

The crowd was comprised of a mix of toddlers, parents, UNF students and faculty members.

Kaitlin Legg, the school's LGBT Resource Center director, said it was the first of its kind on campus, but definitely not the last.

"Now that we see the community sees a need for it, we'll definitely be doing it again," Legg said.

During the storybook hour, Palmer presented lessons to the group on being nice and respectful to others and LGBTQ acceptance. She also presented a puppet show featuring the "Mind ya business monster," which knocked over characters who asked invasive, inappropriate or rude questions instead of minding their business.

"One day it was hot in the south and two girls, who were minding their business wearing their bathing suits as tops tucked into their denim shorts, because it was very hot," Palmer said. "That's when a man appeared. He said somebody might get the wrong idea from their outfits and before he knew it, out came our good friend the monster saying ‘mind your business!' I think he fell off a cliff and died."

Ashley Goswami attended the story hour with her 5-month-old, Zuri.

"I went to a Bebe Deluxe show with my sister last year and we still laugh about it once a week," Goswami said. "I just thought it would be a neat activity to support. You're never too young to learn about inclusion and love. She [Zuri] will get bigger and bigger and keep coming back."

The room was full of cackling laughter, balloons and rainbow streamers.

This wasn't the first Drag Queen Story Hour. The concept was born about four years ago as a lighthearted way to teach children about gender identity and inclusion. The story hours happen all over the country, with about 13 others scheduled this week in Pennsylvania, New York, New Hampshire and Georgia.

"We had already been seeing story hours across the country and thought it was just such a great concept about the expansiveness of gender," Legg said. "Our incoming college students are increasingly identifying as LGBTQ. UNF is making sure they're getting the resources they need to be successful. The opportunity to bring resources to the library was the primary motivation."

It wasn't Jacksonville's first story hour, either. Last month, Cultivate Jax, a hyper-local plant and home goods store in Riverside held a story hour with Palmer as the host. Though the event itself was successful, it was also met with protests across the street.

On May 19, people lined Park Street holding signs and banners that said things like "Dear God: let not the children be perverted by drag queen story hours!" and "Don't drag our children's innocence in the mud."

Drag Queen Story Hours being met with backlash has become a national trend. According to The New York Times, in conservative towns including Cookeville, Tenn., organizers were met with protests, harassment and death threats.

"I guess the backlash is growing because it is getting more popular," co-founder of Drag Queen Story Hour Jonathan Hamilt told the Times.

At UNF, Drag Queen Story Hour was met with one visible protester -- Raymond Johnson.

Johnson, the founder of Biblical Concepts Ministries in Jacksonville who is often protesting local LGBTQ community events, attended the event and live-streamed portions of it to his personal Facebook page.

"I was definitely prepared for somebody to see me and recognize me, pitch a fit and make a scene, but that didn't happen," Johnson told the Times-Union. Organizers said the event was open to the public and police officers were in the crowd in case things got heated.

Johnson said he attended the event to monitor it and show the general public what was going on.

"I think it's absolutely inappropriate for a public place," Johnson said of the event. "Even for UNF to bring children, 12 and under ... this was recruiting young children, brainwashing them that it's OK to be gay, OK to be drag, you can choose whatever you want to be, help [drag queens] in the future, give them money, promote them. To teach children that this explicit lifestyle is OK is a disaster."

Earlier this week, Johnson encouraged people via email to contact city officials and demand the cancellation of Pride Prom, an inclusive event for teenagers that Palmer was scheduled to emcee on Friday. his followed a post from Elizabeth Johnston, a popular blogger who goes by the alias, "The Activist Mommy."

Palmer didn't let the child-friendly setting keep her from throwing punches at Johnston.

During her puppet show, she introduced "an ugly little bulldog called The Activist Mommy Blog," inciting laughter from the crowd.

Jokes aside, Palmer talked to the room of parents about raising their children in an environment where they don't feel targeted or bullied for being different.

"These kids don't have to worry about orientation yet. They don't have to think about that," she said. "But when they get there, they'll be in a society where they don't have to worry about it."

Palmer then addressed the children directly.

"You have so much opportunity ahead of you. You can do anything," she said. "Don't let anybody let you believe you can't be a certain way they're showing signs of. My parents knew at 2-years-old that for the rest of my life I'd be trying on women's clothes."

When one mom asked Palmer what adult allies can do to make drag queens' and other members of the LGBTQ community's lives easier, she suggested talking to family members, escorting kids to prom, escorting drag queens to a show and donating money when possible.

"Most queens in this town will get paid $50 a night," she said. "My show, I make $100 a night. We're not rolling in dough." Palmer also added that a lot of her appearances are free.

Palmer also suggested asking people what their preferred pronouns are and getting in the habit of addressing people with they/them pronouns before getting clarification so as to not misgender someone accidentally.

Following Pride Prom's cancellation, Palmer said Tuesday was exactly what she needed. "It was so refreshing to see that there are proud institutions that have my back," she said. "I feel like it was wonderful to see this many adults concerned about the right thing to do. It's truly delightful."

As for the haters, Palmer isn't phased.

"Little mad man came in to film," she said about Johnson. "He even laughed at one of my jokes."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- One of the biggest selling points of Facebook's ambitious plans for its new cryptocurrency, Libra, was that the social media company had 27 partners, including prominent outfits like Visa, Mastercard and Uber, helping out on the project.
But some of those partners are approaching Libra warily. They signed nonbinding agreements to join the effort partly because they knew they weren't obliged to use or promote the digital token and could easily back out if they didn't like where it was going, said executives at seven of those companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.
The doubts among Facebook's partners add to a growing list of challenges for Libra, a new digital token that Facebook executives hope will one day become the foundation for a new kind of online financial industry.
Companies are hesitant to associate themselves too closely with the Libra project because of Facebook's issues with regulators around the world, the company's shaky track record on privacy and how it treats corporate partners, and the uncertain legality of cryptocurrencies.
Though it was announced just a week ago, the Libra effort has already drawn scrutiny in Washington. Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee and a Democrat from California, quickly scheduled hearings to examine Libra and told Facebook to stop development of the project until big questions are answered.
The House hearing is set for July 17. The Senate is expected to hold a hearing on the same issue the day before.
Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Tuesday that the central bank would be looking at Libra "very carefully" given its potential scale. "I think that our expectations from a consumer protection standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint, are going to be very, very high," Mr. Powell said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
European regulators have also asked for more details about the project.
Facebook said the 27 partners that it announced last week were giving at least $ 10 million and joining an association that would govern the Libra cryptocurrency, which is set to be introduced next year.
But no money has changed hands so far. A number of partners said they would decide whether to join the association and make the payment after there is more clarity on how Libra will work, the executives from the seven companies said.
A Facebook spokeswoman, Elka Looks, said in a statement that the company plans "to engage in healthy dialogue and debate with our fellow founding members, and to welcoming additional members over the coming months."
"We know this will take time and it won't be easy, but together we will be able to make the Libra mission a reality," Ms. Looks said.
A spokesman for the Libra Association, Dante Disparte, said that since the announcement last week, the association has heard from a flood of companies interested in being members. He said the association, which will manage Libra, will most likely have a waiting list for those wanting to be among the 100 initial members it hopes to start with next year.
Facebook had hoped its partners could help Libra handle some of the critics and give the project some distance from the social networking giant and its recent legal problems. But even before the project began, potential partners has their own concerns.
Facebook approached a number of big financial companies, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Fidelity, about participating in the project, according to two people briefed on the discussions. The financial companies declined to join, in part because of regulatory questions about cryptocurrencies, the people said.
Press officers for the banks all declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Fidelity said the company was continuing to monitor the project.
Facebook did manage to sign up two big credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard, as partners. But Mastercard was one of the last companies to commit, according to documents shared with other partners that were described to The New York Times.
When Libra was announced, Mastercard released a statement from one of its executives expressing support for the initiative. But the statement did not mention Libra by name, and it described the effort as one of many partnerships that Mastercard has joined.
"By activating partnerships to explore, cocreate, and test new ideas, we can cultivate ideas to make inclusion a reality sooner than some may think," said Jorn Lambert, Mastercard's executive vice president for digital solutions, in the statement.
Mastercard was one of several partners that avoided voicing full-throated support for Libra after it was unveiled. Some other partners declined Facebook's requests to put out news releases and speak with media outlets about their support for Libra, four people briefed on the negotiations said.
If Libra succeeds at one of its goals -- reducing the cost of making digital payments -- it could pose a challenge to partners like Mastercard, Visa, Stripe and PayPal. But executives at the payment companies said that rather than staying away from Libra, they wanted to have a role in its creation.
Partners like Uber or Spotify, which could benefit from lower credit card fees, were more enthusiastic.
The largest American cryptocurrency company, Coinbase, was one of Libra's 27 initial partners. But when the partnership was announced internally, several Coinbase employees expressed concern about their company joining forces with a giant company like Facebook with a spotty record on issues that matter to cryptocurrency fans, like privacy, according to two company employees.
A spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment.
Joe Lallouz, the chief executive of Bison Trails, another cryptocurrency company that joined Libra as a partner, said he was also skeptical when Facebook approached him.
"My initial reaction was: 'You don't have the best track record from a data privacy perspective,"' Mr. Lallouz said in an interview after the announcement. "Facebook's reputation around data privacy and being trustworthy is against the crypto ethos."
But Mr. Lallouz said Facebook had shown that it was serious about protecting the privacy of its users, in part by ensuring that it does not have too much control over the project.
Facebook executives said the design of Libra was inspired by the decentralized structure of Bitcoin, with governance given over to the association, in which Facebook will only have one vote out of a potential 100 partners.
"Already, they are relinquishing control and ownership over this, which is huge," said Mr. Lallouz.
The partners are expected to meet in the coming months to write a charter that will govern the association.
Facebook's history with partners has added to their caution. The game-maker Zynga, for example, faced a dramatic loss of revenue after Facebook backed away from a close relationship with the company. Facebook also strained relationships with many publishers last year when it changed the algorithms behind its news feed to de-emphasize news stories.
"This is a huge opportunity, but there are a lot of details that still need to be worked out," Mr. Lallouz said.

Texto completo: The world of recorded music was shaken to its core June 11, when The New York Times Magazine published “The Day The Music Burned,” a story about a devastating fire in the Universal Music Group vaults in 2008.
As journalist Jody Rosen writes, the fire (which had been … let’s call it “downplayed” by Universal) consumed thousands upon thousands of original master recordings by artists such as John Coltrane, Patsy Cline, Tupac Shakur, Beck and Sheryl Crow — a very small sample of big names, in addition to dozens, perhaps hundreds more that remain obscure.
Does this mean the best-known recordings will suddenly vanish from the Earth?
Of course not. Master tapes are the original-source documents of these recordings and often contain unreleased outtakes or studio conversations, but the albums and songs everyone has heard for decades remain documented in other formats.
Does it mean that we might never completely know what music our culture lost, given the amount of unreleased material from various sessions that was on those tapes, or that the fidelity of the recordings we have will not likely improve in the future now that those first-generation tapes are gone?
Absolutely.
The article has sparked a conversation among musicians and fans about the preservation obligations of record companies both large and small. To put it bluntly: Do you, musicians of the world, know where your masters are? We asked a few Austin artists at various stages of their careers if they knew the answer.
Kelly Willis has been making music since she was a teenager and releasing records since 1990 for labels such as MCA and Rykodisc. She and husband Bruce Robison have released albums on their own Premium Records label since 2007.
Willis said she has masters only for the music she and Robison released themselves: “I don’t know who has my others or where they are.”
Monte Warden, whose band the Wagoneers rose to prominence with Willis in the late 1980s when both singers were still in their teens, says that “every one of my A&M masters” was lost in the Universal fire. The Wagoneers made two albums for A&M Records, which later was folded into UMG.
Warden says the band also did a gospel session for A&M that was never released and didn’t get to the final mixing stage. Without the masters, remixing is now impossible. “Rough analog mixes is all we have,” he said.
The news is better for his new recordings, such as an as yet unreleased album he recently completed with his pop-jazz combo, the Dangerous Few. “There are three hard copies of the original masters just here in Austin,” Warden said.
Austin rock outfit White Denim declined to answer the question through its publicist, who did note that the band — which recently formed its own label called Radio Milk Recording Company — is reissuing a vinyl version of its 2010 self-released album, “Last Day of Summer.” It will be remastered from the original recordings, which White Denim always owned. The band plays an album release show Aug. 24 at its own Radio Milk performance space.
Singer Eric Burton and guitarist/producer Adrian Quesada make up Austin soul act Black Pumas. Their self-titled debut is out now on ATO Records, and the masters for it remain in Quesada’s hands.
“We own our masters and I am in control of the physical possession of them, because it was all recorded and mixed at my studio,” Quesada said. “Nowadays, being that everything is stored digitally (in addition to physical master tapes), I feel like it’s a lot easier to keep track of your masters. Even though I record onto analog tape, I do not store analog masters, though I probably should.”
Oddly enough, one of the most chaotic Austin acts has all its masters. King Coffey, drummer for the longtime Austin act Butthole Surfers, which has been recording and touring on and off since 1981, said the band is in possession of all its masters.
“I believe we have everything,” Coffey said. “We have a storage unit that contains a bunch of crap from the 1980s, including several shelves of tapes, including the multi-tracks (the tapes on which the music was actually recorded).
“For almost everything, we have backup copies, so if we sent a master tape to a label for production, we almost always made a safety dupe for ourselves. If that unit burns down, we’re pretty screwed.”
Coffey’s active band, USA/Mexico, recorded entirely on digital. “We have those files, but they can degrade,” Coffey said. “We should be making backups.”
Perhaps in keeping with the Surfers’ overall oddness, the tapes even survived the years the band had no permanent home.
“For the few years we lived on the road, we were carrying a couple of boxes of tapes in the van,” Coffey said. “It’s amazing they survived until we could put them in a safe place.” He credits Surfers guitarist (and longtime producer for other bands) Paul Leary for such care.
“Paul is the man,” Coffey said. “He is an engineer at heart and took all this very seriously.”
Not surprisingly, news came last week of artists taking legal action against Universal in a joint lawsuit that included Soundgarden, Tom Petty’s ex-wife Jane Benyo and native Texan singer-songwriter Steve Earle.
That didn’t surprise Warden. “I’m sure there’s going to be some litigation,” he said before the suit had been filed. “But who cares? That’s just for some payout. This stuff is irreplaceable.”
For her part, Willis refuses to dwell on the past.
“I try not to think too much about it all because it’s a bummer,” Willis said. “Why be sad? You have to live in the moment.”

"When the lawyers saw the 2-year-old boy, he wasn't wearing a diaper and had wet his pants, and his shirt was smeared in mucus. They said at least 15 children at the facility had the flu, and some were kept in medical quarantine. Children told lawyers that they were fed uncooked frozen food or rice and had gone weeks without bathing or a clean change of clothes at the facility in Clint, in the desert scrubland some 25 miles southeast of El Paso. NBC, 6/20/19.
Whosoever shall receive this child in my name, receiveth me; whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me. Mark 9:37.
"[A]n 8-year-old taking care of a very small 4-year-old with matted hair couldn't convince the little one to take a shower. AP, 6/21/19.
Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves? Luke 10:36.
"A 14-year-old girl from Guatemala said she had been holding two little girls in her lap. I need comfort too. I am bigger than they are, but I am a child too,' she said. AP 6/21/19.
Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. Luke 9:58.
"Border Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been held in standing-room only conditions for days or weeks. Office of Inspector General, 5/30/19.
Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. Mark 7:27.
"A 2-year-old boy locked in detention wants to be held all the time. A few girls, ages 10 to 15, say they've been doing their best to feed and soothe the clingy toddler who was handed to them by a guard days ago. New York Times, 6/21/19.
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father. Matthew 18:10.
"The teenage girl with pigtail braids was hunched over in a wheelchair and holding a bunched sweatshirt when an immigrant advocate met her at a crowded Border Patrol facility in Texas. She opened the sweatshirt and the advocate gasped. It was a tiny baby, born premature and held in detention instead of where the advocate believes the baby should have been - at a hospital neonatal unit . . . She said she was not sure how premature the baby was born but described the baby as "minuscule, with a head "the size of my fist or smaller than my fist. AP 6/13/19.
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. Matthew 10:14.
"The girl said border authorities made her throw away a backpack with the baby's clothing and had not given her anything else, so the baby was in a dirty onesie bundled in a sweatshirt that another migrant mother gave her. AP, 6/15/19.
What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep? Matthew 12:11.

"There was no milk, so M.R. gave the babies juice. Newly torn from her father, she found herself caring for a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old at a facility somewhere near the southern border. It was really bad because the babies would cry at night missing their parents,' she said. Miami New Times, 6/20/19.
I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Luke 7:44.
"[C]hildren and pregnant women are sleeping on gravel and being bombarded with pigeon droppings. Texas Monthly, 6/11/19.

5 ways to save money while traveling

Texto completo: I love to travel. I love trying out a new hotel, sleeping in a California king-sized bed and not having to worry about making my bed in the mornings.
The one thing that's always true about traveling is that it costs money. And I'm all about saving money. So, here are my best travel tips to help you keep more of your hard-earned dollars in your pocket:
1. Cheapest days to fly If you're flying, travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays
These are cheapest days to be in the air. If you can arrange your trip and vacation days to accommodate, you'll save money!
2. Avoid baggage fees Don't forget that many airlines will charge you to check a bag, which could cost an extra $50 to $100 round-trip per person. So, factor this in when you're shopping for low fares, or just pack more efficiently into a carry-on.
3. Be wary of travel points Don't open a credit card just for the travel points
Even if you think you're "working the system," and you'll pay if off before it's due, the facts say there's a real chance you won't. One in three Americans are behind on bills. Payments have a tendency to pile up, and they steal more than your paycheck. They steal your joy, too.
4. Look into Airbnb With Airbnb, you can rent someone's whole house, or even just one room in their house, and many times it's a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel. If you're a real go-getter, try reaching out to the owner directly and make them an offer. The worst they can do is say no!
5. First get debt-free Don't take a vacation if you have debt.
I know there's always one reason or another to spend money going somewhere. But if you're in debt, now isn't the time to take elaborate vacations. All your extra money should be going toward building up a starter emergency fund or paying off debt. Trust me, you'll enjoy that beach trip so much more when you have money in the bank, and you paid for it with cash.
For more tips on how to save money traveling, I've got two episodes of The Rachel Cruze Show that will help you: Travel Tips That Will Save You Money and How to Go to Disney World Without Debt.
As a No.1 New York Times best-selling author and host of The Rachel Cruze Show, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. You can follow Cruze on Twitter and Instagram at @RachelCruze and online at rachelcruze.com.

Texto completo: The center of attention for the Nets on Monday morning was 6-11 Nic Claxton, who was drafted with the first pick of the second round and introduced at a news conference along with UCLA point guard Jaylen Hands, who was taken with the No. 56 pick.
But the Nets' draft is an afterthought compared with the maneuverings of general manager Sean Marks as he prepares to plunge into the deep end of the free-agent market when it opens at 6 p.m. Sunday.
By Monday afternoon, the Nets' focus had shifted to another center - free agent DeAndre Jordan, who is a confidant of free-agent power forward Kevin Durant and is well-acquainted with free-agent point guard Kyrie Irving, the two high-end players Marks is trying to recruit.
According to a New York Times report that cited league sources, the Nets are "exploring the feasibility of signing Kevin Durant's close friend DeAndre Jordan" to add to the lure of partnering with Irving on the Nets.
Bleacher Report reported on Monday that Irving recently met twice with Durant and is trying to recruit Jordan and Durant to join him in Brooklyn. All three were teammates on the 2016 U.S. Olympic team that won gold at the Rio Games.
When Marks was asked during the news conference about the importance of adding size to the lineup after the way the Nets were manhandled by 76ers center Joel Embiid in a first-round playoff loss and by other physically dominant centers during the season, he said, "I think adding size is certainly something we'll look at as the summer transpires, but you never know what happens in the future."
If the Nets do land Durant, who will miss the 2019-20 season after rupturing his right Achilles tendon in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, and Irving, Jordan would be a great complementary piece. He's a 6-11, 265-pound space-eater who averaged 11.0 points and 13.1 rebounds with the Mavericks and Knicks last season. But he would have to take far less than the $22.9 million salary he earned.
The Nets have $68.67 million in cap room, according to cap expert Bobby Marks of ESPN, but an NBA source told Newsday that they easily can get to the $70.9 million it would take to sign both Durant and Irving without any major moves, such as a trade.
However, Jordan might have to take the Nets' room exception valued at $4.8 million if he chooses the Nets. They also could re-sign backup center Ed Davis to a two-year deal worth $11 million because they own his Non-Bird Rights.
For much of the season, Durant and Irving seemed ticketed for the Knicks as part of a package deal, but multiple NBA sources told Newsday that Irving is all but signed with the Nets. Durant's future is more uncertain, but the sportsbook at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas now has the Nets listed as -$125 favorites on the money line to land him ahead of the Warriors (+200), Knicks (+500) and Clippers (+800).
This is heady stuff for the Nets, but in the high-end market in which they are shopping, they should get some clarity on which direction everyone is headed within a couple days of the opening of free agency.
If Jordan does wind up signing with the Nets, he could serve as a great mentor for current starter Jarrett Allen and Claxton, but he also might command the lion's share of playing time.
At their introductory news conference, Claxton and Hands simply expressed their excitement to be a part of what the Nets are building. Both will be on the Nets' team in the Las Vegas Summer League, along with Allen, who will be entering his third NBA season.

Texto completo: Pete and Chasten Buttigieg celebrated their first wedding anniversary on Sunday. You know this if you're among Pete's roughly 1.1 million Twitter followers or Chasten's 340,000, because they traded sweetly effusive missives, as they frequently do. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="13667">
Pete gushed: "One year ago I married the love of my life. I'm so thankful I found you, Chasten, and can't wait to spend the rest of our life together." Chasten posted pictures of the two of them with their arms around each other, which he introduced by writing that he was on his way "to find this cute guy on the trail. Can't believe it's been one year."
Two months ago, when they kissed during the event that marked the formal beginning of Pete's presidential campaign, one headline called it a "radical moment." But what has happened since - their daily and sometimes hourly displays of the commitment, respect and brimming sentiment that go into the best romantic partnerships - is more significant and potentially transformative.
They aren't just the first gay couple at the forefront of a presidential race. They're the 2020 campaign's most public love story, one that makes it difficult for even the most resistant Americans to see a same-sex relationship as some frivolous romp, freakish affront or carnal curiosity.
But lately I've found myself wondering: What if Chasten were a 29-year-old straight woman instead of a 29-year-old gay man? What would that say about gender and double standards?
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="13672">
Chasten left his teaching job to support Pete, 37, full-time, alternately keeping him company on the road and tending the home fires, which includes caring for their two dogs, while he's away. On June 17, he acted as Pete's surrogate and replaced him as the speaker at an LGBT gala in New York because Pete, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., rushed back there to deal with a police shooting.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="13674">
Although he went by his original surname, Glezman, when they were wed and immediately thereafter, he's Chasten Buttigieg on Twitter, where much of what he does is cheerlead for his husband.
"Sometimes when he's on the road and I'm missing him," Chasten wrote in one tweet, "I just take a deep breath and watch this to remind myself what we're here for." The accompanying link was to a Buttigieg campaign video. In another tweet, he played the suffering, unglamorous helpmeet. "Peter: Crushing townhalls in SC," he wrote. "Chasten: staring out the window waiting for UberEats."
But if Chasten were a woman of his generation in a heterosexual marriage, how would this behavior play? Mightn't it be picked apart as strangely retro?
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="13678">
And what if Chasten's steadfastly adoring and supporting role were in the service of a woman, not a man? What if Elizabeth Warren's, Kamala Harris' or Amy Klobuchar's husband took this tack? Maybe Democratic voters would embrace that, just as many of them are embracing Chasten. But I suspect that some of them would find it discomfiting in a world where the professional sacrifices in heterosexual marriages are still made most often by women.
Chasten's novel status has liberated him (and Pete) from the unforgiving expectations and harsh judgments about the parts that men and women play. And that freedom, as Joanna Weiss observed recently in Politico Magazine, has allowed "this historic figure, the first same-sex husband of a major-party presidential candidate" to also be "something surprising: the most traditional political spouse in the field."
Although his sexual orientation breaks with presidential-campaign precedent, his emotional orientation hews almost unerringly to it. He is doing what Tipper Gore, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Ann Romney were supposed to: loosen, soften and warm up the images of their spouses, in part by veering away from politics. Chasten's preferred topics are his dogs, Harry Potter and the power of love.
"While the president bullies his enemies and shouts misspelled lies on Twitter, Chasten is over here doubling down on lovable nerd antics and all-around goodwill," wrote R. Eric Thomas in an Elle magazine appreciation of Chasten that underscored his swelling celebrity. "If the relentlessly upbeat potential first spouse ever took a social media break I think I would spiral into a pit of despair that only a glint of light from Michelle Obama's Balenciaga boots could pull me out of."
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="13683">
I look at Chasten - who, with Pete, landed on the cover of Time magazine - and see at once how far gay people have come and how far women still have to go. I see what an imperfect patchwork progress is. To my previous thought experiments, add these: Would he and Pete get the same reception if they were men of color or, for that matter, didn't look so much like they'd just stepped out of the pages of a J. Crew catalog? What if they were a lesbian couple?
But mostly I look at Chasten and see the same man I spent time with in South Bend, Ind., three years ago, when I met and first got to know Pete. Chasten showed up after dinner, in time for a swing by the ice cream parlor. On that night and on subsequent occasions when we shared drinks or conversation, he was quick with a laugh, bubbly, the spontaneous yin to Pete's deliberative yang.
He hasn't forged a new personality for the campaign, hasn't outfitted himself specially for the blazing of trails. That explains his popularity and is a lesson not just for other pioneers but for the rest of us. Let people be true to themselves - no matter how daring, no matter how quaint.

Texto completo: A surge of migrants arriving at the Texas-Mexico border has pushed the country's immigration system to the breaking point as new policies aimed at both undocumented immigrants and legal asylum seekers have contributed to a humanitarian crisis. The Texas Tribune is maintaining its in-depth reporting on this national issue.

*Editor's note: This story was updated Tuesday to include information from a former U.S. Customs and Border Protection advisor about why the agency isn't accepting donations.
On Sunday, Austin Savage and five of his friends huddled into an SUV and went to an El Paso Target, loading up on diapers, wipes, soaps and toys.
About $340 later, the group headed to a Border Patrol facility holding migrant children in nearby Clint with the goal of donating their goods. Savage said he and his friends had read an article from The New York Times detailing chaos, sickness and filth in the overcrowded facility, and they wanted to help.

Federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25/hour since July 2009

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - America has now gone longer without an increase in the federal minimum wage than at any point in the law's eight-decade history.
In July 2009, almost 10 years ago, the federal minimum wage rose from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour.
Since then, Congress has not approved any additional hikes, with Republican lawmakers rejecting Democrats' attempts to raise the minimum wage.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he and President Donald Trump have not discussed the administration's position on raising the federal minimum wage.
Trump has backed a number of positions on the minimum wage, saying at one point during the 2016 presidential campaign that he supported significantly increasing it and at others that he would not lift it.
Twenty-nine states have passed state minimum wages that are higher than the federal baseline, while in the other 21 the federal minimum prevails.
Republican-controlled states are less likely to have passed minimum wage hikes, although voters in conservative-led states such as Arkansas and Alaska have approved higher minimum wages through ballot initiatives.
"We've had Congress upon Congress that can't get it done, so we're stuck with this shameful number," said Judiy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates a higher federal minimum wage.
Experts say the recent strong run of U.S. economic growth over the past several years bolsters the case for raising the minimum wage, given that businesses are better positioned to survive the rise in costs than they are during a downturn.
Wages have begun rising for U.S. workers as low unemployment improves their bargaining power, but some economists argue they would increase even faster with minimum wage hikes.
The "effective" minimum wage - the average wage being paid to all minimum wage workers - has surged to $12 an hour, largely due to state and local governments' hikes, according to a report in The New York Times by an economist who served in the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama.
But about 700,000 minimum-wage workers, in areas that have not passed local increases, are still paid $7.25 an hour, the report said.
The value of that wage has fallen by about 17 percent over the past decade, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, which translates into a $3,000 loss in annual earnings for a full-time year-round minimum-wage worker.
"Business profits have been steadily growing, and it's much easier to absorb what businesses view as negative economic shocks when the overall context is positive and good," said Steven Kyle, an economist at Cornell University. "That's been true for the last five years."
Hassett, of the president's economic team, pointed to recent wage growth at the bottom of the income distribution and argued the Republican tax law had helped bolster pay for low-income workers.
In November 2018, White House National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow called the minimum wage a "terrible idea" and "silly," arguing it hurts small businesses by increasing their costs.
"The best way to increase wages is to encourage capital formation, increase productivity, and drive the equilibrium wage higher," Hassett said.
Democrats in Congress have faced internal divisions over how high to raise the minimum wage, with the party's liberals and much of the 2020 presidential field pushing for a $15 an hour minimum wage.
Moderate Democrats in Congress have pushed small increases in the federal minimum wage that would vary by region, with the wage floor rising by smaller amounts in poorer areas.

NEW GENERATION OF TECH FIRMS URGES STRONGER PRIVACY LAWS

Autor: Weaver, Todd; Brendan Eich for.

Texto completo: Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently wrote about the importance of privacy in The New York Times, joining Facebook and others as purported converts to the cause. But while Big Tech publicly claims a change of heart about consumer privacy, it is at the same time quietly attempting to dismantle California's new privacy law before it even goes into effect. This kind of duplicity is why the tech industry is increasingly being viewed with suspicion.
Last year California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, which requires large companies to respect basic personal information rights.
These include the rights of individuals to know what types of information about them are collected, sold or shared, and the right to stop businesses from trading their information.
As an industry that depends on public trust and touts itself as improving our lives, we need to stop sharing intimate information with unscrupulous brokers and building systems that manipulate users' preferences and actions. These are serious mistakes that may generate short-term profits but hurt consumers, our communities and the industry as a whole.
Secretly, our colleagues in Big Tech worry about privacy violations too. That's why so many of them prohibit their own children from using the products and services they push on an unwitting public.
We represent a new generation of privacy-focused companies that believe we should not build things we wouldn't let our own kids use. We support strong privacy protections, not just token "regulation" that doesn't really protect consumers. That's why we (and others) have called on the legislature to actually strengthen California's consumer privacy law.
Big Tech, though? They're calling for something else entirely: watering down California's law as much as possible.
For example, Big Tech has called for an exception for online advertising tracking and other changes that would narrow the range of information protected by the new law.
They also successfully killed SB 561, which proposed that Californians should be able to hold tech companies accountable when they commit serious privacy violations, as well as AB 1760, the Privacy for All Act, which would have strengthened the CCPA in numerous ways.
After intense lobbying efforts, the California Legislature refused to even vote on those bills, while it quietly passed half a dozen bills supported by Big Tech to weaken the CCPA.
Now that the only two state bills to protect our customers' privacy have been obliterated, we're turning our attention to the fact that Big Tech is paying lip service to the value of privacy while cynically trying to advance other bills that render the CCPA meaningless.
Our message is this: Regulate us. Seriously.
Big Tech's cries that CCPA's privacy protections will stifle innovation are false. In fact, they echo the empty panic that tech companies raised around the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. In truth, the GDPR provides new opportunities for innovative companies to grow and compete with Big Tech. Luckily, the EU didn't fall for Big Tech crying wolf about regulation. The California legislature shouldn't either.
If there's one thing our industry knows how to do, it's how to innovate and adapt. We thrive in the startup mindset of tackling new challenges. We know how conquer what seems impossible. We know how to imagine, dream, innovate and implement.
We can rise to the occasion. Making sure that our customers' and families' privacy rights are protected isn't merely doable. It is imperative.
The California legislature should reject the attempts to weaken the California Consumer Privacy Act. Because strong privacy laws help us better serve our users. And that's good for everyone.

Texto completo: Making investment decisions based on seasonal proverbs could squash your 401(k) retirement savings.
U. S. stocks dropped more than 6% last month – their worst May since 2010 and second-worst since 1962. That sour four-week stretch seemed to prove the old adage, “Sell in May and go away. ”
But don’t let coincidence fool you. Markets don’t heed calendars.
Seasonal myths like “Sell in May and go away” have lingered for eons. Bedfellows include “The January effect,” which argues January’s returns (or its first few days) predict the year. Then comes the "Santa Claus rally," which 2018 disproved, and “financial hurricane season” – which supposedly means awful September and/or October returns. All of these proverbs work occasionally. None work often enough to help you.
Sell in May at least started with logic. Its original name – sell in May and go away until St. Leger Day – came from U. K. stockbrokers traditionally taking summers off until a famous September horse race (the St. Leger Stakes). The reduced liquidity supposedly brought sharper swings and weaker returns. Avoiding the summer months dodged this problem.
But decades of stock returns destroyed this logic. Modern sell-in-May thinking argues that avoiding the six months from April 30 to Halloween spells success. Yes, stocks’ average returns over that period – 4. 2% since 1925 – trails returns from Halloween through April 30, which are 7. 4%. But 4. 2% isn’t negative. If you want the stock market's 9. 9% annualized return, you need those spring and summer months along with autumn and winter. Otherwise, your return will be lower and reaching your retirement goal harder.
Seasonal adages “work” just often enough to sustain their myths. January predicted full-year returns in 65 of 92 years – a 70. 6% success rate. April 30- Oct. 31 was negative 28. 3% of the time. September stunk 47. 8% of the time, while October sank 39. 1% of years. The Santa Claus rally paid off an amazingly high 78. 3% of years.
Calendars didn’t drive any of these past returns. Consider January. Stocks are positive on a yearly and monthly basis more often than not, making it logical that good Januarys would happen in "up" years. And the bad? It's normal for a "down" January to occur during a bear market. That's a coincidence, not causality.
And what happens when seasonal myths overlap? While the six-month “sell in May” stretch is lackluster, July is the calendar’s best month. So if you sell in June, you’ve sold too soon! Do you sell in August to avoid “financial hurricane season” in September and October, then buy in November? September’s average – a negative 0. 6% return – might seem to support that. But that is dragged down by a handful of awful Septembers in the 1930s and 2008. Is it wise to stake your retirement on a few outliers? Or is it better to remember September and October are both positive more often than not?
Short-term timing your 401(k) generally puts your retirement savings at risk, especially if you invest based on calendar trivia. What happens if you sell after a down May, like in 2019, but the rest of the year is fine? That happened in 2010, when U. S. stocks fell 8% in May, then went on to climb 16. 8% from May’s end through Dec. 31.
So ignore seasonality. Always think long term. Your 401(k) needs to provide for your lifetime.

Texto completo: CONFIRMATION BIAS: Inside Washington's War Over the Supreme Court, from Scalia's Death to Justice Kavanagh
By Carl Hulse
Harper, 314 pp. $28.99
With the death of Antonin Scalia came the death of civility in the Senate.
Civility, to be sure, had been on life support for some time. It took a body blow when Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was caned in 1856 by Senator Preston Brooks of South Carolina. It barely survived the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Robert Bork (who was defeated) and Clarence Thomas (who today sits on the high court). 
But when Scalia died in the winter of 2016, the Republicans who controlled the Senate, and who deplored everything about Barack Obama, moved with lightning speed to assure that the 44th president would not have a chance to replace the revered conservative jurist.
The swiftness of that decision has been known for more than three years. But the maneuvering behind that decision provides some of the most riveting details of New York Times correspondent Carl Hulse's “Confirmation Bias,"' a gripping tale of insider Washington with implications far beyond the capital and far beyond our own time.
Here, in brief, is how the Republican offensive unfolded. Sen. Ted Cruz, reviled even by his Republican colleagues, was set to move to close down any Obama nomination. But GOP leaders agreed they could not let that happen. Any initiative begun by the snarling Texan would be tainted and eventually discredited. So Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell swept in, arguing that “this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President," dooming Merrick Garland's chances for confirmation before he was even nominated. 
The effect was to widen the partisan divide, to weaponize the confirmation process, to enrage Democrats and to alter the rhythms of conventional Washington practice. 
''It was an act of outrageous audacity," Hulse writes. “Virtually on his own, without consulting a single elected colleague, Mitch McConnell had decided to deny the Democratic president his right to fill an open Supreme Court seat." 
Even then, the name on the lips of those in the Donald Trump campaign inner circle was Brett Kavanaugh; they itched to retain that opening for him. The lawyer at the center of that circle was Donald McGahn, later to win notoriety for his refusal to appear before a House committee. 
Kavanaugh would end up being Trump's second nominee, but the drama had been set in motion. It didn't help the Democrats' cause that Joe Biden, unbidden and unrestrained, was on the record saying that if a Supreme Court vacancy occurred in the last year of George H.W. Bush's term, the president should not name a nominee “until after the November election is completed." 
At the heart of this dispute, and the many that followed, was a vital question of constitutional law and congressional convention: Should lawmakers weigh ideology when considering confirming judges, or is their role merely to assess a nominee's qualifications? Here views change with elections; those out of power lean toward ideology, those with a party colleague in the White House lean toward qualifications. And so judicial nominations have become bitter battlegrounds.
Much of what Hulse sets out is familiar to those following the news — the banning of filibusters for judicial nominees, once considered by Republicans but eventually embraced by Democrats, for example. When that gambit was later applied by Republicans to Supreme Court nominees, Democrats were enraged."
Hulse tells us that McGahn welcomed applying this change in Senate procedure, known as the “nuclear option," to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch because in that episode the ideological balance of the high court was not at issue; Gorsuch represented a conservative replacing a conservative on the court. Cynically but shrewdly, McGahn understood it was better to have the nuclear option in place for the next confirmation fight, when the court could be moved sharply to the right.
And it was. Enter Kavanaugh, a magnet for Democratic criticism even before the emergence of charges of youthful sexual harassment. The result was the most explosive Senate hearings since Anita Hill's accusations against Thomas.
Hulse gives us little new insight on Kavanaugh's private life and the accusations against him; that will have to await a book now in preparation by his New York Times colleagues Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, whose “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" is scheduled for publication in early October , the day after the court opens its fall session. But Hulse does provide us with an assessment of the impact of the Kavanaugh hearings, and it is a searing judgment.
“In the end, both sides believed that the warfare over the courts and Kavanaugh played to their immediate benefit — probably the worst possible outcome for the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the badly broken confirmation process," he writes. “The nation's governing institutions were left facing severe challenges to both their credibility and their ability to assure the public they were acting on behalf of all Americans."
Sadly, that assessment rings true. The ultimate victims of the wars over the courts may be the Americans of the future. They will look back on this book, and the episodes it chronicles, with wonder, and with disappointment and disdain.

Biden’s problem with Dems is he doesn’t hate Republicans

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Let’s get this straight: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he’s the most “electable” candidate in the Democratic field? A guy who doesn’t realize that (BEG ITAL)I worked with segregationists(END ITAL) isn’t a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
This is what you get when you turn to a candidate who has been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different than it is today. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party -- which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
You may be thinking: Who in the world are James Eastland and Herman Talmadge? You’re not alone. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten their names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party’s sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because that’s what Joe Biden does. He is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn’t even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his younger, less popular Democratic opponents are pouncing on Biden’s mistake. California Sen. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1% in the polls) declared that for Biden “to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it’s just misinformed and it’s wrong.” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2.3%) declared, “Vice President Biden’s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (0.3%) tweeted, “It’s 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of ‘civility’ typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal.”
Give me a break. No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do -- in his own, Bideny way -- was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise. But sadly, in today’s Democratic Party, those ideas are just as controversial.
Recall that in February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring -- brace yourself -- that Vice President Pence was a “decent guy.” Then, a few months later, Biden had to backtrack on his effort to craft a middle-ground approach to climate change that would be embraced by both environmentalists and blue-collar voters. After Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thundered, “There is no ‘middle ground’ when it comes to climate policy,” Biden soon embraced the Green New Deal.
And this month, Biden was forced to flip-flop and abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde amendment -- bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions -- after his Democratic opponents attacked him for reaffirming what he once proudly called his “middle-of-the-road” policy on abortion. Biden has also been forced to apologize for his support for the bipartisan 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton but which Democrats now blame for the mass incarceration of African Americans. “I haven’t always been right” on criminal justice, he declared earlier this year.
In today’s Democratic Party, “compromise” and “consensus” are dirty words. Biden’s problem is not that he is a closet racist; it’s that he does not hate Republicans and other political opponents. As he put it on Tuesday, “Today, you look at the other side and you’re the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don’t talk to each other anymore.” That is the point he was trying to make in his ham-handed way. And that is what his Democratic opponents are really upset about.
In a January speech, Biden said, “I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. Okay, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

Iran shoots down US drone: What Iran and the United States are saying

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The rising tensions between the United States and Iran continued on Thursday morning, when a U. S. surveillance drone was shot down by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in what a U. S. official called an "unprovoked attack. "
U. S. and Iranian officials gave differing accounts of the attack, which comes as the war of words between the U. S. and Iran threatens to spill into open conflict.
Here's what we know so far about the drone attack and the tensions between the U. S. and Iran:
What the U. S. is saying
The key difference between the two sides is that U. S. officials said the drone was shot down in "international airspace" over the Strait of Hormuz.
In a briefing at the Pentagon on Thursday, Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of U. S. Air Forces Central Command, called into the Pentagon from a base in Qatar:
"A U. S. Navy RQ-4 was flying over the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz on a surveillance mission in international airspace in the vicinity of recent IRGC maritime attacks when it was shot down by an IRGC surface to air missile fired from a location in the vicinity of Goruk, Iran," Guastella said.
"This was an unprovoked attack on a U. S. surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission," he continued. "This attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and free flow of commerce. "
Guastella reiterated that Iranian claims that the drone was shot down over Iranian airspace "categorically false. "
Trump discussed the issue during an Oval Office meeting later on Thursday, saying, "Iran made a big mistake. This drone was in international waters, clearly. We have it all documented scientifically not just words. And they made a very bad mistake. "
When asked about how the U. S. would respond, he said, "you'll find out. "
Trump added that he thought it was someone "loose and stupid who did it. "
What Iran is saying
Iran has alleged that the drone had violated Iranian airspace, saying the drone fell in the Kouh-e Mobarak region in the central district of Jask.
Iran and the U. S. : Escalating Iran crisis looks a lot like the path US took to Iraq war
Major General Hossein Salami, a spokesperson for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, said the incident serves as a warning to the U. S.
"The downing of the U. S. drone had an explicit, decisive and clear message that defenders of the Islamic Iran’s borders will show decisive and knockout reactions to aggression against this territory,” Salami said at a news conference in Kurdistan Province. “Borders are our redline, and any enemy violating these borders will not go back. "
Despite previous comments by top Trump administration advisors on the threat posed by Iran, President Donald Trump has contradicted his top advisors. In an interview with TIME posted this week, Trump said that the attacks were "very minor. "
Troop deployments
The U. S. has also deployed more troops to the Middle East in what Pentagon officials say is a direct response to Iran's provocations.
On Monday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced that 1,000 troops would be sent to the Middle East "to address air, naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East. " Shanahan cited "hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region. "

Nuclear tensions
Iran announced this week that it would soon be breaking its nuclear stockpile and enrichment limits set under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the "Iran Deal. " The U. S. withdrew from that pact in 2015, but the U. S. has urged Iran to abide by its provisions.
In a television interview last Sunday on Fox News, Pompeo restated America's goals regarding Iran's nuclear program.
"President Trump has been unambiguous: Iran will not get a nuclear weapon," he said. "That's the goal, that’s the objective of our entire campaign with respect to Iran and to create stability throughout the Middle East as part of that effort. "
Does this look like the buildup to the Iraq War?
The saber-rattling between the U. S. and Iran appears to have parallels to the build-up to the 2003 Iraq War.
On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was trying to make the case to Congress that Iran had ties to Al Qaeda, which under a 2001 congressional authorization, would potentially give the Trump administration the legal authority to take military action against Iran.
Pompeo ducked a question about military authorization during a Fox News interview last Sunday, saying that “the president has the authorization to act to defend American interests," but did not elaborate on what authorization that was.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late May shows that half of all Americans believe the U. S. will go to war with Iran "within the next few years. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The downing of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran was a "very big mistake," President Donald Trump said in a tweet Thursday. But as some Republicans pressed for new steps against the country, Trump played down the incident, noting that the aircraft was not carrying any Americans.
The attack on the Navy RQ-4 drone heightened fears that the U.S. and Iran are on a course toward a military conflict as each side blamed the other. The New York Times reported Thursday night that Trump approved a retaliatory strike to take place this morning but abruptly pulled back, according to senior administration officials.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement that it targeted the drone inside Iranian airspace over the southern province of Hormozgan, next to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
But U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, denied that the aircraft had entered Iranian airspace, characterizing the incident as an "unprovoked attack" over one of the world’s most important commercial waterways.
Trump suggested that the attack on the RQ-4 Global Hawk, which has the wingspan of a commercial airliner, may have been carried out without the knowledge of Iranian leaders.
"I’m not just talking about the country made a mistake. I’m talking about somebody under the command of that country made a mistake," Trump said at the White House alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. "I find it hard to believe it was intentional" on the part of Iran’s top officials, the president said.
Trump was noncommittal about a U.S. counterattack. "Let’s see what happens," he said. "This is a new fly in the ointment — what happened, shooting down the drone — and this country will not stand for it."
The White House invited a bipartisan group of top congressional leaders to a meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss the situation. Among those invited were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and the chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate intelligence and armed services committees.
"We had a good briefing," McConnell said, adding that he could confirm that an unmanned aerial vehicle "was fired on from Iranian soil and it was in international waters. And beyond that I think the administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses."
Schumer said he cautioned that "these conflicts have a way of escalating."
"The president may not intend to go to war here, but we’re worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war," he said. "One of the best ways to avoid bumbling into war, a war that nobody wants, is to have a robust open debate and for Congress to have a real say. We learned that lesson in the run-up to Iraq" in 2003.
After the White House meeting, Pelosi held a closed-door session with Democratic lawmakers to brief them on the developments. "We know that the high-tension wires are up there, and we must do everything we can not to escalate the situation, but also to make sure that our personnel in the region are safe," she said.
Thursday’s strike capped a number of recent incidents, including attacks on oil tankers, that American officials have depicted as part of an Iranian effort to hurt the United States and its allies in the region. The attack on the drone comes as the United States continues its "maximum pressure" campaign against a country the Trump administration has identified as its main adversary in the Middle East.
Tehran has responded with defiance to the initiative, which was launched after Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and has included designating the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and taking steps to cut off Iranian oil sales.
On Thursday, the European Union said officials from Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran would meet next week to discuss strategies to salvage the nuclear pact despite renewed U.S. sanctions and Tehran’s threat to exceed limits on its uranium stockpiles.
The Revolutionary Guard’s top commander, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, called the downing of the drone "a clear message to America."
"Our borders are Iran’s red line, and we will react strongly against any aggression," Salami said in remarks carried by Iranian state television. "Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."
Nearly a quarter of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects Middle East energy producers to markets around the globe.
Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, head of U.S. air forces in the Middle East, told reporters at the Pentagon that the Global Hawk was flying at high altitude in the vicinity of recent tanker attacks and was not at any time closer than 21 miles to the nearest point on Iran’s coast.
Guastella said the aircraft did not leave international airspace and was brought down by an IRGC surface-to-air missile fired from an area close to Goruk, Iran. "This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, UAE, and Muscat, Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians," he said. Guastella did not take questions.
The Global Hawk incident occurs the week after two tankers, a Japanese and a Norwegian, were attacked in the area of the Gulf of Oman. The Trump administration has blamed Iran for both incidents, at least one of which is said to have been carried out by use of a limpet mine similar to devices previously displayed at Iranian military parades.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's former aide Hope Hicks sat down with the House Judiciary Committee for nearly eight hours on Wednesday to answer questions about her time in the White House.
The former White House communications director, the first senior administration official mentioned in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report to appear before Congress, was subpoenaed because of her proximity to Trump. Most notably, the committee members wanted to know about several episodes described in the Mueller report as attempts to thwart the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
But throughout her marathon testimony, Hicks did not answer many questions related to her time in the Trump administration. Two White House lawyers were present during the testimony and often interjected with a quick "objection" to lawmakers' questions.
In total, 155 questions went unanswered.
The queries she refused ranged from where her desk was in the White House to the president's actions raised in Mueller's report, according to a transcript published by the Judiciary Committee.

Although the White House did not invoke executive privilege to block Hicks' testimony, the lawyers, Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin, noted that she "may not be compelled to speak about events that occurred during her service as a senior adviser to the President. "
"With all due respect, that is absolute nonsense as a matter of law," House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , replied.
Hicks said she found it "odd" that Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager, was asked to deliver a message to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to "unrecuse" himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.
Hicks was asked several times to read portions of Mueller's report, such as an incident where Trump told Lewandowski to tell Sessions that if he delivered the remarks the president wanted, he would be the "most popular guy in the country. " However, when asked to verify the account, Hicks did not.

In another instance, Hicks was asked about a portion of the report that described her as trying to "throw herself between the reporters and the President" in order to stop parts of an interview Trump was having with the New York Times in which he bashed Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.
When asked whether the account was accurate, lawyers objected to the question.
Hicks also did not answer any questions regarding Trump’s effort to have White House Counsel Don McGahn remove the special counsel, the resignation of former National Security Advisory Michael Flynn and Trump's firing of former FBI director James Comey. She also did not answer a question about the president creating a statement in response to press coverage of a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower. Top Trump officials, including the president's son Donald Trump Jr. , had a meeting with Russians offering dirt on Democrat Hillary Clinton.
She also refused to answer questions about conversations she had with the president.
Although she was able to answer how the weather was on her first day on the job ("cloudy," she said) and where she had lunch (at her desk), Hicks did not answer whether Trump would come and speak to her during lunchtime.
Hicks, who was one of the president's most trusted confidants, did talk briefly about her time on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, which she said felt "relief" after hacked information from top members of Hillary Clinton's campaign was published by Wikileaks. She also defended the campaign's use of the Wikileaks information, which Trump cited many times on the campaign trail.
'That will not stand': Democrats plan next steps after ex-Trump aide Hope Hicks didn't answer key questions
White House departures: Who's been fired and who resigned
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said little was learned from Hicks' testimony. Nadler said he was satisfied in "some ways" with Hicks' testimony, but said the blanket objection to answering questions would "not stand. "
The next step for Democrats, some committee members said Wednesday, is going to court and forcing Hicks and others to fully comply with subpoenas and answer questions, though Nadler did not say that was the next step for the committee.

Federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25/hour since July 2009

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - America has now gone longer without an increase in the federal minimum wage than at any point in the law's eight-decade history.
In July 2009, almost 10 years ago, the federal minimum wage rose from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour.
Since then, Congress has not approved any additional hikes, with Republican lawmakers rejecting Democrats' attempts to raise the minimum wage.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he and President Donald Trump have not discussed the administration's position on raising the federal minimum wage.
Trump has backed a number of positions on the minimum wage, saying at one point during the 2016 presidential campaign that he supported significantly increasing it and at others that he would not lift it.
Twenty-nine states have passed state minimum wages that are higher than the federal baseline, while in the other 21 the federal minimum prevails.
Republican-controlled states are less likely to have passed minimum wage hikes, although voters in conservative-led states such as Arkansas and Alaska have approved higher minimum wages through ballot initiatives.
"We've had Congress upon Congress that can't get it done, so we're stuck with this shameful number," said Judiy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates a higher federal minimum wage.
Experts say the recent strong run of U.S. economic growth over the past several years bolsters the case for raising the minimum wage, given that businesses are better positioned to survive the rise in costs than they are during a downturn.
Wages have begun rising for U.S. workers as low unemployment improves their bargaining power, but some economists argue they would increase even faster with minimum wage hikes.
The "effective" minimum wage - the average wage being paid to all minimum wage workers - has surged to $12 an hour, largely due to state and local governments' hikes, according to a report in The New York Times by an economist who served in the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama.
But about 700,000 minimum-wage workers, in areas that have not passed local increases, are still paid $7.25 an hour, the report said.
The value of that wage has fallen by about 17 percent over the past decade, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, which translates into a $3,000 loss in annual earnings for a full-time year-round minimum-wage worker.
Hassett, of the president's economic team, pointed to recent wage growth at the bottom of the income distribution and argued the Republican tax law had helped bolster pay for low-income workers.
"The best way to increase wages is to encourage capital formation, increase productivity, and drive the equilibrium wage higher," Hassett said.
Moderate Democrats in Congress have pushed small increases in the federal minimum wage that would vary by region, with the wage floor rising by smaller amounts in poorer areas.

Walmart pays $138M

Texto completo: in DOJ bribe probe
Walmart Inc. agreed to pay about $138 million to settle U.S. Justice Department claims that its Brazilian unit violated U.S. bribery laws to secure construction permits for new stores.
WMT Brasilia pleaded guilty Thursday to failing to keep accurate records, while the U.S. parent reached a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to documents filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.
The Brazilian unit’s plea follows a yearslong criminal investigation into allegations that Walmart paid bribes in Mexico, China, India and Brazil over the course of a decade to fast-track store openings. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated the conduct.
The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
In the closing days of the Obama administration, Walmart balked at demands to pay more than $600 million in penalties, leading prosecutors to go back to gather more evidence from witnesses, people familiar with matter told Bloomberg at the time.
In 2017, the company set aside almost $300 million for a possible settlement, after which the sides deadlocked over what misconduct the retail giant would admit to, a person familiar with the matter previously said.
Walmart’s Brazilian unit admitted that $527,000 in improper payments to an intermediary were inaccurately recorded on financial records. Walmart Brazil employees logged those payments as going to construction companies when they knew the money was going to a former Brazilian government official, according to the plea agreement filed in Virginia. The former official helped Walmart win a construction permit. Walmart earned more than $3.6 million in profit from stores built by these construction companies.
Walmart disclosed possible violations in Mexico to the Justice Department and SEC in November 2011. The following year, The New York Times outlined details of allegations that the retailer paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses and environmental permits and deflect opposition to open stores, turning Walmart into that country’s largest private-sector employer.
The Walmart case posed challenges for investigators. Much of the conduct uncovered in Mexico, for example, couldn’t be used as evidence because it was too old, according to the people familiar with the matter. So the government sought to build stronger cases in other countries. In Brazil and India, investigators found more recent examples of what they believed were improper payments, yet struggled to find examples of rampant misconduct in China, the people said.

Texto completo: A presentation by New York Times best-selling author and Pittsburgh area native Marie Benedict will kick off Peters Township Public Library's second annual Read Local/Eat Local event this weekend.
The event, which brings together local authors and area food trucks for a day of reading and eating, will be from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. June 22 at the library. Ms. Benedict's presentation is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., followed by a book signing.
Ms. Benedict, who hails from the South Hills, said the topic for the presentation likely will be her latest book, "The Only Woman in the Room," which was chosen as a national Barnes&Noble Book Club pick and was a New York Times bestseller.
The story is about film star Hedy Lamarr, whose career spanned from the 1930s to the late 1980s. Far away from the Hollywood scene, Ms. Lamarr's technological creation more than 75 years ago served as the foundation for Wi-Fi.
According to the official Hedy Lamarr website, at the start of World War II, Ms. Lamarr along with composer George Anthiel developed a radio guidance system called "frequency hopping" that solved the problem of enemies trying to block signals from radio-controlled missiles.
The technology involved changing radio frequencies to prevent enemies from being able to detect the messages.
Basic principles of their work were incorporated into bluetooth technology and are similar to those methods used in the first versions of Wi-Fi. Ms. Lamarr and Mr. Anthiel were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.
"It shares the astonishing narrative of a young Jewish woman in 1930s Vienna, married to Austria's richest man, an arms dealer to Mussolini and then Hitler, who escapes to the Hollywood film world, but desirous of striking out against the Nazis, invents a groundbreaking weapons system - if only the Navy would use an invention made by a woman," Ms. Benedict writes in her book.
The author also will have a question-and-answer period during her presentation. Ms. Bendict said she would be happy to discuss any of her books. She also has authored "The Other Einstein" and "Carnegie's Maid."
She said she used the city of Pittsburgh for inspiration for "Carnegie's Maid," in which she uses historical Pittsburgh and her ancestors' experiences as Irish immigrants in the 1800s.
She currently is working on a book titled "Lady Clementine," which focuses on Winston Churchill's wife. It is to be released in January 2020.
Registration is required to attend Ms. Benedict's presentation, and seating is limited. Call the library at 724-941-9430 to register to attend. Registration is not required to attend the rest of the event.
Local authors attending Read Local/Eat Local are: Audrey Abbott, Elizabeth Babcock, Chuck Beard, Brian Butko, Mike Buzzelli, Jamie Beth Cohen, Carrie DiRisio, Angele Ellis, David Finoli, Ellen Goodlett, Melanie Linn Gutowski, Ben Gwin, Peter Hayers, Tom Imerito, Lori Jakiela, Quelcy Kogel, J. Judson Lacko, Joe Moore, Jaqui Phillips, Leah Pileggi, Chad and George Shannon and Bob Walicki.

Prosecutors Drop Criminal Charges in Flint Water Case

Texto completo: WI Staff Report
Prosecutors recently dropped charges against state and local officials once facing accusations of neglect in the ongoing Flint water contamination health crisis, causing skepticism among City residents anxious for justice and cleaner water.
Flint's water crisis began five years ago in 2014 when the drinking water was transferred from Detroit's municipal water system to the Flint River. Officials did not implement corrosion controls, giving way for lead to filter through city's pipeline, and as a result many citizens have faced health issues or death because of lead poisoning. Citizens were informed by many health organizations that the water, while unsafe, was still within the limits of possible consumption.
Trust in the government continues to dwindle in the already suspicious and weary citizens as more than three years after the first charges were filed in 2016, out of fifteen state and local officials indicted, eight who were awaiting trial have now had their cases dropped. The remaining seven had already taken plea deals and were not affected.
However, government officials hope to remedy this distrust as a newly-appointed attorney general of Michigan, Democrat Dana Nessel, along with a new team of prosecutors, have vowed to reexamine the evidence, citing concerns for earlier shortcutting in the investigation.
"Upon assuming responsibility of this case, our team of career prosecutors and investigations had immediate and grave concerns over the investigative approach and legal theories," noted the two new lead prosecutors Fadwa Hammoud and Kym Worthy in an interview with New York Times.
The two decided to drop the charges against the officials, stating that previous charges against them are not excluded from this case, and that new charges may possibly be filed.
Nessel, in joining the prosecutors' efforts to lodge a new investigation, reassured citizens that the case remains open.

Amid a measles outbreak that's revived concerns about parents who fail to immunize their children, the New York Times mined a little-known database that offers insight into the safety of the shots. Over roughly the past dozen years in the United States, the newspaper reported, people received 126 million doses of the vaccine against measles, and just 284 people filed claims of harm with the federal government. About half were dismissed, and 143 were compensated through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Measles once infected millions of children and killed 400 to 500 people per year.

Throwback to when three top New York Times writers accused Trump of treason

Texto completo: New York Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger kind of has a point when he says that it “crosses a dangerous line” for President Trump to accuse his paper of “a virtual act of treason” because it’s a crime “so grave it is punishable by death.”
On the same grounds, Sulzberger should probably evaluate what’s going into his own paper.
Three of the Times’ own columnists have now accused Trump of treason. Last July, the paper published a column by Charles Blow, “Trump, Treasonous Traitor.” To really drive home that biting use of alliteration, Blow incoherently closed out the piece writing, “Trump is a traitor and may well be treasonous.”
The Times’ Michelle Goldberg did the same thing that same month. In an appearance on MSNBC, she said that Trump conducted himself in a way that was “potentially treasonous.”
And still that month, Thomas Friedman wrote, “There is overwhelming evidence that our president, for the first time in our history, is deliberately or through gross negligence or because of his own twisted personality engaged in treasonous behavior…”Charles Blow, Michelle Goldberg, Thomas FriedmanFine — that’s the Bill of Rights in action. All political speech is fair under the First Amendment. That covers the president, too. But Sulzberger’s real complaint isn’t that Trump isn’t fighting fair. It’s that he’s fighting at all.
“There is no more serious charge a commander in chief can make against an independent news organization,” Sulzberger wrote Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal. Coincidentally, he said nothing about whether there’s a more serious charge the writers at a news organization can make against a president.
You can believe that the president, no matter who, should have his hands tied. But as it stands right now, the First Amendment kind of cuts both ways.
Trump's own reason for accusing the Times of a "virtual act of treason" is arguably more legitimate, anyway. He made the assertion after the paper published information about the administration's ability to breach Russian cyber systems. Times writers call Trump treasonous because they still believe the hoax conspiracy theory that he colluded with Russia. Or maybe just because it's Monday.
Demanding that Trump shut up and take it is not pro-freedom. Sulzberger tried his hardest to make that case, writing with no evidence of a gag reflex that “Journalism guards freedoms, binds together communities, ferrets out corruption and injustice, and ensures the flow of information that powers everything from elections to the economy.” Okay, but how does calling the president a traitor fit into that guarding of freedom, binding of communities and empowering of elections?
If Sulzberger wants Trump to take the word “treason” more seriously, he should first ask that his own writers do the same.

Reporters struggle to remember segregationists touted by Biden were also Democrats

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden is catching hell from his 2020 Democratic primary opponents this week for claiming he had civil working relationships with pro-segregation Dixiecrats when he served in the U.S. Senate.
But perhaps as interesting as the sniping over the 2020 front-runner’s remarks is the fact that several journalists managed to omit from their reporting the fact that the segregationists touted by Biden were also members of the Democratic Party. It is just an oversight, I’m sure.
The most egregious example of reporters forgetting to mention that the late Sens. James Eastland, D-Miss., and Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., belonged to Biden’s party comes from a New York Times article titled, “Joe Biden and Democratic Rivals Exchange Attacks Over His Remarks on Segregationists.”
The report carries four bylines, including those of Katie Glueck, Astead Herndon, Glenn Thrush, and Alexander Burns. A Times staffer named Alain Delaqueriere also contributed to research for the story. For all that manpower, there is not a single mention of Talmadge’s and Eastland’s party affiliation throughout the entire article.
It would be one thing were the omission of party affiliation and political ideology consistent throughout the report. But it is not.
The authors characterize Eastland and Talmadge as “conservative” and “conservatives.” The article identifies the late Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., as an “arch-conservative.” The article identifies the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., as a Republican. It also identifies former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., as a Republican. The Times reporters are also careful to identify the late Sen. Strom Thurmond as “a South Carolina Republican with a history of racist views.” The body of the story mentions the word “Democrats” twice, and it uses the word “democratic” 12 times (15 if you include the headline and photo captions). Yet there are zero mentions whatsoever of the party that Eastland and Talmadge called home.
So strange!
Now, to be fair to Glueck, one of the story’s chief authors, she is responsible for a separate Times article, titled “Biden, Recalling ‘Civility’ in Senate, Invokes Two Segregationist Senators,” that is careful to note that the two touted segregationists were, in fact, members of the Democratic Party.
Over at the Associated Press, it was more of the same. AP reporters Bill Barrow and Elana Schore authored an article Wednesday titled, “Biden not apologizing for remarks on segregationist senators.”
Their report mentions “Democrats” three times, “democratic” five times, and “Republican” once. The report originally made zero mention of the fact that Eastland and Talmadge were both Democratic lawmakers. The AP also published a wire “update” Wednesday that similarly made no mention that Eastland and Talmadge were Democrats.
The AP published a heavily amended version of Barrow's and Schore's original report Thursday noting the segregationists’ party affiliation. The wire “update,” however, has not been amended.
At the Washington Post, things have been hit-or-miss. This article, for example, is careful to mention Eastland's and Talmadge's party affiliation, as is this article (though the latter does not say anything about the party to which Talmadge belonged). In contrast, neither this Post article nor this article says anything about party membership.
ABC News has been similarly inconsistent, as it published at least one article mentioning their affiliation, but two others that do not.
Lastly, MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt took things a step further Wednesday afternoon when she misidentified both Eastland and Talmadge as Republican senators. Hunt corrected herself almost immediately on social media.
That said, it has not all been bad. Many newsrooms, including USA Today, National Public Radio, the Wall Street Journal, Vox, CNN (also, here, here, here, and here), NBC News, and CBS News, have been careful to identify Eastland and Talmadge as Democrats.

Texto completo: Un jurado de una corte federal de Nueva York halló este miércoles culpable de todos los cargos a Keith Raniere , fundador de la organización de supuesta autoayuda Nxivm, con sede en Albany, que resultó ser una secta de esclavas y trata sexual.
Tras cinco horas de deliberación, los 12 miembros del jurado establecieron un veredicto condenatorio contra el acusado en el juicio que se extendió por un mes.
Raniere, de 58 años, que está en prisión desde su arresto en México en marzo de 2018, enfrentó juicio por varios delitos, entre ellos tráfico sexual con adultos y menores, posesión de pornografía infantil, explotación sexual de un menor y chantaje. Se enfrenta a una posible cadena perpetua.
Pero, si algo llamó la atención de este caso fueron los detalles bizarros y de índole sexual que trascendieron en la Corte del Distrito Este de Brooklyn. A continuación, te presentamos un resumen:
Tres hermanas mexicanas embarazadas y abortos
Tres hermanas mexicanas abortaron a pedido del líder de la secta Nxivm, Keith Raniere, quien las embarazó mientras eran sus esclavas sexuales.
Una de las víctimas, identificadas como Daniela, narró el martirio que tanto ella como sus hermanas vivieron bajo el abuso de Raniere camuflado en el supuesto grupo de autoayuda.
La joven, quien llegó de México junto a otros seis miembros de su familia cuanto tenía 16 años, además relató que la prepararon durante semanas antes de que cumpliera los 18, para que Raniere tomara su virginidad.
“Nunca me habían besado y no había tenido ningún contacto sexual”, dijo Daniela en el tribunal, según citada por medios como The Daily Beast.
Marcadas como “ganado”
Videos muestran cómo las esclavas sexuales eran marcadas a fuego vivo con un cauterizador como una especie de rito de iniciación.
En una grabación se ve el procedimiento mediante el que “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa, se aprecia a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la “tatúan”; se trata de Sarah Edmondson, quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas del grupo a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.

La “Semana de la vanguardia”
Otro detalle atroz que trascendió en el proceso judicial fue la celebración conocida como “Semana de la vanguardia”, en reconocimiento a Raniere, evento que supuestamente congregaba a miembros de varias ciudades de Estados Unidos y Canadá.
El encuentro, relacionado con el cumpleaños de Raniere el 26 de agosto, reflejaba la idolatría de los participantes de la organización a su líder y estaba dirigido a la satisfacción de las demandas de éste.
El agente especial del FBI Michael Lever dijo en una declaración jurada que Raniere tenía una rotación de 15 a 20 mujeres con las que mantenía relaciones sexuales como parte de las actividades.
Manipulación y soborno con material sexual
La sociedad secreta piramidal llamada “DOS” o el “Voto” a Nxivm era otra humillación a las víctimas en beneficio del líder.
Raniere, el único miembro masculino del grupo, ocupaba el nivel más alto, en su papel de “maestro superior”. A su vez, las primeras esclavas reclutaban a otras.
Para unirse, las mujeres se veían obligadas a dar garantías de fidelidad a sus amos: material sería comprometedor para la mujer que se exponía a este trueque.
Podría tratarse de fotografías y videos sexualmente explícitos de las esclavas.
“Las esclavas entendían que si abandonaban el DOS, hablaban públicamente sobre el DOS o repetidamente incumplían las obligaciones o asignaciones del DOS, sus garantías podían ser publicadas”, expuso Lever.
.
Sexo grupal
Lauren Salzman, una de las mujeres que pertenecía al círculo cercano de Keith Raniere y la actriz de Smallville Allison Mack, confesaron haber aceptado participar – como dos de las siete “esclavas de primera línea”- en una ceremonia de compromiso que incluía sexo oral grupal.
Poco antes de que comenzara la ceremonia en marzo del 2018, los agentes mexicanos rodearon la propiedad de Raniere en una villa en las afueras de Puerto Vallarta (Jalisco) y lo arrestaron . En dicho país se extendieron las redes de este grupo con vínculos con altos líderes como Emiliano Salinas, hijo del expresidente Carlos Salinas.

Texto completo: On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties held a hearing on reparations for slavery. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. , was among the witnesses testifying.
Sen. Cory Booker speaks the truth
By Bruce Lowry
Years ago, during a meeting with The Record editorial board, I recall then-Mayor Cory Booker almost tearing up as he told stories of an elementary school in one of Newark’s poorest neighborhoods. The school lacked resources, he said, and was in physical disrepair due to neglect.
He related how “it breaks my heart to walk into a classroom and see the children stand, put hands to their hearts and say the Pledge of Allegiance, say the words ‘liberty and justice for all’ and to know that it’s a lie. ”
Talker: Harvard right to dump Kyle Kashuv for racist remarks: Today's talker
That story, that heartbreak, was Booker’s way of explaining that liberty and justice in America, too often, are not for all, but only for some. It was his way of saying that despite strides, we still suffer the effects of a great racial divide, and from income inequality.
That divide, that inequality, are still with us, and they were seared into Booker’s mind and heart again on Wednesday as he testified before a House subcommittee to speak in favor of reparations for slavery.
“I say that I am brokenhearted and angry right now,” Booker said, “(about) decades of living in a community where you see how deeply unfair this nation is still, to so many people who struggle, who work hard, who do everything right but who still find themselves, disproportionately, with lead in their water, Superfunds in their neighborhoods, schools that don’t serve their genius, and health care disparities that affect their body and their well-being. ”
Booker, a Democrat and one of just three African Americans in the U. S. Senate — there have been only 10 overall — is a prime sponsor of the reparations bill introduced in that chamber. It would, among other things, “address the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States” and “establish a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations. ”
The fact that there has been such an outcry already sort of makes Booker’s point about the need for the bill. The rush to condemn it is part of “the silence” Booker spoke of on Wednesday, part of a nation’s refusal to own up to its violent, racist past, or to its unjust present.
No, I don’t know how any sort of “reparations program” would work, and neither does anyone else. I don’t know, for instance, whether I, a descendant of slave owners, would be moved to the front of the line to write a check. But that’s not really the point.
The point is the reckoning, the recognition, on this 400th anniversary of the arrival of African slaves at the Jamestown colony in Virginia, that remnants of slavery continue to haunt our nation today. The injustices that still exist among our black population today, from health care disparity to inadequate schools to higher rates of unemployment, all date to our original sin of slavery.
No doubt, there will be more to come on the reparations issue, more voices speaking loudly and rudely against even having the conversation.
Booker is right, though: We must have the conversation.

What others are saying
Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. , CNN: "African Americans were purposefully deprived of opportunity, the ability to exercise their rights, equal access to education, health care, public facilities and other programs. The civil rights movement of the '60s made important progress, but discrimination and the long-term effects of segregation still linger. "
Jason Nichols, Fox News: "The disgraceful failure of the U. S. government to at least examine the issue of such reparations until now for the descendants of people who were treated like animals and denied the most basic human rights long ago is no excuse to continue ignoring the issue. "
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "In (a) poll, people were given a list of 14 economic policies and asked how much they thought each would help the black community. The list was full of progressive ideas: paid leave and better workplace benefits; a higher minimum wage; a federal jobs guarantee; stronger laws against discrimination; reparations for descendants of slaves; and more. On a straight up-or-down basis, a majority of black Americans favored every one of the 14 policies. But there was a fairly wide gap in how much they thought each would help. At the top of the list were a higher minimum wage, stronger discrimination laws and better workplace benefits and training. About 70% of respondents said each of those would help 'a great deal. ' "
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, news conference: "I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us who are currently living are responsible, is a good idea. We tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a Civil War, by passing landmark civil rights legislation, elected an African-American president. I think we're always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive was responsible for that, and I don't think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it. First of all, it would be pretty hard to figure out who to compensate. We've had waves of immigrants as well who have come to the country and experienced dramatic discrimination of one kind or another. So no, I don't think reparations are a good idea. "
What our readers are saying
We must realize that there is no way to atone for the evil of slavery. Giving money to descendants of slaves isn't going to address the core of the issue and will not move the country forward.
— John Eichler
Should we decide reparations are needed, where do we stop? Are the Irish immigrants, Chinese immigrants and Native Americans any less deserving? They, too, were abused to grow this country.
— Bill Loftus
What about Native Americans?
— Paula Byrd
Totally agree! There should be reparations for every actual decedent of slavery we can find.
— Dennis R Sullivan

Marc Thiessen: Biden's problem with Democrats is that he doesn't hate Republicans

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Let's get this straight: Joe Biden is leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination because he's the most "electable" candidate in the Democratic field? A guy who doesn't realize that I worked with segregationists isn't a winning message with Democrats in 2020?
This is what you get when you turn to a candidate who has been in Washington for 46 years. Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972, when the Democratic Party was very different than it is today. As a freshman senator, he had to get along with the senior leadership of his party — which included segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia.
You may be thinking: Who in the world are James Eastland and Herman Talmadge? You're not alone. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of living Americans had either forgotten their names or never heard of them in the first place, until Biden decided to dredge them up from the fever swamps of the Democratic Party's sordid racial past.
Why, you ask, would he do such a thing? Because that's what Joe Biden does. He is a walking, talking gaffe machine. His point didn't even make sense. He was trying to argue that he can work across the aisle with people with whom he fundamentally disagrees. But Eastland and Talmadge sat on the same side of the aisle as Biden in the Senate; they were Democrats.
So now his younger, less popular Democratic opponents are pouncing on Biden's mistake. California Sen. Kamala Harris (averaging 7.1 percent in the polls) declared that for Biden "to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it's just misinformed and it's wrong." New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (2.3 percent) declared, "Vice President Biden's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone." New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (0.3 percent) tweeted, "It's 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland. Eastland thought my multiracial family should be illegal."
Give me a break. No reasonable person thinks that Biden was defending or even sympathetic to segregation. What Biden was trying to do — in his own, Bideny way — was to defend not segregation but civility and compromise. But sadly, in today's Democratic Party, those ideas are just as controversial.
Recall that in February, Biden was forced to apologize for declaring — brace yourself — that Vice President Pence was a "decent guy." Then, a few months later, Biden had to backtrack on his effort to craft a middle-ground approach to climate change that would be embraced by both environmentalists and blue-collar voters. After Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thundered, "There is no 'middle ground' when it comes to climate policy," Biden soon embraced the Green New Deal.
And this month, Biden was forced to flip-flop and abandon his four-decade-long support for the Hyde Amendment — bipartisan legislation that bars public funding for abortions — after his Democratic opponents attacked him for reaffirming what he once proudly called his "middle-of-the-road" policy on abortion. Biden has also been forced to apologize for his support for the bipartisan 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democrat Bill Clinton but which Democrats now blame for the mass incarceration of African Americans. "I haven't always been right" on criminal justice, he declared earlier this year.
In today's Democratic Party, "compromise" and "consensus" are dirty words. Biden's problem is not that he is a closet racist; it's that he does not hate Republicans and other political opponents. As he put it on Tuesday, "Today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore." That is the point he was trying to make in his ham-handed way. And that is what his Democratic opponents are really upset about.
In a January speech, Biden said, "I read in The New York Times today that one of my problems if I were to run for president, I like Republicans. OK, well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned." Apparently, for many on the left, that sin is unforgivable.

Trump's alarming campaign kickoff; Sun Sentinel Editorial

Información de publicación: South Florida Sun - Sentinel ; Fort Lauderdale, Fla. [Fort Lauderdale, Fla]. 20 June 2019: A.13.

Texto completo: The myth about George Washington chopping down the cherry tree - "Father, I cannot tell a lie"- was invented after his death by a biographer known as Parson Weems. It catered to what virtually all Americans felt for the president who had set towering examples of integrity and dignity for his successors. Not all lived up to them, but most have tried.
To compare the 45th president with the first is to appreciate what was so deeply unsatisfactory and even alarming about Donald Trump's 80-minute rant in Orlando Tuesday night.
If the rest of the president's re-election campaign follows suit, it will be historically nasty, at least on his part, and continue to debase the high office for which he shows none of the respect he expects for himself.
The entire tone was grossly inappropriate, not to mention the litany of his familiar lies and exaggerations, such as a claim to "the biggest tax cut in history."
Presidents who respect their office do not continue to rail against their last opponent or imply, as Trump did, that his attorney general will try to throw "Crooked Hillary" in jail over her e-mails.
Presidents who claim to sincerely want cooperation from the other party do not slander it, as Trump did, by calling his opponents "un-American" and accusing them of "shredding the Constitution."
Presidents who swear to protect us from adversaries do not denounce as a "witch-hunt" the investigation that proved, despite his interference, how a hostile foreign government helped elect him.
Presidents who seek to reflect America's highest ideals do not pander to bigotry, as Trump did, by accusing would-be immigrants of harboring gangs and committing crimes when in fact they are more law abiding than native-born citizens.
Presidents who seek to level with people don't make promises, such as curing cancer - all cancers? - that they should know they can't keep.
In its arrogance, demagoguery and disrespect for the truth, the president's 2020 campaign kickoff was indistinguishable from his conduct on the stump in 2016. It's as if he has learned nothing and cared less about how a president is supposed to behave. It was more appropriate to a soccer stadium in 1930s Germany or 1960s Cuba, than to the proud democracy that George Washington did so much to create.
Since Washington's day, Americans have become accustomed to politicians stretching or shading the truth on occasion, but not to their departing from it so far and so often as Trump did Tuesday night.
Fact-checkers from the Washington Post and New York Times found:
* Trump lied when he said President Obama did "nothing" about possible Russian interference in the election because he thought "crooked Hillary" was going to win. In fact, Obama warned Russia, confronted Vladimir Putin in person, allowed the intelligence agencies to issue a joint statement in October 2016, and would have done even more had Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, not blocked the way.
* Trump exaggerated in claiming "over 400 miles of wall" will be built by the end of 2020. There is funding for only 258, including money under emergency powers that are being challenged in court.
* He told a familiar and long discredited lie about the tax cut. Ronald Reagan's in 1981 was larger as a share of the economy and Barack Obama's in 2012 was larger in inflation-adjusted dollars.
* He exaggerated again when he said he had created six million new jobs. That includes those from nearly three months before his inauguration. And far from being "impossible," 6.1 million jobs were gained in the 28 months before he took office. Job gains and the economy are riding a wave that Obama helped to create after the 2008 recession.
* He lied when he said our country had "never taken in 10 cents from China" in tariffs. In fact, the U.S. collected more than $10 billion in duties on Chinese goods during the Obama administration.
* He lied when he said "you're not paying very much if you're paying anything at all" in the tariffs that are his trade-war weapons. A study quoted in the Washington Post put the cost to Americans at $1.4 billion a month last year, including corresponding price increases on domestic products.
* He lied when he claimed that "many, many" auto plants are being built in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida." All but South Carolina are swing states, but no plants have been announced in North Carolina, Florida or Pennsylvania. Suppliers in Florida are expanding, but no cars are about to be built here.
* He lied in talking about military budgets that are "far more then ever before." Even without inflation, Obama's in 2011 was larger.
* He lied about the Russian investigation having been conducted by "18 very angry Democrats." Robert Mueller, the special counsel, is a lifelong Republican who was appointed by a Trump appointee and who presented substantial evidence of obstruction of justice on Trump's part.
Trump's choice of Florida for a campaign kickoff reflected how badly he needs to win the state, but he said almost nothing that Florida particularly cares about.
To the contrary, he boasted about slashing regulations, such as those that help defend us against swamping seas. On Wednesday, he completed the dismantling of the Obama rule on coal plant emissions. His move will promote global warming and rising seas. He and his devoted fans might not care, but everyone else should.
He also continued to mislead the nation about his record, and his party's, on health care. None of the persistent attempts to repeal Obamacare would have continued to protect people with pre-existing conditions.
In boasting that people no longer have to pay a tax in lieu of buying health insurance, he overlooked how many still can't afford health care, which costs more than in other developed countries where people are healthier and live longer.
That's just a sampling of where the truth went off the tracks Tuesday night.
Many presidents have had it rough politically, often worse than Trump. But none, not even Richard Nixon, ever bore it as poorly as Trump does.
How he copes with the challenges of his office and how he performs on the campaign trail are open windows into his character. America's future requires far better than what her people saw through those windows Tuesday night.

THE NEW YORK TIMES recently asked 21 of the Democratic presidential candidates 18 questions ranging from light (“What do you do to relax?”) to, well, not so light (“Would your focus be on improving the Affordable Care Act or replacing it with single payer?”).

Texto completo: Oleg Cassini seduced me. It wasn't his thatch of thick white hair, trim frame or silky continental drawl that sent my imagination into overdrive, but his outsize gift for spinning tales.
Cassini was 91 when we spoke in 2005: best known then as Jacqueline Kennedy's designer, the silver-tongued bon vivant who helped shape her image during her White House years.
Leaning forward in a club chair at his Beaux-Arts townhouse and business headquarters on East 63rd Street, the designer reminisced unsentimentally about his conquests, splicing his narrative with dry asides that conjured a lost world of polo grounds, martinis at Musso & Frank, and winter holidays at Chamonix.
Already a formidable Hollywood presence when he met Mrs. Kennedy, Cassini, who had carved a reputation of "designer to the stars," boasted of liaisons with some of the women he dressed, those he liked to call the "top, top girls," a gallery that included Grace Kelly, to whom he was briefly engaged, Ursula Andress and Marilyn Monroe. Then there was Gene Tierney, the 1950s movie star and famous beauty, who became his wife.
A year after we spoke he was dead. To the scores of collectors and curiosity seekers happy to look past the more pedestrian aspects of his business life (his name is attached to a mid-price bridal-wear label and a number of licensees, including housewares and colognes) his mystique remains intact.
Or so Doyle, the New York auction house, is betting. On June 27 the house will place a sizable portion of the Cassini estate, estimated to be worth $ 50 million to $ 60 million, under the gavel: mementos of a life lived on an epic scale reduced to some 750 lots.
There will be contents from two of his properties -- a neo-Gothic townhouse in Gramercy Park and a Renaissance-style mansion surrounded by 43 acres in Oyster Bay Cove, on Long Island. The items include seven suits of armor and such oddly assorted items as a Sino-Mongolian dagger, heraldic plaques, a Louis XVI ormolu-mounted writing table, a 1987 Silver Spur Rolls-Royce and a cache of letters and memorabilia documenting Cassini's relationships with Kelly and Mrs. Kennedy.
A highlight is lot No. 10, a nine-page letter Mrs. Kennedy wrote in the months between election and inauguration. "It's the kickoff piece, the piece I go to," said Peter Costanzo, a senior vice president and executive director at Doyle. "It has such an intimate and unguarded tone."
In that letter, a vulnerable first lady-to-be pleads with the designer, "Protect me. I feel so personally exposed and I don't know how to cope with it."
As titillating as the sale itself is the whiff of scandal that attends it. A 13-year litigation over the estate remained active even as the sale was announced earlier this spring.
Though Cassini rarely mentioned it, there was another woman in his life, Marianne Nestor, who with her sister Peggy has led the New York company Cassini Inc. and a fragrance business, Oleg Cassini Parfums, for more than three decades. Known to all but the designer's inner circle only as his business manager, Ms. Nestor was in fact Cassini's wife.
Ms. Nestor Cassini, who has referred to herself in court documents as the Countess Cassini, was jailed for six months last year for failing to comply with court orders issued in Nassau County. The court orders concerned how to distribute his estate to his four grandchildren, who maintain they are entitled to one half of it.
She was jailed a second time, in January, for resisting a court order to turn over financial statements and business records to a court-appointed receiver assigned to collect the assets of the designer's two companies. She was released in March, having spent two months behind bars for civil contempt.
Vincent Reppert, her lawyer, did not respond to my messages but told WWD, as reported on May 3, "The entire matter is being vigorously disputed.
Also in dispute is a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Nassau County that called for the sale at public auction of the Gramercy Park townhouse.
Mr. Costanzo declined to say how Doyle came into possession of the contents of the estate it is auctioning, referring elliptically to a note in the auction catalog. Lots from the New York townhouse are being sold "pursuant to a New York City sheriff's office property execution seizure," it states, while those from Oyster Bay Cove are being sold by a court-appointed receiver on behalf of Oleg Cassini Inc. and Cassini Parfums.
The note is accurate, according to John Barnosky, a lawyer for the four Cassini grandchildren.
The sale will encompass objects of varying worth, their value reflected, somewhat conservatively, in estimates that range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars.
"There are lots of things collectors would be hungry for, and others you could buy at any Long Island estate sale," said Corbin Horn, the head of furniture and decorative arts sales at Leslie Hindman, an auction house based in Chicago.
A breath of scandal may not boost their worth, Mr. Horn suggested, but will likely build anticipation for the sale.
It may also cast shade on the image Cassini worked a lifetime to burnish.
The son of an Italian Countess and a Russian diplomat of noble descent, Cassini grew up with advantages, learning to sketch, studying under the Italian painter Giorgio de Chirico and taking up riding in his native Florence.
He left Italy in the mid-1930s with Igor, his brother, the two bent on chasing their fortunes in the New World. Igor, known as Ghighi (himself a Lothario once heard to brag that he had slept with every woman at a lavish party he attended), was swift to make a name. Writing as the powerful Hearst gossip columnist Cholly Knickerbocker, he is credited with having coined the term "jet set."
Oleg set his sights on Hollywood, working during the 1940s as a costume designer -- a career, as it happened, with benefits. Ever the rogue, he made no secret of dating the starlets of the day, Betty Grable and Lana Turner among them. "He was a true playboy, in the Hollywood sense," recalled Diane von Furstenberg, the fashion designer and a friend. "Even in his 90s he was a flirt."
But not a cad. "I needed affection, and I did it the old-fashioned way; I earned it," he wrote in his 1987 autobiography. A man with a heroic imagination, Cassini became a United States citizen in the 1940s and served as an army cavalry officer. Besotted with glamour, he once tested his skills as an actor with a cameo as a dress designer in the movie "Where the Sidewalk Ends." Tierney, his wife, played a model in the film.
Cassini went on to design her screen wardrobe during much of their rocky 12-year union. The couple had two daughters, the first of whom, Daria, had significant developmental and physical disabilities and was eventually institutionalized. Stunned, Tierney sank into a depression. Cassini, too, was crushed, telling The New York Times in 1995, "This is a continuous torment to me."
He rebounded professionally, opening a salon in Midtown Manhattan and later licensing his name to products including crystal tableware, a men's cologne and a Chrysler car interior.
Cassini, whose wardrobe sketches for the first lady will be on view at Doyle in Manhattan, was often dismissed as an imitator, owing a creative debt to Hubert de Givenchy, Mrs. Kennedy's Parisian couturier.
"He was not the most highly respected designer," Frank Mori, a former fashion executive and once the licensing guru behind Donna Karan, told the writer Maureen Orth in 2010, "but Jackie Kennedy made him a star."
That seemed to be enough for Cassini. "What is more important, the reality or the perception?" he famously said. "I am perceived to be an important designer. It's enough for me."

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

DEMOCRATS SHOULD ORGANIZE DEBATE WITH ONE TOPIC: CLIMATE CHANGE

Texto completo: Very little about the Democratic National Committee's approach to organizing debates featuring the several dozen contenders for the party's 2020 presidential nomination makes sense.
Does it make sense to have front-runners Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris on one stage, while one of the top five leading contenders, Elizabeth Warren, is relegated to another stage on another night? Definitely not, but that's the plan.
Does it make sense to set thresholds for debate participation so low that most of the time in the initial debates will be taken up by candidates who are polling at 1 percent or less? Probably not, but that's the plan.
The DNC's debate planning does not inspire confidence.
But something about the party's approach should inspire fury.
The DNC is refusing to organize a debate on climate change, and it is clinging to rules that could effectively block candidates from participating in independent debates on the issue.
This is morally wrong and practically foolish.
Most of the candidates acknowledge that, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, climate change represents "an existential crisis that impacts not just you and me and our generation but our kids and our grandchildren, and we must accept the moral responsibility of leaving these kids, future generations, a planet that is healthy and habitable." Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said, "When it comes to climate change, our very existence is at stake. But Washington refuses to lift a finger without permission from the fossil fuel companies. That's dangerous and it's wrong!"
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has staked his nomination bid on the issue, arguing, "We're the first generation to feel the sting of climate change. And we're the last that can do something about it. We went to the moon and created technologies that changed the world. Our country's next mission must be to rise up to the most urgent challenge of our time: defeating climate change."
While the candidates have a shared sense of urgency regarding climate change, they have different understandings, approaches and plans. They should debate about those understandings, approaches and plans.
This is not just a matter of comparing and contrasting Democrats. The candidates who propose to challenge a president who dismisses the existential threat to the planet as "a change in weather that goes both ways" need to show us how they might rally the 69 percent of voting-age Americans who, according to the Yale Program for Climate Change Communication, say they are worried about an environmental catastrophe.
For some time now, Inslee has been urging the DNC to organize a specific debate where the candidates
focus on the issue. But the committee has refused, announcing earlier this month, "While climate change is at the top of our list, the DNC will not be holding entire debates on a single issue area because we want to make sure voters have the ability to hear from candidates on dozens of issues of importance to American voters."
DNC officials say they are interested in climate change. But this decision reinforces a concern, well expressed by former New York Times environmental writer Justin Gillis, that "while Democrats were nominally on the right side about climate change, they never put much fight into it."
The committee's wrongheaded decision raises the prospect that, as in the 2016 debates, the issue could be neglected or ignored. Worse yet, the DNC's rules threaten candidates who join debates that are not officially sanctioned. According to the Inslee campaign, the committee say signaled, "If we participated in anyone else's climate debate, we will not be invited to future debates."
"That's outrageous to me," the governor told CNN, "to muzzle candidates who want to go out and have this debate."
That should be outrageous to everyone who cares about the planet and to everyone who wants a meaningful 2020 presidential race. Blacklisting candidates who are ready to debate issues that the DNC has chosen to underplay is absurd.
Inslee, reports Mother Jones, has indicated that he "cannot rule out any other debate that would highlight both the necessity of defeating the climate crisis and calling for the candidates to step up to the plate."
The governor's response is appropriate, and the other candidates should back him up. Any Democrat who proposes to be president in this time of climate crisis should recognize that Inslee was right when he said, "Sixty-second sound bites, which is all you'll be able to get in a party debate, is grossly inadequate to the task."
There will be plenty of grab-bag debates where Democratic candidates preen and position themselves regarding questions about the president's latest tweet. What's needed are a few debates that allow for this crowded field of contenders to go deep on issues of overwhelming consequence, from climate change to economic inequality to racism to war and peace.
Single-issue area debates have the potential to be more serious, and more revealing, than the sort of debates now imagined by party officials who are clearly overwhelmed by the candidate cacophony. They also offer an opportunity for the DNC and the party's candidates to highlight clear contrasts between Democrats and Republicans on issues that Americans care about.

Congress has never gone this long without a minimum wage increase

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - America has now gone longer without an increase in the federal minimum wage than at any point in the law's eight-decade history.
In July 2009, almost 10 years ago, the federal minimum wage rose from $6.55 an hour to $7.25 an hour. Since then, Congress has not approved any additional hikes, with Republican lawmakers generally rejecting Democrats' attempts to raise the minimum wage.
Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said he and President Donald Trump have not discussed the administration's position on raising the federal minimum wage. Trump has backed a number of positions on the minimum wage, saying at one point during the 2016 presidential campaign that he supported significantly increasing it and at others that he would not lift it.
Twenty-nine states have passed state minimum wages that are higher than the federal baseline, while in the other 21 the federal minimum prevails. Republican-controlled states are less likely to have passed minimum wage hikes, although voters in conservative-led states such as Arkansas and Alaska have approved higher minimum wages through ballot initiatives.
"We've had Congress upon Congress that can't get it done, so we're stuck with this shameful number, said Judiy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Project, which advocates a higher federal minimum wage.
Experts say the recent strong run of U.S. economic growth over the past several years bolsters the case for raising the minimum wage, given that businesses are better positioned to survive the rise in costs than they are during a downturn. Wages have begun rising for U.S. workers as low unemployment improves their bargaining power, but some economists argue they would increase even faster with minimum wage hikes.
The "effective minimum wage - the average wage being paid to all minimum wage workers - has surged to $12 an hour, largely due to state and local governments' hikes, according to a report in the New York Times by an economist who served in the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama. But about 700,000 minimum-wage workers, in areas that have not passed local increases, are still paid $7.25 an hour, the report said.
The value of that wage has fallen by about 17 percent over the past decade, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, which translates into a $3,000 loss in annual earnings for a full-time year-round minimum-wage worker.
"Business profits have been steadily growing, and it's much easier to absorb what businesses view as negative economic shocks when the overall context is positive and good, said Steven Kyle, an economist at Cornell University. "That's been true for the last five years.
Hassett, of the president's economic team, pointed to recent wage growth at the bottom of the income distribution and argued the Republican tax law had helped bolster pay for low-income workers. In November 2018, White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow called the minimum wage a "terrible idea and "silly, arguing it hurts small businesses by increasing their costs.
Liberal "The best way to increase wages is to encourage capital formation, increase productivity, and drive the equilibrium wage higher, Hassett said.
Democrats and much of the 2020 presidential field pushing for a $15 an hour minimum wage. Moderate Democrats in Congress have pushed small increases in the federal minimum wage that would vary by region, with the wage floor rising by smaller amounts in poorer areas.
Polling suggests raising the minimum wage is popular, and some large companies have begun shifting their positions. Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, after raising the company's wage floor to $15 an hour amid criticism from lawmakers, has challenged competitors to follow suit. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) And in March, McDonald's announced it would not longer use its resources to push against minimum-wage hikes at the federal, state or local level.
"There is not a single community in the U.S. where someone can have a decent quality of life at the current federal minimum wage, said David Cooper, an EPI researcher on the minimum wage. "Congress has never waited this long to lift up the wages of workers at the bottom.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Democratic lawmakers accused President Donald Trump's former aide Hope Hicks of rejecting questions about her time in the White House during a marathon hearing on Wednesday.
While Democrats aimed to unearth new aspects of Hicks' role in the White House, which spanned some of the most controversial moments of Trump's presidency, both sides of the aisle seemed to agree that very little, if anything, was learned from the all-day testimony. But despite the roadblock, Democrats vowed that their fight was only beginning, one that would likely go to court, so key officials may testify before lawmakers.
Hicks, Trump’s former White House communication director and campaign spokeswoman, is the first senior administration official mentioned in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to testify before Congress.
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Hicks because of her proximity to Trump during several episodes that Mueller’s report described as attempts to thwart the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The incidents include Trump helping draft the explanation about a Trump Tower meeting between top campaign officials and Russians and his firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director James Comey.
Mueller’s report found no conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia, despite repeated foreign attempts to influence the election on Trump’s behalf. Mueller said he didn't have the option to charge Trump with obstruction of justice despite 10 episodes of potential illegalities listed in the report.
'I will never ever let you down': Trump launches reelection bid
Congressional Democrats on the committee said Hicks’ appearance amounted to her not complying with the subpoena. They claimed she did not answer questions about her time in the White House or the findings outlined in the Mueller report. Lawyers for the administration, who were at Hicks side during her testimony, objected to question after question, claiming she was immune from answering anything related to her time in the White House, Democrats said.
But she did answer some questions about her time on the Trump campaign, and Democrats said every piece of information was helpful for their investigations into the president.
Hicks did not answer questions from reporters as she left the hearing after about eight hours testifying.
Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler said he was satisfied in "some ways" with Hicks' testimony but said the blanket objection to answering questions about her time in the White House would "not stand. "
"She answered some of our questions. We learned considerable information," said Nadler, D-N. Y. "The White House pleaded a non-existent, absolute immunity and that will not stand. "
Some Democrats said her testimony felt more like a roadblock that only pushed them further down the path toward impeachment proceedings.
“This is an obstruction of Congress’ ability to do our job and uphold our oath. It’s unacceptable. We have to begin an inquiry soon,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. “They’re not even allowing her to comment on what’s in a publicly available report, the Mueller report. It’s unbelievable. ”

The next step for Democrats, some committee members said, is going to court and forcing Hicks and others to fully comply with subpoenas and answer questions, though Nadler did not say that was the next step for the committee.
Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif. , tweeted some of the questions that attorneys objected to, including where Hicks' office was and what the weather was like on her first day of work. He said he's ready for a court battle.
“She is basically relying on the Department of Justice to assert objections every single time it’s related to anything during her tenure in the White House,” he said. “There is no such thing as absolute immunity. The White House is just making stuff up. ”
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. , said Wednesday’s hearing amounted to another witness failing to comply.
“We have more lawlessness when it comes to witnesses refusing to testify. It’s frustrating,” said Swalwell, who is running for the Democratic nomination for the White House. “All this does is just take us back to the court and just waste the taxpayer’s dollars. ”
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said Hicks was only "one peg on the board" and the committee needs testimony from Mueller and Don McGahn, the former White House counsel who defied a subpoena from the committee to appear.
Central Park Five: Trump doesn't apologize to Central Park Five: 'You have people on both sides of that'
Trump complained in a tweet that Democrats put Hicks "through hell, for 3 years now, after total exoneration by Robert Mueller. "
Republicans on the committee agreed.
"It's unfortunate that Hope Hicks has been dragged down here and forced to go through this," said Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas. "I'm amazed that people would be willing to serve in any administration when they're harassed like this for just doing their jobs. "
Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said the hearing was a waste of time, an effort by Democrats to just redo the work of Mueller and his team.
“There’s nothing new here,” said Collins, R-Ga. “Democrats continue to try to relitigate the Mueller investigation. ”
Other Republicans said there are other priorities that the committee should be investigating and holding hearings on. Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, questioned why House Democrats believed they would learn anything new that Mueller’s team didn’t already outline.
“I don’t know why we’re on a path to try and interview all of the witnesses that Bob Mueller has already interviewed,” he said, adding that the hearing was a futile effort.

Hicks left the White House in March 2018 and is chief communication officer and executive vice president at Fox, the parent company of Fox News and other networks.
Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N. Y. , said a transcript of her testimony will be made public within the next two days.
Nadler has dismissed claims of executive privilege or immunity for Trump administration witnesses by arguing that the president waived immunity by allowing top aides to speak with Mueller's team.
White House departures: Who's been fired and who resigned
Hicks' appearance stands in contrast to McGahn, who defied the committee’s subpoena. McGahn cited administration reservations that his testimony is protected by executive privilege, to ensure that presidents get candid advice from aides.
Attorney General William Barr, who redacted portions of the Mueller report dealing with grand jury testimony and evidence in pending cases, also defied a committee subpoena to provide Congress the full Mueller report and millions of pages of underlying evidence. The committee found him in contempt but negotiated a compromise to receive documents.
The full House authorized litigation to enforce the subpoenas against Barr and McGahn.
Hicks’ name appears more than 180 times in the Mueller report’s text and footnotes. She described meetings and dealing with the aftermath of incidents, including:
Trump helping draft a response to media questions about the meeting June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower, when Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner met with Russians offering damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. On June 28, 2017, at Kushner's lawyer's office, Hicks reviewed emails setting up the meeting. She said they looked “really bad” and that media coverage would be “massive” when the story broke, the report said. During a foreign trip, Trump helped draft a statement July 8, 2017, for his son to provide The New York Times that said the meeting was "primarily" about adoptions and didn’t mention disparaging information about Clinton.
Sessions recusing himself from the Russia inquiry because he worked on Trump’s campaign. Trump scolded Sessions in Hicks’ presence. Trump, who was "extremely upset" about Mueller's appointment in May 2017, told Sessions he should resign. “Hicks said she had only seen the president like that one other time, after the 'Access Hollywood' tape came out during the campaign,” the report said, referring to a televised recording of Trump saying he grabbed women’s genitals. Trump pocketed Sessions' resignation letter for a year and a half but fired him the day after the midterm election in November 2018.
Trump telling Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on May 10, 2017, in the Oval Office that he fired Comey. “He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump told the Russians, according to the report. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off. … I’m not under investigation. ” When Hicks told Trump about news stories about the meeting, Trump didn’t look concerned and said Comey “is crazy,” the report said.

Texto completo: In another life, Francis Gurahoo might have pursued a career as a hairstylist.
But the three dozen-or-so plastic hair rollers stashed in the East Hartford man's carry-on luggage weren't meant for luscious curls. Instead, authorities found 34 colorful finches inside those rollers - each capable of producing songs worth thousands of dollars.
If they win, that is.
Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn say Gurahoo's attempt to smuggle the live birds from Georgetown, Guyana, through John F. Kennedy International Airport Sunday was not inspired by his love of South-American songbirds. The 39-year-old admitted he was "motivated by financial gain," and planned to sell the finches for about $3,000 each. A successful coup would have netted him more than $100,000.
His would-be-profitable plan was foiled by a customs exam, according to a complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York.
The practice of smuggling finches - via hair rollers, toilet paper rolls, pantyhose or socks, as others have tried, according to the New York Times - is hardly a novel concept.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers working at the airport have caught "numerous" people trying to sneak the birds into the United States from Guyana in recent years, according to the complaint, using creative methods to avoid the cumbersome importation process.
If they make it through the checkpoint, these birds are pitted against one another in singing contests at public parks in Brooklyn and Queens, where a judge determines which has the "best voice." Sometimes, it's a race to see which finch can sing the most songs.
While several species of finch exist in North America, some people genuinely believe Guyanese finches "sing better," making them more attractive, according to prosecutors. Smugglers, in turn, profit by importing the crooners to the United States. Finches who win the avian-idol contest are extremely valuable and can sell for upward of $5,000, the complaint reads. A male finch with "a good pedigree and track record" can net its owner $10,000, the Times notes.
The complete nature of Gurahoo's charges were not immediately clear and his attorney could not be reached for comment Monday. He did not apply for the permit to import the birds legally, the complaint said, opting instead to circumvent the mandatory 30-day quarantine.

Egypt Quietly Buries Former President While Muting Coverage of His Death

Texto completo: KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, was buried at dawn on Tuesday in a furtive and closely guarded ceremony attended by his wife and two sons.
Reporters were barred from the short ceremony and coverage of Mr. Morsi's death was muted.
Only one major newspaper, Al Masry Al Youm, reported it on its front page, under a headline that failed to mention he was a former president. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has yet to make a public comment.
The stifled and uneasy reaction to the death of Mr. Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood leader who collapsed and died in a Cairo courtroom on Monday, offered few indications about the legacy of a man who once represented the hopes for a democratic Egypt and has loomed in the background since his ouster by the military in 2013.
The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group that swept Egypt's first free elections and brought Mr. Morsi to power in 2012, has been driven deep underground by Egypt's security forces. But the government's response to his death was a telling indicator about the state of Egypt under the man who ousted him, Mr. el-Sisi, offering another dismal example of how the country has slid deeper into authoritarianism in recent years.
Within hours of Mr. Morsi's death, Ahmed Moussa, a pro-government television news anchor, attacked him as a terrorist and a spy, and issued a warning to Morsi supporters who might protest on the streets. "To anyone who wants to bury this country: we will bury you first," he said.
[Is the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization?]
There were also signs, though, that the government was nervous about possible unrest in reaction to Mr. Morsi's death. Coffeehouses in downtown Cairo were closed on Tuesday, apparently on official orders.
And Mr. Morsi's burial was sequestered from public view.
The authorities refused a request by his family to bury him in his hometown in the Nile Delta, so the funeral took place at 5 a.m. in eastern Cairo, off limits to the public, two of his lawyers said.
Some former critics of Mr. Morsi, in Egypt and other Arab countries, set aside their political differences to register their disgust at the former president's harsh treatment in prison, where Mr. Morsi spent the last six years of his life.
Hisham Melhem, a Lebanese-American journalist with the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya channel, said he doubted that Mr. Morsi had been fit to rule Egypt. But he was "not as brutal as those who preceded him or the monstrosity that toppled him," Mr. Melhem said.
In a post on Twitter, Queen Noor of Jordan called Mr. Morsi the "only" democratically elected president in Egypt's history -- a seeming dig at Mr. el-Sisi, who won deeply flawed elections in 2014 and 2018.
Tunisia's first post Arab Spring president, Moncef Marzouki, a secularist, wept on television when speaking of Mr. Morsi's fate.
The contrasts between Mr. Morsi and Mr. el-Sisi were a reminder of the personal edge to the bitter rivalry that divided them.
After Mr. Morsi was elected president in 2012, he appointed Mr. el-Sisi, then a senior general, defense minister and head of Egypt's armed forces.
In the months before the military seized power in July 2013, Mr. Morsi brushed off warnings that General el-Sisi might betray him. Photos from the time show a smiling General el-Sisi sitting opposite Mr. Morsi.
But once Mr. Morsi had been ousted, Mr. el-Sisi appeared to single him out for tough treatment that never let up.
Mr. Morsi's lawyers say he was held for long periods in solitary confinement and allowed just three family visits in six years. They say the authorities denied Mr. Morsi medicines he desperately needed to treat his diabetes, high blood pressure and liver diseases -- claims that have driven loud calls by human rights groups and the United Nations human rights office for an impartial investigation into his death.
Egypt's government, which has promised a post mortem, is unlikely to meet those demands, and has lashed out at criticism of its record. On Tuesday, the State Information Service accused the New York-based Human Rights Watch of spreading lies about Mr. Morsi's detention conditions and of seeking to exploit his death.
As Mr. el-Sisi tightened his grip on power in recent years, he has grown intolerant of even mild dissent. Thousands of political detainees fill Egypt's prisons. The intelligence services manipulate Parliament and have direct control over the main television stations.
Mr. el-Sisi has basked in the approval of Western leaders like President Trump, who has received him warmly at the White House several times, and President Emmanuel Macron of France, who traveled to Egypt in January to sign multibillion-dollar arms deals.
Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has also been a regular visitor to Egypt in recent years as he seeks backing for a grand Middle East peace plan, long delayed and now on the back burner owing to Israel's turbulent electoral politics.
Through that period Mr. Morsi languished in prison, occasionally brought to court to face a tangle of prosecutions. After his repeated outbursts against judges, the authorities built him a glass cage that allowed judges to silence his voice.
In leaked audio from one court hearing in 2017, Mr. Morsi complained of bright lights in the cage and being unable to see or hear his own lawyers.
"I don't know where I am," he said in the recording. "It's steel behind steel and glass behind glass. The reflection of my image makes me dizzy."
The Muslim Brotherhood has not fared much better.
Once a sprawling grass-roots organization with a reach across Egyptian society, the Brotherhood has been effectively shattered. Thousands of members and many of its leaders are being held in prisons where torture is rife.
Among those in exile, strong differences have emerged over how best to oppose Mr. el-Sisi.
One faction, based in Istanbul and dominated by younger Brotherhood members, seeks to fight Mr. el-Sisi openly through politics and to build common cause with secular Egyptians.
But the group's main wing, which is dominated by older members and operates from London, advocates a more low-profile approach that involves waiting for Mr. el-Sisi to fall from power -- even if that could take decades.
In an interview with The New York Times in a London suburb last month, the Brotherhood's acting leader, Ibrahim Munir, 83, said that its main activity involved dispensing assistance to the families of prisoners in Egypt.
Mr. el-Sisi will certainly leave office one day, he said, but the timing was in the hands of God. "The movement has to come from all of the people," not just the Muslim Brotherhood, he said.
That quietist approach is a stark contrast with frequent claims by Egyptian government officials who blame the Brotherhood for much of the violence in the country. Security officials often link attacks by the Islamic State and other militant groups to the Brotherhood, although the group has a policy of nonviolence.
The United States and other Western governments have produced no public evidence linking the Brotherhood to violence.
Some disaffected former Brotherhood members in Egypt have broken with the group to form armed factions that carry out attacks on security forces around Cairo. Two of those groups, Hasm and Liwa al-Thawra, have been designated as terrorist organizations by the United States government.
In April, American military leaders and diplomats opposed a plan by the White House to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, saying it would be inappropriate and could strain relations with Arab allies like Jordan and Tunisia, where Brotherhood-affiliated parties are influential.
The leaders of the Brotherhood's Egyptian branch say they have bigger worries than an American designation.
"It is not going to add or cost anything," said Mr. Munir, the brotherhood leader. "We are already in a very bad position and it could not be worse."

Texto completo: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been moved from a minimum-security prison near Scranton, Pa., to the federal detention center in Manhattan used to hold the notorious Mexican drug lord known as "El Chapo," federal records show.
The move to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City comes as Manafort is expected to appear in court there on state mortgage fraud charges. The New York Times and Fox News Channel had previously reported that Manafort probably would be headed to the notorious Rikers Island prison, but the district attorney's office disputed whether that had been decided, and a Justice Department official said it has now been determined that Manafort will remain in federal custody after his attorneys raised concerns about his "health and personal safety."
The official said the attorneys proposed that Manafort stay in federal custody but be turned over to the state as needed, and New York prosecutors did not object.
"In light of New York's position, and Mr. Manafort's unique health and safety needs, the department determined to err on the side of caution by keeping Mr. Manafort in custody during the pendency of his state proceedings," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Manafort would be made available as needed, and the arrangement would not affect his state case, the official added.
Manafort previously had been serving time for federal crimes at the minimum-security prison camp at the U.S. Penitentiary, Canaan, in Pennsylvania.
He drew particular attention during an investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into possible coordination between the Kremlin and President Trump's 2016 campaign for his business involving Ukraine and contacts with people connected to Russia.
Ultimately, Manafort was charged with offenses related only to his Ukraine work - not for a conspiracy with Russia. He was convicted in August of tax- and bank-fraud charges after a weeks-long trial in federal court in Virginia, and he later pleaded guilty in a separate case in federal court in Washington.
Although Manafort admitted wrongdoing and agreed to cooperate with law enforcement, prosecutors accused him of lying even after that. He was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison across both cases. Then, in March, he was indicted by a state grand jury in New York on charges of mortgage fraud - a case that some analysts viewed as a safeguard in case Trump sought to pardon him for the federal crimes. The president cannot issue a pardon for state offenses.
When the New York charges were announced, Trump said a pardon for Manafort was "not something that's right now on my mind," but he added, "I do feel badly for Paul Manafort, that I can tell you." Manafort's attorneys are likely to argue that the state case is a form of double jeopardy because the alleged mortgage fraud stems from the same conduct that led to the federal case against Manafort. An attorney for Manafort did not immediately return messages Tuesday.
Manafort's time in federal custody has at times sparked controversy. Last summer, when he was at a facility in Northern Neck, Va., awaiting his federal trial, prosecutors alleged that he had told people he was treated like a "VIP," because he had his own phone and computer and did not have to wear an inmate uniform.
Because of his case's high profile, the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained regular communication with Justice Department leaders about Manafort's status, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks.
On May 3, New York requested Manafort's transfer to its custody - which probably would have put him at Rikers Island - until after his state trial was completed, according to a letter Manafort's attorney wrote to the prison warden in Pennsylvania.
According to the letter, dated May 17, New York had rejected a request from Manafort to remain in Pennsylvania while awaiting trial. Todd Blanche, Manafort's attorney, asked the warden to intervene so that Manafort could return to Pennsylvania after his arraignment in New York.
Blanche argued that the Pennsylvania camp was "an appropriate facility in light of Mr. Manafort's security needs," while Rikers Island - where Manafort could spend months or years in solitary confinement while awaiting trial - "clearly is not."
"Even if Mr. Manafort were housed at a facility other than Rikers Island, it would not serve anyone's interests for him to be kept in a pretrial detention facility in the New York City area while awaiting trial in the Case," Blanche wrote.
The Times and Fox News reported in early June that Manafort was expected to be transferred to Rikers within a few weeks. The facility has a fearsome reputation, and the Times reported that Manafort probably would be held in isolation. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y), whose district includes the facility, criticized the reported move at the time.
"A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations," she said on Twitter. "That's what solitary confinement is. Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary."
But the plans, it seems, were still in flux. On June 11, Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, forwarded Blanche's letter to the warden to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. and asked for his thoughts.
Vance responded three days later, saying his office had "never taken the position that Mr. Manafort should be housed at Rikers Island." Christopher R. Conroy, chief of the Manhattan district attorney's major economic crimes bureau, separately wrote to the warden, noting that state prosecutors were willing to have Manafort stay at a federal facility in New York, such as the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
Conroy said the district attorney's only concern was that Manafort be made available for court proceedings in a "timely manner." He noted that keeping Manafort in Pennsylvania with only brief excursions to New York for court appearances would be a "departure from usual practice," although he said the office also was open to such an arrangement.
The Justice Department ultimately decided that Manafort should be moved to the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
Some legal analysts said Manafort seemed to be receiving preferential treatment. "This is not a good start for Rosen," Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote on Twitter. "Lots of inmates complain about where they're held - almost none get the Deputy AG's attention."
But the Metropolitan Correctional Center is no five-star hotel; a prisoner who spent time there and at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba famously said the military's detention complex for terrorism suspects was "more pleasant" and "more relaxed." The correctional center, which houses about 800 inmates, has been home to its share of high-profile detainees, including Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán and Bernie Madoff, who was convicted of orchestrating the biggest Ponzi scheme in history.
The Bureau of Prisons declined to provide details about Manafort's detention at the Manhattan center.

Trump says he will meet with Xi at G-20 session

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump said Tuesday that he and President Xi Jinping of China had spoken by phone and would have an “extended" meeting at the Group of 20 meeting next week in Osaka, Japan.
His comments were the first confirmation that the two leaders would actually meet after trade talks between the United States and China stalled in May and suggested that the two countries were once again trying to find compromise.
“Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China," Trump said on Twitter. “We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting."
Stocks jumped after the president's tweet, as skittish investors took comfort in the potential for renewed discussions between the world's two largest economies.
Progress toward a trade agreement between the world's two largest economies had come to a halt after Trump accused China of breaking a deal with the United States and China accused the United States of failing to negotiate in good faith.
Trump officials said the Chinese government altered portions of the agreement that would require it to codify the trade deal's provisions in Chinese law, which the United States saw as evidence that China would not keep its side of the bargain.
That prompted Trump to escalate his fight with China, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods as punishment and threatening to tax an additional $300 billion worth of goods if Beijing does not agree to America's trade terms.
On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Robert Lighthizer, the administration's top trade negotiator, told lawmakers that no decision had been made about the next round of tariffs against China. Lighthizer defended the president's tough tactics before Republican and Democratic senators, who raised concerns about the trade war's effects on American farmers, manufacturers and consumers.
“We had an untenable situation with China, one that should have been addressed frankly a couple of decades ago," Lighthizer, the US trade representative, told the Senate Finance Committee. “We view ourselves as having the most serious problem you can face in the trade space."
New York Times
White House reportedly explored demoting Fed chair
The White House explored the legality of demoting Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in February, soon after President Trump talked about firing him, according to people familiar with the matter.
The White House counsel's office weighed the legal implications of stripping Powell of his chairmanship and leaving him as a Fed governor, the people said, in what would be an unprecedented move. A replacement would have to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.
Trump's team conducted the legal analysis and came to a conclusion that has remained closely held within the White House, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It isn't clear whether Trump directed the legal review, and the people didn't describe the outcome.
A White House official who declined to be identified said he wouldn't comment on what he called alleged discussions from months ago. Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said demoting Powell isn't currently under consideration.
“It's not happening today so therefore I have nothing to say on it," Kudlow told reporters.
Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in an e-mail: “Under the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause."
Bloomberg News
Orlando paper says it would not endorse Trump
The hometown paper of the Florida city where Donald Trump made his reelection announcement says it won't endorse the president.
The Orlando Sentinel said in an editorial Tuesday that some readers may wonder how the publication can eliminate a candidate before anyone knows who his opponent will be.
The Sentinel answers that it's "because there's no point pretending we would ever recommend that readers vote for Trump."
The paper says it has had enough of "the chaos, the division, the schoolyard insults, the self-aggrandizement, the corruption, and especially the lies."

Biden suggests he has raised $20 million for campaign
Joe Biden told supporters at a Manhattan fund-raiser Monday that his presidential campaign has raised money from 360,000 donors, with an average contribution of $55 — figures that suggest he has amassed nearly $20 million.
If so, the former vice president's haul would eclipse that of any of the other Democratic White House hopefuls in the first quarter of the year, including Senator Bernie Sanders, who reported taking in $18.2 million from about 500,000 donors. Sanders also reported another $2.5 million in transfers from previous campaigns.

No love from home state

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio are low in the polls and lagging in donors, but also lacking when it comes to endorsements, particularly from their home-state politicos.
Gillibrand, three months into her official bid for the White House, so far has the endorsement of only one of the 21 House Democrats in New York's delegation, Rep. Carolyn Maloney of Manhattan.
De Blasio, newer to the race at one month into his candidacy, is endorsed by the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council and state Assemb. Rodneyse Bichotte of Brooklyn.
Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has voiced support for former Vice President Joe Biden.
And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he won't pick a preference because seven senators and de Blasio are in the running.
"I think the overwhelming view of most Democrats and even most independents is: Who's the best candidate to beat Donald Trump?" Schumer told Newsday. "And we have to let it play out. That's more important than geography right now."
By contrast, Sen. Cory Booker early in his bid secured the endorsements of New Jersey's governor, lieutenant governor, Senate president and General Assembly speaker as well as his state's other U.S. senator and all 11 Democratic House members.
Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also boast stronger home-state support from federal government colleagues and statewide elected officials.
Newsday reached out to four dozen prospective prominent Democratic endorsers in New York State, either directly or through their representatives. The pool included the federal elected officials, the statewide elected officials and 20 additional Democratic National Committee members, from former President Bill Clinton to key delegates in the private sector.
Among those who responded, the majority said they weren't ready to make an endorsement.
Some said they did not yet know if they would endorse at all.
Some said Gillibrand and de Blasio had not yet requested their endorsement.
Several cited the sheer size of the Democratic field, the multiple friends and colleagues they have in the mix and the fact that they hold party leadership positions as reasons for delaying their decision or staying neutral.
Like Schumer, some noted that their end goal was to unseat President Donald Trump with the right Democratic nominee.
"We're still looking at all the candidates," state Attorney General Letitia James said. "The bottom line is I want to beat President Trump. Period. End of discussion. Full stop."
Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said he hasn't decided whether he'll make an endorsement because the primary includes six current or former House colleagues, two Congressional Black Caucus members and Gillibrand.
"So, at this point, I've decided just to let the process play itself out," Jeffries said. "I speak to whatever candidates reach out to me and will continue to do so."
Among New York's other Democratic House members, Rep. Thomas Suozzi of Glen Cove endorsed Biden and Reps. Kathleen Rice of Garden City and Sean Patrick Maloney of Hudson Valley endorsed former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, both calling him a friend.
Gillibrand, a former House member who has been in the Senate for 10 years, also has friends in the delegation but she doesn't yet have their endorsements.
Rep. Nydia Velazquez of Brooklyn said she hasn't made a decision. "But I'm listening," she added. "I'm listening to all of them."
Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County told The New York Times in March that she was sitting out the primary. Lowey's spokeswoman didn't return Newsday's requests for comment.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Gov. Kathy Hochul made the maximum allowable contribution to Gillibrand's bid but her spokeswoman said she has made no formal endorsement.
Gillibrand and de Blasio's teams said more endorsements are forthcoming.
De Blasio's campaign said that despite his short time in the race, "he already has more union endorsements than all but one candidate."
It cited support from local and national leaders, but did not respond to a request for elaboration. It may have been referencing endorsements by a South Carolina mayor and councilman and a statement by feminist icon Gloria Steinem that de Blasio was the "only male" candidate she'd support for president.
A Gillibrand aide said the campaign does not expect Gillibrand to be an establishment candidate and its strategy reflects that. The aide noted that the senator is endorsed not only by Maloney, but two key activists in Iowa, an activist and a state elected official in New Hampshire and a congressional candidate from Illinois.
A national party official from New York speaking on the condition of anonymity said neither candidate has generated much good will among fellow politicos in the state. Another official, also speaking anonymously, noted that Gillibrand and de Blasio rose to their posts more as individuals than as team players.
Others said it was still early in the 2020 election cycle and also said the candidates' standings in the primary may go hand-in-hand with endorsements.
Gillibrand and de Blasio each have been registering at 1 percent or lower in national polls. The senator struggled to secure the 65,000 unique donors necessary to meet the fundraising threshold set by the DNC to help qualify for the debates later this month. 
Both had expressed concerns that they wouldn't make it to the debate stage, but both qualified in the end. Gillibrand met both the polling and fundraising thresholds. De Blasio only met the polling threshold. The third New Yorker in the primary, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, also qualified for the debates.
"I think that each of these candidates before reaching out for endorsements has got to establish themselves as a possible, a genuinely possible, contender," said Jay Jacobs, state Democratic Party chairman and Nassau County party leader. "And then, I think they'll get the interest and attention in their own home state. And I think that's a good strategy."
DNC member Gerard Sweeney said endorsements would be "an indication of political support." He noted some politicians such as Gillibrand spend less time on the "political party side of things than on the government side of things."
Another DNC member, Charlie King, commended de Blasio on the hotel workers union nod, calling it "one of the more coveted endorsements in New York, if you're running in New York." But, King said, "it's not translating nationally."
Gerald Benjamin, a SUNY New Paltz professor, said state and county party leaders likely are following Cuomo's lead on endorsements. He noted the "adversarial relations" betw

A fighter or a peacemaker? Amy Klobuchar is trying to be both.

Resumen: The Minnesota senator has passed more bills than any 2020 rival, and has won over moderates and conservatives. That may not be what Democrats want.

Texto completo: In a Democratic primary field filled with partisan warriors, Sen. Amy Klobuchar is sometimes cast as too moderate, too “Minnesota nice” to fire up the Democratic base and win back the White House. 
“Some people will find her boring,” says Steve Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. “But Trump may have made boring attractive.”
Within the Democratic Party, there’s unanimity about the urgency of replacing President Donald Trump. But there’s an internal debate about how best to do that, a debate that could be described as fighters versus peacemakers – the Bernies versus the Betos. The fighters are passionate, even angry, about systemic economic and racial injustices that they say President Trump did not cause but has accelerated. The peacemakers are more concerned with partisan polarization and the coarsening of national discourse, which they believe is undermining America’s strengths and ability to surmount the challenges it faces.
Enter Senator Klobuchar, who is in some ways trying to be both: positioning herself as a fighter who can bring America together – with neither angry speeches nor kumbaya sessions, but with conviction and heart.
“[She] is clearly ready to fight and be critical of the president,” says Neil Levesque, director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, which hosted Senator Klobuchar for a Politics & Eggs event last week. “But a lot of what she said is ‘We’ve got to bring everyone together.’”
The senator and her supporters argue that you don’t need to be an ideological crusader to beat President Trump. She has one of the strongest records of any Democrat when it comes to winning over moderate and conservative voters; in 2018, she won 42 Minnesota counties that went for President Trump two years prior. And as she talks about civility and needing to bridge America’s divides, she also emphasizes that she’s got a backbone of steel – fittingly for the granddaughter of an iron ore miner in northern Minnesota. 
On Tuesday, she released a plan outlining more than 100 “concrete steps” she would take during her first 100 days in the White House – everything from rejoining the Paris climate agreement to allowing prescription drugs to be imported from Canada to updating Department of Justice guidelines on enforcing antitrust laws.
“If you’re a progressive, you’d better make progress. You can’t just talk about it; you actually have to get things done,” Senator Klobuchar said to reporters after her Politics & Eggs appearance.
Ranked the most effective Democratic senator in the 2017-19 Congress, she has passed more bills than any other lawmaker running for president – including nearly five times as many as fellow senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
She is currently lagging well behind both of them in the latest Iowa poll, however, with only 4% support in the state that will kick off the Democratic nomination process next February. Heading into the first Democratic debates next week, her national poll numbers average around 1%.
“The odds don’t favor her,” says Professor Schier. “When you have 24 candidates, the probability of anyone who is not already well known nationally [winning the nomination] is pretty low.”
Still, as a Minnesota Vikings fan, she knows things don’t always end up the way they start. And maybe, for once, that could work in a Minnesotan’s favor.
The right kind of fighter? Senator Klobuchar kicked off her presidential campaign outdoors on a 14-degree day in the middle of a Minneapolis snowstorm. No hat, no gloves. Because she wanted people to know she has grit.
But that image of toughness got the wrong kind of burnishing thanks to a series of stories about her track record as a demanding boss, including a New York Times piece about how Senator Klobuchar – exasperated with an aide who forgot to get her utensils to eat a takeout salad on the plane – ate her salad with a comb and then told the staffer to clean it. The story was based on four former staffers’ accounts, none of whom spoke on the record.
“I know I can be tough; I know I can push people too hard, and I also know I can do better – and I will,” Senator Klobuchar told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in a statement.
Former staffer Zach Rodvold likened working for her to Navy SEAL training. “It’s not intended to be fun. It’s hard,” he told the Star Tribune. “But what you get from it is you become very, very good at what you do.”
It is perhaps ironic that a candidate criticized in the press for being too tough as a boss is conversely being portrayed as not enough of a fighter to go to bat for progressive issues, or to take on President Trump.
But Democratic voters are looking for a particular kind of tough, and New Hampshire resident Marie Duggan for one isn’t sure Senator Klobuchar fits the bill. Back in March, she told the Monitor she could see the Minnesota senator breaking up banks – in contrast to former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, whom she had come to see at Keene State College, where she teaches economics. But after hearing Senator Klobuchar in person later this spring, she was less impressed.
“Amy is obviously a fighter by temperament, but she’s not going to show that to us,” says Professor Duggan, who is still paying off her student debt 18 years after finishing her Ph.D. and feels an urgency about fixing a broken economic system. “For me, a person that’s drowning in the current situation – she didn’t say that she would do anything about it.”
‘So New Hampshire!’ For a candidate who’s been criticized as both bland and overbearing, Senator Klobuchar is surprisingly dynamic and warm on the campaign trail.
“She loves people; she loves talking to people. More importantly, what I’ve observed is she really listens to people,” says Karen Cornelius, one of the senator’s closest friends in law school who is now working as an unpaid special adviser to the campaign in New Hampshire.
She describes a lesser-known side of the senator as a student at the University of Chicago, where she was the smartest member of their four-woman study group but also loved going out and dancing to Prince and Tina Turner. “She’s not what would be described as a nerd at all,” Ms. Cornelius says. “She was a rock star.”
Whereas other candidates on the trail here often begin with their personal story – Mr. O’Rourke launched right into talking about his hometown of El Paso and his views on the southern border crisis before a crowd of people who live within a bike ride of Canada – Senator Klobuchar starts with the people of New Hampshire.
She calls out more than half a dozen attendees, lauds the work of the state’s two female senators, and extols an 11-year-old who asked for her autograph in church on Easter Sunday and then showed up the next day at a town hall meeting in Peterborough, N.H., where he raised his hand during the Q&A. “I’d like to know if you think if Bob Mueller testifies,” she recalls the boy asking, “should he go before the House or Senate first, and should he be at the intelligence committee or the judiciary?”
“ So New Hampshire !” she tells the crowd.
Not one for soaring rhetoric, Senator Klobuchar instead drills down on issues that New Hampshire voters care about – like the opioid crisis and access to broadband internet.
Iceland, she says, is wired for broadband. “I’ve been there – because that’s a vacation for people from Minnesota,” she jokes.
She pokes fun at President Trump – we have to use humor back at him, she tells the crowd – but also makes serious policy proposals on everything from immigration and infrastructure to mental health. But the tone remains bright throughout, without the Sturm und Drang that characterizes some of her rivals’ stump speeches. She talks about governing from a standpoint of opportunity, rather than chaos and division.
“Anger is not a plan. Anger is not how you govern. Anger is how we got to where we are right now,” says Michael Atkins, a lawyer in Peterborough who came to hear the senator at the Politics & Eggs breakfast.
That said, he and his law firm partner, Jim Callahan, haven’t the slightest concern about whether she’s tough enough to parry President Trump’s jabs.
“I think she’s going to bust an aikido move and deftly avoid it,” says Mr. Callahan, who got interested in Senator Klobuchar after seeing her calm but firm questioning of then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh during last fall’s contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings. “She’ll turn it on its head to her advantage.”
“You don’t have to fight back with insults and the like,” agrees Mr. Atkins. “You should fight back with strength of character.”

Texto completo: President Donald Trump says the New York Times has committed “Treason. " If anything, the venerable Gray Lady is guilty of a far less capital offense known, in newspaper parlance, as “burying the lead. ”
That’s what editors accuse reporters of doing when they put their most interesting stuff wa-a-a-a-ay down in the middle of a story.
It’s arguably what happened over the weekend, when the Times posted a lengthy, detailed story about how the U. S. is escalating efforts to hack into Russian infrastructure as a deterrent against Russian attempts to do the same in the U. S.
Twenty-two paragraphs into the piece comes this jaw-dropper of a sentence:
“Pentagon and intelligence officials described broad hesitation to go into detail with Mr. Trump about operations against Russia for concern over his reaction — and the possibility that he might countermand it or discuss it with foreign officials, as he did in 2017 when he mentioned a sensitive operation in Syria to the Russian foreign minister. ”
It’s almost certainly this, and not the meat of the story, that prompted the president’s off-the-wall tweet about treason.
Any intimation that the Times endangered national security by reporting the cyber-campaign was preempted by the paper’s own due diligence. Unlike the president, who blithely blew a foreign ally’s cover in one of his early meetings with Russian officials, responsible news organizations give national security officials a chance to push back before publishing their secrets.
Sometimes, they bow to governmental concerns, sometimes, they don’t; the calculus always involves weighing public safety against the public’s right to know. That’s not treason; it’s the First Amendment in action.
Trump's media target: Donald Trump can use Barack Obama's bad precedent to target 'enemy of the people' media
In this case, the Times reported it was given no indication it shouldn’t publish, a signal that U. S. officials actually want the Russians to know they are in the cybercrosshairs.
If the strategy is deterrence, as it usually is when it comes to America’s old Cold War foe, that make sense. Further corroboration: Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, discussed the escalation of the anti-Russian hacking campaign at a public conference last week sponsored by The Wall Street Journal — likely the reason the Times decided to post its story, which clearly had been months in the works.
Trump’s baseless accusation against the Times came during one of his all-too-typical tweet-a-thons. He followed up by rolling out the old “Enemy of the People” chestnut to label his media critics, which would be laughable were it not for the fact that it came on the same weekend Capital Gazette editor Rick Hutzell had a silent, packed ballroom of nearly 2,000 attendees at the Investigative Reporters & Editors conference blinking back tears as he described how his small Annapolis news organization is persevering in the face of last year’s massacre of five colleagues by a deranged gunman.
It is local news organizations like Hutzell’s, which bring you news of your local city council and the school board and the ups and downs of high school sports teams, that are struggling to survive in a digital economy — not the New York Times, which the president once again this weekend described as “failing,” despite ample evidence to the contrary.
Trump, alone with lies: With Sarah Sanders leaving the White House, Trump now lies alone
The president’s reckless rhetoric reveals a stubborn habit psychologists describe as “projection. ” His decision last weekend to fire some of his pollsters after their numbers revealed some storm clouds on his political horizon is yet another case in point: Trump describes as “fake” anyone who comes close to home truths about himself.
So the president, sworn to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States” — a Constitution that includes First Amendment protection of free speech — might want to think again before bandying about charges of treason against those who speak less than favorably of him.
As someone who has worked my entire professional life in newsrooms, who occasionally has been the recipient of leaked official documents myself, and who knows official sources resort to the press only when all else has failed, I read the 22nd paragraph in the New York Times story as a cry for help.
There’s an air of desperation in the nation’s capital. And it’s not all emanating from the Twitter addict who’s too small to rise above his critics.

Texto completo: Jonathan Greenberg explica cómo el presidente Donald Trump silencia a las personas que conocen sus millonarias pérdidas de dinero y cómo hace para, aun así, parecer un gran hombre de negocios.
En el artículo publicado en The Washington Post, Greenberg expone que Trump, para convencer al mundo de que es un genio financiero, no solo fabrica y ven historias, sino que también ha silenciado a la mayoría de personas que podían poner en jaque sus mentiras .
Este periodista trabajaba para la revista Forbes, cuando Trump le llamó en dos ocasiones en 1984 para que lo incluyera en la lista de los más ricos. Cuando el New York Times publicó que entre 1985 y 1994 el actual presidente de los Estados Unidos perdió $1,100 millones de dólares , el experto se puso a revisar los documentos que tenía de aquella época y qué era lo que Trump les contaba a los periodistas.
En primer lugar, revisó una carta que el empresario mandó a Forbes en 1989 en la que afirmaba tener una fortuna por valor de $3,700 millones de dólares. Ahora es conocido que aquel año perdió $100 millones de dólares y rozó la insolvencia económica.
Greenberg también contactó con otros periodista que coincidieron con Trump durante esos años. Según estos otros profesionales, el empresario trató de bloquear sus informes sobre su imperio: inventando escándalos éticos sobre ellos, proporcionándoles documentos falsos y, en un caso, amenazando con exponer la vida privada de un ejecutivo de medios de comunicación.
Los analistas de Wall Street presenciaron una campaña de intimidación que comenzó cuando Trump hizo que uno de ellos fuera despedido por dudar de la capacidad de sus casinos para pagar sus deudas.

Texto completo: Several undocumented immigrants who were fired from President Donald Trump's golf clubs in New Jersey and New York will be speaking out against the president in Orlando, Florida ahead of his re-election launch on Tuesday.
Lawyer Anibal Romero, who represents the immigrants, said the press conference is being held to advocate for immigration reform the same day and in the same city that the president is launching his re-election campaign. Romero said he believes that immigration will once again be a focal point of Trump's campaign.
Trump will be holding a re-election rally at the Amway Center in Orlando.
"These employees who work for Donald Trump represent hundreds of people who have worked for Donald Trump as undocumented immigrants, and it shows how the administration can easily vilify and demonize immigrants and yet has no problem hiring them," Romero said.
Why will Trump be in Orlando?: Because Florida is the road to the White House
More: Trump campaign fires some of its pollsters after leaks show poor numbers for the president
Margarita Cruz and Adela Garcia, former housekeepers at Trump National Golf Club Westchester, as well as Wiston Blandon, a former dishwasher at that same club will be in attendance of the press conference in Orlando. In addition, Sandra Diaz and Victorina Morales, former housekeepers at Trump’s club in Bedminster, N. J. , will also be in attendance.
Many undocumented immigrants have been fired from Trump's clubs after some began speaking about their experiences working there. Romero said he currently represents 44 undocumented immigrants who formerly worked for the Trump Organization.
In December 2018, Diaz and Morales spoke out to the New York Times about their experience as working as undocumented immigrants in Trump's New Jersey club. Diaz, who is now a legal resident, had worked at the club from 2010 to 2013. Morales had been hired in 2013, where she often times made Trump's "nbed, cleaned his toilet and dusted his crystal golf trophies," according to the Times. Morales was fired shortly after the Times article was published.
Blandon's father, Jose Blandon, during an interview with the Washington Post said that he and his son would work 60 hours a week the Westchester club. They were hired in 2016 as dishwashers.
During his campaign announcement for the 2016 election, Trump made a campaign promise to stop migrants from entering the country illegally and to build a wall along the U. S. -Mexico border.
"It's been four years since he first launched his campaign and talked about immigrants, well you know, they're still here and they apparently have been working for him," Romero said. "I think Americans needs to know, and he knows himself, that these people are good workers. "

Unite Here, a labor union that represents many people who work for several industries, including hotels, food service, manufacturing, laundry, will also be sponsoring the event. The group also represents workers from some of Trump properties, including the Trump International Hotel in D. C.
Romero said that undocumented workers right now are being taken advantage of because of their status, and how this rally isn't just about immigrants but about workers.
"We believe that the Trump Administration has used immigrants to divide this country and we believe that once Congress can put legislation to legalize them, this problem will be fixed and we can finally end this immigration debate," he said.
"It's very easy to demonize immigrants when they're not allowed to respond," he said. "They will be there and will respond. "

Giving off good vibrations Blaine: Pollinators are disappearing -BYLN-

Texto completo: Plants and animals have some crazy lifestyles, particularly when it comes to pollination.
Pollination, as you may recall, is the transfer of pollen from one plant to another. This makes it possible for flowers to produce seeds, which, in turn, will produce more plants.
Insects need food, often in the form of plant sugars from nectar and protein from pollen. Put humans in the equation, and it’s a win-win-win situation. The plant gets to make more plants, the animal gets nutrition, and we get stuff we need — like soybeans, cotton, apples, tomatoes, and Tequila.
Pollination ranges from the straightforward to the intricate and complex. In the latter category is buzz pollination (or, to be fancy, "sonication"). Bumblebees seek nectar and pollen for food for their growing colonies in the summer.
Flowers in the tomato family have tons of nutritious pollen, but they don’t give it out for free. The flower won’t release its pollen unless it "hears" a certain vibration.
Bumblebees, it turns out, give off good vibes. In fact, just the right vibes.
Grasping onto the flower by the anthers, the bumblebee buzzes with a specific frequency. At this frequency, the flower explodes with pollen, giving the bumblebee its protein and coating it with pollen.
Thus doused, the bumblebee heads right to another flower, taking the pollen from Flower One to Flower Two, and on to many others.
Scientists have determined that the frequency of buzz pollination is equivalent to a C note on a tuning fork. (Or, the "Hey" in "Hey Jude," for those Paul McCartney fans out there.) And speaking of music, recent research has revealed an amazing new page in the pollination songbook.
Some flowers produce sweeter nectar when they hear pollinators approaching.
Yep, they "hear" or detect the vibrations of pollinators.
Michelle Z. Donahue reported in the January 2019 issue of National Geographic some exciting studies undertaken by Lilach Hadany of Tel Aviv University.
"Hadany’s team looked at evening primroses," wrote Donahue, "and found that within minutes of sensing vibrations from pollinators’ wings, the plants temporarily increased the concentration of sugar in their flowers’ nectar. In effect, the flowers themselves served as ears, picking up the specific frequencies of bees’ wings while tuning out irrelevant sounds like wind."
Sweet!
The Tel Aviv researchers also looked at flower shape and the ability to sense approaching pollinators. Plants with bowl-shaped flowers may be able to detect sound better than others.
"This makes them perfect for receiving and amplifying sound waves," explained Donahue, "much like a satellite dish."
This exciting research has launched a new field of study called phytoacoustics. It all goes to show that sometimes you do need to sing for your supper.
Another amazing plant-pollinator relationship has been recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."
Crazy? You bet. You can read details of the research methods and conclusions in the April 2019 issue of Plant Signaling and Behavior.
A close-to-home example of unusual pollination is the skunk cabbage-carrion insect relationship.
Skunk cabbage, as the name implies, is a smelly plant that grows in wet woods. It’s one of the first plants to flower each year — often in February when the snow is still on the ground.
The flower is definitely not bouquet-worthy. It’s dark maroon, lacks petals, and is hidden by an overarching structure.
The color, as well as the stench of the flower, mimic dead, rotting things — hence attracting carrion beetles and flies.
The flower also produces its own heat, and can maintain a comfortable 60 to 70 degrees inside the floral covering. Perfect for those carcass-loving insects.
Other examples of strange pollination abound. With each new discovery, we find that the business of life is fascinating in its complexities.
What happens when one of the partners in the intricate dance of pollination disappears?
We are losing pollinators at an alarming rate, and plant extinction continues apace. Habitat loss and pesticide use are the big culprits.
Not to end on a buzz-kill, let me present some good news to counter the bad. Everyone can chip in to restore, preserve, and protect habitat for the myriad creatures around us.

IT'S NOT JUST THE ALGORITHMS THE RADICALIZATION OF THE RIGHT GROWS ONLINE BUT IS ROOTED MOSTLY IN REAL LIFE

Texto completo: In the last month, there have been two big profiles, one in this newspaper and one in Washingtonian, of young men who were radicalized into some version of the alt-right and then later abjured far-right politics.
The Washingtonian profile is a mother's first-person account of watching her 13-year-old son join an extremist internet community and then find his way back out. The New York Times profile follows a 20-something college dropout who has turned to progressive politics after a sojourn as a "tradcon" (traditional conservative). Both pieces locate their subjects in a larger sociology, but both are especially concerned with the role of YouTube in accelerating radicalization, and in particular with the way its algorithm, intended to reward videos that prompt intense engagement, is creating a pathway into extremist content by rewarding provocation and letting content purveyors essentially monetize the rabbit hole.
Since I might be described as some sort of "tradcon" myself, I have some doubts about categorizations that purport to define the moment when respectable conservatism becomes dangerous extremism. Nonetheless I agree with several of the profiles' anti-YouTube premises: Education-by-algorithm is a bad idea; Silicon Valley has monetized amoral slippery slopes in all kinds of arenas (with pedophilia being the latest grim example); and the stew of racism and conspiracy theory at the far-right edges of social media is an example of where one such slope can lead.
That said, the profiles are rich enough to illustrate a complexity that can't just be reduced to algorithms run amok. When it comes to explaining the phenomenon of right-wing populism, liberals are likely to argue both that the populist era has exposed a darkness always present at the heart of conservative politics and that a toxic, post-truth new-media ecosystem has greased the skids for President Donald Trump, Brexit and the rest. In the case of white-identitarian media personalities popular on YouTube, the two arguments converge.
But in the profiles you can also see clear illustrations of two arguments that a certain kind of conservative - the kind who locate their politics somewhere between the Trumpians and the Resistance - is likely to offer in response to liberalism's explanations. First, that populism is a reaction to the breakdown of community outside the liberal metropole, a breakdown that the fiscally conservative-socially liberal "centrism" of our leaders has worsened or left unaddressed. And second, that far-right personalities attract people by offering an escape from the airlessness of liberalism, a chance to rebel against its cultural hegemony and increasing ideological conformism.
Caleb Cain, The Times' subject, illustrates the first argument, to the extent that he seems like a character from the pages of Charles Murray's "Coming Apart" or Tim Carney's "Alienated America" or J.D. Vance's "Hillbilly Elegy," to cite just the most prominent right-leaning authors who have written about lower-middle-class decay:
*
The internet was an escape. Mr. Cain grew up in postindustrial Appalachia and was raised by his conservative Christian grandparents. He was smart, but shy and socially awkward, and he carved out an identity during high school as a countercultural punk. He went to community college, but dropped out after three semesters.
Broke and depressed, he resolved to get his act together. He began looking for help in the same place he looked for everything: YouTube.
*
In other words, a story about the internet is also a story about the attenuation of non-online forms of community, about fatherlessness and family breakdown, about the travails of the "some college" demographic, about the social crisis of coal country and the Rust Belt. And it's therefore an example of why attempts to wall off explanations for populism into mutually exclusive "economic anxiety" and "racism" categories are so futile: There is an integrated relationship between socioeconomic conditions in downscale America and the appeal of redpilled YouTube, between changing personal and material conditions and the appeal of virtual white-identitarian "community."
There is also an integrated relationship between how elite liberalism has evolved and the kind of reactions it provokes. Here is the opening act, from the Washingtonian profile, of the suburban-D.C. episode that sent its 13-year-old subject into the online wilds in search of support and solidarity:
*
One morning during first period, a male friend of Sam's mentioned a meme whose suggestive name was an inside joke between the two of them. Sam laughed. A girl at the table overheard their private conversation, misconstrued it as a sexual reference, and reported it as sexual harassment. Sam's guidance counselor pulled him out of his next class and accused him of "breaking the law." Before long, he was in the office of a male administrator who informed him that the exchange was "illegal," hinted that the police were coming, and delivered him into the custody of the school's resource officer. At the administrator's instruction, that man ushered Sam into an empty room, handed him a blank sheet of paper, and instructed him to write a "statement of guilt."
No one called me as this unfolded, even though Sam cried for about six hours straight as staff members parked him in vacant offices to keep him away from other students. When he stepped off the bus that afternoon and I asked why his eyes were so swollen, he informed me that he would probably be suspended, but possibly also expelled and arrested.
* In an out-of-body moment, I imagined that this very episode would be cited by some future cultural critic on the limits of liberalism .
*
And yes, perhaps too predictably, here I am citing it - as a particularly vivid example, from inside the D.C. bubble, of how progressivism fosters alienation and potential rebellion long before any sinister Silicon Valley algorithms get involved. And, going further, as an example of how the alt-right's promise of "secret knowledge" about gender, race and sexuality finds a ready audience among young people primed by aspects of their own progressive education to suspect that the system is enforcing ideology rather than imparting truth.
Which, let me stress again, doesn't mean that the far-right YouTubers are actually good or the algorithms actually benign. Nor does it mean that conservatives reacting to liberal critiques of YouTube should automatically leap to the defense of either - on the assumption that as goes the YouTube success of Stefan Molyneux, so goes the non-racist right.
Yes, it's understandable for conservatives to worry that if Silicon Valley censors the likes of Mr. Molyneux, it will end up censoring them. It's sensible for them to join parts in the left in worrying about the concentrated power over information that the stewards of social-media platforms enjoy. And it's necessary for them to recognize that the influence of red-pillers and white-identitarians reflects their own failure, across the decades of movement-conservative institution building, to create something that seems more compelling to fugitives from liberalism than the Spirit of the Reddit Thread.
With all that said, though, a humane conservatism should still be able to thrive in a world where white nationalists have trouble monetizing their extremism, in which YouTube algorithms are built to maximize something other than addiction. And the endpoint of both The Times and Washingtonian profiles, in which personal contact with real-life alt-righters and counterarguments from online left-wingers suffice to pull the main characters away from the far right, suggests that the current Very Online alternative to liberalism is not necessarily built to last.
But if conservatives would be unwise to commit themselves to the defense of some inalienable right to sell crackpottery on YouTube, liberals would be equally unwise to focus so intently on the algorithm, and to pour so much energy into pressuring Silicon Valley to build a better, more progressive way of steering their readers through the information sea.
Whatever role the structure of the internet plays in radicalization, the root causes are still primarily sociological and political, and they will perdure and manifest themselves somewhere, somehow, no matter what YouTube suggests for your next video when you watch a Milton Friedman lecture.
Moreover, there is no better example of the technocratic spirit's moral idiocy than the idea that, with a social crisis in the hinterland and ideological calcification at the heart of educated power, what we need is a better algorithm to prevent people - young men, especially - from getting too restless or rebellious or extreme.
The healing of the body politic will not be accomplished with such fiddling. There may be left-wing or liberal solutions to our deeper problems. But an elite that tries to manage them away with more enlightened media curation deserves to inherit nothing but the wind.

Texto completo: Anita Hill made history in 1991 when she testified before Congress about the sexual harassment she said she had experienced while she was an aide to Clarence Thomas, a Supreme Court nominee who had been her supervisor at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. With the advent of the #MeToo movement, she has been speaking out again. She most recently made news when she criticized presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden for his handling of the Thomas hearings. She spoke with Jessica Bennett, gender editor at The New York Times, at the New Rules Summit on Women & Power last week. The excerpts from her conversation have been edited and condensed.
JESSICA BENNETT You need no introduction, but I wanted to tell a little back story of mine, which is that I was 10 years old when you testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I don't remember really understanding what was happening, but I do remember my father insisting that we leave the television on. It wasn't until many years later, when the documentary about you came out, that I really truly learned your story. But I want to ask you, how did 1991 change the course of your life?
ANITA HILL Well, you know, it's almost impossible to know. It's been almost 30 years now, so it's hard to even remember exactly what was going on in my life before. This is the new normal for me. I had not planned to be sitting in front of an audience talking with The New York Times 30 years ago. But I will say that I am still a teacher, and I do teach at a university; it's my career. I maintain that. Although the content of what I teach now is different.
The emphasis that I now have on equality was not the emphasis that my work was taking back in 1991. I was actually a contracts professor -- a contracts and commercial law person. I did some work around equality issues, but it wasn't the focus of my life. But the thing that I have to say is that what I have done is I've combined the old with the new. So when I look at equality I look also at economic inequality. And so the background is always there in terms of my profession. In terms of being a public figure, absolutely no. I would have rather spent my life in front of my computer or in a library.
[Video: Watch the full conversation: Anita Hill at the New Rules Summit. Watch on YouTube.]
MS. BENNETT You're a very private person, and a few years back my colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, our congressional reporter, profiled you. And she wrote that at the time -- this was in 2014 -- many of your students at Brandeis [University] didn't actually know your back story. You were just their professor. But at that same time, you decided to cooperate with a documentary filmmaking team. Why?
PROFESSOR HILL In 2014, I think we were really coming back to the issues that were opened up in the hearing in a brand-new way. I won't go all the way back and through all of the details of 1991, but I will remind you that after the hearings, 70 percent -- or at least a pretty wide majority of people -- thought that I had perjured myself. Most of the people polled, regardless of race, regardless of gender, believed that Clarence Thomas should be confirmed for the Supreme Court.
Many people viewing the hearings didn't even realize that sexual harassment was something that was actionable, that they could file a complaint about. They had no idea what the concept was about. So we were at a very different point. In the decades following the hearings, that changed. It changed because people started telling their stories, we started filing complaints, we had lawsuits that were filed, and the public became much more aware. There was still an issue of connecting that awareness with action. And I wanted people to understand with this new awareness what had actually happened in 1991. The film made that possible.
MS. BENNETT You wrote for us last year that during the [Brett] Kavanaugh hearings the Senate Judiciary Committee basically had an opportunity to right the wrongs of yours. Did they do that? What would you have done differently?
PROFESSOR HILL No. You know, absolutely they did not. I mean, just to start with, they should've had a process in place for receiving complaints. They had none. And can you imagine that we are putting judges on the bench -- not just on the Supreme Court, but on the trial court benches, on the courts of appeal benches -- who may in fact have complaints against them, but where people are not able to come forward because they don't have a system to come forward in.
One of the big discussions of the Kavanaugh hearing was, you know, what should've happened to Christine Blasey Ford's complaint. Even though it was out there, it was known, there was no way for her to know how to be heard. We also know that in the process they put together at the last minute, there was this chilling effect -- there may have been other witnesses who might've come forward.
MS. BENNETT I want to ask you about Joe Biden, because he oversaw the Senate Judiciary Committee during your hearings. And this, to remind, was an all-white, all-male panel. And he recently called you to express regret for how you were treated. And you said that you weren't satisfied by that. Some time has passed now -- has he corrected that?
PROFESSOR HILL Well, let me just say that my concern at this moment is that 27, almost 28 years later, what we want from our leaders is for someone or someone(s) to step up and say, "What happened in 1991, what happened in 2018, will never happen again."
And beyond that, that the government is going to put together all of the resources that it has to make sure that the government processes are a model for what's going on in our workplaces. We want them to be not the bad example that we learn from, but the good example. And it has to start with leadership at the top.
One of the things that we know for sure is that leadership at the top on any issue, in any institution, is what changes the game. If you want to talk about new rules you can put together all of the new rules that you want to. But if you don't have leadership behind those rules, they don't get effective.
MS. BENNETT In the year after your testimony, complaints to the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] about sexual harassment went up 73 percent. Some of the working women's groups like 9to5 reported their phone lines ringing off the hook with women -- largely women -- saying: "You mean this is illegal? You mean I can do something about this?" And, of course, in the year after, a record number of women ran for Congress. Why did it take so long for #MeToo to happen?
PROFESSOR HILL Because I think we had to come to terms with a number of facts. We had to come to terms with the fact that people really didn't know that this was illegal. I mean, it had been so normalized in our workplaces that people just assumed this is the way life is. And then we had to start thinking about, what kinds of things do we need to do?
And I think the first approach was to say, let's change behavior. That's all we have to do. We've got to, you know, get a few bad apples out of the system and that's going to be enough. Then we realized that that wasn't enough, that the few bad apples really was not entirely the problem, that what we had were cultural problems, and cultural acceptance of it, and that around the cultural acceptance were structures that were built to support it. And that includes some legal structures that were built.
The nondisclosure agreements that were put into place, the forced mediation around claims of abuse in the workplace -- those were things that we just sort of had thought of as neutral, but were actually contributing greatly to an ongoing problem. So we didn't really understand the complexity of it.
And the #MeToo movement came about because we started to understand the complexity of it, and, I will say, because the press started covering it. And if you don't have all of those things coming together, you're not going to have the kind of reckoning that actually engages people and puts together out there the stories and the analysis that will make for a #MeToo movement, and that invites other people to come in and engage in the conversation.
MS. BENNETT Do you see parallels to your experience there? You've spoken a lot about the letters you received, hundreds upon thousands of letters that came to you. And now there seem to be communities sprouting up. Was it an incredibly isolating experience for you to speak out?
PROFESSOR HILL Well, you saw the pictures. There I am, and there were not a lot of people who were joining publicly. But in a way, the letters do reflect a kind of connection that people made with me, and with that hearing, and with the issue -- connections that ranged from sexual harassment to sexual assault, to incest, to domestic violence. We didn't have the platforms. And now we have a different platform.
MS. BENNETT I was speaking with a sociologist who's here and we were talking about people who find themselves at the front lines of movements -- sometimes purposefully, sometimes reluctantly. You've found yourself there. Was there a cost to that? What is the cost?
PROFESSOR HILL Yes, there was a cost. And I don't spend a lot of time trying to calculate the cost. What I do spend time doing is trying to make sure that the benefits outweigh the cost, that I can move forward and have positive outcomes. You know, a lot of people came to me after the hearing and said, "People aren't going to come forward now," and some people blamed me for that. And I was determined that I was not going to be the reason that people didn't come forward.
I had two things going for me. I had youth -- you know, I was 35 years old -- and I have a lot of patience. And more and more I think the ability to take the long view, to see -- to measure progress, not just about in my lifetime, but to measure progress through the lifetime of women, to realize that we have moved forward, but also to take the long view in looking forward to thinking about what we can do for the next generation.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's campaign has decided to purge some of its pollsters after a leak of dismal internal polls for the president that he denied existed.
Just two days before the president is set to kick off his bid for re-election, a top adviser said on Sunday that the campaign was cutting ties with three of its five pollsters to prevent further disclosure of survey data.
The polling showed Mr. Trump behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in several key battleground states, including by double digits in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The results were confirmed to The New York Times by advisers to Mr. Trump, but when they became public, he called them "fake polls."
For days, aides to Mr. Trump have tried to figure out whom to point the finger at over the leak of the data, which jolted and infuriated the president. But in continuing to discuss it, aides violated a long-held unofficial rule of campaigns not to comment publicly on internal polling, even if the numbers leak.
The resulting furor led to an effort by the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to tighten control. By removing several pollsters, the campaign hopes to shrink the circle of outside operatives who have access to information that could leak, according to the presidential adviser, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
The rupture of the team came even as the president and his advisers were preparing for a large and elaborate rally in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday night to formally open his campaign for a second term. Mr. Trump was hoping for a show of strength as Democrats had drawn increasing attention before their first debates on June 26 and 27.
The internal poll numbers, while not predictive, painted a bleak picture of the current state of the race for Mr. Trump, at least against Mr. Biden, when they were taken in March. They showed a number of critical states at risk -- not just Florida and the Midwestern states, but even some longtime Republican bastions like Georgia. A Democratic state that Mr. Trump's aides have insisted they want to put in play, Minnesota, appeared out of reach for the president.
The polling was reported on by The Times nearly two months ago without citing specific numbers. Last week, The Times reported that Mr. Trump had told aides to deny that such polls existed and to say that other data in the survey showed him doing well.
Some aides to the president appeared to be using the episode to undermine one of his closest advisers, Kellyanne Conway, who was Mr. Trump's final campaign manager in 2016 and is now his White House counselor. Ms. Conway's relationship with Mr. Trump, and the praise he has given her for his 2016 victory, have long stirred envy among other advisers to the president. Her former firm, the Polling Company, was one of the ones to be ousted. Ms. Conway no longer has any formal ties to the company, which was sold in 2017 to CRC Public Relations, a well-known conservative advocacy firm.
In addition to Ms. Conway's former firm, the Trump adviser said the campaign would cut ties with Adam Geller, a pollster for former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Michael Baselice, a pollster for former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, both late additions to Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016.
[Want to know what it's like to cover the White House? Ask our White House correspondent, Maggie Haberman, here.]
NBC News first reported the decision to oust the pollsters, although it did not identify which ones. Two other pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, will remain with the campaign. Mr. Fabrizio conducted the March survey for Mr. Trump. As a pollster, he worked for Mr. Trump's company many years ago, but he was brought into the 2016 campaign by Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, who was one of the people charged by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. McLaughlin has known Mr. Trump for years and did informal work for him in 2011 when the real estate developer was considering running for president.
Mr. Fabrizio and Ms. Conway declined to comment. Mr. McLaughlin and the other pollsters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has angrily denied receiving polls showing him losing or instructing aides to deny them. "Those polls don't exist," Mr. Trump told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Thursday. "I just had a meeting with somebody that's a pollster and I'm winning everywhere, so I don't know what you're talking about."
But on Friday, ABC reported specific information from that supposedly fake polling. The data obtained by ABC showed Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump 55 percent to 39 percent in Pennsylvania, 51 percent to 41 percent in Wisconsin and by seven points in Florida. The president was leading in Texas, a bulwark for Republican presidential candidates for four decades, by just two points.
When approached by the network with the numbers, Mr. Parscale confirmed that they were accurate, but dismissed them as outdated, insisting that the president's public standing had subsequently been helped by Attorney General William P. Barr's initial characterization of the special counsel's report. A redacted version of Mr. Mueller's report has since been released, showing that it was not as favorable as Mr. Barr suggested.
"These leaked numbers are ancient, in campaign terms, from months-old polling that began in March before two major events had occurred: the release of the summary of the Mueller report exonerating the president, and the beginning of the Democrat candidates defining themselves with their far-left policy message," Mr. Parscale said in a statement on Friday.
"Since then, we have seen huge swings in the president's favor across the 17 states we have polled, based on the policies now espoused by the Democrats," he said. "The president is correct that we have no current polls against defined Democrats -- at all -- that show him losing in any of the states we have tested."
The more recent survey conducted by the campaign involved extensive message-testing -- in other words, asking questions about support for Mr. Trump only after first describing the Democrats in negative terms, according to two people familiar with the data. Such polling methods can be useful in assessing the strength of various messages but are not considered meaningful bottom-line measures of the current state of a campaign.
NBC on Sunday reported further data from the Trump campaign polls in March. The president trailed Mr. Biden by one point in Ohio, six points in Georgia, seven points in Iowa, eight points in North Carolina, 14 points in Minnesota, 15 points in Maine and 17 points in Virginia.
Internal polls, like any other surveys, are a snapshot in time and not predictive more than 18 months from Election Day, especially with Mr. Trump's Democratic challenger yet to be determined. Historically, they are used by campaigns to guide their understanding of where to expend resources, and of the mood of the electorate.
But Mr. Trump is famously focused on numbers as affirmation -- the larger the better -- and he has recoiled at suggestions that he is struggling in a general election matchup. Throughout 2016, Mr. Trump began almost every conversation with reporters by highlighting his polling lead in public surveys of the Republican primary field.
"Well, the polls I see, we're doing great in Pennsylvania," he said in a telephone interview with "Fox & Friends" on Friday. "We're doing really good in North Carolina. Florida, I'm winning by a lot. Ohio, I'm winning by a lot. I just left Iowa. We're winning that by a lot. And every poll that I see and every poll that we have, I'm winning by -- we're doing well."

Texto completo: As subtitles go, the one Laurence Scott chose for his new book, "Picnic Comma Lightning," is certainly on the ambitious side: "The Experience of Reality in the Twenty-First Century." Scott's hard-to-categorize, essayistic investigation of reality and technology is literary, cultural and deeply personal. The literary side is reflected in his title, which is taken from Humbert Humbert's terse description of the cause of his mother's death in "Lolita": "(picnic, lightning)." The personal involves the deaths of Scott's own parents: his mother in 2010, when he was 30, and his father in 2012. Scott is interested in the ways social media and other technologies change our understanding of what is public and private. It's a capacious book, moving freely from Walter Benjamin to the TV soap "Dynasty"; from the "metaphysics" of Marie Kondo to Heidegger's consideration of the question "What is a thing?" Below, Scott talks about Brexit, influencers, how our feelings have become big business and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
In 2015, I'd just written "The Four-Dimensional Human." In that book, I was trying to explore the new pleasures, anxieties and etiquette of inhabiting the fourth dimension: the internet and social media. I wanted to broaden that and look at how technologies blur the boundary between our private and public lives in new ways.
As I write in the book, my parents died in "impolite succession." What I noticed when I thought about digital life was that death really calls into question what a real person is. The dead often feel very present and real to us. I wanted to see if the experience of personal bereavement could help illuminate larger cultural shifts in our sense of reality and the reality of other people.
I didn't want to write a book that gives a plan for living happily in the digital age. I have almost no suggestions for that. I just wanted to communicate how this new world feels to me, and hopefully readers would recognize some of those feelings in themselves: I find this weird; do you find this weird?
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
I've unexpectedly coined the term Big Emotion in this book. I thought it must have been used somewhere else, but as far as I can tell, it's just me. I use it to describe the multibillion-dollar industry that uses the power of big data and machine learning to study the emotions of consumers. If businesses know how we're feeling at any moment, they can know better how to sell us things. Stores are already using facial-recognition cameras that can tell when our eyes are dilated with interest, maybe when we're about to buy a product.
I was surprised to learn, while researching that chapter, that there's a whole industry of people called "sentiment analysts" or "opinion miners." They're paid to find the real meaning of our social media posts. They might write a program, for instance, to detect when a tweet is sarcastic or not. Sarcasm is a huge problem for them.
So, knowing our feelings is really big business. The irony I wanted to explore is that while we're always being asked about how we feel -- every service we use online is punctuated by a survey; "What was your experience on a scale of 1 to 6?" -- expressing our feelings online is regularly getting us in trouble. A good example of this was in London, when someone excitedly posted on social media: "It's snowing!" And various people said, "This is going to be awful for homeless people tonight." Our private thoughts are often tactless when said to a large audience.
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
It got different quite quickly. I had just sat down to write, and the times suddenly became hyper-unreal. Publishers accepted the proposal in June 2016, at exactly the same time Brexit was unfolding and a few months before the Trump administration, and both events have had a huge impact on our sense of reality. I was writing just as "fake news" and "post-truth" were becoming buzzwords. In Brexit, the debate, on both sides, was about fantasy. Both Leave and Remain voters were accusing their opponents of living in a land of make-believe at every stage, dismissing the opposite view as a kind of hallucination.
The figure of the influencer also rose to prominence during this time. Influencers are amazing symbols of unreality, because their authentic feelings are often indistinguishable from those dictated by whatever corporate partnerships they have. When I proposed the book, I didn't even mention influencers. So I had to bring in these subjects as I went, which I think gave the writing of the book a kind of urgency.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
There's a BBC series, some of it available on YouTube, called "What Do Artists Do All Day?" Each episode features a day in the working life of various artists: Tracey Emin, the British visual artist; an etcher called Norman Ackroyd. There's something about the rhythm of these half-hour programs that I would return to. It was this concentrated effort of focus, like there was no other life but the concern of what was on the etching plate or the canvas. There was a certain artistic intensity -- something about the artist in a purified, distilled form -- that helped me.
The novelist John Banville once said something like, "Isn't it terrible to be a full-grown man and still crying about your mommy?" I love that. My mother was a creative person and amateur visual artist, and even more than that, her sensibility shaped me. When I was growing up, she made me more afraid of being a boring child than a naughty child. That was an aesthetic and moral education for me, and useful for a writer: Don't be boring or repetitive, and always say something worth thinking about. To this day, she keeps my paragraphs in check.
Persuade someone to read "Picnic Comma Lightning" in 50 words or less.
Ours is a weird age of both endless data and limitless skepticism. Social media profits from turning private lives into public monuments. Our gadgets can now decide when we've watched too much television. But when these unreal times meet the unquestionable fact of death, what becomes of those we've lost?

�
Many thin-skinned dictators jail the newspaper cartoonists who mock them, but in the past few weeks some U.S. newspapers have done the next best thing and eliminated those pesky troublemakers from their pages.
After publishing an ill-advised cartoon in its international edition in May that was broadly decried as anti-Semitic, The New York Times panicked. After apologizing, it abandoned journalistic tradition last week when it announced that starting next month it will discontinue the use of syndicated editorial cartoons. Soon after, the editors informed cartoonists Patrick Chappate and Heng Kim Song that their contracted services were no longer required.
The Times was only a tepid supporter of the art of political cartooning, but at least it deigned to give the form a nod in its international edition. Its former Sunday Week in Review section phased out a wildly popular feature which was a roundup of the work of editorial cartoonists from around the nation, setting in motion an inexorable slide toward last week's no-cartoons edict.
The commotion over the Times' decision has overshadowed a similar recent blow to the craft. GateHouse Media cut loose political cartoonists from its chain of 156 daily newspapers in what appears to be a reflexive response to another controversial cartoon - which contained an insulting visual gag at the expense of transgender people. Terminated were staff cartoonists Nate Beeler at The Columbus Dispatch, Rick McKee of The Augusta Chronicle, and Mark Streeter of the Savannah Morning News. The chain's freelance cartoonists were simultaneously dismissed as well, including Long Island Business News' Matt Bodkin, who contributes a weekly cartoon Newsday publishes on Saturday.
There is a feeble dissonance about these newspapers - which would probably editorialize against the unfairness of collective punishment. Instead they deprive readers of a unique form of commentary because of just one bad drawing that caused a furor.
I've heard the argument that these dismissals are dull, revenue-based actions. I may be accused of being naive, but that's an argument I find unconvincing. If money and audience eyeballs are the issue, then the outcry over a poorly considered cartoon beautifully illustrates the massive levels of attention cartoonists and their work generate. And attention in this business is good.
But I am biased. I like cartoons, even the ones with which I vehemently disagree. Readers don't need to be protected. This removal of a raucous genre leads inevitably to the uncomfortable question: What else are we being protected from?

Texto completo: Special to the Star Tribune
How miserable is too miserable? Taffy Brodesser-Akner poses the question and successfully mines it for laughs in her first novel. But comedy is not her primary goal here. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" is funny, yes, but also savage, landing blows with efficient and deadly precision, fearless in its ravaging of gender double standards, the inequities of modern marriage and the bewildering intersection of sex and technology.
The would-be hero is Toby Fleishman, a 41-year-old Manhattan doctor who has just discovered app dating (although "dating" is hardly the right word). Father of two and in the process of divorcing Rachel, his ambitious, social-climbing shrew of a wife, Toby is stunned by the carnal universe inside his phone. So many choices! So many inscrutable emojis! So many assertive, attractive, intelligent women ready for hookups!
"These were women who would not so much wait for you to call them one or two or three socially acceptable days after you met them as much as send you pictures of their genitals the day before."
Toby's split with Rachel has been ugly and exhausting. She seems to care more about work and scheduling play dates with the offspring of rich and influential parents than she does about Toby or their children.
And now she has vanished and isn't responding to texts or calls, leaving Toby to manage the kids during summer vacation, all in the name of me time.
Toby is such a mess that he can't even narrate his own nightmare. That duty falls to his college friend Libby. Once a writer at a men's magazine, now a stay-at-home mom in the suburbs, Libby is at a bit of a loss herself. She can't seem to write the novel she wants to write. She misses her old job, although she struggled with its unspoken institutional belief that men's stories matter most. The "only way to get someone to listen to a woman," she knows, is "to tell her story through a man."
Wait.
What if "Fleishman Is in Trouble" isn't about a cold, dismissive wife who doesn't appreciate her husband? What if there's another story? What if it's about the devaluation of women once they have children? Or maybe the insane expectations on working mothers, on stay-at-home mothers, on women, period? What if the "The Future Is Female" T-shirts are all we get by way of compensation for a very bad deal?
A staff writer for the New York Times Magazine, Brodesser-Akner turns the tables on Toby with wit, insight and a bracing, simmering rage. She offers a view of truths we may fear to examine too closely. How miserable is too miserable? Keep asking, she urges. Maybe one day, we'll find out.

Summer Solstice Jazz Festival to light up East Lansing

Texto completo: Artistic director Rodney Whitaker always approaches planning for the annual Summer Solstice Jazz Festival with a clear idea. He likes to mix local talent with young upcoming stars from New York, Chicago or elsewhere.
Over its 23-year history that plan has resulted is a wide variety jazz and we have heard many great up and comers, like heard bassist and singer Esperanza Spaulding, trumpet player Bria Skonberg and saxophonist Grace Kelly before they were internationally known.
This year, Whitaker is taking a different approach.
"I thought that so many of our jazz faculty at Michigan State University play with musicians from all over the country, why don't we bring those folks in so they can all play together?"
The Festival runs June 21 and June 22 in downtown East Lansing on Albert Street, between Bailey and Charles.
One of the headliners will be an MSU trumpet prof, Etienne Charles, who has developed a huge international career in the eight years that he's been at Michigan State. For the release of a new album, "Carnival, The Music of a People" The New York Times sent a writer to East Lansing for a feature story.
Originally from Trinidad, Charles received his master's degree from Julliard and undergrad from Florida State before he came to Michigan State. "I was younger than many of most of the graduate students when I first came here."
Speaking with Charles on the telephone is a fun experience. His speech has the soft lilt rhythms of the Caribbean along with a youthful excitement of living the life of his dreams ("Shh. Don't tell anybody.") – teaching, traveling the world, and playing jazz with his cherished colleagues. He even claims to love living in East Lansing.
"Playing professionally outside of MSU to build a career, is part of my job. I have to maintain a significant profile as a performer."
And he's done that. He just became a member of the jazz's best all-star band, the SFJAZZ Collective, has recorded seven CDs and has toured through Europe, South America, California, Africa, Jakarta, and Aspen.
Charles said, "We sort of built a conga line all over the world. We groove a lot. But when Rodney asked me to put my group together for the festival, I realized that we haven 't played in East Lansing for a long time and that would great."
The jazz trumpeter loves to connect with people through his music. "I love music for what it does for me and what it does for people. I love to see people squirming in their chairs because they just can't stop moving to the music. They've got to dance."
Also appearing is Randy Gelispie, drummer, and his Organ Ensemble. Gelispie, 84, has had one of the most remarkable careers where he has toured the country with all of the jazz greats for 30 years, but then his wife became sick and he came to Lansing and worked at the General Motors plant.
On the road Gelispie played every kind of music you can imagine and now he teaches that to his students at MSU. "In those 30 years I had to play every kind of style. I just listened to the players like mad and whatever they wanted to do; I would go that way."
On a tour, Saxophonist Cannonball Adderley said, "Boy, you sure can swing."
"And that's the secret of being a good drummer," says Gelispie. "You have to swing. I always tell my young students. 'You've got to make it swing.'"
Gelispie loves the electric organ, the Hammond B3, made famous in the '50s and '60s by Jimmy Smith. For the group he's assembling for the Festival, he is bringing in Bill Heid, a legendary keyboard man. With him will be MSU profs Michael Dease on trombone, Diego Rivera on saxophone and guitarist Fareed Haque from Chicago.
Although Gelispie loves natural acoustic music, he doesn't shy away from electric organ and guitar. "I listen to the line, the music and the feeling of the music. I just love it all."
Has he slowed down at age 84? An indomitable Gelispie says, "Man, I can play those tempos just as fast as I ever could. I'm still going strong."
Friday, June 21, 4-11 p.m.; Saturday, June 22, 2:30-11 p.m.
The Founders' Stage will be in the Bailey Parking Lot, 139 Bailey St.,; the Education Stage will be adjacent to the Albert-Division intersection.
Friday night headliner is Jane Bunnett & Maqueque, an all-female sextet known for their Afro-Cuban jazz.
Saturday night headliner is Straight Ahead, an all-female quartet of Grammy-nominated recording artists from Detroit.
Other 2019 Founders' Stage performers include the Randy Gelispie Organ Ensemble, Etienne Charles, Maureen Choi, Xavier Davis Quartet with Regina Carter and the Rodney Whitaker Sextet.
The 2019 Education Stage performers include the Stanley Ruvinov Quartet, Jordyn Davis, Tim Blackmon & Tissa Khosla, Jeff Shoup Quartet, 496 West, JAMM, Margherita Fava Quartet, Brandon Rose, The Becoming Quintet, Max Colley and Root Doctor.

Texto completo: O n July 13, 1860, the hottest ticket in town was to a public hanging.
Thousands of New Yorkers jammed ferries out to Bedloe's Island for the execution. Those with a little extra money ponied up a dollar, for all the beer and oysters they could hold. A great show was promised on what's now Liberty Island.
After all, this was no common criminal. This was Albert Hicks - serial killer, ax-murderer and "The Last Pirate of New York."
That's also the title of Rich Cohen's new book. Its subtitle, "A Ghost Ship, a Killer and the Birth of a Gangster Nation," hints at additional horrors in store. Hicks wasn't just a proud and prolific criminal. He was a charismatic figure, the country's original celebrity psycho.
Today there are movies about human monsters like Charles Manson, murderous mobsters like John Gotti. But it all began with Hicks, Cohen writes, the first front-page fiend and star of New York's last public execution.
The crime that finally tripped up Hicks was gruesome, even for him. One night, an oyster sloop, the E.A. Johnson, was found drifting off the coast of Brooklyn. Tugboats towed the ship, slick with blood, to the Fulton Fish Market.
There was no sign of the crew, though. Not unless you counted the four fingers and a thumb scattered on the deck. But at least one survivor had taken the yawl, a small sailboat usually lashed to the stern. New York's Harbor Patrol finally found it on the Staten Island shore, abandoned in the tall weeds.
Strangers stood out in that rural borough, though. Locals noticed a tall, dark man with a heavy bag trudging to the ferry. Detectives finally picked up his trail in Manhattan. His cheap apartment was already cleaned out. Neighbors identified him as Albert Hicks and said he had recently been spending money like, well, a drunken sailor. He also told them he and his wife and child were moving, perhaps to Rhode Island.
The police tailed the family to rented rooms in Providence. Hicks had $100 cash on him and a watch belonging to Capt. George Burr, the sloop's slain skipper.
Hicks was accused of hacking up Burr and two other crew members, then tossing their corpses overboard. The lack of bodies made a murder conviction difficult, however. Since this happened at sea, prosecutors could charge piracy.
That made it a federal crime and a capital offense. The trial was brief. One witness swore he had seen Hicks hire on as the E.A. Johnson's new first mate. Others identified some of his possessions as belonging to the dead sailors. Hicks never took the stand.
The jury took all of seven minutes to convict. The judge, calling his crimes "inhuman and revolting," sentenced Hicks to death. The prisoner was led away to await public execution.
He had already found fame.
The silent killer with the coal-black eyes fascinated New Yorkers. A phrenologist studied the bumps on Hicks' head and pronounced him prone to excitability. P.T. Barnum took a cast of his face, to help construct a wax statue for his museum of oddities.
Meanwhile, the fledgling New York Times landed a Death Row interview in which Hicks revealed that there were actually five aboard the ship that night. "The devil was the fifth personage," he explained. "He possessed me."
Hicks said he had taken the job because the oyster trade was a cash-only business, meaning there would be money onboard. A few hours after they set sail, he went after the crew with an ax, decapitating one of them. Then he threw the bodies into the sea.
It was a sensational confession, but it annoyed Hicks that the Times would be the only one to profit by it. So the murderer found a publisher willing to pay for his whole story. Send someone to take it down, he said. There was a lot the public still didn't know. Such as the 97 other murders he had committed.
Hicks had always been hungry for excitement, he admitted. At 15, he ran away from his father's farm in Rhode Island, looking for adventure. He was soon arrested for stealing two pieces of luggage and sent to the penitentiary.
Hicks escaped twice and was recaptured both times. He did time on a chain gang and spent a year in solitary. By the time he was released, Hicks was 18. He said he was also now determined to be the criminal they said he was.
For more than 20 years, he would rob and kill, amassing small fortunes, throwing them away in debauches, then heading out to plunder and murder some more.
Most of his crimes were committed at sea, where Hicks would sign on as a sailor, then persuade the rest of the crew to mutiny. It wasn't hard at a time when men were often shanghaied into service, and brutal whippings were routine.
Once they murdered the officers and divvied up the spoils, the mutineers would sail the ship to a new port, and abandon it. After Hicks had run through his share of the take, he would sign on with another ship, and repeat the process.
When the sea began to bore, he plied his trade on land. The Gold Rush of '49 was a gamble for many, but not for Hicks. His sure bet was ambushing successful prospectors. After, he moved to Mexico and briefly went legit, buying a hotel in Mazatlan. Old habits, though, are hard to break. Hicks couldn't resist robbing and murdering, even his own guests. When the Mexican police became suspicious, Hicks fled, leaving behind most of his fortune.
Hicks went back to sea then, fomenting more mutinies. He also spent a year on a genuine, black-flagged pirate ship, the Ann Mills, sailing from Marseille to Constantinople, smuggling slaves, and rum. Finally, nearing 40, Hicks decided it was time to return home. He found a job on an English ship sailing to America.
And, to his shock, fell for an Irish immigrant girl.
History doesn't record her name. But he had a rough charm, and she - reportedly poor, nearsighted, and already 23 - likely had few prospects. Once they married and settled in Manhattan, she had a child and stayed at home. He went out and looked for work.
She discovered what kind of work later, from the police.
Hicks' book-length confession was published the day of his execution. There are no reports on whether the volume profited his heirs. But his hanging drew some 20,000 impatient spectators.
"Make haste," Hicks told his executioner.
It took two tries before doctors would pronounce him dead. Then the authorities hoisted the corpse up one more time, just so everyone could have a good look. The crowd was drunk and rowdy, and it was best to give them what they came for.
The bloody pirate's reign of terror was over, but there was still one more crime to come. When his widow went to Potter's Field to reclaim his body, she found only a freshly dug hole. The city's most notorious thief finally had been robbed himself, and of the only thing he had left.
The body snatchers got there first.

Pastor, protesters clash; 'Make America Straight Again' event draws confrontation

Texto completo: An Arizona pastor attending a "Make America Straight Again" event at a Lake County church told a crowd of protesters Saturday that homosexuality was a "perversion" and gay people ruined the city of San Francisco.
Pastor Steven Anderson, who founded Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, spoke to the crowd that gathered near the parking lot outside the Revival Baptist Church of Orlando, which planned the three-day event focusing on homosexuality. The Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled Faithful Word an anti-LGBT hate group.
Pastor Patrick Boyle of the Lake County church has called for the arrest and execution of gays and lesbians and said he is "adamantly opposed" to homosexuality, which he believes should be illegal.
Boyle initially would not reveal the location of the event, saying he didn't want to draw protesters.
But about 100 people gathered on the edge of the church property along US-27 and across the street in front of a McDonald's.
A suitcase in tow, Anderson stepped out of the church and confronted the crowd for about a minute, telling them that "if you're going to be hanging around with a bunch of [expletive] and weirdos, you're going to be condemned with them."
He said the city of San Francisco was "built by straight people. Now people [are] taking a crap in the street."
Protesters repeated the line "love is love" while face-to-face with Anderson and held signs that said "God is love" and "love always wins."
"This isn't love, it's perversion," he said.
Anderson started Faithful Word in 2005, according to its website. Its doctrinal statement says its members "believe that homosexuality is a sin and an abomination which God punishes with the death penalty."
After the 2016 shooting at Pulse Nightclub, Anderson posted a video on Youtube in which he praised the massacre, saying "[t]he good news is that there's 50 less pedophiles in this world," the New York Times reported.
A Facebook event organizing the protest of the Make America Straight Again event said it would be a "firm (yet loving) opposition to blatant discrimination and intolerance" and included tips to avoid violence, such as urging attendees not to trespass, provoke people and to remain calm.
Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. John Herrell said Thursday the event "looks like a hate group," and that the agency refused to hire deputies for off-duty security at the church, rejecting a request from Boyle.

Parties fight over UTC headquarters departure

Texto completo: The state Capitol complex in Hartford was eerily quiet last week as lawmakers took some time to decompress after the legislative session ended June 5. But the partisan sniping didn't stop, with Republicans and Democrats wrangled over the departure of another corporate headquarters and the as-of-yet-unsigned state budget. There was some reprieve from talk of tolls, but Gov. Ned Lamont plans to meet with legislative leaders this coming week to continue negotiations ahead of a planned vote on tolls in a special session. No date for that session has been set yet.

The big story
*UTC HQ to Boston: United Technologies Corp. is moving its headquarters from Farmington to Greater Boston, taking about 100 high-paying executives with it. The move comes as UTC merges with Waltham, Mass.-based Raytheon Co., a major defense manufacturer, to form Raytheon Technologies. The loss of another corporate headquarters stings, and Republicans in the General Assembly blamed the state's tax policy. Democrats said the departure was a business decision, and noted that Massachusetts is not a cheaper place to do business. UTC CEO Greg Hayes confirmed that later in the week, saying Wednesday it was "patently false" the headquarters was moving because of high taxes. Civic leaders said Connecticut can't compete head-to-head with Boston in many categories, but the state must focus on selling its strengths. Meanwhile, business leaders said Connecticut legislators must double down on job training efforts to prepare for new jobs generated by the merger.
Five things you may have missed
*Republicans say budget isn't balanced: GOP legislators ramped up their criticism of the two-year, $43 billion state budget last week, arguing nearly $460 million in state employee savings counted on to balance the budget are based on agreements with unions that haven't been reached yet. Senate Republican leader Len Fasano of North Haven called the budget unconstitutional and urged Lamont to veto it. At a news conference about half an hour later, Lamont pledged to sign the budget bill and said Republicans should be thanking him for the savings he was able to realize by refinancing pension payments and trimming health care costs. The governor's budget director, Melissa McCaw, said most of the savings don't need to be negotiated with the unions and there was nothing unusual about a budget including savings targets.
*Unfunded pensions drive UConn budget gap: The state's chronic underfunding of state employee pensions is causing consternation at the state's flagship university, where officials say budgets would be balanced if it weren't for massive pension payments that are required to catch up for the decades when retiree benefits weren't properly funded. The budget gap for UConn was $19.6 million. The deficit at UConn Health was $7.1 million but would have been far greater if state legislators had not agreed to an additional $33.2 million to cover pension costs at the health center in the final days of budget negotiations. UConn is in the fourth year of a four-year tuition increase plan and while no additional tuition hikes are planned, officials did not take that option off the table.
*Feds squash Connecticut's tax workaround: The Treasury Department has issued regulations that effectively kill legislation enacted in Connecticut last year that would have allowed state residents to donate to a nonprofit established by their city or town and receive a local property tax credit in return. The legislation was seen as a workaround to a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions that was included as part of President Donald Trump and Republicans' federal tax reform. The cap disproportionately impacts taxpayers in high-tax states, who often write off far more than $10,000 in state and local taxes. Charitable donations remain uncapped. The Treasury Department has yet to weigh in on a separate tax workaround that allows small business owners in Connecticut to take bigger federal deductions.
*Courtney nixes Air Force One paint job: Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, dealt a blow to President Donald Trump's plans to repaint Air Force One red, white and blue during negotiations over Pentagon spending last week. An amendment he authored, which would require congressional approval for excessive spending on "interior, paint and fixates" for the aircraft, was adopted on a party line vote. Trump made an off-hand remark about a year ago that he wanted a red, white and blue paint scheme on the iconic Air Force One and mentioned outfitting the plane with gold-plated fixtures like those at Trump Tower in New York City and Mar-a-Lago in Florida. Courtney, in introducing the amendment, said additional paint can add weight and new fixtures can increase costs or cause delays in the new Air Force One planes being delivered.
*Ideanomics project stalls in West Hartford:Progress on a proposed financial technology center at the former UConn campus in West Hartford came to a halt after the CEO of Ideanomics suspended work at the site citing "regrettable and unreconcilable differences with the State of Connecticut." After a meeting with Lamont last week, CEO Alfred Poor said a "solution has been reached to move forward" on what his company is calling Fintech Village. Ideanomics purchased the West Hartford site in 2018 for $5.2 million and has planned a $283 million financial technology hub slated to bring 330 jobs to the area. The project received a $10 million loan from the state. As part of the deal to purchase the property, Ideanomics agreed to remediate the campus before developing it.
Odds and ends
The state budget bill has been public for two weeks but interesting tidbits tucked within the 567-page document are still being discovered. The Courant's Jon Lender reported last week that the bill contains highly technical language that in effect gives legislative employees (not including lawmakers) 7 percent raises over the next two years. Like some of the other items tucked in the budget during the final days of deliberations, there was no public discussion of the issue. ... Consumer Counsel Elin Swanson Katz is departing her role as the state's top consumer advocate, Lamont announced Friday. Katz has held the job since 2011. Before that she was a lawyer at firms in Washington, Boston and Hartford and assistant counsel at the state Department of Environmental Protection. Lamont didn't say what Katz was doing next, just that she'd be leaving July 5 "to pursue her passion for improving broadband access for Connecticut's citizens." The Connecticut Mirror reported Katz was taking a legal and executive position with Tilson Technology Management, a Portland, Maine-based information technology company opening an office in Connecticut. ... Greenwich native Hope Hicks has agreed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee as Democrats continue their investigation into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russian agents meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren model who was Trump's press secretary during the campaign and took a White House job after he won, now holds a communications job with the Fox Corporation in Los Angeles. ... Vice President Joe Biden has said his presidential campaign won't accept lobbyist contributions, but that didn't stop lobbyists including former U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., from showing up at a Washington fundraiser Monday evening, according to an account in Politico. Dodd, a registered lobbyist who was previously head of the Motion Picture Association of America, is now senior counsel with Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, a white-shoe law firm based in Washington. The next night, Dodd joined House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a fundraiser for U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, according to Politico. Pelosi will be in Larson's district Friday evening (June 21) to speak to Connecticut Democrats at their annual fundraising dinner. Also attending Larson's fundraiser were his Connecticut colleagues Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and Jim Himes, D-4th District. ... Vineyard Vines is OK but the town of Greenwich is telling municipal employees they can't wear flip-flops to work. That includes school district employees. Lifeguards, swim instructors and staff at town-run camps are exempt from the new rule. Town leaders said it's about safety, not fashion. "One of the things that this is trying to do is prevent slips and falls or trips and falls," Mary Pepe, town director of human services, told the Greenwich Time. "Stopping those from happening is a great way to avoid workplace accidents or sprained or twisted ankles and other injuries." Speaking of Greenwich, veteran Connecticut political reporter Neil Vigdor, who started a new gig at The New York Times last week, has his first byline: an explanation of the Hatch Act, the 1939 law prohibiting executive branch employees from engaging in some forms of political activity. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway is accused of violating the Hatch Act and a federal agency has recommended she be removed from her White House job.

Texto completo: For William B. Furlong
(1922-1986)
A breeze lifts a lock from my brow
as I eat lunch on a bench in the sun
and watch a model boat pitch its prow
across the pond that Stuart Little found
in Central Park where my father
brought me once, half a lifetime ago,
an Allegheny mountain boy
thirsty for a drink of the City,
charmed by fountains' splash
on stone and steel and glass.
I never thought then
that I'd live here now
in the hush of ten years
since the hearse an hour held him.
Yet, here I sit at pond's rim
as if he sits with me again
a glance away from Alice
in Wonderland cast in bronze
facing this liquid looking glass
in which skyscrapers and trees
and the easy ironies of Fifth Avenue
and its balconies of wealth
are reflected upside down. ...
Indeed, the gifts you left arise sans script -
a teacher's raft of wisdom alive, afloat,
so that I find in the wake of toy boats
ripples of your legacy whose interest
pays out in measures of peace over time
compounded by the peals of laughter
ignited so often by your telling wit, which
here and now repeat that gift of joy which
confounded the world and its fools
you suffered so well, leaving unspoken
your sojourns to hell and back however many times
since the Higgins boat spat you out on Omaha Beach
to receive from a Panzer's shell near Le Désert
the wounds you carried ever after hidden.
You astound me still in this,
the thirtieth year since
we stopped here once -
a father and his sons -
to watch toy boats pushed
by a light West wind
under what must have been
a soft, summer sun.
- Tom Furlong

Texto completo: Who knew getting old would be this painful?
The median age of the American worker is 42, four years more than the median 20 years ago.
Americans are used to hearing dire warnings about aging. We are told it could bankrupt the social safety net as Medicare and Social Security run out of money. We are regularly admonished about the inadequacy of our nest eggs.
These are the least of our worries. Reshaping the work force, and distorting patterns of saving and investment, the aging of the American population is carving an unexpectedly broad path of destruction across the economy.
It explains a lot about what's wrong. Aging, according to recent economic research, is stunting the emergence of new businesses and sapping productivity. It is contributing to the rise in monopoly power and eating into workers' share of national income. Many of our most intractable economic ills can be traced to some degree to this ineluctable fact: America is getting old.
Consider the bluntest measure of progress: economic growth. Comparing growth across American states that are aging at different speeds, researchers from Harvard's Medical School and the RAND Corporation concluded that a 10 percent increase in the share of the population over 60 reduced the growth rate of per capita gross domestic product by 5.5 percent. They projected that aging would shave no less than 1.2 percentage points off annual economic growth this decade.
Part of this is because of a shrinking labor supply. As baby boomers move into retirement, leaving the work force to the smaller cohorts behind them, the share of Americans who are working is shrinking, while the share of the elderly who depend on the fruits of their work is rising. By 2030, only 59 percent of adults over 16 will be in the labor force. That's three percentage points less than in 2015.
As the share of the population at work shrinks, it stands to reason that economic growth per person will slow too -- a smaller proportion of Americans are engaged in income-generating work. But two-thirds of the growth shortfall comes from slowing labor-productivity growth.
It's not obvious why the change in composition of workers (more workers in their 50s and 60s, fewer in their 20s and 30s) slows down innovation. It may be that older workers have a harder time learning new skills, so businesses with an older work force may be less likely to deploy new tech.
Whatever the precise cause, the slowdown shows up in the data. Mark Zandi and colleagues at Moody's Analytics concluded that aging over the past 15 years reduced productivity in the United States by 0.25 percent to 0.7 percent per year.
Other researchers suggest that an older, smaller labor force can also account for the sluggish rate of business start-ups. Roughly half of American companies are at least 11 years old, up from less than one-third in the late 1980s. For all the hype about Silicon Valley's explosive entrepreneurship, there are fewer young companies entering the marketplace now than there were a generation ago. Hugo Hopenhayn of the University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues argue that this is caused in large part by a declining labor supply.
As big, old companies come to dominate the marketplace, their increasing market power could mute their incentive to innovate. Mr. Hopenhayn and others have found that larger firms share less of their revenues with their workers, trimming workers' share of national income.
The declining supply of workers may not even be the most intense headwind unleashed by our aging population. The most worrying feature of our time, instead, may be older workers' high rate of savings and low rate of spending, as they build nest eggs to support themselves through what is likely to be a long retirement. Over the past 20 years or so, this thriftiness has helped pushed interest rates -- the price of money -- down to near zero, making it hard for the Federal Reserve to cut rates further to stimulate the economy when needed.
More immigration might help address some of the shortcomings of our aging labor force. Yet in the current political environment, the odds that the United States will open the door to more foreign workers look, to put it mildly, slim.
Tax breaks, child subsidies, paid leave and other regulations have had some modest success in increasing fertility rates in countries like France, Canada and Sweden. But there is scant evidence that policy could slow aging significantly by encouraging Americans to have more children.
One great paradox of this predicament is that robots could help address some of these problems, replacing workers that age out of their productive lives.
It might seem counterintuitive to hope for more robots, given their track record of knocking workers without a college education from the middle-income jobs that once supported a middle class. But it would be different if workers were retiring anyway.
In a study of several advanced economies from 1990 to 2015, the economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo found that aging was actually associated with rising living standards. As workers became scarce, businesses invested in automation to replace them, as well as in other new technologies, all of which raised productivity and incomes.
We may end up with too few robots rather than too many. Even the most aggressive projections of future automation, Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Restrepo estimate, will not fill the hole that retiring Americans are projected to leave in the work force. That may be a problem: For all the misgivings about a world in which machines perform most of the work once done by humans, how else can we afford to get old?

Texto completo: Last week, as American and Mexican officials haggled over how to address the migrant crisis at their countries’ shared border, United States Customs and Border Protection released its monthly migration statistics. They tell an alarming story.
In May, 144,278 migrants were taken into custody. It was the third consecutive month in which apprehensions topped 100,000 and the highest one-month total in 13 years.
Unequipped to deal with the crush, border facilities and migrant shelters are dangerously overcrowded, and the staff is overburdened. Dysfunction, disease and even death are a growing reality.
“We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger: The system is broken,” the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, said.
Also last week, officials said that the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency assigned to care for unaccompanied migrant children, would begin cutting services “not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety.” This includes English classes, legal aid and recreational programs.
Democrats and other administration critics called the move “cruel” and “illegal,” but the financial reality is that the agency is overwhelmed. So far this fiscal year, it has taken charge of nearly 41,000 unaccompanied children — a 57 percent increase over last year. The entire program could run out of funding by the end of June.
In short, it is time for Congress to stop dithering and pass emergency funding to deal with this nightmare.
It has been more than a month since the administration sent Congress a request for $4.5 billion in additional border assistance. A large portion of the money, $3.3 billion, was earmarked for humanitarian aid — which most lawmakers agree is sorely needed. But a relatively modest piece of the request aimed at shoring up border security operations, roughly a quarter of the total, has tied negotiators in knots.
Early on, Democrats were opposed to funding additional detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Republicans had problems with Democrats’ demands for changes in the administration’s asylum policies. At one point, negotiators thought they were close to resolving these conflicts, only to have other issues snarl the process. Beyond the money for security, one of the remaining disagreements is how much data sharing will be allowed between the agencies responsible for caring for migrant children and those that handle border enforcement.
The broader problem is that many Democrats have come to view the Trump administration as untrustworthy, and they are loath to hand over one more penny for anything to do with immigration.
Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have been particularly adamant, insisting that their leadership take a hard line in negotiations.
In part, they fear that the administration, despite its promises, will spend any additional funding on enforcement rather than humanitarian needs.
There is much to despise about this administration’s immigration policies, which are exacerbating this crisis, but there should be no ambivalence about the urgency of addressing the humanitarian needs. While lawmakers wring their hands and drag their feet, tens of thousands of migrant children are suffering.
Congress needs to get serious about dealing with that suffering.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE HATE U GIVE (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. For Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg), code switching is part of her daily routine. During the day, she attends a college prep school that is predominantly white and rich. But in the evening, she goes home to her mostly poor, black neighborhood. Her ability to balance these opposing worlds falls apart when a white police officer kills her childhood best friend. George Tillman Jr. directed the film, which is based on a novel of the same name by Angie Thomas. In the New York Times review, Aisha Harris wrote: "Ms. Stenberg strikingly embodies Starr's dichotomies -- self-doubt and bouts of confidence; introversion and outspokenness -- but the film's driving plot is Khalil's death and how it pushes Starr to come into her own as an activist."
MURDER AND JUSTICE: THE CASE OF MARTHA MOXLEY 7 p.m. on Oxygen. This three-part docuseries tells the story of Martha Moxley, a 15-year-old girl who was murdered on her front lawn in Greenwich, Conn. The investigation was stalled for over two decades until Michael Skakel, her neighbor at the time and a relative of the Kennedy family, was arrested. Skakel was sentenced to 20 years to life, but was released in 2013 after serving 11 years when a judge ruled Skakel did not have a competent defense. Laura Coates, a legal analyst and host of the series, breaks down what happened, going through evidence and interviewing people involved in the investigation. The series also explores how money, connections and the media impacted the case.
ALL THAT 8:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. The 1990s hit variety show that brought us Kenan Thompson, Amanda Bynes and Nick Cannon, returns on Saturday with a brand-new cast. Executive produced by Thompson and Kel Mitchell, the show features seven young comedians ranging from 12 to 15 years old. In the first episode, they are joined by some original cast members, who reprise some of their classic sketches. The Jonas Brothers will also perform their new single "Sucker." Expect more musical guests throughout the season and some surprise appearances from actors and comedians.
What's Streaming
MARVIN'S ROOM (1996) Stream on Hulu. Lee (Meryl Streep) and Bessie (Diane Keaton) have been estranged for nearly two decades. But when Bessie, who stayed in Florida to take care of their bedridden father, discovers she has leukemia, Lee comes home. Jerry Zaks's film adaptation of Scott McPherson's 1991 play features an all-star cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro.

Texto completo: OJAI, Calif. -- First there's Barbara Hannigan the singer, a fearless soprano who's more likely to give a world premiere than step into a repertory staple. Then there's Barbara Hannigan the conductor. She's even done the two jobs at once. So what's one more?
Meet Barbara Hannigan the curator. She programmed this year's Ojai Music Festival -- a utopia where open-minded audiences welcome adventurous works presented against a backdrop of green hills, bird song and Pixie tangerines -- with the help of Thomas W. Morris, the festival's outgoing artistic director. And she came up with a well-balanced meal: four days of concerts, talks and screenings that went down easily, without bloat or arduousness.
Among the regulars here -- a few have been coming since the 1940s, and everyone seems to know everyone -- some were quick to say Ms. Hannigan's festival is an improvement on last year's, organized by the violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja. Descriptions I heard of that event included "too dark," "a lot" and "not a good vibe." (Zachary Woolfe, who reviewed it for The New York Times, wrote, "While there's joy in the festival's too-muchness, the music would be better served by judicious pruning.")
I'm happy to report that this year's schedule, while still grueling for anyone who doesn't enjoy live music, consisted of a manageable three concerts a day -- a short "dawn" program in the morning, and two more, around lunch and dinner, at the outdoor Libbey Bowl -- and short early evening performances in a gazebo in Libbey Park. And even when the subject matter turned bleak, as it did in pieces by Mark-Anthony Turnage, Claude Vivier and Gérard Grisey, they were surrounded by leavening works that maintained, well, a good vibe.
This occasionally made for bipolar experiences; I'm still trying to make sense of the Saturday evening program, in which a world-music showcase worthy of a cruise ship was sandwiched between John Zorn's masterly "Jumalattaret" and Grisey's apocalyptic "Quatre Chants pour Franchir le Seuil" ("Four Songs for Crossing the Threshold"). But the misfires were few in Ms. Hannigan's festival, which began on Thursday with Stravinsky's "The Rake's Progress" (sleepy but solid) and ended on Sunday evening with an exhilarating suite of Gershwin songs both conducted and sung by her.
Ms. Hannigan had a stacked roster of artists helping her bring the weekend to life -- not least Mr. Morris, whose 16-year tenure at Ojai has been credited with broadening the festival's scope and ambition. Succeeding him is Chad Smith, who oversees the Los Angeles Philharmonic's bold programming. His first music director -- under Mr. Morris, the position has gone to a different artist each year, ensuring ongoing freshness -- will be the composer and conductor Matthias Pintscher, who so far has revealed plans for works by Pierre Boulez (a seven-time Ojai music director in the decades before Mr. Morris), Olga Neuwirth and Anna Thorvaldsdottir.
[Read more about Mr. Morris's farewell to Ojai .]
In addition to assisting Ms. Hannigan in planning, Mr. Morris appeared onstage twice: reciting poetry in "Façade" (William Walton's ridiculous "Pierrot Lunaire" sendup) and joyously jamming with the rest of the musicians in Terry Riley's "In C." After that piece, Ms. Hannigan surprised him with an affecting rendition of Kurt Weill's "Lost in the Stars."
Throughout the weekend, young singers from Equilibrium, Ms. Hannigan's artist development initiative -- oh, yeah, she's a mentor, too -- provided vocal muscle. Fleur Barron, an earthy Baba the Turk in "The Rake's Progress," sounded like a Carmen in the making. The soprano Aphrodite Patoulidou was an entrancing soloist in Vivier's "Lonely Child," a head trip of a piece in a musical language both direct and mysterious. Doubled voices, like clarinets and violins playing in unison, made sounds thrillingly difficult to pinpoint, their ethereality matching lyrics like "The stars make prodigious leaps in space, / time, dimensions striped with colored zebra markings."
With a natural command of the stage, James Way, a tenor with a delicate voice, was a consistent scene stealer. As the auctioneer Sellem in "The Rake's Progress," his mania was skillfully vaudevillian; similarly eccentric were his Noël Coward-esque segments of "Façade." When he returned, in the final concert, in Stravinsky's "Pulcinella," his voice was lush and nimble, balancing the sound worlds of 18th-century Pergolesi and 20th-century neoclassicism.
Another group affiliated with Ms. Hannigan, Ludwig, a capable Dutch collective that backed her on her 2017 album "Crazy Girl Crazy," provided as few as one instrumentalist -- Ingrid Geerlings, fleet in Debussy's flute solo "Syrinx" -- and as many as a full orchestra. (Ms. Hannigan was a frequent conductor, among others including the percussionist Steven Schick.)
Ludwig's shape-shifting adaptability kept the programming refreshing and free from reliance on large-scale works. Even Rachmaninoff, awkwardly inserted into an otherwise eye-opening tribute to the composer Oliver Knussen on Saturday, was reduced; Thomas Beijer's chamber arrangement of "The Isle of the Dead" did the piece no favors by exposing its flimsy architecture.
But the most invigorating -- and, thankfully, ever-present -- guest artists were the players of the JACK Quartet, a perfect match for Ms. Hannigan's voracious search for new music. They're reliably surprising, and reliably impressive; their marathon performance of Elliott Carter's string quartets earlier this spring remains one of the most gratifying concerts I've heard all season.
On Friday, JACK -- the violinists Christopher Otto and Austin Wulliman; the violist John Pickford Richards; and Jay Campbell, a busy cellist who also appeared solo over the weekend -- managed not to survive, but to triumph in three concerts, including one, of punishing John Zorn chamber works, that left me exhausted, as if I'd spent all day in a museum.
Mr. Smith, could you please give them their own festival as a reward?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Two American premieres at JACK's 8 a.m. concerts, by Clara Iannotta and Catherine Lamb, experimented with perception in a way that prompted close listening -- a mindful start to the day -- and recalled the visual works of local Light and Space artists like Robert Irwin. Ms. Iannotta's "dead wasps in the jam-jar (iii)" (2017-18) felt like a three-dimensional space that listeners were made to wander through, as if exploring their childhood homes underwater in a dream.
And Ms. Lamb's String Quartet (2009) explored tonal spectrums at a glacial pace. Attempting to track the changes, you risked slipping into a daze, only to be jolted awake by occasional pauses. Near the end, the JACK players arrived at perfect fifths -- the interval used to tune string instruments -- and the piece snapped into focus. But the transformations continued, microtonally, warping the harmony like melting wax.
The only conservative fare from the JACK men -- conservative only by their standards -- was Schoenberg's String Quartet No. 2, whose final two movements feature a soprano. It was Friday night, 24 hours into the festival, and Ms. Hannigan was finally making her first appearance as a singer.
Her intensity completely changed the energy of the piece, and even of the concert itself. Her soprano was chillingly pure when unadorned, and heartwarming with vibrato. Her voice at one point leapt with us, rapturously, into the stratosphere, only to drag us to the depths of her range.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ojai was at its best any time Ms. Hannigan sang -- head-spinningly agile in "Jumalattaret," frightening in "Quatre Chants" and charming in "Façade," in which she, in Sprechstimme, recited unintelligible poetry at a sprint that would give Lin-Manuel Miranda a run for his money.
It was fitting that she closed her festival with "Girl Crazy Suite," a Gershwin medley arranged by her and Bill Elliott. Here was Ms. Hannigan in all her polymathic glory: the impresario who commissioned the piece; the conductor whose persuasive authority demonstrated that it was no vanity project; and the alluring singer, bright and magnetic, who wasn't above ending on a literal high note.
Who could ask for anything more?

Texto completo: HUCKA-BYEEEE
Fib-prone White House press secretary  Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced plans to vacate her perch at the podium by the end of the month, though the details of how she'd leave remain unclear (Cloud of bats? Oozing through a floor drain? Bursting into spores?). “The most important job I'll ever have is being a mom to my kids and it's time for us to go home," she tweeted — which sure sounds convincing. But as The New York Times's James Poniewozik tweeted, “I'm not going to believe that Sarah Huckabee Sanders is leaving as White House press secretary until she denies it herself." Who, or what, will replace her? Twitter's candidates are mostly unprintable, but if I were a betting man I'd say get ready for a lot more Kid Rock in your life.
JACKIE NO
In a perfectly normal birthday morning interview with Fox News (which also by carefully constructed coincidence happened to coincide with the first ever #JohnMcCainDay) President Trump defended his decision to repaint Air Force One red, white, and blue (a bold departure from the baby blue hue first selected by former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) by dragging his wife into it with the weirdest compliment ever: “It was Jackie O and that's good. But we have our own Jackie O today, it's called Melania. Melania. We'll call it Melania T , OK?" Twitter spent the day wrestling with which aspect of the answer was worse, the “our own Jackie O" part or the double dispatch of “it" to refer to the current first lady. Truth be told, I really don't care (do U?), but this kinda feels like saying we have a new Chanel No. 5 and it's called Febreze. 
NEW YELLER
Enough of these foolish mortals and this lousy present! Gather 'round my crystal ball, everyone, and behold as I grant you a glimpse into a strange and distant future! Just kidding, it's actually just a terrifying clip of Spot, a Boston Robotics dog, violently malfunctioning on an expo stage and writhing around in simulated pain before unceremoniously tipping over. WAIT! If you're about to make the “he sure knows how to play dead" joke, I regret to inform you that everyone already has. Turns out humans are way more reliable than robot dogs. Who knew? 
SMALL TALK
Speaking of dad jokes, in honor of Father's Day, I am pleased to present to you this year's Winning Internet Dad, DJ Pryor of Tennessee, who was recorded by his wife, Shanieke, chilling on the couch and deeply engaged in a just-as-deeply meaningless conversation with their 18-month-old son Kingston, who appears to be making some valid points. “We think a lot alike, huh?," says Pryor in the objectively cutest moment of the clip, which has been shared over a million times. If this kid is as smart as he looks, he'll put whatever he asked for in writing as soon as he figures that out.

APOLOGIES ARE OWED TO THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE

Texto completo: Not long ago, a few southern newspapers offered apologies for having vociferously opposed the civil rights movement. The newspapers that were around in the 1910s and 1920s offered mea culpas for condoning lynching, Klan terrorism and the routine indignities of Jim Crow.
Much of this public soul-searching was prompted by staff journalists rummaging through archives looking for information about their region's sordid past. It wasn't difficult to find evidence of their own newspapers' conveniently forgotten complicity with evil.
As it turns out, the rich and powerful media barons who owned newspapers during that era usually aligned themselves with the most reactionary forces, including lynch mobs.
Even so, a few newspapers have correctly figured out that they'll never have moral credibility with readers without dealing forthrightly with their racist pasts. The sting of contrition was mediated by the fact that apologizing for editorials written in the 1920s felt like an exercise in abstraction.
Still, it's great to know that there's no statute of limitations when it comes to the press admitting its errors. That said, apologies shouldn't have to wait decades. They should be as common as rain because mistakes are made on every media platform every day.
Just as most newspapers publish daily correction boxes where the previous day's errors are listed, it would help the credibility of this industry enormously to regularly revisit our biggest failures and admit where groupthink has had disastrous results - from cheerleading the Iraq war to giving Donald Trump a billion dollars in free campaign coverage because he long was regarded as an entertaining freak show and not a serious candidate.
I've been thinking about this notion a lot since recently finishing director Ava DuVernay's excellent four-part Central-Park-jogger miniseries "When They See Us" on Netflix. Her devastating portrayal of the New York cops and district attorney's office coercing confessions from five underage black and Latino boys regarding the brutal sexual assault of a jogger in Central Park already has resulted in rough karmic justice for many of the players in the drama.
Linda Fairstein, the woman who ran the sex-crimes unit that had jurisdiction over the case, has been kicked off several prestigious boards and dropped by the publisher of her pulpy crime novels. Even though the five men who spent as much as 14 years in prison have been exonerated by the confession of the perpetrator and a lack of DNA or other physical evidence putting them on the scene, Ms. Fairstein continues to maintain that they were part of the assault of Trisha Meili, who is from Upper St. Clair.
Prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer was removed from her teaching position at Columbia Law School recently after students demanded her ouster for her role in railroading the young men. In the miniseries, she's portrayed as a feckless second banana to Ms. Fairstein.
I can't wait to see what eventually happens to commentator and former Washington Post columnist Pat Buchanan for publishing this kind of racist doggerel about the accused: "How does a civilized, self-confident people deal with enemies who gang rape their women? Armies stand them up against a wall and shoot them; or we hang them."
Mr. Buchanan also wrote that if "the eldest of that wolf pack [who was 16] were tried, convicted and hanged in Central Park, by June 1, and the 13-and 14-year-olds were stripped, horsewhipped, and sent to prison, the park might be safe again for women."
Mr. Buchanan purposely used the language of antebellum slavery to remind his readers of America's historic prerogative when it came to punishing black men and boys. Nothing could be too barbaric when the honor of white women was at stake.
The New York Times and The Washington Post, arguably America's two finest newspapers, fell in line with racist editorials of their own. It may have been 1989, but the rhetorical logic both papers offered would have been familiar to anyone living in 1859.
Much already has been made of Donald Trump's infamous $85,000 ad buy in four prominent New York newspapers calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty and execution of the Central Park Five.
The ad spells out his philosophy clearly in those pre-Twitter days: "BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY! BRING BACK OUR POLICE!" and "I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. .CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS."
Mr. Trump was a nascent tyrant even in those days, but still he was endlessly profiled by an adoring press that happily glossed over his lies about his wealth and business acumen because he always made great copy.
Because this happened within recent memory, and because the men who lost their childhoods are still very much with us (and are $41 million richer thanks to an unlawful conviction settlement from New York), I believe they still are owed apologies from every media organization that called for them to be horsewhipped and executed. That would be most newspapers at the time. This should be a no-brainer, because every newspaper can pull up its morally compromised editorials as evidence.
We all know that the president is morally incapable of apologizing, but as with Ms. Fairstein and Ms. Lederer, his day is coming - and he's going to lose something far more substantial than a book deal.

Texto completo: Ed Harris will succeed Jeff Daniels as the star of "To Kill a Mockingbird" on Broadway.
Mr. Harris, featured in "Westworld" on television, is a four-time Oscar nominee and was nominated for a Tony in 1986, for his performance on Broadway in "Precious Sons." He also appeared on Broadway in 1996, in "Taking Sides."
Mr. Daniels, who was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance in "Mockingbird," will finish his tenure as Atticus Finch in the play on Nov. 3, and Mr. Harris will begin on Nov. 5.
The casting is being promoted in advertising in The New York Times on Sunday; a production spokesman declined to comment.
The play, a new adaptation of the Harper Lee novel written by Aaron Sorkin, opened in December. It has been selling quite strongly at the box office, has recouped its $ 7.5 million capitalization costs, and is planning a national tour, starring Richard Thomas, beginning in August of 2020. It was not nominated in the best play category at the Tony Awards, but Celia Keenan-Bolger, the actress playing Atticus's daughter Scout, won as best actress in a featured role.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: (JTA) - The New York Times announced that it will no longer publish daily political cartoons in its international edition, in the wake of backlash over a cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu considered anti-Semitic.
In the announcement made on Monday, the Times ended its relationship with two contract cartoonists.
In late April, the New York Times international edition published a political cartoon that showed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a guide dog (a dachshund) wearing a Star of David collar and leading President Donald Trump, who is wearing a black kippah.
The newspaper later acknowledged that the cartoon "included anti-Semitic tropes" and that it was "an error of judgment to publish it."
James Bennet, editorial page editor, in a statement on Monday said that "for well over a year we have been considering bringing that edition into line with the domestic paper by ending daily political cartoons and will do so beginning July 1." One of the fired cartoonists, Patrick Chappatte, wrote on his personal blog: "I'm putting down my pen, with a sigh: that's a lot of years of work undone by a single cartoon - not even mine - that should never have run in the best newspaper of the world."
He added: "I'm afraid this is not just about cartoons, but about journalism and opinion in general. We are in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm, falling upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blow. This requires immediate counter-measures by publishers, leaving no room for pon-deration or meaningful discussions."

Texto completo: Sometimes, the shortest of lives inspire millions. And so it is with the oak tree that French President Emmanuel Macron ceremonially planted with President Trump on the South Lawn of the White House. It was intended as a symbol of the enduring Franco-American alliance. But on June 11, Macron confirmed it had died. It has gone on to the great oak forest in the sky.
The anonymous sapling — a tree has no name, you might say — was born in France before, Lafayette-like, setting out for the land of the free. Appallingly, however, like so many immigrants in Trump’s America, the tree had to undergo extreme vetting, in this case the quarantine mandated for foreign plants, which Macron said contributed to the tree’s demise. The soil giveth, the bureaucracy taketh away.
Experts told the New York Times that soil differences between Europe and America were probably another factor in the tragedy of the wilted foreigner, raising the ugly specter of arboreal nativism with implied doubts about how arrivals from overseas can properly assimilate, or “take root” in “American soil.”
"In the words of the Psalmist, may this relationship grow ‘like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, and produces its fruit in season whose leaf also does not wither,’” declared Vice President Mike Pence after the planting. The tree, it turned out, was more like the cursed fig tree from the Gospels, or perhaps the seed planted on rocky soil.
“It’s not a tragedy,” Macron callously declared upon confirming the tree’s demise, adding: “One shouldn’t see symbols where there are none.”
Quite right. Those who see in the tree’s extinction a symbol of the end of the once-ballyhooed “bromance” between Macron and Trump should ask themselves whether the relationship really relies on chlorophyll to transform sunlight into nutrients. Clearly, it does not. (This should not be taken to imply that human beings who identify as oak trees are not trees.)
Unlike an oak tree, Macron is not fueled by photosynthesis, but rather by his preternatural talent for appealing to older people. His meteoric career is a list of the men several decades his senior to whom he became protégé. Along with education and income, age is the strongest correlate to electoral support for Macron. It seems, however, that this superpower does not work on foreign heads of state, much like a certain French tree’s inability to survive in alien soil. Whether it is Theresa May on Brexit, Angela Merkel on European policy, or Trump on trade and security, foreign leaders have thus far proven mysteriously resistant to forsaking their countries’ national interests in exchange for Macron being friendly to them, and so few of Macron’s diplomatic endeavors have borne fruit.
Many French people are familiar from their schooldays with 17th century poet Jean de La Fontaine’s renditions of Aesop’s classic fables, which makes it imaginable that Macron wanted his diplomacy to be like “The Fox and the Crow.” His foxy sweet-talking would get other leaders to give up the cheese. But in this period of mourning, it would be bad taste to compare it instead to “The Oak and the Reed,” to oblivious bravado leading to a beautiful tree’s untimely death.
Meanwhile, contrary to predictions that Trump would be easily bamboozled by his counterparts, he has proved focused on American national interests, whether it has been sanctioning Russia, confronting Iran, or hammering China on trade. The exception seems to be Kim Jong Un, whose family is known, among other things, for its sponsorship of flowers and not trees. Could this be mere coincidence? Or is there a reason experts don’t like to talk about plant geopolitics?
Macron has already announced he will send Trump a new tree. But nothing can ever replace a unique plant that, though never taking root properly in the White House South Lawn, surely took root already in all our hearts.

Texto completo: A picture, we all know, is worth a thousand words. But which thousand is often up to the individual viewer.
This can be especially true when it comes to editorial cartoons. As a form of expression, a single cartoon panel can have a unique power to make a viewer laugh in agreement or growl with displeasure. Interestingly, the reaction is immediate — a chuckle, a guffaw, a pounding of the fist on the table — but the effect, at least in the best of cases, is long-lasting, as the viewer naturally is induced to reflect on the meaning and intent of a particular issue’s visual portrayal.
Unfortunately, though, nuance is not usually the editorial cartoonist’s stock in trade, so in many, if not most, cases, an individual cartoon must be examined very narrowly, and in some cases, a lack of depth can leave a cartoon open to vastly different interpretations.
All this makes selecting editorial cartoons for publication an imprecise art, no pun intended, for newspapers like the Daily Herald that value presentation of diverse points of view on their Opinion pages. And it can lead to considerable controversy when readers are stung by an artist’s portrayal that they find offensive, wildly exaggerated or simply wrong.
We at the Daily Herald address this challenge by striving to present a wide range of points of view in the editorial cartoons we publish from day to day. The New York Times has decided to deal with it by ending publication of editorial cartoons altogether in its international editions.
The Times’ decision followed an outcry over an April cartoon that lampooned President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Many critics found the image overtly anti-Semitic. The Times later agreed and apologized.
The artist, it’s worth noting, insisted that he did not mean to promote anti-Semitism but just wanted to make a statement about what he saw as President Trump’s blind loyalty to the Israeli leader. He is finding — as legions of Twitter and social media commentators also learn from time to time — that the inherent power of an arresting image or clever phrase can be abused by clumsy presentation.
The Times has never been particularly fond of editorial cartoons and had already ceased publication of them in its domestic editions. In a blog reacting to his newspaper’s decision to cease publishing traditional editorial cartoons in all its editions, Times cartoonist Patrick Chappatte, who did not draw the offending panel, described cartoons as "visual shortcut(s) with an unmatched capacity to touch the mind" and said that quality is both "their strength, and their vulnerability." He lamented that we live in an age when "moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm" to intimidate publishers and commentators.
In short, combine a moralistic mob and a visual shortcut and you have a formula for trouble. Chappatte thinks the solution is "to stop being afraid of the angry mob," and I’m willing to side with him to a point. But I’ve also found that the degree of people’s objection to the "angry mob" often depends on which angry mob they’re a part of. So, I place my hope and faith in the willingness — even as grudging as it sometimes is — for citizens of a country that values free speech and a free press to, within certain broad boundaries, tolerate views and images they abhor as long as their own views can get a fair hearing.
Or, in the case of editorial cartoons, a fair viewing.
For our part at the Daily Herald, we’re constantly evaluating how we use editorial cartoons and how we select the ones we publish. Like Chappatte, we still think they have a unique capacity to compact a complex idea into an instantaneous picture, as long as we respect the sentiments and diversity of the readers transforming each image into those thousand words.

Less sex? Millennials are just doing it differently.

Texto completo: Media outlets have spent the past few years warning us that millennials are killing sex (along with cars, the American Dream, mayonnaise and napkins), but another voice just joined the conversation to say, "Not so fast."
That voice is Cosmopolitan, the magazine that became politically bold and culturally relevant when you weren't looking. A new article for the July issue, headlined, "The millennial sex recession is bull----," offers a counterpoint to the young-people-aren't-having-sex narrative reported in The Atlantic, The Washington Post and The New York Times, among others.
Cosmo looked at the data behind the sex-recession stories and interviewed a handful of experts and a bunch of millennials. The result is an instructive read, offering a gentle reminder that every generation has its own way of living and relating, and data don't always tell the whole story.
"We millennials happen to know we're killing it in the bedroom (and in our cars, and in our showers, and on our couches)," writes Julie Vadnal, "and we want credit for it (we are millennials, after all)."
Data collected from the General Social Survey, which asks about everything from religion to wealth inequality to sex, found that 18- to 29-year-old respondents reported having sex an estimated 78.5 times per year from 2010-2014. That's a slight (very slight, in fact) dip from the 81.29 times per year that was reported between 1989 and 1994.
Couple that with the fact that from 1991 to 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Survey found the percentage of high school students who'd had intercourse dropped from 54% to 40%, and the fact that teen pregnancy rates have been steadily declining since the '90s, and suddenly you have a whole lot of theorizing about young people and their inability and/or unwillingness to put down their dang phones, look each other in the eye and get it on.
Cosmo says the General Social Survey questions didn't specify what type of sex people were or were not having, leaving out a whole range of activities that may not fit a conventional script.
"Our definitions are expanding," Kinsey Institute researcher Justin Lehmiller, tells Cosmo. "It's not that we're necessarily having less sexual contact overall, we're just having different kinds of sexual contact than have traditionally been measured."
(I'll leave the specifics to your imagination. Or you can read the Cosmo article.)
Biological anthropologist Helen Fisher told Cosmo the new data represent, to her, a rise in "sexual intelligence."
Millennials are less likely to say yes to sex they don't want to have, thanks to shifting notions of gender roles and better understanding of consent. And, Cosmo reports, a 2016 Singles in America survey commissioned by Match.com, where Fisher is a scientific adviser, found that millennials are 40 times more likely than other generations to believe an emotional connection makes sex better.
"It's not like we're less horny," Remy Kassimir, 29, told Cosmo. "We're not, like, robots. We're just being smarter about stuff and asking, 'Is this going to be worth my time and emotion?' "
#MeToo has played a part in that rise in sexual intelligence, Cosmo maintains.
"When you think of all the stories we've heard since (the movement) exploded in 2017 about bad sex, coerced sex, harassment and rape," the article states, "the idea that millennials are mostly having the sex we really want to have seems even less like a sad dry spell and more like mass empowerment."
Amen to that.
Kristie Overstreet, a psychotherapist and clinical sexologist who works with millennials, told the magazine, "I'm a Gen Xer, and back then, you didn't feel as empowered to say no."
Ian Kerner, a sex counselor and author of "She Comes First," told the magazine there's much to celebrate about millennials' approach to sex.
"This is a generation, more than any other generation, that can really fuse the relational with the recreational to create sex that feels intimate, emotional and connected, in which pleasure is really front and center," he said.
Hard to see that as anything but good news.

But on her 24th wedding anniversary Lauren makes a decision that will change everything. Lauren won't pretend things are perfect anymore. She defies the controlling husband who has privately mistreated her throughout their marriage and files for divorce.

Save Me the Plums: My Gourmet Memoir by Ruth Reichl (non-fiction)

Yet Reichl had been reading Gourmet since she was 8; it had inspired her career. How could she say no? This is the story of a former Berkeley hippie entering the corporate world and worrying about losing her soul. Readers will meet legendary chefs like David Chang and Eric Ripert, idiosyncratic writers like David Foster Wallace, and a colorful group of editors and art directors.

Martin S. Feldstein, Harvard professor and economic adviser to presidents, dies at 79

Texto completo: While Ronald Reagan was campaigning for president in 1980, Martin S. Feldstein was teaching at Harvard University, a top rising star in economics though he hadn't yet held an influential position in government. Would he head to the White House if Reagan were elected, a reporter asked. “I haven't really thought about that," he told the Globe that June. “I'd have to consider it."
Summoned to Washington, D.C., after the election, Dr. Feldstein said yes, and became a chief economic adviser in the Reagan administration — building a reputation as someone who was unafraid to publicly disagree with other White House officials.
Dr. Feldstein, who lived in Belmont, died Tuesday at the age of 79. His death was announced in an e-mail sent to colleagues by Jeremy C. Stein, the chairman of Harvard's economics department. It did not say where he died. He had been treated for cancer for some time, Stein said.
During his long career at Harvard, Dr. Feldstein nurtured many of today's top policy makers. He later counseled the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and for three decades — from 1977 to 2008 — he was president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a once-sleepy think tank based in Cambridge that under his leadership became a gathering point for economists, particularly those focused on policy-oriented work.
Dr. Feldstein rose to prominence early in his career as he sought to take serious economic research out of the classroom and apply it to public policy.
“He was a dominating scholar and teacher of public sector economics of the last half century," Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former Harvard president, told The New York Times Tuesday.
Summers once worked as a research assistant for Dr. Feldstein, who was his dissertation adviser. He credited Dr. Feldstein with “bringing serious empirical analysis, particularly with respect to incentives, to the whole field of public sector economics."
Dr. Feldstein entered the national spotlight in 1982, when he was appointed chairman of Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, just as the country was heading into a deep recession. Dr. Feldstein replaced Murray L. Weidenbaum.
Dr. Feldstein helped lay the intellectual groundwork for the “supply-side" economic theory that underpinned much of Reagan's economic policy, and which was known as Reaganomics. It held that the nation could be restored to economic health through the stimulus of tax cuts — the heart of supply-side theory — and by restricting the money supply to contain inflation. Critics called that combination contradictory.
But Dr. Feldstein was “not a polemicist," Summers said, and viewed himself as a scholar, not a political actor.
He was also a prolific writer, the author or editor of several books, on topics such as taxes and capital formation, the Social Security system, and the economics of art museums, as well as hundreds of academic papers. He frequently contributed opinion pieces to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Globe, and other publications.
He assembled a staff that included Summers and Paul Krugman, who won the Nobel Prize in economics and is now a columnist for the Times.
At first, Dr. Feldstein's support of tax cuts and deficit reduction matched the White House's goals, but campaign rhetoric soon collided with everyday reality. When the Reagan administration called for the dual aims of cutting taxes and increasing military spending, Dr. Feldstein looked at the numbers and they simply didn't add up.
"It will not be possible for us to grow our way out of these deficits" without raising taxes, Dr. Feldstein said in 1983.
His economic analysis may have been right, but his politics were wrong.
Reagan largely ignored the advice and turned instead to Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Secretary of State George Shultz, an economist by training. Administration insiders privately called the Harvard economist "Dr. Gloom."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes shot down Dr. Feldstein's call for a tax hike, saying, "Feldstein's wrong; the president's right."
Speakes all but called for Dr. Feldstein to step down immediately, deliberately mispronouncing his name, in his Mississippi drawl, as "Feld-steen." (The proper pronunciation is "Feld-stine.")
When Dr. Feldstein submitted a report to Congress in February 1984, Regan undercut him, telling a Senate panel, "As far as I'm concerned, you can throw it away."
Dr. Feldstein refused to step down and even made light of Regan's comment, saying, "I suppose that was just a throwaway line."
He returned to Harvard later in the year, earning the admiration of members of Congress from both parties.
"It may very well be that you leave Washington with an economy in ruins," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, "but you leave with a reputation intact."
Upon his return to Harvard, a Globe editorial said his tenure as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers was “notable for candor."
“Reagan would do well to look for a replacement as straightforward as Feldstein," the editorial said, adding that he was “leaving with his honor very much intact. Whatever one thinks about his conservative views, he has earned access to the ears of the rest of the world, access he seemed not to have had in the White House."
Martin Stuart Feldstein was born on Nov. 25, 1939, in the Bronx to Meyer and Esther (Gevarter) Feldstein. His father, who was known as Mac, was a lawyer. Martin Feldstein won a scholarship to Harvard, from where he graduated in 1961.
He had considered becoming a physician before becoming fascinated by economics while attending graduate school in England in the 1960s. His analysis of the efficiency of the British health-care system helped influence national policy and helped define his future.
"I figured if a 25-year-old graduate student could do something," he later told the Globe, "then economics was a pretty good activity to be in."
He went on to earn a doctorate from Oxford University. While in England he met his future wife, Kathleen Foley, who is also an economist and with whom he would cowrite columns — including dozens for the Globe's business section in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Dr. Feldstein returned to the United States before the end of the decade to be an assistant professor of economics at Harvard, where he studied the legacies of programs such as Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal, and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. He said he found that such programs, while created by Democrats with good intentions, had ended up worsening economic conditions.
In addition to his wife, Feldstein leaves their daughters, Margaret Feldstein Borden and Janet Feldstein McKillop; a sister, Helen Feldstein; and four grandchildren. Funeral services will be held 2 p.m. Thursday at Levine Chapels in Brookline. Burial will be private.
Dr. Feldstein was an “extraordinary research economist" from an early age, winning the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal for economists under the age of 40, said James Poterba, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Poterba, who was an undergraduate when he met Dr. Feldstein, succeeded him as the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2008. “He was a terrific and inspirational teacher," he added, “clear, exciting — got you feeling like economics could really make a difference in the world."
Many of Dr. Feldstein's students, of various political persuasions, went on to prominence in their own right, among them Raj Chetty, the Harvard economist known for his work on inequality and social mobility, and Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia University economist known for his work on global poverty.
“If you look at the economists who have played important roles in economic policy in this country over the past four decades, an incredible number of them were students of Marty's or students of students of Marty's," Douglas Elmendorf, dean of the Harvard Kennedy School and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Times.
“Marty taught people how to think about economic policy in a rigorous way with a real commitment to making policy better, in order to make the world better," Elmendorf said.
Indeed, Dr. Feldstein conceded that he had little time to devote to anything other than economics. Nearly all his friends were economists.
“It's one thing to have other interests, and another thing to have time for them," he told the Globe in 2005. “I keep accumulating books, and saying, 'Maybe next year.' "

Texto completo: Agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with livestock management, deforestation, and other common practices releasing heat-trapping compounds that would otherwise be trapped underground.
But agriculture could also help mitigate the problem: By reducing plowing, rotating crops, and planting cover crops on empty fields, farmers can help bury millions of tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by human activity.
Now, a well-funded Boston agricultural technology startup is looking to build a business around “regenerative" farming practices, using arable soil as a sink for greenhouse gas emissions.
Indigo Agriculture says it will pay farmers $15 for every metric ton of carbon that they can demonstrably capture in their soil, perhaps beginning to make a dent in the huge concentration of greenhouse gases that have accumulated in the atmosphere since the industrial era began.
“Nature provided us with the technology to remove the carbon dioxide from the air, and plants conveniently use the energy of the sun to do it," said David Perry, the company's chief executive. “This is what nature wants to do. We just have to harness it."
Indigo, which employs about 400 people at Charlestown's former Hood Milk plant, is best known for its development of seed coatings that use microbial treatments to help plants weather difficult conditions. But the company has set its sights on a broader reform of the agricultural industry, and it has raised a total of $650 million in venture capital.
Indigo calls this new venture the Terraton Initiative, a reference to the trillion tons of carbon released into the atmosphere as a result of human activity. The company hopes to work with more than 3,000 farmers through the program this year, sequestering as many as 3 million tons of carbon dioxide.
Indigo hopes it can entice other companies and industries to eventually purchase the credits it buys from farmers.
Businesses or individuals might buy them to demonstrate their commitment to the environment, the company said. Or, if Indigo can secure regulatory approval, the credits could potentially be purchased by energy and transportation companies, which face regulations in some jurisdictions to reduce emissions or support programs that do.
The program also could boost sales of Indigo's core products. The company says plants from its seeds allow farmers to use less synthetic fertilizer, which can also draw carbon out of soils. Indigo is not, however, requiring farmers in the carbon program to use its seeds.
The idea of sequestering carbon in soil is not new. Many of the practices Indigo has promoted are part of a movement toward “carbon farming," and farmers have long known that increased carbon content means better soil quality, drainage, and water retention.
The practices can cost more than conventional farming, however, and require different equipment. Though some organic farmers have undertaken these efforts independently, on the grounds that they produce stronger crops and better environmental outcomes, the price of entry has limited their spread.
Federal initiatives and programs in some states have offered limited support for soil strengthening programs, and the issue has begun to come up in the 2020 presidential campaign, with Democratic candidates including South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg touting such programs as potential greenhouse gas solutions.
Pamela Templer, a Boston University professor who studies climate change, said the potential of capturing carbon in soil is just beginning to gain traction.
“People increasingly are recognizing that using soils is a tangible goal we could have, and that we can both mitigate climate change and also help farmers," she said.
Though she cautioned that no single solution can fix climate change, Templer said ideas like soil carbon capture are important because they go beyond simply limiting fossil fuel consumption and begin to address the question of how to remove carbon from the atmosphere.
There's more carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere than at any other point in human history. Recent observations in Hawaii found carbon dioxide levels at 414.8 parts per million, which researchers said is the highest in millions of years.
The effects of this change have already become apparent, with rising temperatures, rising sea levels, and increasingly severe weather becoming more common.
Indigo believes incentivizing farmers to capture carbon could mean substantial improvement, though it will have to overcome some obstacles along the way. For one, if the company hopes to sell the credits in regulatory markets, it must find ways to measure carbon in soil across a huge amount of land.
Similar efforts in the forestry business have run into problems, said Barry Rabe, a University of Michigan professor who has written extensively about carbon markets.
“It is one thing to, with confidence, measure the amount of carbon coming from the smokestack of a power plant or the tailpipe of a vehicle," Rabe said. “It's just much, much harder to monitor when you get into a larger, decentralized area like agriculture."
Indigo's program is focused on soil concentrations, though it said it will also grant credits for other emissions reduction efforts, such as reduced use of fossil fuels for heavy equipment. The credits will take into account activity dating back three years.
Caro Roszell, who runs a Massachusetts soil carbon training program for the Northeast Organic Farming Association and operates a small farm, said another challenge Indigo could face is making sure that the carbon it pays farmers to trap remains in the ground. Disturbing the soil, she said, can release it back into the atmosphere.
Some farmers, she said, could “get their payment in the mail, and then they could go back out and plow, and oxidize a lot of that carbon."
The deep-pocketed Indigo, founded in 2014 by the biotech-focused venture firm Flagship Pioneering, has a roster of scientific researchers and a global workforce of around 950. It says it will at first rely on “rigorous soil sampling" and analysis, and aim to develop more advanced technologies. Indigo plans to award $1 million contracts for inventions or strategies to help the company reach its goals.
Others in the environmental world said they were skeptical that the company's $15 per ton price would be high enough to entice farmers.
Torri Estrada, executive director of the California-based Carbon Cycle Institute, which encourages carbon capture in farming, said many of the methods his group has used are much more expensive. Though he said he is interested to see what Indigo has planned, he cautioned that lower-priced efforts risk paying farmers for doing things they would have done anyway, or that are subsidized by government programs.
Josh Heinrich, who grows corn and soy on about 2,500 acres near Jamestown, N.D., and is in talks to join Indigo's program, said he has tried some carbon capture strategies over the past several years. He gradually implemented “no-till" practices to reduce plowing because he was looking for ways to increase the fertility of his soil while reducing fertilizer and labor.
The Indigo program could help him afford further improvements, he said, and could potentially entice neighboring farms that have not tried similar practices.
“There's got to be a value," he said. “These major corporations are polluting like crazy, and some of us out here on the ground can sequester some of that carbon that they're using."
But the program may not be a fit for everyone interested in carbon capture farming. It's launching with a minimum size of 300 acres, which means it could leave out some smaller farmers already using regenerative practices.
Chuck Currie, who manages the 88-acre organic Freedom Food Farm in Raynham, said he'd be skeptical about joining a program that uses carbon credits because he would not want his activities to justify emissions elsewhere.
“I'd feel better if [the money] was coming directly from our customers, with more education, and them being willing to pay for better-quality food," he said.

New York Times and MSNBC relationship tense over Maddow guest appearances

Texto completo: The relationship between the New York Times and MSNBC has reportedly become tense after the Times decided not to allow reporters to appear on “The Rachel Maddow Show”.
Executives from the two news organizations met last week hoping to resolve the issue but were unable to come to any agreements.
The rocky relationship began after reports from Vanity Fair revealed that the Times explicitly instructed their reporters to “steer clear” of TV show appearances that are deemed to be “too partisan,” which includes Maddow’s nightly show on MSNBC.
“We have always had a rule saying reporters should be wary of going on very clearly opinionated shows,” Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet told the Daily Beast. “It isn’t meant as a commentary on any show, just our view that hard-hitting stories like the ones we are doing should stand on their own.”
Vanity Fair also reported that “The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell” and “CNN Tonight with Don Lemon” have additionally been deemed “too partisan” for the Times’ standards.
"I do not get the sense that they are banning reporters from my show. But, I don't work for the Times so I can't be sure,” said Lemon. “However, it would be extremely shortsighted if they are when journalism is under attack. We should support each other. Period."
Tensions have only increased in recent days after Fox commentators such as Sean Hannity have criticized NBC’s decision to select Maddow as one of the five moderators for the upcoming Democratic presidential debate.
“Tinfoil hat-Maddow,” Hannity remarked is “the single-biggest liar, conspiracy theorist in the country.”
The Times also noted how “opinion journalists” are not often selected as moderators for these debates.
Many reporters for the New York Times are also paid contributors to both MSNBC and CNN, making it more unclear as to how and if the two organizations will be able to reconcile their differences on “reporting” versus “opinion."

Texto completo: Fox Nation personalities Diamond and Silk appeared on Capitol Hill Wednesday to tout a new bill targeting sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. They also talked up its sponsor, Rep. Steve King. House Republican leaders this year stripped the Republican lawmaker of his committee assignments, over a series of comments he made in an interview with the New York Times that seemingly promoted white nationalism.
King says the article quoted him out of context.
On Wednesday he sought to promote the "End Sanctuaries and Help Our American Homeless and Veterans Act," which would redirect federal funds from sanctuary cities and sanctuary states to programs helping homeless Americans and America's veterans.
The congressman also declined to comment on reports he was not invited on Air Force One for President Trump's trip to Iowa on Tuesday, despite asking the White House for a seat on the presidential aircraft.
"That's not on topic. Didn't you hear me? Any other questions?" he said.

Texto completo: BIRMINGHAM, ALA. -- Leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, opened their annual meeting this week vowing to focus on an issue that many pastors have long resisted: how to address sexual abuse at their churches.
Thousands of pastors voted late Tuesday afternoon to address the problem in a concerted way for the first time, enacting two new measures they say are a first step to reform. Outside the arena where they were gathered, victims and their families protested what they considered an inadequate response.
The pastors voted to create a centralized committee that would evaluate allegations against churches accused of mishandling abuse. They also approved an amendment to their constitution that would allow such churches to be expelled from the convention if the allegations were substantiated.
"Protecting God's children is the mission of the church," the denomination's president, J.D. Greear, said on Tuesday morning as he addressed the gathering. "We have to deal with this definitively and decisively."
But victims' advocates argued there was still widespread cultural resistance in the evangelical community to dealing with abuse. For years the Southern Baptist Convention has refrained from suggested reforms, like establishing a database of abusers, and has had no explicit procedures or enforcement mechanisms to address the problem of sexual abuse and its cover-up.
"The heart shift is what we really need to see," said Rachael Denhollander, who is on the denomination's sex abuse study group. "There has also been a significant effort by some factions of the S.B.C. to undermine even some of the good things that are already underway."
Earlier this year, Mr. Greear called for 10 churches to be investigated for how they handled abuse allegations. Southern Baptist officials cleared seven of them within days. Either these officials were ignorant or they were intentionally undermining efforts for reform, Ms. Denhollander said.
On Monday, The New York Times published an article about how the Village Church, one of the most prominent evangelical megachurches in the country, handled a sexual abuse allegation against an associate children's minister, Matthew Tonne. Christi Bragg, a longtime member, said that after telling church leaders that her daughter had been molested by the minister, the Village failed to provide her family with sufficient answers and support, and the family has since left the church.
The church said in a statement Tuesday that it was "absolutely grieved by this report, first and foremost because the Bragg family does not feel loved and supported by our church."
"While we are imperfect as a church, the care, compassion and spiritual well-being of our members and guests is at the core of who we are and how we operate as a church body," the Village said to members in an email.
The Village disputed the Times article's characterization of how the Braggs were treated, saying for instance that Matt Chandler, the lead pastor, spoke with Ms. Bragg in September, at a group meeting with many other families.
On Tuesday, Ms. Bragg said that was "simply not true," and that the family had never met personally with Mr. Chandler since her daughter's disclosure. Ms. Bragg said another top pastor explained to her the night of the group meeting that Mr. Chandler would not talk with her then because he did not want to draw attention to them.
Mr. Chandler interrupted his sabbatical to unexpectedly join the annual meeting on Tuesday.
At a panel, he said he was in "introspective mode" about what he could have done differently.
He said that he was not "running point on care" for the Braggs and allowed other pastors to handle their care because "they are 25 minutes away" and didn't attend the campus where he was based. Ms. Bragg's daughter was allegedly molested when the family attended Mr. Chandler's campus.
At one point, Mr. Chandler teared up when he spoke about his memories of his daughter talking with Mr. Tonne before her baptism. "He was a beloved man," Mr. Chandler said.
Mr. Chandler is in the inner circle of top Southern Baptist pastors across the country, and has strong relationships with many top Southern Baptist leaders, especially new and younger leaders. He is the president of Acts 29, a global association of hundreds of evangelical churches whose goal is to spread their faith and church model worldwide.
"We believed that having this conversation publicly and immediately would help Southern Baptists learn, whether positively or negatively, how to better handle these issues in our churches," said Jedidiah Coppenger, a leader of Baptist21, the group that hosted the event.
Russell Moore, who leads the denomination's public policy arm, said that while he sees progress, the challenges are also significant. "Sometimes Elijah sees a cloud the size of a person's hand on the horizon and that is what you need to press forward," he said.
Mr. Greear urged pastors to put aside their reputations and focus on doing what was right. "You've got to make this a priority," he said. "The credibility of what we actually believe about the gospel is at stake."

Texto completo: The first time I ever encountered Ed Levine's name, it was in a Ruth Reichl book. It was her 2005 memoir, "Garlic and Sapphires," the volume in which she amplified and electrified her turn as the restaurant critic for the New York Times. Late in the story, Reichl replayed her white- knuckle car tour of Brooklyn with Levine as he dodged traffic - and his own mortality - to give the critic a taste of the borough's finest bakeries, butchers and candy shops.
These scenes solidified everything I already loved, or would come to love, about Reichl and Levine: The latter's bloodhound pursuit of the most delicious foods - and his puppyish affection for the artisans who make them - and Reichl's lyrical voice and her ability to capture her movements through the food world, even when she fears she has been kidnapped by a madman.
"Ed was full of opinions: I should be buying this olive oil instead of that, my coffee should come from next door, and he did not approve of my choice of smoked salmon," Reichl wrote in "Garlic and Sapphires." "But his enthusiasm was so infectious that I couldn't be annoyed."
In the past few months, these two venerable food journalists - Levine, the cult figure; Reichl, the titan - have released books that lay out the vastly different paths they followed in the years after they shared that rollicking, invigorating trip in Brooklyn.
"Save Me the Plums" - an allusion to William Carlos Williams's sweet stanzas - depicts Reichl's own wild ride as editor of Gourmet magazine, back when its parent company, Condé Nast, still had clout, glamour and enough bank to hire Frank Gehry to design its cafeteria. "Serious Eater: A Food Lover's Perilous Quest for Pizza and Redemption" tells Levine's story of launching Serious Eats with a $500,000 investment from his brother.
One is a tale about the perils of Old Media, the other is a tale about the perils of New Media.
Reichl and Levine began these new chapters under radically different circumstances. After a deal to launch a food channel imploded on him, Levine poured his energies into creating Serious Eats, so that he and his like- minded food hunters could turn their obsessions and passions into online stories, which they hopefully could monetize if enough eyeballs read them. Reichl, on the other hand, practically had to be dragged from the Times to edit Gourmet magazine. She had good reasons for not wanting the job (starting with a résumé thin on magazine experience), but apparently no one turns down Samuel "Si" Newhouse, then chairman of Condé Nast Publications.
Reichl's job had perks that Levine could only imagine in his wildest dot-com IPO fantasies: a company car, with a driver. A clothing allowance. Country clubs. Hairdressers. "It's kind of unreal," Reichl tells her husband. "I worry about the money, worry it will change us."
But money and power - or the lack of it, in Levine's case - only distract from the larger narratives playing out in these books: that both Reichl and Levine found success, despite being in way over their heads. Reichl knew food, after all, but she knew little about magazines, let alone how to manage the staff at such a marquee publication, which Sullivan Street Bakery owner Jim Lahey once called the "New Yorker of food magazines back in the 1970s and '80s."
Similarly, Levine knew food, but he knew next to nothing about the Internet or the dark arts of venture capital. When David Karp, Serious Eats's 19-year-old chief technology officer, tried to explain HTML to Levine, he just shrugged. "I was looking for the perfect bite, and David was looking for the perfect byte." The page almost groans under the dead weight of that pun.
Yet something about their emotional makeup allowed Reichl and Levine to muddle through circumstances that would have felled more timorous souls. Maybe it was just their ego. Or maybe it was a learned skill to improvise like mad when necessary (Levine, in fact, studied music in college and produced jazz concerts in his early career). Or maybe they just possess some potent combination of traits inherent to boomers of a certain age: a defiance that comes easy to the protest generation, an unwavering belief in their own creativity and a willingness to stand up to the man, even if the man is Si Newhouse.
Whatever it is, Reichl and Levine summoned it at Gourmet and Serious Eats. Reichl undermined the status quo when she put cupcakes on the cover - essentially glorifying junk food at a magazine that catered to moneyed readers - and when she hired David Foster Wallace to ponder the moral ambiguities of boiling lobsters alive. Levine perhaps did something even bolder: He shifted the balance of power at Serious Eats away from food and dining guides and toward recipes, thanks largely to two gifted writers and cooks, Stella Parks and J. Kenji López-Alt. Still, it had to be a difficult decision for a man widely considered the best food sleuth in New York.
"Serious Eater" and "Save Me the Plums" almost cross paths at times, like when Reichl complains to a fellow editor about Gourmet's lack of an online presence. (Its recipes were unceremoniously shoveled onto Epicurious, a major source of tension in Gourmet's offices.) "Of course we should have our own website," Reichl complains to her managing editor. "Food sites are huge."
When you read this quote, you can't help but recall Levine's struggles. You're basically back into the roller coaster with Levine as he watches his traffic numbers spike at Serious Eats - and his ad revenue bob up and down, and all over the place. Food sites may look huge from the outside, but from the inside they can feel small and perpetually on the verge of collapse.
"This content and revenue migration to the web spelled trouble and caused major agita for even the best of the old-media publishers, like the New York Times and Condé Nast," writes Levine, as if he had an advance copy of Reichl's book. "They were befuddled by the Internet, and rightfully so."
As writers, Reichl and Levine are polar opposites. She is the author of tweets that read like verse, and he is New York's culinary cartographer, whose prose sometimes comes across like a series of exclamation points. With "Save Me the Plums," Reichl tells her story with one anecdote after another, some almost cinematic, and many featuring long quotes from loved ones, colleagues and even party guests. I can't help but think Reichl must be a helluva note-taker. For his part, Levine writes as if he were allergic to anecdotes. His story, filled with genuine fears and regrets, reads like reportage from the psychiatrist's couch.
As you reach the final pages of each book, you realize that only one of them had a classically happy ending. Levine sold Serious Eats and made a little money. It's American Dream stuff. But Reichl was the editor in charge when Condé Nast killed off Gourmet in 2009, a victim of the Great Recession and a dramatic shift in advertising dollars. It's a loss that still hurts a decade later, but at least Reichl's memoir gives us a sense of closure. And that's worth something, right?

It is time to protect California’s energy diversity

Texto completo: The benefits of diversity are seemingly everywhere in California. We celebrate different lifestyles, religions, cultures, music, languages, cuisine and geography. The value of diversity can be seen in other ways, too, practical ones such as the popularity of mutual fund investments, eating a balanced diet or making sure an NFL team has a playbook with multiple options.
Everywhere one looks, we see the value of diversifying. If all your eggs are in one basket, you are more vulnerable should something happen to your basket. Diversifying makes obvious sense.
While California needs to harness its sun, wind and water to make us more energy independent, some people are blindly trying to make California 100 percent electric.
Certainly, most people want to continue expanding energy sources that are earth-friendly. But wearing electricity-only blinders is misguided on numerous levels.
Whether transitioning to electric vehicles or “de-carbonizing” buildings, the importance of a multipronged approach to renewable energy has gotten lost or ignored – even energy sources that are renewable, sustainable, and help the environment.
First, relying on a single source of energy is a dangerous proposition. The last time California regulators tried to micromanage the energy market was two decades ago when the state was gripped by a massive energy crisis that brought electrical shortages and skyrocketing consumers prices. Rolling blackouts threw hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses into darkness and zero power.
Second, consider that our electrical grid is computer based. Hackers – inside the U.S. or around the world – pose a serious threat.
Last summer, the New York Times reported that “State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.”
Third, a shift toward a 100-percent electrical society reneges on the promise of building a vibrant and innovative California. There have been incredible innovations involving many different types of energy sources that are already helping California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
Major developments are taking place in the natural gas and propane industries, which has the flexibility to meet the needs of rural Californians. A growing number of California dairy farmers are converting methane into renewable natural gas, which would help California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
An electricity mandate would kill all of these advances.
Fourth, even if demand for electricity explodes, can California realistically provide enough renewable electricity? For the foreseeable future, the answer is no. And according to the Los Angeles Times, new demand will “tax a system already fragile, unstable and increasingly vulnerable to outside forces.”
Fifth, other sources of energy are simply better for the environment and our California lifestyle. Home and professional chefs prefer cooking with gas – as do consumers who grill with propane. Electricity is not exactly portable. How will restaurants and homeowners conveniently provide outdoor heating without tripping over dozens of extension cords?
Consumers also are vehemently opposed to being stripped of energy choice. By a margin of 5 to 1, Californians prefer natural gas for home heating and cooking. And 80 percent of voters oppose laws that would take away their natural gas appliances.
While most people like and appreciate electricity, they cannot and should not have to imagine a world with only one source of energy. Like everything else, energy diversity needs to be celebrated and promoted as a key to a clean and green future.

If the New York Times can't publish anti-Semitic cartoons, it won't push any cartoons at all

Texto completo: The New York Times’ official response to the appearance of an anti-Semitic political cartoon in its April 15 international edition has been, ironically, cartoonish.
To wit, the paper will no longer publish daily political cartoons in its international edition, bringing to an end long-running contracts with cartoonists Patrick Chappatte and Heng Kim Song, editorial page editor James Bennet announced Monday.
It is as if the paper is saying, “If we cannot run political cartoons that contain anti-Semitic themes, then we cannot run political cartoons at all.”
The simpler fix would be simply to weed out cartoons that contain obvious anti-Jewish bigotry or any overt bigotry, for that matter. But I guess the Times does not trust that its editors could be so discerning.
“We are very grateful for and proud of the work [Chappatte and Heng] have done for the international edition of the New York Times, which circulates overseas,” Bennet said in a statement. "[H]owever,” his statement added, “for well over a year we have been considering bringing that edition into line with the domestic paper by ending daily political cartoons and will do so beginning July 1.”Tweet
Bennet's announcement comes after the paper had already ceased publication of all syndicated political cartoons.
Though his statement suggests the decision to cut daily cartoons from the international edition was in the works well before it published a cartoon depicting a blind, yarmulke-wearing President Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is portrayed as a large-nosed, Star-of-David-sporting service dog, some are not buying it.
Tweet
And by “some,” I mean at least one of the contract cartoonists whom the New York Times just gave the boot.
“I’m putting down my pen, with a sigh: that’s a lot of years of work undone by a single cartoon — not even mine — that should never have run in the best newspaper in the world,” Chappatte groused on his website.
In April, after the paper published the anti-Semitic, anti-Netanyahu cartoon in its international edition, the paper initially slow-walked its response, claiming in a generic statement on social media that the “image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it.” The paper added that the bland statement would appear in print in the April 29 edition.
Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy issued a lengthier statement later on April 28 in which she made an actual attempt to apologize for the cartoon.
The cartoon, which was retracted from the Times' website soon after critics noted its obvious anti-Semitic themes, was created by Portuguese cartoonist António Moreira Antunes, the Times reported. Antunes, by the way, blamed the “Jewish propaganda machine” for the negative reaction to his cartoon, in case you were wondering what might have motivated him to draw it the way he did.
Honestly, the Times' handling of this entire ordeal could not be worse. It would be better for the paper to publish offensive materials and defend them, rather than fall back on this weird, childish I’m-taking-my-ball-and-going-home attitude. It is cowardly and censorious, neither of which is a good look for an ostensibly free and outspoken newspaper.

Texto completo: Best: Ali Stroker's speech
Ms. Stroker, who won for best featured actress in a musical as the man-crazy Ado Annie in Daniel Fish's iconoclastic revival of "Oklahoma!," exuded confidence and clarity, as well as sentiment and gratitude, in accepting her Tony. "This award is for every kid who is watching tonight who has a disability, who has a limitation or a challenge, who has been waiting to see themselves represented in this arena," said Ms. Stroker, who has been in a wheelchair since she was two. "You are." Though her speech was relatively (and refreshingly) short by awards show standards, she gave weight and substance to each of her words, as if all of them were of undeniable importance. They were. BEN BRANTLEY
Best: Showcase for a play
Considering the strong season for plays on Broadway, what a shame that the Tonys once again could not figure out how to represent them. This year was better than last: The playwrights were at least invited to speak (for 55 seconds) about their work. Yet Jez Butterworth, the author of "The Ferryman," wasted his minute with a uxorious tribute to his partner and star, Laura Donnelly -- sweet, I guess, but useless as a way of letting viewers know what his play, which later took home the big prize, is really about.
The only nonmusical work that really had a chance to shine was Tarell Alvin McCraney's "Choir Boy," about a gay, black prep school singer. No doubt invited to be performed -- and not just talked about -- on the Tonys because it relies so much on song and dance, it made the most of the opportunity, thanks to Jason Michael Webb's superb arrangement of the traditional spiritual "Rockin' Jerusalem," and Camille Brown's step-dance choreography. This was a stark and beautiful reminder that music and dance are forms of drama, not to be kept in separate cages. JESSE GREEN
Worst: Showcase for a musical that deserves better
"Hadestown" was the night's big winner, but the performance of "Wait for Me" didn't -- couldn't? -- capture the show's real calling cards, namely its knack for catharsis and a fabulous performance from Amber Gray as Persephone. The swinging lights are sensational in the theater, giving a sense of both climax and danger, but on the broadcast the technique came across as sort of puny. MARGARET LYONS

Best: Audra vs. Laura
Though neither woman was a Tony nominee, Laura Linney and Audra McDonald gave the evening's wittiest performance (sorry, James Corden) as they faced off in mock hostility in an otherwise lame segment about too-nice theater folk learning to vent. Though it was hard to top Ms. Linney's malevolent coolness, Ms. McDonald held her own and then some, as she started to tear off her earrings to do battle. The evening could have used some more of their ripe theatricality. BEN BRANTLEY
Worst: You had to be there (really)
Is it possible the best parts of the ceremony didn't air and were never meant to? There was audience karaoke at Radio City during the commercial breaks, which included Mr. Corden and Ben Platt duetting on "Tomorrow" from "Annie" and Billy Porter singing "Everything's Coming Up Roses" from "Gypsy." Televise this! MARGARET LYONS

Best: Bathroom break
"Be More Chill" only had one nomination, but its breakout song "Michael in the Bathroom" (written by Tony nominee Joe Iconis) got a whole terrific spoof. Mr. Corden, holed up in a men's room stall inside Radio City Music Hall, sang wistfully about his insecurities as M.C., and then last year's hosts, Josh Groban and Sara Bareilles, joined in with laments of their own. A surprise, slick cameo from Neil Patrick Harris (and his mustache) capped off the song, making the bit funnier and snappier than the ceremony's opening number. MARGARET LYONS

Best: Short-form performances
Mr. Corden asking stars in the crowd to practice their "losing faces" promised to be run-of-the-mill comic padding, but Kristin Chenoweth, Andrew Rannells and Jeff Daniels made the most of it, earning hearty laughs with their terrifyingly frozen smiles. SCOTT HELLER
Best: Defense of a fashion choice
"I spent too many years being a cater waiter to enjoy wearing a tux," the playwright and performer Taylor Mac explained on the red carpet, proudly festooned in a creation by his regular collaborator Machine Dazzle. SCOTT HELLER
Worst: Defensive posture
The opening number begged binge-watching couch potatoes to consider a trip to the theater instead. Another song worried neurotically about the Tonys telecast ratings. Mr. Corden suggested that a Cardi B/Nicki Minaj-style feud might goose Broadway's cultural profile.
Enough with the defensiveness! Broadway may be a splurge (though it doesn't cost as much as many pop concerts) and it may not get as much attention as other performance mediums. But almost 15 million people went to a Broadway show this past season, more than attended professional sporting events in the region. It makes no sense to endorse false notions of cultural unworthiness, especially using criteria like mass popularity that most plays and musicals take such pains to delegitimize.

Best: Wise advice
They say to learn from the best and two "Hadestown" winners included sage advice in their acceptance speeches. André De Shields, the best featured actor in a musical, shared his three cardinal rules: "One, surround yourself with people whose eyes light up when they see you coming. Two, slowly is the fastest way to get to where you want to be. And three, the top of one mountain is the bottom of the next, so keep climbing." Anaïs Mitchell, who wrote the show's book and score, had her own three rules: "Number one, nobody does it alone. Number two, it takes a long time. And number three, it's worth it." MARGARET LYONS

Texto completo: ISTANBUL - Iranian authorities revoked the credentials of a New York Times journalist and have barred him from working in Iran for the past four months, the newspaper said Monday.
Thomas Erdbrink, a Dutch citizen, is a Tehran-based correspondent for the Times and has written for the paper since 2012.
Iran's government did not give an explanation for its decision to withdraw Erdbrink's press credentials but have "repeatedly assured" the Times that they would soon be restored.
Authorities also denied Erdbrink's wife, award-winning photographer Newsha Tavakolian, permission to work, the paper said. Tavakolian is an Iranian citizen and has published photos in the Times and with other news organizations since 2001.
Erdbrink previously reported for The Washington Post from Tehran.
Rights groups say Iran is one of the world's worst violators of press freedom and that Iranian journalists are regularly subjected to intimidation, arrest and unfair trials.
More than 800 journalists have been imprisoned or executed in Iran since the 1979 revolution, according to the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, or RSF.
Jason Rezaian, who was The Post's correspondent in Tehran, was arrested by Iranian authorities in 2014 and held in the notorious Evin prison for 544 days.
Few Western news organizations maintain an official presence inside Iran, where authorities have in recent years arrested several dual and foreign nationals, including Americans.
The Iranian government "has extended its fight against media freedom beyond the country's borders and also targets the international media," RSF says.
The moves come amid heightened tensions between Iran and the United States, which has targeted Tehran with a so-called maximum pressure campaign to cripple its economy and isolate its leaders.
In November, the Trump administration reimposed harsh economic sanctions that were lifted under a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, including the United States. The deal curbed Iran's nuclear energy program in exchange for widespread sanctions relief. The administration withdrew from the pact, however, saying it failed to address issues such as Iran's ballistic missile program.
In recent weeks, the Trump administration also said it was moving more military assets to the Middle East in a show of force to deter Iran.

Texto completo: Massachusetts voters really don't like President Trump, but that doesn't mean they want Democrats on Capitol Hill to try to impeach him.
Sixty-one perecent of those surveyed in a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll viewed Trump unfavorably — far more than any of the other politicians included in the question. Just 30 percent held a favorable view of Trump.
However, 49 percent of Mass. voters said the House of Representatives should not seriously consider impeaching Trump, according to the survey released Tuesday. Forty-two percent said they were in favor, and 9 percent were undecided.
The number of those in favor of impeachment jumped among Democrats: 63 percentsaid the House should consider impeachment, while 25 percent said it should not.
“The impeachment number tells us that people want Congress to focus more on the issues," said Suffolk's David Paleologos, who oversaw the poll.
That sentiment was echoed by Kurt Bolgen, 34, who participated in the Suffolk poll.
“I think that impeachment in general is bad for the country. I have no use for the man who is in that office personally," the Melrose resident said. “The issue that a president can't be indicted was designed for a specific reason. And I just think that progressives and Democrats need to focus on governing and presenting platform options at this point."
Calls for impeachment have been growing, especially among the 2020 Democratic primary field, as the Trump administration has refused to cooperate with congressional investigations, ignoring subpoenas related to the president's tax returns, the unredacted Mueller report, and testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. It's created a split among the House Democratic caucus, with some calling for impeachment and others, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advocating a more cautious approach, fearing the move could backfire.
Massachusetts' congressional delegation, which includes 11 Democrats, is not immune from the divide. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representatives Ayanna Pressley, Seth Moulton, and Jim McGovern have called on the House to at least begin an impeachment inquiry, while the rest of the delegation has held off.
Massachusetts is still more heavily in favor of impeachment than voters nationally. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found this month that just 22 percent of voters favored a start to impeachment proceedings.
The poll was conducted among 600 registered Massachusetts voters from June 5 to 9, and it had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

It’s phony math, not clean air

Texto completo: A Times editorial

The Trump administration had a choice when its plan for replacing an Obama-era pollution rule was forecast to result in thousands of premature deaths. It could have recognized the harm and ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to side with public health over big polluters. Or it could simply change the math for what constitutes a health risk, thereby driving the mortality figures lower. That the administration leans toward the second option is not surprising, which is why Congress and the courts should ensure any change is based on sound science.

The administration made public the details of its new pollution rules in August, seeking to overturn an aggressive plan by the Obama White House to speed up the closure of coal-burning power plants, one of the main producers of greenhouse gases. The Obama-era Clean Power Plan set new targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, encouraging utilities to use cleaner energy sources like solar and wind under a proposal it estimated would help prevent between 1,500 and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030.

But the Trump administration countered that the plan was too costly and burdensome to business, and it proposed an alternative, the Affordable Clean Energy rule. It would encourage minor on-site efficiency improvements at individual plants and allow states to relax pollution rules to enable older, dirtier plants to operate longer. The Trump EPA estimated its plan would have resulted in an increase of between 470 and 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 because of increased rates of microscopic airborne particulates. Those particulates are linked to heart and lung disease and can trigger chronic conditions such as asthma and bronchitis.

But now, the New York Times reported last month, the administration is considering a new analytical model that would significantly drive down its number of estimated deaths. The proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. And the administration would likely use the new standard, should it be adopted, as a weapon to further roll back other pollution rules. Five people familiar with the plan who spoke with the Times  all current or former E.P.A. officials  said the new model would appear in the agencys final analysis of the regulation, which is expected to be made public this month.

Experts in environmental law and health criticized the change, likening it to rule-making on the fly and deriding it as an attempt to whitewash the mortality figures. This looks like a math exercise in reverse, with the administration shopping for a formula to produce a rosier result from dirtier air. Congress and the courts, which may ultimately decide this issue, need to stand firmly with decades of federal protections for clean air and public health. Responsible players in the power industry are already moving to cleaner energies. There is no need to arrest that momentum by rewarding the worst polluters.

Finding time to read ... to everyone else

Texto completo: Of all the requirements to do a job well, consider those of Keith Sellon-Wright:
Heyworth  h -w rth 
Rod Blagojevich  bl -goy-y -vich 
DeWitt  duh-wit 
Most people," says Sellon-Wright, of the 258 Central Illinois-specific pronunciations he has studied of late, "would be surprised how often words that they're sure they know how to pronounce aren't pronounced that way at all.
Steven Skelton  skel-ton 
Pantagraph  pant- -graf 
Amanda Hamm  h m 
And, one more: "audible (awd- -bul) ... books (b ks)."
Thats what Sellon-Wright does.
Have you caught up with the craze yet?
If you listen to either The New York Times or Wall Street Journal daily audio editions or any of the nearly 50 books hes read aloud, youve already heard Sellon-Wright.
Hes becoming an old veteran of a new age.
Mellow-toned, smooth, calm but with exasperation (Save my babies! Oh my God!) when needed, his voice is now becoming heard in this area, too  as audiobook reader of the new book by Pantagraph reporter Edith Brady-Lunny and already-best-selling author Steve Vogel  The Unforgiven"  on the life and case of Amanda Hamm.
We all learned to read in first grade.
Sellon-Wright, too.
Then he finished schooling, moved on to a career in IT and then also acting. California-based, his acting resumé spans a variety of TV, from Seinfeld to Mad Men to NCIS to the latest season of Shameless on Showtime.
And now, fully in his 60s, an age when everyone else is readying to retire and lean back in a chair to read to themselves, Sellon-Wright is going into a specially built, soundproof studio in his own home to read to everyone else.
Audiobooks? Keith Sellon-Wright knows what you're thinking  it must be easy, right?
But, have you ever noticed how you instantly correct those on The Weather Channel or national news when they mispronounce the name of your city, or town, or a specific person?
In Illinois as an example, San Jose (san-j es) is not San Jose (san h se- y). It's Cairo (k y-row), not Cairo (ky'-row). Its Schroeder (schr y-der) Hall at Illinois State University, not Schroeder (schr w-der).
A mispronunciation," says Sellon-Wright, "takes that listener away from being engrossed in the book and credibility is lost.
Thus, he subcontracts a person in advance of a read to sleuth out all the names and pronunciations of a specific area, sending back pronunciations the way you see them in a dictionary (dik-sh - ner- ).
Another issue is an accent.
I've heard horror stories of narrators not noticing until page 250 of 300 that a main character has an Irish accent. That means tons of going back, finding the audio and having to re-record it.
Inflection is yet another.
In the Brady-Lunny/Vogel book as an example (its the true story of Hamm, her then-boyfriend and three young children in the back seat of a car that in 2003 slipped into Clinton Lake, leading to trials and this question: horrible accident or murderous plot?), Sellon-Wright says he had to go back and re-do.
Generally in non-fiction, you don't add too much 'acting'  you let the listener do the work, says Sellon-Wright. But after listening to the rather dispassionate way I had recorded Amanda Hamm in my first passes, it just didn't feel like I gave the urgency of those sections their due.
Audiobooks have been around since the 1930s. In the 1980s and 90s, the medium began to attract retailers.
Now, with earbuds, mobility and busy times, being able to "read" a book while exercising, driving, doing the laundry, etc., etc., is what Amazon is calling "the future of a love of reading in the multi-tasking 21st century."
And Sellon-Wright as a reader?
Vogel wrote what would become a New York Times best-seller  "Reasonable Doubt," about the 1983 Hendricks family murders in Bloomington  and it eventually became an audiobook, too.
I was given the choice of several narrators and chose Keith, essentially for his natural voice quality and pacing," says Vogel. "After the fact, I was impressed by how much effort he put into making sure pronunciations were correct and his ability to effectively employ subtle, yet distinctive, non-distracting voices for various characters."
"So," adds Vogel, "when it came time to select a narrator for 'The Unforgiven,' we insisted on Keith.
Whose last name, by the way, is pronounced s llin-rite."
And, thanks for reading this. Even without him reading it.

Texto completo: No han pasado dos días desde que se llego a un acuerdo entre México y Estados Unidos para suspender la imposición de los aranceles a los productos mexicanos para que el presidente Donald Trump volviera a amenzar a López Obrador.
“Sin embargo, si por alguna razón desconocida no hay (cooperación por parte de México), siempre podemos volver a nuestra posición anterior, y muy lucrativa, de (amenazar con) Aranceles; pero no creo que eso vaya a ser necesario” , dijo Trump en Twitter al defender el acuerdo pero sin dejar sus amenazas contra el gobierno de AMLO.
En una serie de tuits, Trump defendió el pacto migratorio logrado este viernes con México, por el que él accedió a suspender los aranceles que planeaba imponer a todas las importaciones mexicanas, después de que el diario The New York Times afirmara que algunos puntos se acordaron hace meses.
“Antes, México no estaba cooperando en la frontera, y ahora tengo una confianza completa, especialmente después de hablar ayer con su presidente (Andrés Manuel López Obrador), en que cooperarán mucho y en que quieren hacer bien el trabajo”, escribió Trump.
El mandatario aseguró que “se acordaron algunas cosas que no se anunciaron en el comunicado” del viernes, “una en particular”, y que eso “se anunciará en el momento adecuado”.
La Casa Blanca no dio más detalles sobre cuál podría ser ese acuerdo inédito, y el secretario en funciones de seguridad nacional, Kevin McAleenan, se limitó a recordar que, como se anunció el viernes, está previsto que siga habiendo negociaciones durante los próximos 90 días.
“Hay un mecanismo para asegurarnos de que ellos (México) hacen lo que prometieron hacer, de que hay un resultado y vemos una reducción grande en los números” de inmigrantes que llegan a EEUU, dijo este domingo McAleenan a la cadena de televisión Fox News.
La embajadora de México en Estados Unidos, Martha Bárcena, precisó después que las conversaciones entre los equipos técnicos continuarán “casi semanalmente”, por lo que en el plazo de 90 días podría haber nuevos anuncios.
“(Lo anunciado el viernes) es una declaración conjunta de principios, que nos da una base para la hoja de ruta que tenemos que seguir en los próximos meses en cuanto a migración” , explicó Bárcena en una entrevista con la cadena televisiva CBS News.
Bárcena apuntó que el objetivo es devolver las cifras de migrantes que llegan a EEUU a los niveles de 2018, y pronosticó que habrá “resultados en un plazo relativamente corto, de un mes o mes y medio”, gracias al despliegue de unos 6.000 efectivos de la Guardia Nacional de México en la frontera de ese país con Guatemala.
Pero la embajadora no confirmó que, como parte del acuerdo alcanzado el viernes, México haya “accedido a empezar inmediatamente a comprar grandes cantidades de productos agrícolas” a EE.UU., como aseguró Trump en un tuit este sábado.
“Estoy absolutamente segura de que el comercio en bienes agrícolas podría aumentar drásticamente en los próximos meses”, debido a la combinación de la suspensión de los aranceles y “la ratificación del (acuerdo comercial) T-MEC” en EE.UU., México y Canadá, subrayó Bárcena.
Su entrevistadora le pidió entonces aclarar si estaba hablando de un acuerdo paralelo logrado durante las negociaciones de esta semana, o si simplemente se refería a tendencias comerciales, y Bárcena respondió: “Estoy hablando sobre comercio”.
El pacto anunciado el viernes permitirá la ampliación a toda la frontera común de un programa que el Gobierno ha aplicado hasta ahora solo en tres puntos de entrada en la zona limítrofe, y que obliga a los solicitantes de asilo a esperar en el país vecino mientras se tramitan sus casos en territorio estadounidense.
Ese proceso puede durar meses o incluso años, y este año ya se ha enviado a México a 10,393 solicitantes de asilo en EEUU, según fuentes oficiales mexicanas.
La oposición demócrata ha criticado a Trump por usar la amenaza de aranceles para extraer compromisos de México sobre inmigración, y dos aspirantes presidenciales, Bernie Sanders y Beto O’Rourke, arremetieron este domingo contra el mandatario por su aviso de que, si no hay avances migratorios, volverá a amenazar con aranceles.
“Necesitamos una relación decente con México. Son nuestros aliados, como Canadá. No deberíamos estar enfrentándonos a ellos cada día”, dijo Sanders a la cadena CNN.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump tuiteó desde temprana hora acerca el acuerdo con el Gobierno mexicano sobre inmigración, seguridad y materia comercial para evitar aplicar las tarifas de hasta 25% a productos de ese país; destacó que hay un elemento importante que se dará a conocer más adelante.
Los comentarios del mandatario formaron parte de la respuesta al reporte de The New York Times, sobre que los puntos que integran el pacto entre su Administración y la de Andrés Manuel López Obrador fueron cerrados en marzo por la entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , y la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez Cordero .
El mandatario republicano dijo que México no había cooperado con los Estados Unidos adecuadamente, pero ahora tiene completa confianza, especialmente luego de hablar con su homólogo López Obrador.
“Hay algunas cosas importantes que no se mencionaron ayer en el comunicado de prensa, una en particular, sobre la que acordamos” , indicó el presidente en un tuit. “Será anunciada en su debido momento” .
Agregó que ahora existe una gran cooperación entre ambas naciones y recalcó que era algo que no existía “en décadas” por razones desconocidas.
…..not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time. There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn’t exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019
Las críticas sobre el acuerdo se desataron en ambos países, incluso en voz de la lideresa de la Cámara, Nancy Pelosi .
“Las amenazas y las rabietas no son una forma de negociar la política exterior”, dijo Pelosi en un comunicado el sábado.
Grupos de activistas, como Families Belong Together México consideraron que poner a inmigrantes como un elemento de negociación entre países los coloca en una posición más vulnerable.
“La celebración del acuerdo migratorio entre México y los Estados Unidos en Tijuana no toma en cuenta la desesperación y el sufrimiento de los miles de migrantes que son afectados por las políticas migratorias de Trump. Hemos deshumanizado la migración” , afirmó Soraya Vázquez , directora de Families Belong Together México. “Nos hemos vuelto insensibles frente a una realidad lacerante de miles de niños y familias que deben esperar su proceso de asilo en Tijuana sin seguridad, comida o refugio adecuado”.
El presidente Trump afirmó que México se había comprometido a aumentar la adquisición de productos agrícolas de los Estados Unidos.
Cuestionada al respecto, al Embajadora mexicana, Martha Bárcena , evitó desmentir o reafirmar dicha revelación, aunque destacó que en los últimos cuatro meses el país vecino del sur se convirtió en el socio comercial número uno de EEUU.
En entrevista en el programa Face The Nation de CBS, la Embajadora destacó que con la aprobación del Acuerdo Estados Unidos-México-Canadá (USMCA o T-MEC ) habrá ese incremento.
“Hará un incremento de productos agrículos y manufactureros”, apuntó, pero la entrevistadora Margaret Brennan insistió sobre el mensaje tuiteado por el presidente Trump acerca del incremento en productos agrícolas.
“Ahora somos el segundo comprador de los Estados Unidos en ese sector” , dijo Bárcena. “Tenemos una economía integrada en el sector agrícola”.

El canciller mexicano, Marcelo Ebrard , afirmó que el acuerdo evitó la pérdida hasta de 900,000 empleos en México en forma inmediata, sí como la cancelación del T-MEC.
Sobre los inmigrantes que se enviará a México señaló que se les dará asistencia legal y orientación para laborar en el país, además de registrar todos los extranjeros que busquen llegar a EEUU.
“Necesitamos saber quiénes son, si no, no los podemos proteger” , afirmó.
???? #MéxicoUnidoEsGrande
"No hay tarifas, Presidente, y salimos con la dignidad intacta": @m_ebrard
Evitamos:
→ Caída de inversión
→ Pérdida de más de 900 mil empleos
→ Perder ratificación del #TMEC con EUA ???? y Canadá ????#DignidadYAmistadhttps://t.co/9sf0x9COJe

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump said Sunday that there's more to his deal with Mexico on tariffs and immigration than he announced two days ago, but he offered no specifics.
Trump tweeted that there were some things Mexico said it would do to curb Central American migration that were "not mentioned" in a description of the agreement put out by the State Department. He said those further steps would be "announced at the appropriate time. "
When pressed in a television interview on whether Mexico agreed to further measures, Mexico's Ambassador to the United States Martha Bárcena said there were "details" that didn't make it in the official declaration.
Trump gave Mexico an ultimatum, demanding that it take stronger action to limit the flow of Central American migrants or he would impose an escalating series of tariffs on the country beginning Monday.
Friday, he said he was "indefinitely" suspending the threat because of an agreement reached with Mexico.
The New York Times reported Saturday that the steps outlined in the deal were ones Mexico had already agreed to in previous rounds of negotiations.
A crisis of Trump's own making?Critics say it's not clear how much Mexico deal will accomplish
Trump pulls tariff threat: Says deal on migrants reached with Mexico
The administration said Mexico agreed to take "unprecedented steps to increase enforcement" along its southern border with Guatemala, where many Central Americans cross into Mexico on their way to the USA. Mexico said it would crack down on human smuggling organizations.
Saturday morning, Trump tweeted that Mexico reached a deal with the United States to purchase American agricultural goods as part of a larger deal to avoid the imposition of tariffs on Mexican goods.
Asked on "Face the Nation" whether there was a new agricultural deal, Bárcena brought up the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement signed last November, saying it would lead to a dramatic increase in trade.
She insisted on Twitter that she "did not contradict" Trump.
"I just explained that with no tariffs and the USMCA ratification the trade in agricultural products will increase dramatically," Bárcena said.
Republican lawmakers praised Trump's strategy on pressing Mexico, even though many oppose tariffs. On "Fox News Sunday," Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, called Trump's actions "brilliant" when asked whether Republican senators would stand up against tariffs.
He said the migrant crisis was "out of control" so Trump "had to act. "
Celebration in Mexico: Mexican president to 'celebrate' in Tijuana after Trump pulls tariff threat
Congressional Democrats called the dispute over tariffs a crisis of Trump's own making.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York wrote on Twitter that "if past is prologue, this is likely to be one of the president’s typical, bogus solutions to justify backing off things like the tariffs. "
"Threats and temper tantrums are no way to negotiate foreign policy," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , said in a statement released Saturday.

3 reasons real estate is a lousy retirement investment: Location, location, location

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger “forever” homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families. It also supports one of the most controversial things I’ve ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don’t bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can’t buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn’t a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Paul Davidson’s story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Moving up: How to take the stress out of selling your house and buying another home
Farm crisis? Low prices, floods and trade wars plague American farmers, putting their survival at risk
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location. The housing market isn’t uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco’s property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That’s your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it’s cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren’t guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well. But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location. You’re betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You’re betting some hot new suburb won’t steal your hamlet’s thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don’t shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn’t stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn’t.

Miracle Mets reminisce about '69 World Series

Texto completo: BRIDGEWATER – Ahead of an appearance at TD Bank Ballpark this afternoon, Art Shamsky joked that he played 13 seasons of professional baseball, but fans only seem to ever want to ask him about one of them.
"Nobody talks about the other 12," he quipped. "All anybody ever talks about is 1969."
Four members of the 1969 World Series Champion "Amazin' Mets" will be reunited as part of a special event prior to and during the Somerset Patriots' series finale with the York Revolution at 1:05 p.m. Shamsky, Ed Kranepool, Cleon Jones and Ron Swoboda are scheduled to appear and sign autographs on the main concourse. Kranepool, who spent his entire 18-year career with the Mets from 1962 to 1979 and is a member of the Mets Hall of Fame, is just five weeks removed from kidney transplant surgery. But the beloved former first baseman and outfielder says he "feels great" and is excited to once again meet the fans in Somerset after an extremely well-received appearance in Bridgewater with Shamsky and the now-late Ed Charles in 2015.
"It's going to be nice to get out, say hello to these fans and enjoy myself," Kranepool told MyCentralJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "I'm encouraged about going over there. It's always a nice event. They do such a professional job over there, it's a great organization and great ballpark, and the last time we were there it was very well-received. I'm really looking forward to this one."
The Bronx native memorably hit a home run in Game 3 of the World Series that year, and echoed Shamsky's sentiments that, despite a long career, it's the legacy of the 1969 season that's seemed to live on forever. "I played 18 seasons and went to two World Series for the Mets; we lost in '73 in seven games to Oakland, but nobody talks about that," Kranepool said. "Everybody seems to have been at the stadium at '69 and has a piece of the action, whether it be the sod, or they saw the game...being a New Yorker, people always want to talk about it. It keeps you current." Shamsky was a .300 hitter with 14 home runs for the Mets during the 1969 season, both of which were good for second on the team; he also hit cleanup in the postseason and hit .538. Five of his eight big-league seasons were with the Mets, but it was the Amazin' year that he captured with co-author Erik Sherman in his new book, "After The Miracle: The Lasting Brotherhood of the '69 Mets," which recently made The New York Times best-sellers list. "The memories are still vivid, because that was such an incredible year for all of us," Shamsky said. "All of our lives changed when we won on Oct. 16, 1969...so many books have been written about that team, I'd venture to say that more books have been written about that team than any team in history, so what we wanted to was just let fans get closer to the players and feel like they were a part of the conversations. This was about the camaraderie and the friendship we had on the team that we still have to this day." Between the stories told in the book and those that will be shared Sunday at the ballpark, fans both young and old can perhaps gain a new appreciation for the "Miracle Mets" club.
"I enjoy talking with the younger people, but many people know about that team from their parents or their grandparents," Shamsky said. "We live in a world where it's what's in front of you right now, and a lot of people who weren't born by then don't know a lot about that team or that era. But, once they hear stories about that team and where we came from – how bad the team was in the early years and even the year before – and when people talk about the late 60's and that era, which was so much in turmoil, I think we get their ear. That team has a special meaning to people, and they're able to pass it on from generation to generation."
The Mets defeated the Baltimore Orioles in five games in '69 to capture their first World Series championship.

Texto completo: British pomp, pageantry mark queen's 93rd birthday, officially
LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with the annual Trooping the Colours parade, a traditional display of British pageantry. About 1,400 soldiers in scarlet coats and bearskin hats marched past in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade in Westminster.
Royals taking part included Prince Charles, Prince William and his wife, Kate, and Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan - who appeared in her first public outing since giving birth to their son, Archie, to watch the birthday flyby of military aircraft.
Baby Archie did not appear, but another young royal almost stole the queen's limelight when he made his debut on Buckingham Palace's balcony. Prince Louis, 1, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, waved frantically at the first sight of helicopters.
The queen marks her birthday twice a year - an official ceremony is always held in June, in hopes of holding the parade in good weather. Her actual birthday, April 21, is usually celebrated with close family only. She turned 93.
Thousands of spectators lined the parade ground and gathered in nearby St. James's park to watch the spectacle in sparkling sunshine. They then walked down the road leading to Buckingham Palace, gathering at the gates to honor the monarch ahead of the fly-past.
The queen waved and smiled as she emerged on the balcony and the crowd roared.
The ceremony originated from traditional preparations for battle. The colors - or flags - were "trooped," or carried down the lines of soldiers, so they could be seen and recognized in battle.

London police arrest 5 teens in alleged attack of women on bus
LONDON- Five teen boys were under arrest Saturday in connection with an alleged assault on two women who refused to kiss as they were surrounded on a London bus and taunted as lesbians, according to an account by one of the women.
The alleged attack was revealed in social media posts by one of the women, Melania Geymonat.
The Metropolitan Police announced that four teens had been arrested Friday and said another boy, 16, was arrested Saturday. Police were reviewing footage of the attack.
Geymonat, an Uruguayan flight attendant, said she and her U.S. girlfriend were traveling home on the top deck of a bus to Camden Town, a neighborhood busy with nightlife, on May 30 when they were attacked.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the incident "a disgusting, misogynistic attack."

US ambassador says Israel can retain parts of the West Bank
JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday come about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.

Albania president cites tense climate in canceling elections
TIRANA, Albania - Albanian President Ilir Meta on Saturday canceled upcoming municipal elections, citing the need to reduce political tensions in the country. Meta said he would clarify his decision Monday.
Thousands of Albanians who support the political opposition assembled for an anti-government protest Saturday. The Albanian opposition accuses the government of links to organized crime and vote rigging. The government denies the allegations and said protests that started in February have hurt the country's image as the European Union is set to decide this month whether to launch negotiations to include Albania as a member.
The U.S. and EU urged the opposition to disavow violence and sit with government representatives to resolve the crisis.

Hillary Clinton says youngest brother has died
NEW YORK - Hillary Clinton's youngest brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The former U.S. senator, secretary of state, first lady and Democratic presidential candidate announced the death Saturday on Twitter.
Clinton remembered her brother as a generous person who could walk into a room and "light it up with laughter."
"It's hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today," she tweeted.
He was survived by his wife, Megan, and three children, Zach, Simon and Fiona. Tony Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham. He was raised in the Chicago suburbs along with his older siblings, Hillary and Hugh.
The youngest Rodham held a variety of jobs, including stints as a prison guard, insurance salesman, repo man, private detective and business investor.

Pickup truck hits Amish carriage, killing 2 kids
ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Authorities say a pickup rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
State police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.

Rebel soccer icon: A Syrian soccer goalkeeper who became an icon of the rebellion against President Bashar Assad has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces, the rebels said Saturday.
Abdelbaset Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a player for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Assad in 2011, Sarout led rallies and became known as the "singer of the revolution" for his songs and ballads.
Following the arc of the Syrian uprising, Sarout later took up arms as the country slid into civil war. Many activists and rebels came to refer to him as the "guardian of freedom," a play on the Arabic word for goalkeeper.

Texto completo: Just up for summer's reading time: a few author talks to pique your interest.
* Nancy Sheppard's latest history is "Lost Attractions of Hampton Roads" (History Press, 206 pp.), exploring sites such as Hampton's old Rice's Fossil Pit; the roller coaster at Norfolk's Ocean View Amusement Park; and Frontier City, Virginia Beach. She'll give a talk and sign copies Monday, 7 to 8 p.m., Hampton History Museum. 120 Old Hampton Lane, downtown. Admission and garage parking free.
HamptonHistoryMuseum.org; 757-727-1102.
* William Geroux, author of the well-regarded "The Mathews Men," now has "The Ghost Ships of Archangel: The Arctic Voyage that Defied the Nazis" (Viking, 337 pp.) He'll give a talk at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Prince Books about the fraught U.S.-British voyage to get supplies through the Arctic to Stalin's army. 109 E. Main St., Norfolk. 757-622-9223.
* Robert N. Macomber plans to talk about his latest Peter Wake maritime thriller, "Honoring the Enemy," about the U.S. victory over Spain in 1898 Cuba. (Naval Institute Press, 368 pp.)
2 p.m. next Sunday the 16th, Prince Books.
Michael Wolff's second tell-all about President Trump, "Siege: Trump Under Fire" (Henry Holt, 335 pp.) is out. It's crippled by three central flaws, writes Ryan Lizza, a senior political analyst for CNN and chief political correspondent for Esquire. First, Wolff relies too much on one person - as with "Fire and Fury," it's Steve Bannon, and now he's an outsider with less access to Trump. Wolff makes fact errors that hurt his credibility, and uses "sourcing that is so opaque it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable." (He also makes a problematic central argument that, Lizza says, "the real heart of Trumpism is heroically being kept alive by Bannon's band of true-believing outsiders.") (Washington Post)
E-book piracy: The stealing continues, legal enforcement is increasingly weak, and publishers and authors must work together to fight it. So said an Authors Guild panel at this year's Book Expo. (PW)

New and recent
"A History of the Bible: The Story of the World's Most Influential Book" by John Barton (Viking, 448 pp.). Barton ("The Bible: The Basics"), editor-in-chief of the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion, offers a rigorous, jargon-free and comprehensive look at "the story of the Bible from its remote beginnings in folklore and myth to its reception and interpretation" today. To him, "freedom of interpretation and commitment to religious faith are complementary, rather than antithetical," says Publishers Weekly.
"Heavy: An American Memoir" by Kiese Laymon (Scribner, 256 pp., new in paperback). Laymon's memoir, about growing up black in Jackson, Miss., is "a gorgeous, gutting book that's fueled by candor yet freighted with ambivalence," wrote New York Times reviewer Jennifer Szalai. "It's full of devotion and betrayal, euphoria and anguish, tender embraces and rough abuse." Written in address to his complex mother, a professor who gave her son daily writing assignments but beat him for not being perfect, this "generous, searching book," wrote Szalai, "explores all the forces that can stop even the most buoyant hopes from ever leaving the ground." (Moira Macdonald, Seattle Times)
Also:"Called to Forgive: The Charleston Church Shooting" by Anthony B. Thompson with Denise George ... From William H. McRaven, "Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations" ... "Howard SternComes Again," by the shock jock, who says he's tired of being self-centered but is getting a kick out of telling the stories of some of his favorite interviews. ... Elizabeth Gilbert, "City of Girls" ... Ruth Reichl's "gourmet memoir," "Save Me the Plums" ... Rita Mae Brown, "Whiskers in the Dark" ... Graeme Simsion, "The Rosie Result."

THE MAN WHO REVAMPED OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM DON FRASER DROVE REFORMS THAT TRANSFERRED POWER FROM PARTY BOSSES TO PARTY MEMBERS

Texto completo: You probably missed it, because some of the major papers missed its significance, too: the death of former U.S. Rep. Don Fraser. In fact, you may never have heard of Fraser, who also served a record four terms as mayor of Minneapolis. But he shaped the American political system of the past half-century. His influence particularly will be seen in the 2020 presidential election, which he did not live to see to its conclusion but which he witnessed in its messy, muddled and mindless start.
Fraser, who died at 95, was celebrated for hearings exposing efforts by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and South Korean intelligence personnel to manipulate American affairs - a theme that has echoes in our troubled times. But that is not what catapulted Fraser into a transformative figure in American politics.
Unmentioned in his obituaries in The New York Times and his hometown Minneapolis Star and Tribune was Fraser's involvement in the commission bearing his name, along with that of the late Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota, which created the modern Democratic presidential nomination system and which was adopted, in time and in large measure, by the Republicans as well. Indeed, it is not too much to say that the McGovern-Fraser Commission gave us the nomination system now playing out in Iowa, New Hampshire and across the country.
Before McGovern and Fraser - an ally of former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and initially regarded as a reluctant warrior in the party reform movement - rewrote the rules of politics, presidential nominees were chosen in a fashion unrecognizable today. In the years before the commission's strictures, there were virtually no rules governing the selection of convention delegates, who are the key figures in selecting the eventual party nominee. State parties and state legislatures - perhaps the least suitable principals for this task in the history of democratic rule - set out the procedures as they liked. There was mischief all around. Cronyism triumphed. Discrimination reigned. Bosses ruled.
In fact, the only principle that prevailed was the one set out by William Magear Tweed, the Tammany boss in 19th-century New York politics - another situation where democracy meant never having to say you're sorry for trampling democratic norms. The Tweed doctrine: "I don't care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating."
The bosses did get to do the nominating - until McGovern and Fraser snatched away control of the process and left the bosses out in the cold and, in many celebrated cases, actually out of the convention hall itself.
Much of what McGovern-Fraser changed is in the small type of party procedure, arcane but vital elements such as forbidding "proxy voting" and eliminating "unit rule." In all, the commission set out 18 guidelines; no state had been in violation of fewer than six. "By any reasonable standards," the political scientists Michael Hagen and William Meyer wrote, "this was not mere 'tinkering' with the rules."
One phrase was easily understood: "prohibit ex-officio designation of delegates." Everyone knew what that meant. It meant a new dawn in American politics.
That new dawn wasn't completely rosy, though it had a distinctly pink tint.
"I opened up the doors of the Democratic Party," said McGovern, the eventual 1972 nominee who would lose 49 states to Richard Nixon, "and 20 million people walked out."
The commission grew out of the chaos, conduct and composition of the raucous 1968 Democratic convention, marked by violent riots outside the Chicago convention hall and bitter contention within. Delegates under 30 four years later, in 1972, accounted for a quarter of the convention; in 1968, those under 30 accounted for fewer than 3 percent. Only 13 percent of the Chicago convention were females. In 1972, two in five were.
"Don Fraser was a supporter of the most important changes having to do with women and minorities in the convention," said Ken Bode, research director for the commission before becoming a top NBC political correspondent. "He turned out to be a big reformer."
One of the major influences on Fraser, and on the committee as a whole, was Arvonne Fraser, his wife, who died last year at 92. Mrs. Fraser was a Minneapolis precursor to Hillary Rodham Clinton in Little Rock - accomplished, respected, known for her ardent feminism, a force for innovation and inspiration. Her informal but formidable role in the commission was evocative of the remarks of Abigail Adams to her husband John, a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1776:
"In the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors."
The result was a new look at the 1972 convention that Hunter Thompson described as being "like a scene from the final hours of the Roman Empire." Perhaps. But the convention didn't include Mayor Richard Daley, the villain of the Chicago convention, ejected when the credentials committee ruled the Illinois slate did not reflect the diversity stipulated by the commission. The state's eventual delegates included the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Fraser would be remembered for Koreagate, as the 1976-1978 scandal would be called; for Minnesota's Fair Housing Act of 1961; for urging relaxed relations with Cuba; and for opposing Chile's military government.
But his greatest legacy grew out of quiet lunches at the Iron Gate, the idiosyncratic Mediterranean restaurant near 17th Street in northwest Washington where much of the new political world was shaped. There is no plaque there, but the impact is unmistakable.
In 1968, there were only 15 presidential primaries. In recent years, there have been about 40. Between 1952 and 1968, the earliest date for a presidential candidate announcement came in mid-October of the year before the election (Robert Taft, October 1951). For 2020, former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland already has been running for two years. By the time October comes around - the 2020 equivalent of the Taft announcement - some of the two dozen Democratic candidates already will have dropped out of a race that increasingly is a marathon, not a sprint.
One of the Fraser tributes described him as a "true champion for good." That remark came from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She is a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
David M. Shribman is a former and now emeritus executive editor of the Post-Gazette and a nationally syndicated columnist. He is scholar-in-residence at Carnegie Mellon University(dshribman@post-gazette.com).

Dancing on iTunes' grave

Texto completo: These days, I don't get much satisfaction from reading the headlines.
But “Apple Is Finally Killing iTunes"? Oh yes. That one can stay. 
In fact, when I heard the news (oh boy!) that future Apple operating systems would arrive sans iTunes, I stood from my seat, put in my earbuds, fancied myself in silhouette, and danced. Oh how I danced. If it's not clear, I hated iTunes.
And I wasn't alone, apparently. The app that introduced millions of users to digital music (and billions of compact discs into the landfill) was reaching its 18th birthday firmly in the shadow of its younger, streamier sister, Apple Music (the subscription service launched in 2015), as the music economy at large continues its precarious shift away from ownership and toward the far more nebulous notion of access — that is, as streaming continues to eclipse downloads (which now garner less revenue than sales of physical formats).
But its legacy of soured users goes back years, as the app struggled to accommodate a more media-rich Internet under one poorly-engineered roof (“Won't Someone Take iTunes Out Back And Shoot It?" asked a Slate headline back in 2012). 
To be clear, the death of iTunes is really more of a symbolic death — literally symbolic, in that the only thing really going away is the icon.
The functionality (if you could ever really call it that) of iTunes will instead be divided into four separate apps: Apple Music, Apple TV, Podcasts, and Apple Books. Existing music collections will be made available in the new Apple Music app (according to a panic-soothing statement from Apple), and  “iTunes" will live on in name as a music store integrated into Apple Music, but not as a standalone app. 
That's fine. Whatever, it's dead, I'll take it. 
Despite wistful and weirdly nostalgic appreciations/obituaries for this “revolutionary," “groundbreaking" nightmare of an app appearing in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, the far more important anecdotal consensus I've gathered over hours of celebrating its demise with others and nearly two decades of my own reluctant experience is that iTunes single-handedly turned the simple joys of blithely browsing through and adding to one's music collection into something more like an unceasing and steadily worsening sequence of tiny tortures. 
In his reminiscence for the Times, Kevin Roose writes that iTunes was emblematic of the “Middle Internet," or “the period between the Wild West days of Napster and the hyper-centralized era of Facebook and YouTube." And it remained so until the end. Like many did when it first arrived on Mac desktops in 2001, Roose credits the sleek (for 2011) design of iTunes and its field-leveling 99-cent song model as contributing to a cleaner Internet via its “magical, one-click emporium."
And indeed, iTunes did have a tidying effect, not just on the Internet's untended pastures of pirated music (with their overgrown filenames and nefarious worms), but in our newly digitized relationship to music. Jobs famous described the experience of using iTunes on a Windows machine as akin to “giving somebody a glass of ice water in hell."
But while iTunes may have been a massive development in our enjoyment of computers, I can't say it did much to enhance our enjoyment of music — stupid stoner screen savers be damned. If anything, iTunes came between me and my music more aggressively than my first ex.
To me, iTunes is what dismembered the once-sacred body of the album (it even had me sipping some anti-album Kool-Aid for a while, just to see how it tasted), and reduced the aesthetic heft of album art to fuzzy thumbnails or nothing at all.
It subjected music collectors to hours of data entry to fill in metadata, or correct it. It lost songs completely, or imported them poorly. It was buggy, bloated, and slow, and a reliably increasing drag on your machine's resources.
Oh, and back in 2014, it forced me to own (and manually delete) a latter-day U2 album. Unforgivable. #neverforget.
And with each new iteration (i.e. attempt to rescue itself) and with every added feature, menu, portal, and product, iTunes grew less and less appealing, endearing, useful, and user-friendly. What ground it had broken had softened into a deep muddy bog, with all of my favorite songs somewhere at the bottom. 
Like a loathed relation we all must pitch in to bury, iTunes will always seem sweeter in hindsight than it ever was in person. Yes, it helped make the Internet a more musical place, and sure, it was, in its own clunky little way, the beating heart at the core of the smartphone revolution.
But iTunes also kickstarted what feels like a grand devaluation of music — turning tracks into 99-cent snacks, and ultimately paving the way for today's streaming services to turn our music from honored art form to something more like a basic utility — something we pay for that flows through our houses, but that we never quite possess. The birth of iTunes signaled the start of a revolution, but its death just feels like the end of an error.

Texto completo: What's on TV
BIG LITTLE LIES 9 p.m. on HBO. In its first season, this melodramatic murder-mystery defined itself as a whodunit decidedly more interested in its characters than its puzzle. Forget the mystery of the killer; the season took until its final episode to even reveal who had been killed. Instead, the show, created by David E. Kelley ("Ally McBeal") and based on a novel by Liane Moriarty, trained its eyes on its beautiful Monterey, Calif., location and the lives of its central characters: a tech executive (Laura Dern), a retired lawyer (Nicole Kidman) and a recently remarried, very outspoken mother (Reese Witherspoon). While initially marketed as a mini-series, the show is back for a second season -- this time moving past the plot of the novel and adding Meryl Streep, who plays the mother-in-law of Kidman's character, and Andrea Arnold ("American Honey"), who directs.
BLINDSPOTTING (2018) 2:55 p.m. on ActionMax. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that "The Last Black Man in San Francisco," out this weekend, "belongs to a handful of recent Bay Area movies about the African-American experience that includes 'Blindspotting' and 'Sorry to Bother You."' In each, she wrote, "black characters confront (among other things) gentrification." In "Blindspotting," that issue is even baked into the opening credits, which show, in split-screen, Oakland from two different perspectives: that of longtime residents and that of wealthy transplants. The main character, Collin (Daveed Diggs), is a longtimer -- and when the movie starts, he's nearing the end of his probation and working at a moving company. The plot involves Collin's witnessing an officer-involved shooting and struggling to maintain a friendship that threatens to derail him.
CLAWS 9 p.m. on TNT. "We are more than just nail artists," the comic actress Niecy Nash's character says in a trailer for Season 3 of "Claws." It's a bit of an understatement. The strip-mall manicurists at the center of the series have been involved in organized crime for two seasons now, making for what Mike Hale described in his review for The Times as "a mash-up of 'Steel Magnolias' and 'Breaking Bad."' The second season ended with a shooting; this season sees the ladies getting involved in the casino business.
What's Streaming
TALES OF THE CITY Stream on Netflix. Across the bay from "Blindspotting" are the characters of this 10-episode series, the latest adaptation of (and a contemporary sequel to) the Armistead Maupin novels. Laura Linney plays Mary Ann, who leaves a comfortable East Coast life to hang out with a new generation in San Francisco. While the famed '90s mini-series adaptation was trailblazing in its depictions of gay and transgender characters, the Netflix series, Mike Hale said in his review for The Times, feels less fresh. "For a celebration of diverse identities and lifestyles, with a healthy amount of nudity and some graphic depictions of sex, it's resolutely square," he wrote.

Religion and women’s suffrage mirror America, then and now

Texto completo: This past Tuesday, Americans marked 100 years since Congress passed the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote. As Susan Schulten documented in a New York Times article, it was a long and winding road from Seneca Falls in 1848 to Washington in 1919.
In talking to scholars about the genesis of the women’s suffrage movement, it became clear how deeply it was intertwined with religious practice in 19th-century America.
Faith infused the debate over whether women should have the right to vote. Religious fervor impelled many to campaign on behalf of women’s suffrage — and many to fight as hard against it. The fight for and against voting rights, a debate that raged for almost 80 years, engaged people of faith, many of whom appeared to see in the struggle an echo of their own stories, whether they were immigrants, abolitionists or religious minorities like Jews.
Rabbis feuded. Clergy clashed. Women took to the streets to protest, but, perhaps more critically, they organized, strategized and enlisted help from members of Congress, a president or two (notably Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson), and “suffragents” — famed male proponents like William Lloyd Garrison and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Seneca Falls Convention
The suffrage movement brought together women from widely disparate backgrounds. Some were natural activists, like the Quaker Lucretia Mott, an early activist both against slavery and for the rights of women. Forbidden to participate in the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London because of her gender, Mott forged an alliance with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one that helped lead to the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, a milestone in women’s rights history in America.
Other women came to the suffrage movement because of their interest in defending women as guardians of the home fires. “In the 19th-century, we see the rise of the cult of domesticity and the emphasis of religion’s role in the home,” according to Calvin College historian Kristin Du Mez. “The home displaces the church as the center for faith, and women are upheld as wives and mothers.”
While this might not seem to be a recipe for a revolution, women became involved in temperance organizations like the Women’s Christian Temperance Union in part to protect themselves and their children from the effects of alcohol, Du Mez said. Women of faith also could join social reform movements as a way of doing good and, for those engaged in the 19th-century holiness movement, a way of demonstrating their quest for sanctification.
Gradually, the campaign for the right to vote became respectable, said Du Mez.
A moral divide
Women saw voting as a moral issue —as did their anti-suffragist opposition, said journalist Elaine Weiss, author of “The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote.” Their message? If women get the vote, the moral health of the country will be in danger, as social and political equality (remember Eve?) goes against the will of God.
Stanton ultimately became so frustrated with the orthodox religion of her time that she created her own sacred text, “The Woman’s Bible.”
Referring to the Christian Bible, Stanton wrote: “I know no other books that so fully teach the subjection and degradation of woman. ... When our bishops, archbishops and ordained clergymen stand up in their pulpits and read selections from the Pentateuch with reverential voice, they make the women of their congregation believe that there really is some divine authority for their subjection.”
Convinced that progress on women’s rights required a revised Christianity, Stanton assembled an international committee “to reinterpret the Bible’s message.”
Racism and suffrage
The history of women’s suffrage and the church is also, almost inevitably, the history of racial politics in America. Because black community engagement always emerged out of their faith community, that of black women’s involvement in the suffrage movement “naturally meant something about the church,” said Kelly Brown Douglas, dean of the Episcopal Divinity School at Union Theological Seminary.
Though white women leaders like Susan B. Anthony and black suffragists, including men and women like Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass, were active in the movement to guarantee voting rights to black men and women of all races, they split after the Civil War, when politicians told the abolitionists that they couldn’t get universal suffrage through Congress.
Though some suffragists continued to work across racial and gender lines, racist remarks by some of the icons of the votes-for-women crusade as well as a determination by black and white abolitionists that the need to gain votes for black men was easier to accomplish first led to acrimony and division within the women’s suffrage movement.
While black women understood the “intersection between race and gender, they weren’t considered to be equal in the women’s movement,” Douglas said. “They stood in this peculiar position of being disenfranchised because of racism on the one hand and patriarchy on the other.”
Du Mez noted that by the turn of the century, in an age when work was an increasingly available option for women, religious arguments for women’s suffrage didn’t seem to have the same weight that they had once possessed.
But that doesn’t mean that the argument about women’s proper place and her degree of autonomy ceased to be hotly debated in religious circles.
Unresolved issues
My chief takeaway from discussions with these scholars of religion and gender? Many of the arguments over gender and race that preoccupied both suffragists and abolitionists during the 19th and early 20th-century still remain strikingly unresolved.
It’s only on the pages of history books that we get to close a chapter and move on to the next outrage and perhaps inspired by heroes — or in this case, heroines — and villains. In real life, history lurches rather than leaps — and progress is both apparent and elusive.
The men and women who fought so that women could have the vote were as much creatures of their complex time as we are of ours.
“Nothing bigger can come to a human being than to love a great cause more than life itself,” said Anna Howard Shaw, doctor, minister and suffragist. She lived to see the 19th Amendment passed by Congress, but not yet ratified by the states. The work of justice and reconciliation isn’t confined to one generation. The torch is passed, and the work goes on.

Texto completo: A private school in Lafayette accused of fraud and abuse is under federal investigation, and a state police investigation is set to wrap up soon, officials say.
The New York Times reported on an F.B.I. investigation into T.M. Landry College Preparatory School in the premier episode of the Times' new television docuseries "The Weekly," which aired Sunday on FX and Hulu.
The episode focused on a November 2018 article in the Times about the school that originally caught national attention with viral videos of minority students from small-town-Louisiana opening acceptance letters to Ivy League colleges.
In the article, former students and parents alleged college applications had been doctored and that co-founder Michael Landry had abused students.
The federal investigation is believed to be focused on the fraud and cheating allegations in the wake of the F.B.I. large-scale investigation into a national college cheating scandal. Times reporters interviewed multiple people contacted by the F.B.I.
Craig Betbeze, public information officer with the FBI New Orleans Field Office, wrote in an email Thursday, "We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation."
Louisiana State Police are looking into the abuse allegations as complaints were turned over to the department by the Breaux Bridge Police Department, Breaux Bridge Police Chief Rolli Cantu said in December.
LSP Trooper Thomas Gossan said Thursday that state police's investigation into abuse allegations at the school "should be wrapping up in the next couple weeks" and then turned over to the 16th Judicial District District Attorney's Office, which includes St. Martin Parish.
Landry was cited for simple battery in 2012 after St. Martin Parish Sheriff's deputies investigated complaints of students being whipped at T.M. Landry College Prep, according to records from the Sheriff's Office.
Landry and wife Tracey are teaching at the school and focused on education rather than allegations, T.M. Landry board chairman Greg Davis said in an interview Thursday.
In April the school released a 23-page report concluding an investigation by an New Orleans law firm and Paul Pastorek, former state education superintendent now education lawyer.
The report was not conclusive, though, as investigators didn't talk to any of the people who had made negative claims against the school, like those quoted in the explosive Times article.
Davis said the school's enrollment has dropped to 63 students from 110 before the article was published.
He said the ones who remain have exhibited "true grit, which is what you need, by the way, to graduate and go to college and be successful, especially the colleges they are going to."
Tuition to attend the private school, which is not funded through or accredited by the Louisiana Department of Education, ranges from $575 to $725 a month, depending on grade level.
The school is operating in a former skating rink on Moss Street in north Lafayette. In March the State Fire Marshal gave the go-ahead for the school to begin remodeling the interior to bring it up to state fire code, lifting a cease and desist order on construction.
Davis said he hopes the remodeling will be complete by August when a new school year begins. The school operates year-round, so students are in class and occupying a part of the building while improvements take place.
"The Weekly" is a docuseries produced by The New York Times for FX and streaming service Hulu. Each episode follows a different breaking news story and the Times journalists who covered it, with the first being about T.M. Landry. It aired Sunday.
Greg Davis, chairman of the T.M. Landry College Prep board, speaks at a Dec. 14, 2018 press conference.

Texto completo: Ex-prosecutor-turned-author Linda Fairstein's publisher just wrote her off.
The best-selling Fairstein's relationship with Dutton publishing ended abruptly Friday as the brutal backlash over her handling of the Central Park Five case 30 years ago continued to swell.
"Linda Fairstein and Dutton have decided to terminate their relationship," read a statement provided by the author to the Daily News. "Fairstein is the author of 24 books, including 16 New York Times bestselling crime novels, as well as a nonfiction work that was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year."
Dutton Publicity Director Amanda Walker confirmed the split and declined to comment. Star author Fairstein's latest book "Blood Oath" came out just three months ago.
The stunning announcement was the latest blow to Fairstein (photo) in a week where the former chief of the Manhattan district attorney's sex-crime unit was forced to step down from her positions at Vassar College, the charity God's Love We Deliver and the nonprofit Safe Horizon - a haven for victims of abuse.
Fairstein, 72, turned her experience as a sex-crimes prosecutor into a series of New York Times best-selling books with the lead character Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cooper. The books were translated into more than a dozen languages and became international best-sellers as well.
She also wrote the "Devlin Quick Mysteries" for middle-school readers.
But the Netflix debut last week of director Ava DuVernay's take on the headline-making 1989 case ignited a firestorm of indignation over Fairstein's handling of the prosecution. As played by actress Felicity Huffman, the former prosecutor is portrayed as deciding on the guilt of the five suspects early on in the investigation.
Fairstein's office won convictions against the quintet, but the charges were later vacated when the man who raped the jogger came forward and was linked to the crime by his DNA. The five original suspects collected a $41 million settlement from the city in 2014.
Last year, the Mystery Writers of America took the extraordinary step of withdrawing a lifetime achievement award from Feinstein after other authors protested her role in the Central Park case.

Texto completo: Out on the diamond of green, especially in that excruciating moment of stillness and anticipation before the ball shoots from the pitcher's hand, the man behind the plate can be the most elusive figure on the field.
He squats while others stand, his face hidden by a mask. From that vantage point, at the pointy tip of the field's perfect geometry, he sees all, but is barely seen.
This was the ideal place for a man like Moe Berg, an eccentric and enigmatic figure from baseball's yesteryear. Berg's exploits on the field in the 1920s and 1930s for the Washington Senators and other teams would come to be overshadowed by his cunning as a wartime spy in the infancy of the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of today's Central Intelligence Agency. Berg's life and even the inscrutable circumstances surrounding his death 49 years ago linger as ongoing mysteries, a melange of fact, myth and opaque clues.
To encounter Moe Berg's story is to become entranced with it. He spoke as many as 12 languages, became a radio quiz-show sensation, extracted a key Italian aerodynamics expert from behind enemy lines during World War II, and was sent to suss out the Nazi bomb-development program and, if necessary, assassinate the German nuclear genius Werner Heisenberg.
For decades, authors, filmmakers, scriptwriters and spy buffs have obsessed over him. In the past two years, Berg's remarkable saga has flickered onto movie house screens - first in last year's feature film, "The Catcher Was a Spy," based on Nicholas Dawidoff's critically acclaimed book "The Catcher Was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg," and now in a deeply researched documentary, "The Spy Behind Home Plate," by the Washington-based filmmaker Aviva Kempner.
"Everyone's trying to nail it," Kempner, now 72, says.
Kempner, who is best known for her documentary about Hall-of-Famer Hank Greenberg and for her activism on behalf of D.C. statehood, is a relentless digger. She gathered too many nuggets to fit into a single film, and she shared one curiosity with The Washington Post that didn't make it into her documentary.
The baseball record books list Berg, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, as being born on March 2, 1902. But Berg's birth certificate lists another date: May 3, 1902. It gets stranger from there. Moe was only a nickname - his proper name was typically listed as Morris. But the birth certificate shows his actual first name as "Moses."
"Another mystery!" Kempner says.
Elusive from the start Berg, who was said to have a photographic memory, was practiced in deception from the beginning. When he was a kid, he assumed a fake name so that he could play baseball on a Christian league team - there were no Jewish teams at the time.
For all her sleuthing, Kempner was never able to figure out where Berg lived from 1932 to 1934 while he was playing for the Senators, the Washington major league team for nearly six decades. But she suspects he spent much of his time at the Mayflower Hotel, one of his favorite haunts.
Even assigning a start date to Berg's tenure as a spy has become an elusive task. Some think he began his life in the shadows as early as 1934, when he traveled to Japan with an all-star baseball team that featured the greatest players of his day, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. In Tokyo, Berg donned a men's kimono - a sartorial flourish included in the documentary - and walked to a hospital under the pretense of visiting the daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Japan, who had just given birth. Instead, he dumped the flowers he'd brought with him and made his way to the roof of the hospital, then the tallest building in the city. He pulled a Bell & Howell camera from beneath his kimono and - in defiance of Japanese orders that no photos or films should be made during the visit - made a panoramic film of the cityscape that later made its way to the U.S. military, possibly for use in bombing raids, according to the documentary.
Berg was recruited to join the nascent OSS by the larger-than-life figure William "Wild Bill" Donovan, the founder of the spy agency. Berg was eventually handed the seemingly impossible task of finding Antonio Ferri, an Italian aerodynamics expert who had gone into hiding and had been privy to the secret workings of German scientists connected to the Nazi nuclear program. Berg found him and - because the former ballplayer spoke passable Italian - helped translate a cache of hidden documents.
But his scariest wartime adventure required Berg's special talent for fading into the background, like the masked catcher he'd once been. He traveled to neutral Switzerland, posing as a student, to hear a lecture by Heisenberg, the German nuclear scientist. His mission was to assess Heisenberg's progress, and to kill him if it appeared he was getting close to developing the bomb.
Ever resourceful, Berg managed to take a walk with Heisenberg after a dinner party, a stroll in which he concluded the scientist still had a long way to go in developing the bomb - and therefore he passed up an ideal opportunity to kill him. In the feature film, there's a shootout during the walk. Kempner doesn't believe it occurred.
The feature film strongly suggests that Berg was bisexual. Dawidoff's book says there's no evidence to support that but briefly cites some rumors and speculation. Kempner also found no evidence, and points to his longtime relationship with a woman who was a piano instructor, and to interviews with former teammates who described Berg as "a ladies' man" and a "womanizer," albeit a classy one.
"I think that's the Hollywood version," Kempner says. "I'm trying to be very diplomatic. Facts can be more exciting."
In a New York Times interview last year, Robert Rodat - who adapted Dawidoff's book for "The Catcher Was a Spy" film - said: "The standards of veracity I applied in the movie were different."
Neil Goldstein, a filmmaker who directed interviews with more than a dozen of Berg's former OSS colleagues and baseball teammates years ago for a film that was never produced, said not one of them "even hinted" that he was bisexual.
"Why does this gossip remain a topic?" said Goldstein, whose interview footage is included in the documentary.
After the war, Berg spent time living in New Jersey with his brother, Sam, a physician, and later with his sister, Ethel. He never married, and he was a frequent presence in libraries, where he indulged his varied interests, and at major league ballparks, where he had been given a lifetime pass. He was awarded a presidential Medal of Freedom in 1945 but refused to accept it. He never explained why, adding another layer to his mystique.
Berg died in 1972 at the age of 70 after a fall at his home. His sister gave his remains to a rabbi and asked that they be scattered on Mount Scopus in Israel.
Kempner has unearthed letters from Sam Berg, first wondering whether the remains were ever actually scattered, then later puzzling over stories he'd been told by a rabbi about his brother's remains possibly ending up in someone's backyard in Jerusalem. He wanted his brother's remains returned to the United States, since Moe Berg was never particularly religious. But that request was complicated by the fact that no one could tell him the exact location of the ashes.
It appears, according to Kempner, that Sam Berg never found his brother.

Texto completo: Dance has been a part of Derek Hough's life since he was a child, but he is also an accomplished musician, actor and singer. In his new stage show, "Derek Hough Live! The Tour," he showcases his many talents and opens up with audiences.
Hough is best known as a cast member on "Dancing With the Stars," a TV competition he has won six times. He won two Emmy Awards for his choreography on the show. He recently served as a judge alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo on the TV show "World of Dance."
He has played Corny Collins in "Hairspray Live!," been the male lead in a London production of "Footloose" and had a recurring role on the TV show "Nashville." His book "Taking the Lead: Lessons from a Life in Motion" was a New York Times bestseller.
This tour is a different experience for Hough, who is used to working with his sister. In 2014, 2015 and 2017, he toured with Julianne Hough, also an accomplished dancer, actress and singer.
His new show isn't just him on stage alone, though. He has dancers and a band. The show crosses genres, presenting Motown, Latin, rock-and-roll, big band, hip hop and other styles of music and dance. Hough plays the guitar and drums, along with singing and dancing.
He talked about his solo tour during a recent telephone interview.
Question: How have audiences been responding to your tour?
Answer: The audiences' response, the reactions, the reviews have been overwhelming. I've worked so hard on this show, putting together something that appeals to such a wide demographic, everybody from kids to 90-year-olds and everybody in between.
I really get personal, and I get quite vulnerable in the show towards the end, having a chat. The response so far from everybody has been just beautiful. I'll sign autographs and sign posters after the show, and I ask a lot of people what's their favorite part.
What's so wonderful to hear is everybody has a different favorite part that they love the most. Some will be in tears from the emotional parts of the show, and some are having a blast, having fun, standing up and dancing.
Q: Do you feel it's changed how people look at you?
A: There's a lot of singing in the show. I do "Singin' in the Rain," Michael Buble songs and some Top 40 stuff. It's wonderful to share that aspect of what I do as well.
For me to have done so many different tours and for people to come up to me and say that they really, really loved this one, it just makes me so happy. I'm always trying to get better and better.
Q: What went into choosing the dancers for your show?
A: I picked dancers that can do things that I can't. There's certain things that I'm an expert at, and there are certain areas that aren't necessarily my strongest areas. Every night, I'm blown away by what they are producing on that stage, just their technique, their grace and their athleticism.
Q: When you were getting ready for the show, did it feel different working with them compared to your sister?
A: The biggest difference was trying to figure out how I was going to be onstage for the entire time, or where I was going to not be onstage. It was very important for me to have dancers who were so good that it didn't matter if I was onstage or not.
Also, the one big change for this show is I have a live band. That was a big part of the process. It took a lot more thought, a lot more time. I did all the arrangements and was in the recording studio, putting together music. The band was rehearsing, and we were dancing in the room. What it has done is it has made the show feel more like a concert.
Q: How long did it take to put together the show?
A: It took a long time. The thing that took the longest was the music, getting the music and the set list together. I wanted such a big variety of music that covers the whole spectrum of genres and music that inspires us to move and dance. Also, I wanted to pick music that was meant to be played live. I wanted this music to really pop and really feel exciting when you hear it.
Q: How did you decide what music to use?
A: I picked music that I get excited about but also music that I know that my audience will love as well, infusing them, combining them, updating some of them, changing some of these songs and making them feel more contemporary. For me, what's awesome is after the show having a 6-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music and, in the same moment, having a 70-year-old come up to me and say how much she loved the music.
Q: Did you have to brush up on any dance styles for the show?
A: I tap a lot in the show. For me, I love tap dancing so much. I had to definitely work hard on brushing up on my tap. I do a really challenging routine in the show. It's very demanding, very physical. Fortunately, I keep sharp in my styles and what I do, and I work hard, train and practice a lot. When it came to rehearsal, I was ready to go.
Q: It sounds like you've really challenged and pushed yourself with this show.
A: This definitely is a challenging show for everybody, including our dancers. The dancers are working extremely hard. It's a full-out show. When people come and see the show, I think they're surprised by the amount of energy that is exerted on that stage.
Q: What do you hear consistently that audiences always love and get excited about?
A: There's a moment where I get really personal. I really open up about struggles that I've gone through and how we all share this vulnerability. We all share these thoughts, these doubts in our mind. I've really heard from a lot of people that it touched them. It really moved them tremendously. That's my goal. I really just want to inspire, motivate or connect with the audience.
Q: Have your dancers and band helped to shape the show?
A: A lot of the big moments, it could only happen because of the talent of the musicians or the dancers. Being a choreographer isn't just about creating moves that you want to see. It's about bringing the best out in who you have. A lot of times, I will say, "Do something amazing here," and they will do something that is in their wheelhouse and only they can bring that to the table. There are so many of those moments that each dancer brings that couldn't have happened without them.

Texto completo: HARRISBURG - Between boasts about his boss's accomplishments and the state of the U.S. economy, Vice President Mike Pence took time Thursday evening to recall the night Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016.
As they awaited election results at their campaign headquarters, Mr. Trump would playfully slug his running mate every time a state was called in his favor. When Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes fell into his column, the playful tap "left a mark," Mr. Pence said with a chuckle.
It might leave a bruise if history repeats itself next year.
"We need Pennsylvania to lead the way to give America four more years of President Donald Trump," Mr. Pence told a few hundred Pennsylvania Republicans at a fundraising dinner in the ballroom of the Radisson Hotel Harrisburg.
The vice president told them much of what they already believe: that Mr. Trump is a man of action who has gotten two years of results for America.
But his half-hour remarks also foreshadowed a big question Republicans face in 2020 in holding on to states such as Pennsylvania: Although Mr. Pence says the president is negotiating trade deals that put workers first, are those impacts being offset by the administration's tariff wars?
Hours before Mr. Pence's speech, U.S. and Mexican officials met for a second day to negotiate a deal to avert Mr. Trump's proposed tariffs on Mexican goods. The president is planning to impose a 5% tax on Mexican goods Monday in an effort to strong-arm Mexico into addressing the flow of Central American migrants heading to the U.S.
Mr. Pence said the sides have "made some progress" in the talks but, as the president said previously, "not nearly enough." He reiterated the assertion that Mexico must "step up" to stem the tide of illegal immigration.
"I just want to make you a promise," Mr. Pence said. "This president and this administration are going to continue to stand strong until Mexico takes the action necessary to secure our border."
If imposed, tariffs on Mexico will affect Pennsylvania. The state imported $6.4 billion of products from Mexico in 2018, the 12th-highest total of any state in the country, according to a New York Times analysis this week.
That didn't stop Mr. Pence from touting the other economic gains he said Mr. Trump has made in his first two years in office, including signing more bills that cut federal red tape "than any president in American history," as well as the tax cuts.
In addition to low unemployment rates, Mr. Pence cited statistics about manufacturing jobs - that more than 500,000 have been created since Mr. Trump took office, including 6,000 in Pennsylvania.
"Remember when President Obama was asked in 2016 about manufacturing in America?" Mr. Pence said. "He said, 'What magic wand do you have?' We didn't need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House."
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party pounced on Mr. Trump's record on manufacturing before the event, saying he broke his campaign promise to bring those jobs back to Pennsylvania.
"It's clear Trump's campaign promises to create jobs here and support our manufacturing industry were just more of the same empty words we've heard from him time and again," spokesman Brandon Cwalina said. "Instead of looking out for us, Trump and Pence just care about helping their rich and powerful friends, and that's why Pennsylvania voters will hold this administration accountable in 2020."

Texto completo: LONDON -- By the time she was 17, the Dutch teenager had written a harrowing memoir recounting repeated sexual assaults and her subsequent experience with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anorexia.
Last year, when she was 16, she approached an end-of-life clinic in the Netherlands seeking euthanasia or assisted suicide, but was rejected because her parents had been unaware of her request and she needed their permission, according to a local newspaper profile published in December.
When her sister announced that the teenager, Noa Pothoven, had died at 17 early Sunday morning -- without revealing where or how -- the story ricocheted and metastasized around the globe. It spurred an outpouring of condolences on social media and set off debates about the nature of the Dutch law on euthanasia and the spread of misinformation.
In the initial absence of detailed information from medical officials or from Ms. Pothoven's family, the internet was flooded with inaccurate reports that she had died via legal euthanasia, raising questions about how someone so young could be allowed to die voluntarily.
But the teenager did not die of euthanasia, according to her family, the Dutch health minister and the Royal Dutch Medical Association. She had stopped eating and drinking, her relatives said in a statement, and she was at home in the eastern Netherlands when she died, Dutch news outlets reported.
Steven Pleiter, the director of the end-of-life clinic in The Hague that Ms. Pothoven approached last year to help end her life, would not go into details about her case because of privacy reasons, but he said by phone on Wednesday, "It is a terrible story of a young woman who made the decision to end her life."
"It would be fake news if we made this euthanasia," he added.
The story of the Dutch teenage author from the city of Arnhem appeared to have caught the attention of the pope, who alluded to the case on Wednesday in a Twitter post. "Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all," his account tweeted.
But as Ms. Pothoven's case became a battleground for arguments about the right to die, many commentators criticized news outlets in Europe and the United States for wrongly reporting the means of her death. Naomi O'Leary, a journalist with Politico, initially debunked those stories in a post on Twitter.
Ms. Pothoven's case, as tragic as it is, turned out to be far more complex than initially reported. The health minister, Hugo de Jonge, confirmed in a statement on Wednesday, "There is no question of euthanasia in this case." He cited information from the family, with whom the authorities were in touch.
According to a private Instagram post written in Dutch by Isa Pothoven, her sister, who allowed The New York Times to see it, Ms. Pothoven died at 2:40 a.m. on Sunday local time.
"You deserve a lot better, but Noa, go to sleep," Isa Pothoven wrote. "We will have to let go of you."
Noa Pothoven's family told Dutch news outlets on Thursday that she had stopped taking food and had been under the supervision of a medical team. News reports said that Ms. Pothoven had died on a bed in her living room in Arnhem.
Isa Pothoven did not respond to follow-up questions, and other members of the family could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
Active euthanasia -- when a doctor injects a lethal combination of drugs into a patient -- and assisted suicide -- when a doctor provides the means for someone to take his or her life -- were legalized in the Netherlands in 2002.
It is legal for someone as young as 12 to request and receive euthanasia, as long as the parents give their permission, according to Dutch law. For those 16 to 18, parents must be aware of the request but their permission is not necessary, Mr. Pleiter said.
Ms. Pothoven unsuccessfully tried to end her life more than once, according to the newspaper profile in December. Ms. Pothoven said in an interview at that time that she longed for peace and the absence of pain.
Her mother, Lisette, also said in an interview with a Dutch newspaper in December, "Noa doesn't want this life anymore." She added, "She just longs for peace."
In her autobiography, Ms. Pothoven wrote that at the age of 11 she was sexually assaulted at a school party. The next year, she was assaulted again at a classmate's party. At 14, she was raped by two men.
She did not tell anyone for a long time, she wrote. She recounted in her book, "Winning or Learning," which was released in November, that the experience took a destructive toll.
"To this day, my body still feels dirty," the teenager wrote. "My house has been broken into, my body, that can never be undone."
In an Instagram post last week that was later deleted, Ms. Pothoven announced that she had stopped eating and drinking, a local newspaper reported on Monday.
"After years of fighting and fighting, it is finished," she was quoted as saying. "After many conversations and assessments, it was decided that I will be released because my suffering is unbearable."
Mr. Pleiter, the director of the end-of-life clinic in The Hague, said that gaining approval for euthanasia was a complex process. After the clinic receives a request, he said, it is reviewed, with doctors and nurses making home visits and conducting multiple interviews.
Every person seeking euthanasia must meet criteria set by Dutch law, which include ensuring that the request is voluntary, that the person is in unbearable suffering with a poor prognosis that shows no improvement, and that he or she is mentally able to understand the process and its consequences.
From the moment a request is made, it typically takes four to six weeks for the request to be processed in the case of physical illnesses. But when it comes to mental illnesses, things are more complicated. "It is complex to decide if they meet the criteria," Mr. Pleiter said.
The clinic received 2,600 euthanasia requests in 2018 -- 27 percent to 28 percent of them were from mentally ill patients, according to Mr. Pleiter. Of the 727 patients who were euthanized last year, about 50 were patients with mental health problems, he said.
In January 2018, a 29-year-old Dutch woman, Aurelia Brouwers, made headlines when she died with the help of doctors after a long history of mental illness, the BBC said.
After Ms. O'Leary, the Politico journalist, wrote a Twitter thread criticizing the misleading news coverage of Ms. Pothoven's case, Euronews, a network based in France and one of the first English-language websites to report the story inaccurately, issued a correction. Other prominent news outlets also removed the claim that she had died via euthanasia.

Medicare-for-all would be political suicide for Democrats

Texto completo: John Delaney, a Democrat, represented Maryland's 6th Congressional District from 2013 to 2019 and is a candidate for president.
Medicare-for-all is bad policy for the country and bad politics for the Democratic Party. The Democratic nomination for president shouldn't go to anyone who supports it, and Medicare-for-all shouldn't be in the party's 2020 platform. If we Democrats become the party of Medicare-for-all, advocating that every U.S. citizen is forced into a government-run health-insurance program, President Trump will be reelected and Republicans will control both houses of Congress - ensuring that today's health-care system will be endangered by renewed GOP attacks.
I was alarmed last weekend at the California Democratic Party Convention to see some of my fellow candidates for the nomination and many convention attendees embracing Medicare-for-all.
The current health-care system needs improving, not dismantling - by Republicans or by Democrats. That's why I have proposed a mixed-model universal plan that would guarantee health-care coverage through a government plan but would leave Medicare alone and leave private insurance available for those who wish to buy it, with limited tax credits if they opt out of the new plan entirely. The plan would also close the loophole that prevents the government from negotiating drug prices, an essential step for lowering costs.
Crucially, my plan would be fully paid for by steps such as ending the corporate tax deduction for employer-sponsored insurance, allowing the government to negotiate on prescription drug prices and instituting a cost-sharing requirement for higher-income individuals.
Medicare-for-all legislation proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), one of my opponents for the Democratic nomination for president, would basically make private insurance illegal; the federal government would pay all health- insurance costs. That sounds good - if you really, really like the government - but there is one fundamental flaw: Overwhelming evidence shows that, under Medicare, the government doesn't pay the true costs of health care. According to data from the Urban Institute, Medicare pays providers 89 percent of costs, with higher reimbursements from private insurance companies making up the difference.
Over time, the government's not paying the cost of health care would become a significant problem. In a free-market system - which would still exist even under Medicare-for-all - health-care providers are not going to pursue or maintain a business model that loses money. This year, the New York Times reported that Medicare-for-all would mean "some hospitals, especially struggling rural centers, would close virtually overnight, according to policy experts. Others, they say, would try to offset the steep cuts by laying off hundreds of thousands of workers and abandoning lower-paying services like mental health."
Moreover, lower reimbursement rates and a lack of competition (remember, there is only one payer: the federal government) would mean there is no market incentive to innovate, develop new treatments or expedite care. Over time, that would be bad for patients and for medical innovation. Medicare-for-all would clearly lead to a decrease in both health-care access and quality.
But the impact would go beyond hospitals. It's remarkable that this never seems to get talked about during these debates, but under Medicare-for-all, 150 million Americans would lose their current health insurance and be forced to switch to something new. These are people who have employer-based coverage, union coverage or private plans they pay for fully. Gallup polling data indicates that about 70 percent of those with private insurance are happy with their coverage. The coverage works for tens of millions of Americans, and it is one of the most valued things in their lives; Medicare-for-all would take it away.
Medicare-for-all might be popular as a slogan or as a tagline. But it is political suicide. If the Democratic Party emerges as the party that closed hospitals and made millions of people shift out of a health-care plan they like, the electoral cost will be severe. People on both sides of the debate recognize that Medicare-for-all is a significantly more disruptive policy change than the Affordable Care Act. But when the ACA, which was a good law and smart policy, affected people's existing coverage options and led to higher prices for some, Democrats paid a significant political price. Medicare- for-all would guarantee that this disruption affects 150 million Americans.
It has been baffling over the past few years to watch so many Democrats rush to embrace Medicare-for-all, and it has been disappointing and sad to see many of them now try to equivocate on their position. The Sanders bill is crystal clear in what it would do, and Sanders, to his credit, is upfront about what he believes. But a lot of other candidates are trying to play it both ways with complicated and strange answers. We need to just drop this thing.

STANFORD PLAYER DRAFTED DESPITE ASSAULT ALLEGATION

Texto completo: The Indianapolis Colts drafted former Stanford football captain Bobby Okereke in April despite knowing that he had been accused of sexual assault while he was at the university, and that three members of a campus disciplinary panel had concluded he was responsible for the alleged rape, according to The Associated Press.
The Colts discussed the allegation with Okereke before they drafted the inside linebacker in the third round of April's NFL draft, general manager Chris Ballard told reporters on a conference call Wednesday, AP reported.
Ballard stressed that Okereke was never criminally charged or convicted in the 2015 case, and was not disciplined by the university because two members of the Stanford hearing panel found he was not responsible for the alleged assault.
"From everything we gathered, we felt it was appropriate to take him," the AP reported Ballard said. "He was very honest about his side of the story and what occurred and how he had to move forward."
Ballard's comments came hours after The Fountain Hopper, an independent Stanford student publication, for the first time identified Okereke as the accused football player who was written about, but not named, in a 2016 New York Times story scrutinizing how Stanford handled sexual assault allegations.
Brad Hayward, a Stanford spokesman, said Wednesday the university could not confirm the identity of anyone involved in a Title IX investigation, or say whether Okereke was ever disciplined while at the university.
The Times reported that the woman met the unnamed player at a fraternity party and went back with him to her room, where she said he sexually assaulted her. He said that the two had consensual sex, according to documents cited by the Times in the report.
Neither the woman nor Okereke could be reached for comment Wednesday.
Three of five members of a Stanford disciplinary panel that handled Title IX allegations found the player had committed sexual assault, according to the Times. But Stanford's policies for adjudicating sexual assault allegations at the time required that at least four of the five panelists reach that conclusion in order to impose discipline.
The woman who accused the player appealed the panel's decision and was granted a second hearing, where the panel again split 3-2 in favor of finding the player responsible, the Times reported.
As a result, the university found the football player was not responsible for the assault, and he was never disciplined. The woman also sought a restraining order against Okereke in 2015, but a judge reportedly turned down the request.
Okereke started every game of the 2018 season and led the Cardinal with 96 tackles.
A spokesman for the Colts did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.
In the conference call reported by AP, Ballard said no one from the Colts had spoken with the woman who accused Okereke of sexual assault before he was drafted.
"It happened four years ago, and because there were no charges and no disciplinary action taken by the university, and because of his track record since, we felt comfortable drafting him," Ballard said.
The woman never reported the alleged assault to law enforcement, according to the Times, preferring to handle the accusation through Stanford's internal disciplinary process.
Stanford and other universities handle sexual assault allegations under the federal gender equality law Title IX. But the processes for investigating and disciplining students have faced criticism, both from victims rights advocates who say they don't do enough to protect survivors and from those who argue they violate the due process rights of accused students.
Stanford changed its standard for finding students responsible the equivalent of a guilty verdict in university discipline hearings in 2016. Cases are now heard by a three-person panel, which must unanimously find the student committed sexual assault for the student to be disciplined. Critics have said that the process favors the accuser.
Hayward, the university spokesman, said, "Stanford responds to all reports of Title IX violations that are brought to the university's attention, and we encourage anyone with information or concern about a Title IX matter to report it to our Title IX Office."

Texto completo: A 17-year-old American pulled off a shocker at Roland Garros on Thursday.
Amanda Anisimova stunned third-ranked Simona Halep in the quarterfinals at the French Open, cruising in straight sets to a 6-2, 6-4 victory. The win was Anisimova's first against a top-five player, and it secures her first trip to the semifinals at a major championship.
The 17-year-old will next face Australian Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals.
But just who is this young American, who beat the defending French Open champion before her 18th birthday?
Here's a quick look at Anisimova, and how she got to this point.
LIKE OLD TIMES: Federer vs. Nadal in France
BAD PERSONALITY?: Dominic Thiem complains, says that about Serena Williams
New Jersey born, Florida raised
Anisimova is the daughter of Russian immigrants Konstanin and Olga, who moved to the United States in 1998 in order to provide more tennis-related opportunities for the oldest daughter, Maria, according to The New York Times.
Maria went on to play tennis collegiately at the University of Pennsylvania — but Amanda quickly grew into a star.
Born in Freehold Township, New Jersey, in 2001, Amanda later moved to Florida, where many professional tennis players live and train. She now lives in Aventura, Florida.
Why tennis?
Anisimova told WTA's website that she was inspired to pick up the sport by her aforementioned older sister. But she also loves the individual nature of the sport.
"In tennis, you don’t have to depend on anyone," she told WTA's website. "I did gymnastics as a kid, and I liked that too, because I only had to depend on myself.
"It’s not like it’s all about me, but at the end of the day, if I won or lost, I knew what I had to improve, and couldn’t rely on a team. "
A rapid ascent
Anisimova actually made her French Open debut two years ago, earning a wild-card spot when she was just 15. She also won one title that year on the ITF Women's Circuit, which is a developmental level below the WTA.
Last year, in her first professional season, she climbed to No. 95 in the world with a handful of solid performances, including a runner-up finish at the Hana-Cupid Japan Women's Open in Hiroshima and a run to the fourth round at Indian Wells.
Anisimova then reached the Round of 16 at the Australian Open in January, where she lost to Petra Kvitova. She was ranked No. 51 in the world entering play at Roland Garros.
Russian roots
Anisimova speaks Russian with her parents, including her father, Konstanin, who served as her coach earlier in her career. But she told The New York Times in 2017 that she has never visited Russia and never considered representing her parents' home country on the court.
"I do plan on going, though," she told the newspaper in 2017. "I really want to visit and see what it’s like and see the culture more. "
Anisimova is one of two Russian-American players who have made waves at Roland Garros this week. Another young American of Russian descent, Sofia Kenin, upset Serena Williams on Saturday.
Backup plan?
Anisimova said in the 2017 article that she would like to become a surgeon if the whole tennis thing doesn't work out.
"Actually what I want to do is go to online college while I’m in my pro career and then go to med school after I finish," she told The New York Times in 2017.
In a similar vein, WTA's website reported two years ago that Anisimova "spends her free time reading books and watching Youtube videos about science and chemistry. "
"I’ve always been curious about it, and I think it’s pretty cool," she said at the time.

Texto completo: Regardless of the politics involved, I want to see people reading, writes Liz Soares
CNN host Don Lemon exhorts viewers, on what seems like a regular basis, to read the Mueller report.
As a school librarian, I am intrigued by his plea.
Regardless of the politics involved, I want to see people reading.
Yet the conventional wisdom in pundit-land is that Americans won’t take an interest in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and aspects of President Donald Trump’s behavior unless there are televised impeachment hearings, as there were in the Watergate affair.
I well remember watching those hearings back in the 1970s — I was glued to the set — but I also read plenty about the situation. I was taking a high school advanced placement class and had to compare coverage in the conservative National Review and the liberal New Republic. My family took an extended cross-country trip that year, so I had to do this homework in the back of a camper.
Of course, I’m an avid reader who grew up to to be a writer and a librarian. I don’t expect everyone to be as nerdy as me, even the 17-year-old me, who was self-conscious about appearing to be a geek.
Still, I would like to see people reading more, and I don’t mean Twitter and Facebook posts.
“Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election,” also known as the Mueller report, will do. It was on the bestseller lists for a while. But how many people actually have read it? Apparently, not even some key elected officials.
The Washington Post asked House and Senate members of the Judiciary and Intelligence committees if they’d read the report. More than three in 10 “declined to respond to five yes-or-no questions after repeated contact attempts, offered unclear answers or said they have not read the full report.”
Whoa, Nellie.
The NPR show “Hidden Brain” recently did a feature on the decline of local newspapers. Host Shankar Vedantam reported on research showing that, when newspapers close, the affected municipalities borrow money at higher interest rates. The “watchdog” is gone, so municipalities have more leeway to make bad decisions.
There are many reasons why newspapers go out of business, but let’s face it. A major reason is that, when they fail, it’s because fewer people are reading them. That eats away at advertising revenue, etc.
And that’s not the only real-world consequence of people avoiding the written word except in its simplest, easiest-to-digest form. (Yes, Twitter and Facebook).
Post columnist Max Boot recently wrote a piece with the headline “Are we becoming too stupid to govern ourselves?” He discusses anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists and Flat Earthers, who obviously are not getting their news from this newspaper, The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. “One study of the 2016 election found that the 20 top false articles combined on Facebook were shared, reacted to or commented on more widely than the 20 top mainstream news articles combined.”
I bet few of those people reading false articles got beyond the first paragraph. Those “readers” were simply passing along lurid headlines.
The French movie “Non-Fiction” is set in the Parisian publishing world. The characters endlessly discuss people’s reading habits. E-books were supposed to save publishing, but they’re falling out of favor. Now audiobooks rule. Not only are they convenient, the movie’s characters explain, but they often are narrated by celebrities.
I like that the French value intellectualism. No American would even attempt to make a film in which characters do little else but talk, eat fabulous food, talk, drink wine, talk, and get busy in the bedroom. Imagine — they spend two hours essentially talking about ideas.
Even so, one of the characters is a digital guru for a publishing house. At a conference, she and some other self-important techie-type declare the death of libraries. They will have to be “repurposed,” moviegoers are told, which brought to my mind Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century.
I could not help but snort loudly. As I wrote recently in this space, libraries are alive and well, thank you very much.
I would be the first to admit that it’s not all about the books nowadays, nor would I wish it to be. I just want more people to read.
Astronaut Christa McAuliffe, who perished in the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, said, “I touch the future, I teach.” My hope for future readers is kindled every time I see elementary students huddled together over picture books, pointing and laughing, or amazed at some weird feat in the “Guinness Book of World Records.”
But the country they will venture into doesn’t nourish that curiosity, that urge to learn.
Today is the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The Allies went on to defeat the Nazis, who burned books. It’s a perfect day to celebrate our right to read — how about by reading all about it?

GARLIC BUTTER BAKED SALMON
Ingredients:
* 1 pound fingerling, Yukon gold or baby potatoes, halved
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided
* 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper, divided
* 4 6-ounce skinless salmon fillets
* 2 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic, divided
* 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley
* 1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter
* 3 bunches asparagus, (about 18 spears, woody ends removed)
* 2 tablespoons dry white wine (can substitute with 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth)
* 1 lemon sliced to garnish
Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together potatoes with the oil, 1/2 tablespoon of garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Spread out in an even layer and roast for 15 minutes until they're just starting to soften and brown.
Push potatoes to one side of the sheet pan and arrange salmon down the center. Rub salmon evenly with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of parsley. Add the asparagus to the other side of the pan.
Combine 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of the melted butter together and pour the mixture over the salmon and asparagus. Season everything with the remaining salt and pepper.
Return to oven and continue baking until the potatoes are golden and fork-tender and the salmon is opaque throughout, about 10 minutes. Optional: broil in the last 2 minutes for charred edges.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining butter, garlic and lemon juice with the wine (or chicken stock). Serve with the salmon, veggies and lemon slices.

ROASTED CHICKEN AND CARROTS
Ingredients:
* 4 chicken thighs
* 1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled and trimmed
* 1 large onion, peeled and cut into eighths
* 1 head of garlic
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
Arrange the carrots and onion in a single layer on a greased baking sheet. Slice the top off a head of garlic; discard the top and place on the tray. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the vegetables; season with the rosemary, and salt and pepper.
Top with the chicken thighs. Rub each thigh with 1 teaspoon olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
Roast in the oven until the chicken skin is golden and the carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

GNOCCHI WITH MOZZARELLA AND CHERRY TOMATOES
Ingredients:
* 1 16-ounce package gnocchi
* 2 pints of cherry tomatoes, any color
* 1 12-ounce tub marinated mozzarella balls (save the oil)
* 2-4 cloves garlic, to taste
* Fresh basil, to garnish
* Fresh Parmesan, to garnish
* Balsamic vinegar, to garnish
Directions:
Heat oven to 450 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Put gnocchi and cherry tomatoes on the pan. Smash the garlic and add it whole to the pan.
Remove the mozzarella cheese to a bowl. Pour most of the herbed oil from the tub onto the pan with the gnocchi, tomatoes and garlic. Use enough of the oil to make sure everything is coated. Use your hands to rub oil all over the gnocchi and tomatoes, then spread out the gnocchi, tomatoes and head of garlic into a single layer on the pan. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
Roast for 17-20 minutes, until some of the tomatoes have popped and the gnocchi looks golden.
Let the gnocchi cool on the pan for a few minutes before adding the mozzarella so the cheese doesn’t melt into blobs. You can either add the mozzarella to the pan and serve it from there, or remove all of it to a serving platter and toss together.
Garnish with fresh basil and Parmesan cheese. Drizzle a bit of balsamic vinegar over each serving.

VEGAN SHEET PAN SHAWARMA
Ingredients:
* 3 lemons, divided
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 6 cloves garlic, smashed and minced
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
* 2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon coriander
* 2 teaspoons sweet paprika
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon aleppo pepper flakes
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 large head of cauliflower broken into small florets
* 1 can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 2 small red onions, quartered
* 1 8-ounce package gluten-free tempeh cut into cubes (can substitute same quantity of firm tofu)
Directions:
Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl combine the juice of two lemons, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, aleppo pepper flakes and cinnamon. Whisk to combine. Divide the marinade into two bowls.
Add the tempeh (or tofu) to the first bowl, turning to coat each piece in the marinade. Set aside for 10 minutes to marinate.
Add the cauliflower florets and chickpeas to the second bowl, turning the ingredients together with a large spoon or tongs until all of the vegetables are coated.
Arrange the tempeh on the sheet pan first, spooning any remaining marinade from the bowl on top of the pieces. Next, add the seasoned cauliflower and chickpeas to the pan around the tempeh. Layer in the onion quarters. Cut remaining lemon and place cut side down on the pan, one near the top and one near the bottom.
Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the tempeh or tofu is warmed through and the vegetables are tender.
To serve, squeeze the roasted lemon halves over the tempeh and vegetables, then garnish with desired toppings. Serve immediately.

SPICY SHEET-PAN SAUSAGE AND SQUASH
Ingredients:
* 1 2-pound butternut squash, peeled, halved lengthwise and seeded
* 1 pound spicy sausage (fresh chorizo, Italian, Andouille or otherwise)
* 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* Kosher salt and black pepper
* 1 1/2 cup parsley leaves
* 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more as desired
* Flaky salt, as desired
Directions:
Heat the oven to 425 degrees and stick a large baking sheet in the oven. Prep the squash and sausage: Cut the squash into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then cut the slices crosswise in half. Transfer to a large bowl. Score the sausages in a few places on both sides, making sure not to cut all the way through. Transfer to the bowl with the squash, then stir to coat with the olive oil and fat pinches of salt and pepper.
When the oven comes to temperature, carefully dump the squash and sausage mixture onto the hot baking sheet and spread it out into a single layer. Roast, stirring every so often to coat the squash in the rendered fat, until the squash is tender and sausages are crisp and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. (To add some color, put them under the broiler for a minute or two.) Let cool slightly while you prepare the parsley.
In a small bowl, mix together the parsley and lemon juice, and add salt and pepper to taste. Slice the sausage diagonally in thirds. Serve the sausage and squash on a platter with a pile of parsley on top and sprinkled with an extra squeeze of lemon and flaky salt, if desired.

Madonna: Harvey Weinstein 'crossed lines and boundaries' when we worked together

Resumen: Madonna tells "The New York Times" about how Harvey Weinstein was "sexually flirtatious and forward," and that no, she never tried to ask Trump out.

Texto completo: In 1991, Madonna was in her early 30s and her documentary/reality show "Truth or Dare" was distributed by Miramax. Now, at age 60, the music icon is opening up about how Harvey Weinstein, who owned Miramax with his brother at the time, treated her back then.
In a wide-ranging interview for The New York Times Magazine, Madonna says, “Harvey crossed lines and boundaries and was incredibly sexually flirtatious and forward with me when we were working together. " She remembers that he was married, "and I certainly wasn’t interested. ”
Madonna knew that Weinstein also acted that way toward other women in the business; it was an open secret. "And we were all, ‘Harvey gets to do that because he’s got so much power and he’s so successful and his movies do so well and everybody wants to work with him, so you have to put up with it. ’"
When Weinstein's hidden abuse finally came to light in October 2017, "I was really like, ‘Finally,’" she says. "I wasn’t cheering from the rafters, because I’m never going to cheer for someone’s demise. I don’t think that’s good karma anyway. "
In the Times interview, Madonna also answers questions about Donald Trump. No, she says, she never asked him out on a date, despite the fact that a so-called Trump publicist said that she did in 1991.
The musician says she does remember talking on the phone with Trump, though: When she was in Florida and he kept calling her.
“I did a Versace campaign with (photographer) Steven Meisel at his house in Palm Beach,” she said. “He (Trump) kept going: ‘Hey, is everything OK? Finding yourself comfortable? Are the beds comfortable? Is everything good? Are you happy?’ ”
And as for her assessment on Trump's character, she says it's weak, which, according to Madonna, is typical for an alpha male.
“They’re overcompensating for how insecure they feel — a man who is secure with himself, a human who is secure with themselves, doesn’t have to go around bullying people all the time. ”
Madonna has a new album, "Madame X," out this month. Her complete Times interview is available online.

Texto completo: YouTube anunció este miércoles planes para eliminar miles de videos y canales que promueven el neonazismo, la supremacía blanca y otras ideologías intolerantes en un intento por limpiar el extremismo y el discurso de odio.
“Los videos que alegan que un grupo es superior para justificar la discriminación, la segregación o la exclusión (serán prohibidos)” , dijo la compañía en un comunicado.
La prohibición también borrará aquellas teorías de conspiración que afirmen que no ocurrieron hechos como el tiroteo en masa en la Escuela Primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut.
“Es nuestra responsabilidad proteger eso y evitar que nuestra plataforma se use para incitar al odio, el hostigamiento, la discriminación y la violencia” , dijo la compañía en información primero reportada por The New York Times.
La decisión de YouTube, que es propiedad de Google, se suma las acciones de Facebook para rechazar mensajes de ese tipo y vetó a a siete de sus usuarios más controvertidos, incluido Alex Jones , el teórico de la conspiración y fundador de InfoWars, quien también fue vetado en Twitter.
El presidente Donald Trump ha defendido a quienes publican mensajes que abonan a la discriminación, asegurando que las compañías tecnológicas han sido injustas y apoyan a los izquierdistas.
Incluso la Casa Blanca tiene una iniciativa para evitar que eso siga ocurriendo, pero algunas redes sociales y plataformas avanzan en el desecho de mensajes, fotos, videos y otros productos que inciten al odio y cualquier tipo de discriminación.
La comunidad hispana ha sido una de las más afectadas por el incremento de estos grupos de odio, incluso una de esas organizaciones, “Identity Evropa” , organizó una protesta en el Consulado de México en Nueva York en contra de los inmigrantes el 30 de julio de 2018.

Texto completo: Former ESPN ombudsman Le Anne Schreiber died Friday at 73.
The pioneer journalist became the first female sports editor at a major American daily newspaper for The New York Times in 1978, and she remains the only woman in the paper's history to hold that title.
Schreiber spent two years as ombudsman at ESPN, beginning in 2007. She offered critique and analysis of the sports network's programming and news coverage — in television and other mediums.
In her memoir, "Midstream," she called her two-year Times tenure "excruciating. "
"If The New York Times was ready to appoint a female head of a hugely male department for the first time in its history, I had no right to refuse the position," she wrote. "I was, depending on one's view, the (expletive), the saint, the amazon, the token, the recipient of awards and death threats and, ultimately, the ingrate. "
Prior to those endeavors with the New York Times and ESPN, Schreiber served as the editor-in-chief of womenSports magazine and covered foreign affairs and the 1976 Montreal Olympics for Time magazine. Later in her career, she went on to win a National Magazine Award for public interest journalism for a 1991 series about the violence and intimidation faced by doctors who perform abortions.

Everest long been a deadly destination

Texto completo: "The plain truth," the author Jon Krakauer wrote, "is that I knew better, but went to Everest anyway."
It was 1996. Krakauer, a correspondent for Outside magazine, was to hike to Mount Everest's base camp and write a story for the publication. Instead, he met the guides who helped pioneer the commercial climbing business on the world's highest peak, and convinced the magazine to let him climb to the top. His editors obliged.
By the end of his trip, eight climbers had died during a storm. At the time, it was the deadliest attempted ascent on the mountain. Eleven people have died on Everest this year, due in large part to the vast contingent of unqualified and unguided alpinists who now flock to the mountain during climbing season, the very phenomenon Krakauer went to document.
Three years before his trip, life on Everest changed, but to understand that, you have to understand the mountain's history.
British climbers made early attempts to reach the peak on the northern side of the summit in Tibet in the early 20th century. George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were spotted within hundreds of feet of the top in 1924, but the two never returned to camp to relay whether they'd made it. Mallory's body was found in 1999. Irvine's remains missing.
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay made the first official ascent in 1953 on the mountain's southern side, in Nepal. The first Americans summited in 1963.
But amid the Cold War, access to the mountain was severely restricted. China closed the Tibetan portion of Everest from 1950 to 1980. Nepal for years did not allow foreigners into the country to climb Everest unless they were accompanied by scientists, and when it finally opened its border in 1985, it issued one Everest permit per season per route.
By the 1990s, international tensions had eased and more qualified alpinists began showing up at the mountain, hoping to gain access to climb.
"Everest, you could always get a permit, but you had to be sponsored by your country's climbing agency," said Todd Burleson, founder and president of guide service Alpine Ascents International. He's led two guided journeys to Everest's summit, and said aspiring climbers used to wait several years until their turn for a permit arrived.
"Up until about 1990, you'd take a group of the best climbers from your country to Everest and if one of those climbers got to the top, you were a national success," he said. "But during the '90s we learned a lot, and there were a lot of people who couldn't get on those groups who were very skilled. And then we started bringing them to the mountain."
Sensing opportunities for revenue and fresh off an economic modernization, China began granting more permits. Then Nepal liberalized the permitting process to keep up. Where fewer than 2,000 people attempted to climb the mountain in the 1980s, according to the Himalayan Database, nearly 4,000 have tried each of the past two decades.
"In 1993 the world changed completely," said Eric Simonson, director at International Mountain Guides and a multiple-time Everest summiteer.
Guiding agencies like Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness, the subjects of Krakauer's 1997 book "Into Thin Air," began leading trips up Everest. Local Sherpas, who experienced mountaineers say are excellent climbers but sometimes unqualified guides, established companies that offered trips at less than half the cost, but not every agency did a thorough vetting of clients to see if they were physically capable of scaling Everest.
And so crowds arrived at the mountain as the services at base camp improved, aided by technology and more precise weather tracking that allowed climbers to reach the peak in more predictably safe conditions.
But the cluster of people on the mountain is dangerous, too, sometimes preventing swift evacuations and cramming climbers together on perilous slopes.
By 1996, one of the world's most remote locales was becoming a tourist attraction. Krakauer, an avid climber, arrived to tell that story.
He summited the mountain on May 10, then returned to a forward base camp. As he descended, the weather turned, and dozens of climbers from three groups were stuck in a traffic jam and exposed to a hurricane-strength storm. So many climbers assaulted the summit at once -- even after delays in securing ropes along the treacherous "death zone" some 26,000 feet in the air -- they couldn't turn around in a timely fashion and retreat for cover.
Eight climbers died, including three guides.
"The commercialized trips and the overcrowding were what caused the tragedy (in 1996)," Hillary, who died in 2008, told Time magazine in 2003. "It was inevitable. I've been forecasting a disaster of that nature for some time. And it will happen again."
Krakauer wrote a 17,000-word article about the tragedy for Outside, then turned it into a book that made The New York Times bestseller list and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Sony bought its film rights nearly immediately after publication, and it was adapted into a TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest") in 1997, and a feature film ("Everest") in 2015.
(Krakauer has criticized the 2015 movie for departing from actual events on the mountain. He told the Los Angeles Times it was "total bull." Director Baltasar Kormakur responded that his script was not based on the book.)
"I walked off of that mountain," said Burleson, who was awarded the American Alpine Club's most prestigious honor for his part in the 1996 rescue effort, "and I had phone calls from all over the world asking, 'Can I climb Everest? Can I climb Everest?' Before that, there were only a few of us and we knew what we were doing. But now everybody wanted to do it."
The new demand for Everest expeditions outpaced the supply, especially from the mostly Western guide agencies that had offered such services, said Alan Arnette, an Everest expert, summit coach and blogger.
Those firms typically took small groups, often no more than 10 clients, and brought along up to four guides with several more Sherpas, who help fasten ropes and haul gear. Since acclimatizing to Everest's elevation can take days, and the climbing is slow going, the average Everest quest takes close to two months and costs around $70,000.
Other guide agencies began leading larger trips at lower prices without requiring climbers to have certain requisite experience, experts say, and the mountain got even more crowded. And as more underqualified adventurers attempt to summit the peak, Everest was normalized as a tourist destination.
"If you have the money, you can go," Burleson said.

Texto completo: BERLIN -- Daniel Barenboim, the venerated musical director of Berlin's Staatsoper who was accused this year by some of its orchestra members of creating a culture of bullying and a "climate of fear" in the institution, has had his contract extended until 2027.
The decision was announced at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon by Klaus Lederer, Berlin's highest-ranking representative for culture. Mr. Barenboim's contract had been set to expire in 2022.
In a statement, Mr. Lederer described Mr. Barenboim as an "exceptional artist," and said that a third-party investigation initiated by Berlin's culture ministry this year, had found that "none of the legally relevant accusations could be confirmed."
Mr. Barenboim, 76, is one of the world's most admired conductors and a high-profile public figure in the German capital. Alongside his musical leadership of the Staatsoper, the city of Berlin's premier opera house, and his position as principal conductor of the Staatskappelle, as its orchestra is called, he has founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a youth ensemble with members from across the Middle East, and a conservatory and a concert hall.
The investigation did find that there was room for improvement in the institution's working climate, Mr. Lederer said, and as a result, an ombudsperson would be introduced to mediate disputes.
"Today was only the beginning of a process of change" to improve working conditions, he said, adding that "artistic excellence should never excuse a deviation from the rules of careful interaction among people."
Mr. Lederer also noted that "the large majority of the orchestra" wanted Mr. Barenboim to remain.
Berlin's culture ministry was unable to immediately clarify the standards for misconduct used by the investigation.
The accusations against the conductor first appeared in February in an article in VAN, an online classical music magazine in which current and former employees described numerous instances of bullying, including temper outbursts and the public berating of staff members. Willi Hilgers, a former timpanist with the Staatsoper, later described to The New York Times being repeatedly singled out by Mr. Barenboim for humiliation in front of the rest of the musicians, leading to "high blood pressure, depression" and a need to use beta blockers and antidepressants before performances.
[Read our report about Daniel Barenboim's behavior .]
In an email to The New York Times in February, Mr. Barenboim said he sometimes used a "harsh tone" with employees, but disputed being a "bully" and argued that the accusations had been suspiciously timed to coincide with his contract renegotiations. Speaking at the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Barenboim said, "I am very thankful that the orchestra wants me to continue."
Leo Siberski, the music director of the Plauen-Zwickau Theater in Germany who played trumpet under Mr. Barenboim from 1992 to 2003, in February accused the conductor of having bullied and humiliated him and other members of his orchestra. In a phone interview on Tuesday, after the announcement, he said that he had spoken with the third-party organization that looked into the allegations.
He said the investigators' questions were directed at whether incidents crossed legal boundaries, rather than centering on irresponsible behavior. "They were only interested in black-and-white things and of course, this case is not black and white," he said.
Of Mr. Barenboim's contract extension, Mr. Siberski said he didn't care what happened to his former boss anymore. "I said what I said, and I'm very happy I did," he explained. "It's Berlin's business now. Whatever they feel is best for Berlin, is best for them."
As for Mr. Barenboim, when asked Tuesday what personal reflections he had in the wake of the accusations, he responded only that he would "tell that to the orchestra."
Susanne Schergaut, a member of the orchestra leadership, said that as a result of the controversy, the conversations in the organization about disagreements had gotten more "intensive." She pushed back against media reports, saying that "we don't want our relationship to our boss to be explained to us from the outside."
Thomas Rogers reported from Berlin and Alex Marshall from New York.

'Unintended consequences': CBS host worries Democrats are protecting white, male lawmakers

Texto completo: 'CBS This Morning' host Tony Dokoupil wondered if a Democratic policy designed to protect incumbents from primary challengers is keeping the party's elected officials from becoming more diverse.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced in March that it would cut business ties with consultants that went to work for Democratic primary challengers running against incumbent congressional Democrats.
The policy is designed to protect incumbent Democrats and keep their focus on congressional issues rather than worrying about a primary challenge. In effect, the policy disadvantages minorities and women from unseating white, male incumbents, slowing the party's move for diversity, Dokoupil claimed Monday while referencing a story in the New York Times.
"Democratic leadership in the House have a new policy meant to protect incumbents — people currently in office. The policy is no consultant can work for a challenger to that seat," Dokoupil said. "Now the idea is to help keep the people who are in Congress, make them stay in Congress."
"Here's the problem, two-thirds of the people who are in those safe House seats are older white men. The people who are making the challenges? Often female, often younger, often people of color," Dokoupil continued. "So people are looking at this new Democratic policy and thinking, 'Not a good look for the Democratic Party.' Unintended consequences, indeed."

Texto completo: Flying Southwest this summer and like to stash your boarding pass in those colorful paper holders they hand out at the airport?
That's now a thing of the past.
Ticket jackets, as the document holders are called, have gone the way of peanuts on Southwest. The airline stopped giving out the paper holders on Saturday.
The airline, which doles out about 22 million ticket jackets a year, eliminated them to "reduce waste, protect our environment, use less paper and ultimately become a greener company,'' spokesman Dan Landson said in a statement.
Southwest is the last major U. S. airline to ditch the ticket jackets, a relic from an era when airlines issued paper tickets.
Most tickets are now electronic, and boarding passes have moved that way, too. Travelers who don't fly Southwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, may not even know they still exist.
United Airlines said it eliminated ticket jackets in the early 2000s. Delta Air Lines did away with them in 2008. Alaska says it did away with them more than a decade ago. The last time American used them was in 2014. Spirit Airlines eliminated them in late 2016 as mobile boarding passes and self-service check-in kiosks grew in popularity.
Landson said Southwest has seen an increase in the number of travelers using mobile boarding passes and decided now was the time to eliminate the paper holders.
"Through this change in behavior, we feel like we’ve reached a good point to transition away from paper ticket jackets,'' he said.
The look of Southwest's ticket jackets, like other airlines', evolved with the airline's style and slogans over the years. The ticket jackets included gate information, Southwest reservations information and ads for Southwest products including gift cards. In the past, baggage claim checks were stapled to them.
A decade ago, one Southwest frequent flier got his close-up on Southwest's ticket jackets.
Terry Buchen, president of Golf Agronomy International, said he was selected to be on the ticket jacket after he gushed nonstop about Southwest at a party the airline hosted for frequent fliers in Baltimore.
Southwest flew Buchen and his wife to Austin, Texas, for a photo shoot and treated them to a luxury hotel, meals and a new outfit from Nordstrom for the ad. (Yes, he got to keep it. )
Buchen was on the ticket jacket from 2007 to 2009.
He was often recognized at the airport by fellow travelers and Southwest employees, earning the nickname "the ticket jacket guy," he told the New York Times in 2008.
"People used to ask me for autographs,'' Buchen said in a phone interview with USA TODAY. "It was a lot of fun. I really had fun. ''
Buchen, 72, has a framed copy of the ticket jacket at his home outside Boise, Idaho, and saved about 100 of the ticket jackets with his picture on them.
The last time Buchen used a Southwest ticket jacket was 2016. Not because he's moved to mobile boarding passes — he has, but still prints out a hard copy in case his phone dies or malfunctions — but because he doesn't fly Southwest following his move from Virginia to Idaho.
Delta has better flight options from Boise, he said. But no ticket jackets.
Buchen said he folds his backup Delta boarding pass in half and sticks it in the back left pocket of his pants.
He said he will always fondly remember ticket jackets.
"It was such a tradition for so many years,'' he said. "It just made you feel good, sort of like you were carrying a passport. And you'd open it up like a book and there was a boarding pass and a receipt. ''
Travelers nostalgic for ticket jackets, including Southwest's current version, can find plenty for sale on eBay.

Texto completo: The Broadway revival of "King Lear," starring Glenda Jackson as the anguished male monarch, will close a month early.
The production, directed by Sam Gold, opened in April to mixed reviews. In The New York Times, Ben Brantley praised Ms. Jackson for "a powerful and deeply perceptive performance," but described the show as a "glittery, haphazard production."
Others were tougher -- in The Washington Post, Peter Marks called the production "confoundingly muddled," while in New York magazine, Sara Holdren said "the painful truth is that Sam Gold's King Lear is a hot, heavy mess."
The show, which is at least the 20th Broadway production of the Shakespeare tragedy, arrived as one of the most highly anticipated productions of the season, given that it offered New York audiences the chance to see Ms. Jackson take on one of the stage's titanic challenges.
Yet it was largely snubbed by the Tony Awards nominators. Ms. Jackson, who had triumphantly returned to the Broadway stage last season with a Tony-winning performance in "Three Tall Women," was not nominated; neither was the production as best revival. Ruth Wilson got the only nod as best featured actress for her portrayals of two roles, Cordelia and Lear's fool.
The play, one of five this season with Scott Rudin as its lead producer, cost up to $ 4.95 million to capitalize, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it has not recouped those costs.
Its grosses have been softening -- it brought in $ 285,108 at the box office during the week ending June 2, which is 32 percent of its potential, according to the Broadway League.
And the audiences have been getting smaller over the course of its run -- for seven weeks the theater was over 80 percent full, but last week it was at just 60 percent capacity.
The revival began performances at the Cort Theater on Feb. 28 and was scheduled to run until July 7. Instead, it will now close on June 9. At the time of its closing, it will have had 34 previews and 76 regular performances.
A spokesman for Mr. Rudin declined to comment on Monday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- A threat of government regulation is casting a shadow over the tech industry. Now there is a billboard to remind tech workers about it on their commutes.
In all capital letters, on a black background, the sign reads: "Break Up Big Tech."
The billboard, paid for by Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign, greets commuters as they walk toward the city's main Caltrain station, the transit hub that connects San Francisco to the big tech firms in Silicon Valley. The train stops in Menlo Park (home to Facebook), Mountain View (home to Google) and Sunnyvale (near Apple's headquarters).
The appetite among politicians and regulators to break up tech giants is growing. On Friday, news broke that the Justice Department is exploring opening an investigation into Google for potential antitrust violations. The Federal Trade Commission is taking a look at Amazon. And it's not just politicians thinking about this: In May, a Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes, wrote an essay titled "It's time to break up Facebook."
"I've been talking for years about how Big Tech has too much power over our economy and our democracy," Ms. Warren wrote in an email to The New York Times. "I'm going to keep making the case for my plan to break up Big Tech and put power back in the hands of the American people -- whether it's at SXSW, a town hall in Iowa or a billboard in the heart of Silicon Valley."
While San Francisco is not exactly the heart of Silicon Valley -- that would be about 20 miles south on the Caltrain line -- her billboard, which went up on Wednesday, is above a lot of tech workers. And many are not thrilled with it.
A good portion of the people at that San Francisco intersection during the rush were drawn here by the tech industry. They are here to work for one of the big companies (most of the firms also have large offices in San Francisco), or for a start-up, or they are lawyers for tech, or doing market research for tech, or they run pizza shops for tech workers.
Though the economic windfall has helped exacerbate what some residents and officials say is growing inequality, others who have found a niche in town are wary of messing with success.
"There isn't a single person here who doesn't benefit from these companies," said Tony Riviera, 61, who owns a few restaurants around San Francisco, including the nearby Slices Pizzeria. "These guys are out working hard, making good money and spending good money, and if it weren't for tech this city would be dead."
He said the senator had "bought some bad placement." He added that he had some food-tech ideas.
Some worried about the unintended consequences of cracking down on tech's biggest companies.
"Any damage to the big companies would damage the whole economy," said Yesh Devabhaktuni, 25, who works as a software engineer for Walmart Labs. "The small companies need the big companies."
Others moved here from around the world to work in the industry.
"Tech giants are where innovation is happening, and they offer a lot of jobs," said Fred Ren, 27, a software engineer who immigrated from Canada. "I came here for that."
And some scoffed at the idea that start-ups could no longer compete.
"There's always opportunities for more start-ups," said Edmund Park, 28, a data scientist for a market research firm.
The fire alarm technician walking by did not like it, either.
"'Big Tech' is a big generalization," said Rick DeRushia, 58.
Even a tech worker whose project was blocked by Google argued against breaking up the tech giants. Michael Plasmeier, 28, a product manager, had once worked on a home screen competitor that he says Google squeezed out.
"That product ended up not going anywhere, and, yeah, it was frustrating," Mr. Plasmeier said, adding that he still did not want to see the companies broken up. He said that because big tech firms often bought struggling start-ups, they played a vital role keeping the region's innovation machine going.
Chuck Conlon, 44, who works as a sales and design consultant at HD Buttercup, the high-end furniture store the billboard is attached to, suggested the message might have more fans in a different part of the city. The Caltrain station is in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, home to scores of tech start-ups.
"This is an odd area to put it -- the whole area's all tech," Mr. Conlon said. "But I guess she knew that?"
But one of his colleagues, Megan Schmitz, 28, was enthusiastic about the message.
"What a badass," she said. "I love it."
With the headlines seemingly always negative, some rank-and-file workers in the tech industry believe they are being unfairly demonized.
Laura Grantham, 48, an engineering recruiter at the file-hosting service Dropbox, said that she was a fan of the senator but that the message was alienating.
"I know why she's saying that, but I feel like if you just only saw that billboard you'd be like, 'Oh, wow, Elizabeth Warren really hates us,"' Ms. Grantham said.
But others recognized points in American history when the federal government intervened to break up powerful companies.
"Out here, people write this rhetoric off as absurd, that it's never going to happen, but that's because they're ignoring history," said Collins Belton, 28, a lawyer at the tech law firm Atrium. "The oil barons did the same thing."
This is not Ms. Warren's first time going straight to tech people to say tech is too powerful. In March, she detailed her argument to the audience of South by Southwest, or SXSW, a technology and music festival in Texas.
"You can be an umpire or you can own teams," Ms. Warren said. "But you can't be an umpire and own one of the teams that's in the game."
On Saturday, while she was in town for the state's Democratic convention, Ms. Warren visited the billboard. She took a selfie underneath it.

Texto completo: SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Over the past year, Apple purged iPhone apps that helped people limit the amount of time they and their children spent on Apple devices, drawing accusations of anticompetitive behavior.
On Monday, as news broke that federal officials were stepping up antitrust scrutiny of Apple and its peers, the Silicon Valley giant abruptly reversed its policy and quietly disclosed that the apps' practices were allowed.
After promoting its latest software updates in a splashy two-hour presentation on Monday morning, Apple articulated its new policy in a short blog post on a section of its website for developers.
The post said parental-control apps could now use two technologies that Apple had recently cited as grounds for their removal from iPhones.
One technology, mobile device management, or M.D.M., enables parents to take control of a child's phone. The other is a virtual private network, or V.P.N., which parents can use to block certain apps on a child's phone.
In the post, Apple said the apps could use the technologies if they didn't "sell, use or disclose to third parties any data for any purpose."
"These apps were using an enterprise technology that provided them access to kids' highly sensitive personal data," an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement. "We do not think it is O.K. for any apps to help data companies track or optimize advertising of kids."
She did not say whether Apple had found evidence that of the apps' doing so. The app makers deny such activity. The spokeswoman declined to say why Apple had changed its mind.
Fred Stutzman, the chief executive of Freedom, an app that helped people track and limit their time on iPhones, said, "My reaction is: Why this last year of pain? And we end up exactly in the same place."
Apple removed Freedom from iPhones in August for using a V.P.N., without much explanation, Mr. Stutzman said. The move cost his business more than $ 1 million, he said.
Apple's move followed an April report by The New York Times that it had purged some apps. On Monday, The Times and other publications reported that House lawmakers said they would step up their antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies and that the Justice Department would consider antitrust complaints against Apple.
Apple's tight control over its App Store is likely to be central to any antitrust investigation of the company. Spotify and two parental-control apps recently complained to European regulators that Apple was abusing its dominance of the digital marketplace, which has become one of the world's largest centers of commerce. Dutch regulators are also investigating the issue.
And the Supreme Court recently allowed an antitrust class action to move forward, ruling that consumers can try to prove that Apple used the App Store to raise apps' prices.
In response, Apple published a new webpage aimed at explaining its App Store policies and defending its practices. Apple said it tried to make the App Store a safe place for consumers and a good business opportunity for developers. It said it welcomed competition.
Apple's reversal on Monday concluded a yearlong struggle for some app developers. At its annual developers conference in San Jose on June 4 last year, Apple unveiled a feature to help people limit the time that they and their children spend on the iPhone. Around that time, Apple quietly began removing or restricting apps in its App Store that offered similar services.
In April, The Times reported on Apple's app removals. The makers of several banned apps told The Times that Apple was acting unfairly and had severely damaged their businesses. Apple responded to the article by saying it had removed the apps because they "put users' privacy and security at risk." The company added: "Contrary to what The New York Times reported over the weekend, this isn't a matter of competition. It's a matter of security."
At the encouragement of Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive and one of the iPhone's creators, 17 of the affected app makers joined together and last week proposed a technological solution, called an application programming interface, or A.P.I., that they said would enable them to continue to help parents limit their children's screen time without invading their privacy.
While the companies could offer a road map for resolving the issue, it would be up to Apple to create the A.P.I. Apple often creates A.P.I.s so software made by other companies can work well with its popular products, like the iPhone.
"It's been a hellish roller coaster," said Dustin Dailey, a senior product manager at OurPact, which had been the top parental-control iPhone app, with more than three million downloads, before Apple pulled it in February. OurPact, which had counted on its iPhone app for about 80 percent of its revenue, lost roughly $ 3 million from Apple's move, a spokeswoman said.
In response to Apple's stance that the apps could gain too much control over a child's phone, Mr. Dailey said, his team shared information with Apple about how it handled user data. "We'd be open to an audit," he said.
The affected parental-control and screen-time apps are not yet back in the App Store. Several had appealed Apple's decision to remove them, while others will probably have to reapply for entry.

House schedules first hearing on Mueller's findings, without Mueller

Texto completo: House Democrats, grasping for ways to bring the special counsel's report to life, said Monday they would convene a series of hearings focused on Robert Mueller's findings, even if the special counsel would not be on the witness stand for now.
The first star witness, in fact, will come from another era and another presidential scandal: John W. Dean, White House counsel for the late former president Richard Nixon who told the Senate in June 1973 that the president had been directly involved in the Watergate cover-up.
The hearing, scheduled for June 10 with the House Judiciary Committee, will allow lawmakers to fully air Mueller's findings for the first time.
So far, Democrats' requests for testimony from key witnesses in the Mueller investigation have been blocked by the Trump administration, and Mueller has yet to agree to appear on Capitol Hill despite delivering a rare public statement last week.
The Judiciary Committee is not the only panel trying to fight back against a refusal by the executive branch to comply with oversight demands. The chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said Monday he would schedule a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas for documents related to the administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and the Judiciary committee chairman, said his committee's first hearing would zero in on “the most overt acts of obstruction" documented by Mueller. The special counsel's report detailed at least 10 cases of possible obstruction by President Trump as he sought to thwart investigators studying his campaign's ties to Russia and its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Republicans mocked the announcement. Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, a member of the Judiciary Committee, accused Democrats of seeking to stage “make believe" reasons to impeach Trump.
The committee already has outstanding subpoenas for testimony from two more key witnesses this month. But neither witness — Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; or Annie Donaldson, chief of staff to the former White House counsel — is likely to show.

Trump, in tussle with CNN, suggests boycott of parent AT&T
President Trump took to Twitter on Monday to reiterate his complaints about CNN and suggest a boycott of its parent company, AT&T.
Soon after his arrival in London for a pomp-filled state visit to Britain, Trump tweeted that CNN is his chief source of US news but that "after watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S."
Trump asked why doesn't AT&T "do something" and said that if people stopped using or subscribing to AT&T, it would be forced to make "big changes" at CNN. CNN is owned by Turner Broadcasting System, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia.
"This is unprecedented and extremely unusual for this to come out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.
It's not clear how much of an impact Trump's remarks will have. Invested shrugged off the news, as AT&T's stock price increased 1.7 percent on Monday. AT&T and CNN declined to comment.
Trump has long criticized CNN over its coverage of him and his administration.
Associated Press
Why Donald Trump can't watch Fox News in Britain
Trump is known to be an avid viewer of one network in particular: Fox News.
The president regularly tweets about news he has seen on the right-leaning network, and he is an active participant on the network. According to data compiled by The Washington Post earlier this year, roughly one-third of all interview time that Trump has given to members of the media since taking office were granted to Fox News or its sister network, Fox Business Network.
Why can't the American president watch a "Fox News International" in Britain, as he could with CNN? The problem appears to be relatively simple: British viewers have rejected it.
Just two years ago, it was possible to watch Fox News in Britain. However, in August 2017, the network was abruptly pulled off the air. A statement released by its parent company at the time pinned the blame on low ratings.
"It averages only a few thousand viewers across the day," 21st Century Fox said in a statement provided to CNN. The company noted that this was largely because the network's programming was aimed at American audiences.
The channel aired in Britain for more than a decade and was offered by Sky Limited, a British media conglomerate that at the time was partially owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.
Although figures released by the Broadcaster's Audience Research Board (BARB) suggested that Fox News' average daily viewers in Britain were almost 60,000, a company source told the BBC that they were in fact closer to 2,000.
The decision to pull out of Britain came amid scrutiny of Fox News from Britain's telecommunications regulator, the Office of Communications. The regulator, widely known as Ofcom, had criticized the television network for a number of breaches, including airing pro-Brexit views on the day of the June 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union and allowing a commentator to suggest that Britain's second-largest city was "totally Muslim."
Months after the channel was taken off the air in Britain, Ofcom said in a statement that the channel had broken broadcasting rules about impartiality by being largely pro-Trump and not offering alternative viewpoints.

Texto completo: James Holzhauer’s “Jeopardy” winning streak came to an end Monday.
Holzhauer set a record for the most money won in a single episode, going 11 episodes during his 32-game winning streak without answering a single question wrong. His $2.4 million in winnings was less than $60,000 short of beating Ken Jennings, who set a record in 2004 with his 74-game winning streak.
His average winnings per game — $77,000 — were more than double Jennings’ average winnings.
In the game show’s Monday episode, Holzhauer, a 34-year-old professional sports bettor, lost to 27-year-old librarian Emma Boettcher.
“Nobody likes to lose,” Holzhauer said to the New York Times. “But I’m very proud of how I did, and I really exceeded my own expectations for the show. So, I don’t feel bad about it.”
“I lost to a really top-level competitor,” Holzhauer said. “She played a perfect game. And that was what it took to beat me.”
Holzhauer said Boettcher gained an edge when he picked a clue worth $1,200 from a category about capitals.
“The answer to this question occurred to me a second too late, so she was able to out-buzz me,” Holzhauer said.
Boettcher picked a Daily Double next, bet all she had, and guessed the correct answer.
During Final Jeopardy, both contestants answered correctly, but Holzhauer couldn’t catch up with Boettcher’s lead.
“What a game! Oh my gosh!” host Alex Trebek said.

Los inmigrantes donan órganos pero no puede recibir trasplantes. Y es cuestión de vida o muerte

Texto completo: “Tú vas al hospital y puedes donar tus órganos aunque seas inmigrante” e indocumentado , se lamenta Abigail Martínez , pero “cuando tú eres inmigrante no te pueden dar un riñón, yo creo que es injusto ”.
Su marido, José Antonio Martínez, sufre desde hace cinco años una enfermedad renal, según informa la emisora NY1, y el tratamiento de diálisis al que lleva sometiéndose desde entonces ya no es suficiente .
“Su riñón ya se hizo muy pequeño, ya no le sirven los riñones”, explica su esposa, “no tenemos el dinero, no tenemos los fondos para que a él lo operen”.
Martínez necesita un trasplante de riñones para sobrevivir. Y no es el único. Según un estudio publicado en febrero de 2018, alrededor de 6,500 inmigrantes indocumentados en todo el país sufren una enfermedad renal grave, pero en la mayoría de estados sólo pueden ser tratado con diálisis en caso de emergencia.
Y casi nunca pueden recibir un trasplante de riñón (se han registrado casos en California), que es una opción más saludable para el paciente y menos costosa para el erario público que la diálisis. Además, añade el estudio, los inmigrantes indocumentados donan sus órganos en mayor cantidad de la que reclaman un trasplante.
No existe una regulación legal que impida a estos inmigrantes recibir trasplantes; el problema es que, sin seguro médico disponible, el precio es casi siempre inasumible. Y el seguro médico público sólo cubre la diálisis ordinaria (no de emergencia) en estados como Nueva York, California , Illinois y Washington DC (en el resto, sólo se puede realizar en situaciones de emergencia, pese a ser un tratamiento que se precisa periódicamente), pero casi nunca cubre el trasplante.
En 2015, por ejemplo, una clínica de Nueva York se negó a trasplantarle a una mujer con una enfermedad renal en fase terminal el riñón que le iba a donar su propio marido, al enterarse de que ambos eran indocumentados y, por tanto, el seguro público Medicare no cubriría la intervención.
Según informó entonces el diario Daily News, un trasplante costaba 106,000 dólares , mientras que la diálisis (dos veces a la semana de forma indefinida) cuesta 72,000 dólares al año (para toda la vida).
Es por ello que, pese a pagar sus impuestos en Estados Unidos, algunos afectados viajan a México a realizar el trasplante, aunque allí el precio sigue siendo muy alto (40,000 dólares en 2011, según el diario The New York Times) y requieren de préstamos.
El congresista estatal Félix Ortiz ha presentado en mayo una propuesta de ley para que el seguro médico público Medicaid cubra los trasplantes a aquellos pacientes que lleven al menos dos años bajo diálisis. Según ha relatado a NY1, hay al menos seis inmigrantes indocumentados que lo requieren. La misma propuesta ha sido planteada ante el Senado estatal por el congresista Gustavo Rivera.

Texto completo: The Justice Department is gearing up for an antitrust investigation of Google set to examine the search giant's internal practices and search rankings, according to a report published late last week.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the Justice Department "has been laying the groundwork for the probe," citing people familiar with the investigation. The New York Times and Bloomberg also confirmed the inquiry with people who have knowledge of the deliberations.
The exact focus of the inspection remains unclear, but a new probe by federal investigators would be the latest in a string of regulatory looks at Google's search and advertising practices along with the tech firm's negative impact on competitors.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Google in 2011 over allegations that the tech company misrepresented its use of tracking cookies to users of the internet browser Safari. Google settled the case, agreeing to pay a $22. 5 million fine.

In 2017, The European Commission fined Google over how it ranks results on its shopping platform, and earlier this year, the EC slapped Google with a penalty for being "anti-competitive. "
The results of the latest investigation could add renewed credibility to those who warn about the dangers of having a handful of tech firms dominate the U. S. landscape.
Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , announced a grand proposal to break up big tech firms earlier this year, arguing that companies like Facebook and Google have become too powerful and need to be broken up.
A few weeks ago, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes had similar sentiments, calling for the breakup of the social media giant he helped create.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
VOX LUX (2018) Stream on Hulu. Natalie Portman plays Celeste, a pop star whose success was born from tragedy. As a teen in 1999, Celeste survived a school shooting and was discovered after she sang at the memorial service. With the help of her sister (Stacy Martin) and manager (Jude Law), Celeste rockets to fame. But by 2017, overcome by scandal, her career is in a nose dive. As Celeste prepares for her comeback, she gives in to fits of rage and faces the challenges that come with fame and motherhood. Written and directed by Brady Corbet, the film was chosen as a New York Times Critic's Pick by Manohla Dargis, who wrote in her review, "Portman's performance puts an exclamation point on Celeste's every gesture, word and saunter." Portman also sings original songs written by Sia.
BLITZED: NAZIS ON DRUGS (2019) Stream on Acorn TV. Narrated by Steven Berkoff, this one-hour documentary explores how drugs played a role in World War II. Theodor Morell, Adolf Hitler's personal doctor, gave the Nazi leader daily drug cocktails and fed the troops methamphetamine. The film looks at whether -- and how -- drugs affected the war's outcome.
What's on TV
CHERNOBYL 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. In the final episode of this five-part mini-series starring Jared Harris, Stellan Skarsgard, Jessie Buckley and Emily Watson, the main characters are taking drastic risks to expose the secrets behind the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl. In his Times review, the critic Mike Hale said that "the writer Craig Mazin ('The Hangover' Parts II and III) and the director Johan Renck take an event unlike any other in human history and turn it into a creaky and conventional, if longer than usual, disaster movie."
BELOW DECK MEDITERRANEAN 9 p.m. on Bravo. It's time for Bravo to set sail once again in the Mediterranean. In this Season 4 premiere, the cast's stews and deckhands are headed to the French Riviera. With a few returning crew members -- including Captain Sandy and chief stew Hannah -- and some new to the show, the group will have to work together to appease their often demanding guests on the megayacht Sirocco. This season also features the show's first female chef, Mila Kolomeitseva, who is classically trained in French cuisine. As usual, expect drama, heavy drinking and beautiful destinations.
SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE 9 p.m. on Fox. The host Cat Deeley kicks off the 16th season of this dance competition show in Los Angeles with the first week of auditions. Dancers of all styles, ages 18 to 30, will try to prove their talent to move on to the next round. This season's judges include Nigel Lythgoe and Mary Murphy, and the guest judges this episode are Laurieann Gibson, Lady Gaga's choreographer and creative director, and Dominic "D-Trix" Sandoval, an alum of the show.

Re "Taxi Drivers Fell Prey While Top Officials Counted the Money" ("Taken for a Ride" series, front page, May 20):
Your investigative series does not tell the stories of the lenders to the taxi medallion industry that did not take advantage of the borrowers.
The Franklin Corporation and Beneficial Capital Corporation were two lenders in the 1980s who lent millions of dollars to buyers of coveted taxi medallions. The interest rate was regulated by the Small Business Administration, and the loans were self-amortizing over five to seven years.
No loans called for the payment of interest only, and none were sold to third parties. The lenders never had a default. When the price of medallions rose to astronomical levels and loans could not be repaid within seven years, these lenders discontinued lending to the industry.
We recognize the importance of The New York Times in unearthing examples of corporate greed and corruption, devastating communities, but there are examples worth highlighting of the positive effect lenders in this industry had when they knew how to act fairly.

Help an author (and fellow readers) by posting a thoughtful book review online

Texto completo: One of the most generous things you can do for the author of a book is to write a review and post it on Amazon.com or Goodreads.com. This is especially true for indie books — those published by the authors themselves or by small presses.
With their tiny (or non-existent) marketing budgets, these books — a million are published each year — struggle to find readers. Receiving a large number of reviews can help raise a book’s visibility on retail sites like Amazon.
Unfortunately, just like grade inflation in our schools, the awarding of “stars” to indie books has been affected by readers who want to help their author friends sell more books. As a result, amateur reviews have lost credibility. Further, because display order depends on algorithms that take into account star ratings, books that don’t sport a large majority of four- and five-star reviews on Amazon effectively disappear.
While authors understandably fret about one-, two- and three-star or negative reviews, that doesn’t mean readers should write only positive, five-star reviews. Even books considered part of the literary “canon” have received harsh criticism. Literary Hub, an online literary digest, frequently collates one-star reviews of famous novels. An example: in a one-star critique of 1984, a reviewer called it “a wet, moody rag.”
On the other hand, five-star ratings that include no comments and one-sentence positive reviews don’t help sell books, either. I know that writing a review can be intimidating for readers who don’t write much other than an occasional email or Facebook post. It’s even more daunting if you think you must be a literary critic to write a review.
Nothing could be further from the truth. No one expects all readers to have the expertise of a book reviewer for the New York Times or the New Yorker. Your opinion is valuable anyway. To make it easier to contribute an Amazon or Goodreads review, I offer the following “do” and “don’t” tips.
Do
Give a brief summary of the plot. This doesn’t have to be comprehensive; just write a couple of sentences so that another reader will have an idea about whether the book will interest them. While doing this, be sure you don’t spoil the answer to a mystery or give away a secret that the author is keeping for the end.
Give a recommendation: up or down. Should others consider buying this book? If yes, what did you get out of it? Did you learn something? Were you unable to go to sleep until you finished it? Did you love the writing? The characters? And if you didn’t like it, always say why as well.
If you received a free copy of the book in exchange for your review, it’s only fair to the other readers to let them know. It only takes a quick sentence: “I received a free copy in return for agreeing to review this book.”
If it’s appropriate, share a sentence or two about yourself that helps other readers understand your perspective. It might be something like: “I grew up in Iowa, so I know the setting well.” Or: “As a child, I also suffered from parental neglect.” This establishes some credibility for your opinion.
Don’t
Review the book that was written. Never suggest the author should have written a different book. I once read a review of a golf novel in which the reviewer felt romance wasn’t a large enough part of the book. She should have looked for books in the romance section, not the sports fiction section!
Don’t use poor grammar, poor punctuation or bad spelling. Even the most glowing review will mean nothing if it is poorly written. Take a few minutes to review what you’ve written before you dash it off. No one expects you to be a great writer, but your review won’t carry any weight if it looks like you’re illiterate.
Don’t get even with the writer for a past snub, a disagreement or a domestic issue. One of my books was once given a number of one-star reviews — sans comments — by the friends of a women who was divorcing a friend of mine. Not fair!
Don’t pick out a minor detail in the book that you don’t like and make the review about it. I recall reading a one-sentence review that took an author to task for having an overweight character in the book, which the reviewer felt was insensitive.
Finally, to see professionals write reviews, there are many free websites where you can read their offerings, including Kirkus Reviews (www.kirkusreviews.com), Foreword Reviews (www.forewordreviews.com) and Midwest Book Review (www.midwestbookreview.com). A caveat: reviews may be less biased if they’re written soon after the book is released. Average ratings tend to fall once a book receives a major literary award, probably because of heightened expectations on the part of readers and jealousy of the literary crowd that didn’t win the award.

Texto completo: CITY OF GIRLS, by Elizabeth Gilbert. Riverhead, 470 pp., $28.
At the start of Elizabeth Gilbert's much-anticipated new novel, "City of Girls," the year is 1940, and Vivian Morris is a Vassar dropout shipped off by her well-to-do family to live with her offbeat Aunt Peg in Manhattan. To a pretty 19-year-old with no discernible ambition but an eye for all that's beautiful, sensuous and frivolous - "a girl so freshly hatched there was practically yolk in my hair" - her arrival in the big city practically shocks her into consciousness, propelling her into a life worth telling about.
Vivian's Aunt Peg owns the Lily Playhouse Theatre, a "grandiose" yet "crumbling" old palace that puts on schlock for its working-class neighborhood audience. Still, this world dazzles Vivian. The Lily attracts a wondrous hodgepodge of misfits: a tough-as-nails stunner of a showgirl named Celia; a cantankerous playwright who greets each day with doom and gloom; and a friend of Peg's, Edna Parker Watson, an esteemed stage actress with impeccable style, who finds refuge at the Lily with her handsome lout of a husband after their London home is reduced to rubble during the Blitz.
Living above the theater in a fully furnished apartment - the stuff of fairy tales for young people moving to New York now - Vivian embarks on a series of wanton adventures glued to the side of fast-living Celia, soaking up gin and male attention in one swanky nightclub after another.
Months after Vivian's arrival, the Lily puts on a play that's worthy of Edna Parker Watson's star power. That play - "City of Girls" - reverses the fortunes of the shambling  theater and turns it into a destination for New York's elite. Gilbert unfurls the premiere of the play in rapturous, breathless chapters that, in a tour de force of literary mimicry, are punctuated with reviews by Brooks Atkinson from The New York Times and Walter Winchell for the now-defunct New York Daily Mirror.
The good days last just a little bit longer. When reflecting upon her adventures in show business and sex, Vivian is so prone to hyperbole she can appear to be hooked on hallucinogens; to her, everyone and everything in her new life is cranked up to impossible extremes: New York City is a synapse-frying wonderland orgy of booze and handsome men, Celia is a once-in-a-generation beauty, Aunt Peg is a larger-than-life bon vivant, Edna Parker Watson possesses unlimited stores of otherworldly charisma, while her husband is the most doltish human to ever live.
This isn't a criticism - a first move to the big city is an extreme experience for a young person, especially a beautiful, moneyed 19-year-old starting out in pre-WWII Manhattan. But just as the endless nights of waking up hung over in makeup-streaked sheets start to become monotonous - both to Vivian and to the reader - the fantasy comes to an abrupt end, when Vivian is mixed up in a ruinous scandal splashed all over the gossip rags.
The city spits Vivian out - temporarily, at least - thus setting off a surprising, more sober second half to her story, as World War II transforms the city and the world. It's no spoiler to say this isn't a novel about an indecorous woman's descent into disgrace - Vivian harbors no shame in her checkered past; it's her taste for sex and adventure, independence and rebellion, that makes her life worth following over seven decades.
For fans of Gilbert's best-known work, "Eat, Pray, Love," there are no concrete similarities  with her juggernaut memoir. Yet "City of Girls" embraces some of the same themes: the power of a woman breaking from a traditional path, and the wisdom of taking true, two-handed joy in the pleasures that life offers up. The only other similarity? "City of Girls" is an unbeatable beach read, loaded with humor and insi

Texto completo: PITTSFIELD — As he was nearing 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges in Massachusetts, Fred Rutberg began thinking about what he might do next. He had served on the bench in Berkshire County for 20 years, and lived in Stockbridge for 40.
Then one soft summer night in 2014, Rutberg and his wife, Judith, were on Nantucket, listening to a talk at the island library by veteran political journalist Joe Klein.
“At some point, [Klein] said, offhandedly, 'Democracy requires citizenship and citizenship requires a town square,' " Rutberg said. “And when he said that, I whispered to my wife, 'The Berkshire Eagle.' "
Five years later, the former district court judge is president and publisher of the Eagle, a once-great daily newspaper whose staff, circulation, and prestige all declined dramatically during two decades of corporate ownership. Backed by a group with local ties and deep pockets, Rutberg bought the moribund paper in May 2016 and began investing in it, hiring reporters and editors, adding new sections, revitalizing its website, even spending money on better-quality newsprint.
So far, the results are promising. Print subscriptions, which had been dropping for years, are holding steady, and the Eagle's digital subscriptions are growing — by an impressive 60 percent since June 2018. Last year, the Eagle received the New England Newspaper & Press Association's award for general excellence, and its daily and Sunday editions swept the Newspaper of the Year awards for papers of its size. And not coincidentally, there has been an increase in furrowed brows among local officials who are now being confronted by a more active press.
“I wanted to do something useful," said Rutberg, sitting behind his desk at the Eagle's offices in a converted mill building on the edge of downtown. “I wanted to try to do some good around here."
Most stories about newspapers these days end badly. According to a recent University of North Carolina study, gloomily titled “The Expanding News Desert," nearly 1,800 papers in the United States have closed since 2004, and many others, facing steep declines in circulation and advertising, have been taken over by chains whose first priority is profit, not news.
The Berkshire Eagle's previous owner, MNG Enterprises, is an example. The Colorado publishing company, formerly known as Digital First Media, is a subsidiary of Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund with a track record of buying beleaguered papers and slashing costs to raise profits. Called “vulture capitalists" by critics, MNG owns dozens of newspapers, including The Denver Post, The Mercury News of San Jose, the Los Angeles Daily News, the Fitchburg Sentinel & Enterprise, and the Boston Herald, which it bought out of bankruptcy last year and promptly cut a quarter of the staff.
“People in the Berkshires won the lottery when [Rutberg's group] bought the Eagle," said newspaper analyst Ken Doctor. “It's rare to see local people with the willingness, the capital, and the stamina to step up and do the really heavy lifting to transform an old newspaper in the digital age."
Rutberg, who grew up in Philadelphia, was 26 when he moved to the Berkshires, opening a law practice in Stockbridge in 1974. As a boy, he'd attended summer camp nearby and enjoyed the natural beauty of westernmost Massachusetts. As a grown-up, he marveled at the area's thriving cultural scene, including Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home in Lenox, the renowned Jacob's Pillow dance center in Becket, and the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown.
The county also boasted an uncommonly good newspaper that had been owned for decades by the Miller family. With a flatbed press and one typesetting machine, Kelton B. Miller started publishing the Eagle in 1892, succeeded by sons Pete and Don in 1941, and by grandsons Mark and Michael in the 1980s. Throughout, the Millers poured money into the paper, turning a modest profit even as they maintained an unusually large staff for a paper with a circulation, at its peak, of about 35,000.
“My uncle used to say that we put out a much better paper than we should," said Mark Miller.
Over time, the Eagle earned a national reputation for being tough and meticulous in its reporting. In 1972, Washington Post press critic Ben Bagdikian told Time magazine there were only three great newspapers in the world: The New York Times, Le Monde, and The Berkshire Eagle.
The Eagle became a training ground for talented young journalists. Notable alums include Gustav Niebuhr, who became a respected religion writer at The New York Times; Richard Weil, a longtime editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; Helen Donovan, onetime executive editor of the Globe; Priscilla Painton, executive editor at Simon & Schuster; and Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and killed in Pakistan in 2002 while reporting a story about Al Qaeda. Other celebrated Eagle staffers included Abe Michelson, the State House reporter whose behind-the-scenes “Beacon Hill" column ran in eight Massachusetts papers, including the Globe, and Roger Linscott, the Eagle editorial writer who won the paper's only Pulitzer Prize in 1973.
The Eagle even had a minor pop-culture moment in the early 1980s when actress Sally Field, playing an embattled reporter in the film “Absence of Malice," said her first job was “the summer when I was 16 on The Berkshire Eagle. I wonder if they'd have me back."
“The Eagle was absolutely indispensable," said Rutberg. “When I was practicing law, I used to say it was required reading. It didn't happen unless it was in the Eagle. The paper had a real hold on the community."
But the Eagle's fortunes turned in the late 1980s when the Miller grandchildren got involved in a questionable real estate deal, buying the former Sheaffer Eaton mill in Pittsfield and spending $23 million to renovate the 11-acre site to house the newspaper and, they hoped, other tenants.
It didn't work, and in 1987, the same year the Millers bought the decrepit mill complex, the stock market crashed, while the cost of newsprint soared. Soon after, General Electric, which once employed 13,000 people at its Pittsfield plant, announced mass layoffs, devastating the local economy. In 1995, drowning in debt, the Millers sold the Eagle and papers they owned in Vermont and Connecticut to William Dean Singleton, a Denver newspaper executive nicknamed “Lean Dean" because his company, MediaNews Group, pioneered a strategy of buying regional papers and cutting costs by consolidating business operations, ad sales, and printing.
“Dean fired me the day he took over," said Don MacGillis, who was editor in chief and editorial page editor during his two decades at the Eagle. “I told him I'd seen some of his other papers, and before he did to the Eagle what he'd done elsewhere, he ought to talk to subscribers.
“I don't think he appreciated that," said MacGillis, who later worked at the Globe.
Singleton, now retired, said he'd been an admirer of the Eagle for many years, but the paper was losing money when he bought it.
“I always suffered from not being the Millers," said Singleton, reached at his office in Denver. “I certainly plead guilty to insisting on economic responsibility. If a newspaper doesn't make money, it doesn't have a future, and the Eagle was not making money."
The Eagle continued to do good journalism, but the staff gradually shrunk; in its heyday, there were close to 60 people in the newsroom, well above the industry standard for a paper its size. The contraction did not go unnoticed by readers and advertisers.
“They just kept scaling back and back," said state Representative William “Smitty" Pignatelli, a Lenox native who grew up reading the Eagle. “It was sad because it had been a lifeline for so many people."
By 2014, when Rutberg was contemplating his next step, the Eagle had lost much of its luster. Alden Global Capital had gained a majority stake in MNG Enterprises and made even deeper cuts. Overnight, it also boosted the price of an annual Eagle subscription from $180 to $300.
Kevin Moran, the Eagle's executive editor, recalls a 2015 visit to the newsroom by Alden Global president Heath Freeman. Moran had been told Freeman was just dropping by to introduce himself, but then watched as the 35-year-old fund manager (once dubbed “the Gordon Gekko of newspapers" by business columnist Joe Nocera) spent six hours eliminating 20 positions from the newspaper's budget. At its lowest ebb, Moran said, the Eagle had five reporters scrambling to cover Berkshire County's two cities — Pittsfield and North Adams — 30 towns and many arts-and-culture organizations.
“Heath left that meeting saying Alden is a hedge fund and it's his job to maximize operational efficiencies and increase profits for shareholders," Moran said. “I want to be operationally efficient, too. I want this business to thrive. But people were picking up the Eagle at the end of their driveway and wondering what they were paying for."
Freeman, who seldom gives interviews, declined to comment for this story.
“Alden Global has a turn-out-the-lights strategy, a milk-it strategy," said Doctor, the newspaper analyst. “As revenues decline, they just continue to cut the enterprise to maintain cash flow. They know it won't last forever, and if they have to close a property, they will."
Even Singleton, who had a reputation as an enthusiastic cost-cutter, questions whether Alden Global chopped too much from its newspapers, including the Eagle.
“They've cut costs much more aggressively than we ever did," he said. “Sitting in a big office building in New York, they didn't care. We cared. I particularly cared about the Eagle."
Rutberg admits the idea of buying the Eagle was “pollyannaish." He didn't know the newspaper business, had no idea whether Alden Global was interested in selling, and, if it was, didn't have the money. Nonetheless, he started making calls, beginning with Hans Morris, managing partner of the venture capital firm Nyca Partners and a former president of Visa. An inveterate newspaper reader who has owned a house in Stockbridge for 30 years, Morris agreed to meet Rutberg for coffee. The notion of a local owner resuscitating the Eagle intrigued him, but Morris was hesitant to encourage Rutberg.
“It was a noble thing to do," he said. “But I didn't want to get into something that's just going to be a financial mess. I said, 'Let's see if there's any interest in even talking to us.' "
There was, but the two sides were far apart on price. A year later, in 2015, Alden Global came back with a lower number, and Rutberg assembled a group of investors that included Morris; Bob Wilmers, chief executive of Buffalo-based M&T Bank Corp. and a longtime homeowner in the Berkshires; and Stanford Lipsey, former owner of the Sun Newspaper Group in Nebraska and a part-time Berkshires resident.
A deal was struck in May 2016 — the sale price hasn't been disclosed — and in a letter to Eagle readers, Rutberg pledged to invest in the paper. (His group also bought back the Vermont papers formerly owned by the Millers: the Bennington Banner, the Brattleboro Reformer, and the Manchester Journal.)
“The goal is to make the Eagle a part of the finest community newspaper group in America," Rutberg wrote. “Our business plan is simple. By improving the quality and quantity of the content in our publications, we expect to increase our readership which will, in turn, increase our revenues, and ensure the future of these publications."
Three years later, Moran, the Eagle's executive editor, has a staff of 13 reporters, including two in the paper's reopened Great Barrington bureau. One recent hire is Larry Parnass, a longtime reporter and editor at The Daily Hampshire Gazette in Northampton, who is the Eagle's new investigations editor. In September 2017, Parnass wrote a 10,000-word story scrutinizing Van Shields, the former Berkshire Museum director who quarterbacked a controversial plan to sell 22 works of art, including paintings by Norman Rockwell, to raise money for museum renovations. The story generated enormous buzz in the community, and Shields left the museum less than a year later.
But the Eagle's energetic coverage has not been welcomed by everyone. Reporter Amanda Drane, who joined the Eagle in 2017, also from The Daily Hampshire Gazette, said some city officials in Pittsfield had grown unaccustomed to being questioned.
“A lot of what I do is educate prominent people who should know what an active press looks like," said Drane, laughing. “I've made some inroads with the Police Department, but, honestly, they've struggled to keep up with my demands."
Not long after the sale, Wilmers and Lipsey, who were both in their 80s, died. Rutberg declined to say if the business is profitable, but said their deaths have not affected the Eagle's viability. For the past year or so, to promote the paper and boost subscriptions, Rutberg has been hosting “Coffee with the President" events around Berkshire county, and turnout has been good.
“Wherever I go, I hear 'You don't cover south county'; 'You don't cover north county.' But that's great because it shows they want more," he said.
There's some evidence the Eagle is rebounding, albeit slowly: daily circulation is holding at 14,179 and at 16,711 on Sunday, according to the latest figures from Alliance for Audited Media, while digital subscriptions increased to 3,976, as of March, from 2,474 last June.
Former owner Mark Miller said he noted the Eagle's improvement in a recent e-mail to the publisher.
“I told Fred I'd like to lodge a complaint: It's taking me much too long to read the paper now," he said.
Rutberg said it's a challenging time for newspapers, including the Eagle.
“Our print circulation is flat, but I like to say, 'Flat is the new black,' " he said, smiling. “I tell people to read one copy and buy two.
“Look, I'm very conscious that what we're doing is counter to national trends," Rutberg said, “but we're committed to making this the finest community newspaper in the country again."

TV mobster's mansion now on the market
Two decades after the debut of "The Sopranos," the house used in the filming of the HBO series is up for sale - long driveway, kitchen island and all.
The New York Times reports that owners Patti and Victor Recchia listed the North Caldwell, New Jersey, home for a "starting price" of $3.4 million.
While Zillow indicates the price is high for the area, Victor Recchia said it's impossible to quantify "the intrinsic value" of the house that mobster Tony Soprano called home.
The 1.5-acre property comes with a four-bedroom house, two garages and a detached guesthouse.
The house was chosen from 150 considered, the Times reported in 2002. While a studio replica was used for interior scenes after the series pilot, the production crew returned year after year to film the exterior.
OMAHA, Neb.
Record bid buys lunch with billionaire investor
An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million set in 2012 and 2016.
An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night on eBay with a winning bid of $4,567,888.
It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO from Omaha has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner a chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000, and the auction has only finished below $2 million once since 2010. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years.
VILNIUS, Lithuania
In annual baby race, competition just crawls
In Lithuania, the rat race of life apparently starts early.
Twenty-five babies have taken to the red carpet in Lithuania in a crawling race as their parents, grandparents and onlookers cheered the spectacle.
Saturday's event in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, was the 20th annual event staged by a local radio station to mark International Children's Day, celebrated on June 1.
An 11-month-old boy named Ignas managed to crawl over a few yards and reach the finish line first.

Explosions kill 10 people in Syrian city of Raqqa
Two explosions killed 10 people in Raqqa on Saturday in the latest attacks to hit the city in northern Syria, opposition activists reported.
The blasts occurred in two different locations in the city that was once the de facto capital of the Islamic State group. The attacks occurred after iftar, the meal after sunset that breaks daylong fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first blast was a roadside bomb in the city center. It said the second blast was carried out by a suicide attacker driving a vehicle at a checkpoint of U.S.-backed fighters in the central Naim Square, killing five fighters and five civilians.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

Texto completo: In the 33 years since the filmmaker Spike Lee released "She's Gotta Have It," about a Brooklyn artist and her romantic entanglements, he has written, directed and produced projects nonstop, including the movie "BlacKkKlansman," which won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay this year.
Last week, Mr. Lee's television series, "She's Gotta Have It," which is based on his breakout film, started its second season on Netflix. With so many projects underway, it's no wonder Mr. Lee, 62, spends most Sundays working. When he calls it a wrap, he heads to Manhattan's Upper East Side, where he lives with his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, an executive producer on his television series, his daughter, Satchel, 23, his son, Jackson, 21, and their Yorkshire terrier, Ginger.
WAKE UP I normally wake up at 6 or 7. I use my BlackBerry as my alarm. I don't know why people look at me crazy. Yes, I have a BlackBerry. I don't like typing on the iPhone. I wake up, brush my teeth, take a shower, put my clothes on, and I go to work. It's not like for me Sunday is the Sabbath. I got work to do. For me, it's not really work. I love what I'm doing.
OLDGIRL But I got other things. I got a life -- a beautiful wife and two lovely children. And a dog. Dog's name is Ginger. She's getting old. She can't walk up the steps no more, she has to be carried. Her hearing's going, too. We think we have two years left. The other day, I snuck up behind her and she didn't hear me. That never happened before.
LIL JOINTS I have two offices, so either I go to my N.Y.U. office, where I'm a tenured professor of film -- N.Y.U. Graduate Film school -- or the world headquarters of 40 Acres & a Mule, in the heart of Fort Greene, the People's Republic of Brooklyn, New York. It used to be a garage. I bought it when the getting was good.
DO THE RIGHT THING I get a coffee, egg whites and a bowl of grits. I'm trying to cut out bread. Oh, I have one slice of buttered, whole-wheat bread with grape jelly. I go to a place across the street. It's called Academy. Coffee, cream and three natural brown sugars.
No more sugar for me. In my generation, you lived for Saturdays because the cartoons. Advertisers knew it, and those commercials turned us into sugar crackheads. Frosted Flakes -- do you know how much sugar's in that? We have a scene in "Crooklyn." It's semi-autobiographical, so Delroy Lindo, who plays my father, pours two pounds of sugar in the Kool-Aid.
AND YA DON'T STOP There's various projects that come in between the big stuff. I've done a short film for the Killers, that song "Land of the Free." I'm doing something for Budweiser. I'm going in and out of the editing room. I don't stand behind my editor's back. Barry Brown's been my full-time editor since '88. We don't have to have big discussions. "Do this." Boom, boom, boom, boom. "All right. I'll tell you when I'm ready."
SUCKER FREE CITY I go to the bodega. I buy all the papers -- not The Post, but The New York Times and The Daily News. That was my chore growing up. I had to get the Sunday paper. Back then you had to do what your parents told you to do. There was no negotiation and discussion. You don't do it, you get hit. Now? We had to bribe. "You're not taking out the garbage? Don't ask me to go to a Knick game." "O.K., I'm taking out the garbage."
BAMBOOZLED I've lived in Manhattan over 20 years. I bought the house from Jasper Johns. He didn't leave a drop of paint, a paintbrush, nothing. There was a Rauschenberg door. Our broker said if you buy the house, you get to keep the door. We bought the house. There was no door. He took the hinges, too.
ALL THE INVISIBLE CHILDREN What's special about Sundays is that's really the only time the whole family is together. We all sit down to eat at 7. Tonya cooks. We talk -- what's happening with everybody, what's happening in the world. Then dinner's over, we got to clean up, put dishes in the dishwasher. Satchel and Jackson, they go out again. Most times Tonya and I are in bed before they come back home. I don't know where they are; I don't want to know.
HE GOT GAME Tonya and I go watch a movie. We also watch news. Tonya watches a lot of episodic stuff. Everything. I can't keep up with what she watches. I watch a lot of stuff. I'll see movies. "On the Waterfront" -- that's my guy, Budd Schulberg. In June, I'm watching the N.B.A. playoffs. Those games go on late.
THE ANSWER 10 o'clock, I'm going to bed. I don't need preparation to go to bed. Just go to bed. Turn the lights out, go to bed. My head hits the pillow, I'm out.

Texto completo: Each week, the editors of The New York Times's Modern Love column publish "Tiny Love Stories": reader-submitted tales of love and relationships, all told in 100 words or less. Here are three set on the beach. Fake Drowning, Real Connection It was 1971 down the Jersey Shore. He was a 20-year-old surfer. I was a 17-year-old lifeguard. He pretended he was drowning, and I threw him off the beach. Not long after, we were surprised to learn that we had a mutual friend. That friend took us out on a dinghy one night, dropping us off on a diving dock, where we sat, alone, and talked. After almost 50 years together, we still swim every day. -- Deborah Sovinee A
Bike-Shop Owner Plays Wingman The owner of the Taiwanese bike shop asked about the half-smiling dreamboat standing next to me. I answered "boyfriend" in Mandarin so that James -- who had flown across the ocean for the second time to see me -- wouldn't understand. "Your boyfriend is very tough," the owner said in English, betraying me. James's half-smile expanded. We rode to the beach and lay down, ignoring the stares that our black American presence garnered. I listened to the ocean, grateful that it wasn't too big to keep me from holding James's hand. -- Kiah Duggins Moonlight, Then Police Lights We met on a moonlit East Hampton beach in late August. Barely had the chemistry begun to sizzle when it was short-circuited by a sweep of police trucks with swirling spotlights that sent us scurrying to the safety of our cars. Gay men of a certain age and determination, neither of us was daunted by the display of policing power, and we drove to my house, where we continued our talk, a mix of flirtation and L.G.B.T.Q. politics. Fourteen years later, our conversation continues, both on and off the very same beach. -- Jonathan Silin DRAWING (DRAWING BY BENE ROHLMANN)

Texto completo: PITTSFIELD — As he was nearing 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges in Massachusetts, Fred Rutberg began thinking about what he might do next. He had served on the bench in Berkshire County for 20 years, and lived in Stockbridge for 40.
Then one soft summer night in 2014, Rutberg and his wife, Judith, were on Nantucket, listening to a talk at the island library by veteran political journalist Joe Klein.
“At some point, [Klein] said, offhandedly, 'Democracy requires citizenship and citizenship requires a town square,' " Rutberg said. “And when he said that, I whispered to my wife, 'The Berkshire Eagle.' "
Five years later, the former district court judge is president and publisher of the Eagle, a once-great daily newspaper whose staff, circulation, and prestige all declined dramatically during two decades of corporate ownership. Backed by a group with local ties and deep pockets, Rutberg bought the moribund paper in May 2016 and began investing in it, hiring reporters and editors, adding new sections, revitalizing its website, even spending money on better-quality newsprint.
So far, the results are promising. Print subscriptions, which had been dropping for years, are holding steady, and the Eagle's digital subscriptions are growing — by an impressive 60 percent since June 2018. Last year, the Eagle received the New England Newspaper & Press Association's award for general excellence, and its daily and Sunday editions swept the Newspaper of the Year awards for papers of its size. And not coincidentally, there has been an increase in furrowed brows among local officials who are now being confronted by a more active press.
“I wanted to do something useful," said Rutberg, sitting behind his desk at the Eagle's offices in a converted mill building on the edge of downtown. “I wanted to try to do some good around here."
Most stories about newspapers these days end badly. According to a recent University of North Carolina study, gloomily titled “The Expanding News Desert," nearly 1,800 papers in the United States have closed since 2004, and many others, facing steep declines in circulation and advertising, have been taken over by chains whose first priority is profit, not news.
The Berkshire Eagle's previous owner, MNG Enterprises, is an example. The Colorado publishing company, formerly known as Digital First Media, is a subsidiary of Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund with a track record of buying beleaguered papers and slashing costs to raise profits. Called “vulture capitalists" by critics, MNG owns dozens of newspapers, including The Denver Post, The Mercury News of San Jose, the Los Angeles Daily News, the Fitchburg Sentinel & Enterprise, and the Boston Herald, which it bought out of bankruptcy last year and promptly cut a quarter of the staff.
“People in the Berkshires won the lottery when [Rutberg's group] bought the Eagle," said newspaper analyst Ken Doctor. “It's rare to see local people with the willingness, the capital, and the stamina to step up and do the really heavy lifting to transform an old newspaper in the digital age."
Rutberg, who grew up in Philadelphia, was 26 when he moved to the Berkshires, opening a law practice in Stockbridge in 1974. As a boy, he'd attended summer camp nearby and enjoyed the natural beauty of westernmost Massachusetts. As a grown-up, he marveled at the area's thriving cultural scene, including Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home in Lenox, the renowned Jacob's Pillow dance center in Becket, and the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown.
The county also boasted an uncommonly good newspaper that had been owned for decades by the Miller family. With a flatbed press and one typesetting machine, Kelton B. Miller started publishing the Eagle in 1892, succeeded by sons Pete and Don in 1941, and by grandsons Mark and Michael in the 1980s. Throughout, the Millers poured money into the paper, turning a modest profit even as they maintained an unusually large staff for a paper with a circulation, at its peak, of about 35,000.
“My uncle used to say that we put out a much better paper than we should," said Mark Miller.
Over time, the Eagle earned a national reputation for being tough and meticulous in its reporting. In 1972, Washington Post press critic Ben Bagdikian told Time magazine there were only three great newspapers in the world: The New York Times, Le Monde, and The Berkshire Eagle.
The Eagle became a training ground for talented young journalists. Notable alums include Gustav Niebuhr, who became a respected religion writer at The New York Times; Richard Weil, a longtime editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; Helen Donovan, onetime executive editor of the Globe; Priscilla Painton, executive editor at Simon & Schuster; and Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and killed in Pakistan in 2002 while reporting a story about Al Qaeda. Other celebrated Eagle staffers included Abe Michelson, the State House reporter whose behind-the-scenes “Beacon Hill" column ran in eight Massachusetts papers, including the Globe, and Roger Linscott, the Eagle editorial writer who won the paper's only Pulitzer Prize in 1973.
The Eagle even had a minor pop-culture moment in the early 1980s when actress Sally Field, playing an embattled reporter in the film “Absence of Malice," said her first job was “the summer when I was 16 on The Berkshire Eagle. I wonder if they'd have me back."
“The Eagle was absolutely indispensable," said Rutberg. “When I was practicing law, I used to say it was required reading. It didn't happen unless it was in the Eagle. The paper had a real hold on the community."
But the Eagle's fortunes turned in the late 1980s when the Miller grandchildren got involved in a questionable real estate deal, buying the former Sheaffer Eaton mill in Pittsfield and spending $23 million to renovate the 11-acre site to house the newspaper and, they hoped, other tenants.
It didn't work, and in 1987, the same year the Millers bought the decrepit mill complex, the stock market crashed, while the cost of newsprint soared. Soon after, General Electric, which once employed 13,000 people at its Pittsfield plant, announced mass layoffs, devastating the local economy. In 1995, drowning in debt, the Millers sold the Eagle and papers they owned in Vermont and Connecticut to William Dean Singleton, a Denver newspaper executive nicknamed “Lean Dean" because his company, MediaNews Group, pioneered a strategy of buying regional papers and cutting costs by consolidating business operations, ad sales, and printing.
“Dean fired me the day he took over," said Don MacGillis, who was editor in chief and editorial page editor during his two decades at the Eagle. “I told him I'd seen some of his other papers, and before he did to the Eagle what he'd done elsewhere, he ought to talk to subscribers.
“I don't think he appreciated that," said MacGillis, who later worked at the Globe.
Singleton, now retired, said he'd been an admirer of the Eagle for many years, but the paper was losing money when he bought it.
“I always suffered from not being the Millers," said Singleton, reached at his office in Denver. “I certainly plead guilty to insisting on economic responsibility. If a newspaper doesn't make money, it doesn't have a future, and the Eagle was not making money."
The Eagle continued to do good journalism, but the staff gradually shrunk; in its heyday, there were close to 60 people in the newsroom, well above the industry standard for a paper its size. The contraction did not go unnoticed by readers and advertisers.
“They just kept scaling back and back," said state Representative William “Smitty" Pignatelli, a Lenox native who grew up reading the Eagle. “It was sad because it had been a lifeline for so many people."
By 2014, when Rutberg was contemplating his next step, the Eagle had lost much of its luster. Alden Global Capital had gained a majority stake in MNG Enterprises and made even deeper cuts. Overnight, it also boosted the price of an annual Eagle subscription from $180 to $300.
Kevin Moran, the Eagle's executive editor, recalls a 2015 visit to the newsroom by Alden Global president Heath Freeman. Moran had been told Freeman was just dropping by to introduce himself, but then watched as the 35-year-old fund manager (once dubbed “the Gordon Gekko of newspapers" by business columnist Joe Nocera) spent six hours eliminating 20 positions from the newspaper's budget. At its lowest ebb, Moran said, the Eagle had five reporters scrambling to cover Berkshire County's two cities — Pittsfield and North Adams — 30 towns and many arts-and-culture organizations.
“Heath left that meeting saying Alden is a hedge fund and it's his job to maximize operational efficiencies and increase profits for shareholders," Moran said. “I want to be operationally efficient, too. I want this business to thrive. But people were picking up the Eagle at the end of their driveway and wondering what they were paying for."
Freeman, who seldom gives interviews, declined to comment for this story.
“Alden Global has a turn-out-the-lights strategy, a milk-it strategy," said Doctor, the newspaper analyst. “As revenues decline, they just continue to cut the enterprise to maintain cash flow. They know it won't last forever, and if they have to close a property, they will."
Even Singleton, who had a reputation as an enthusiastic cost-cutter, questions whether Alden Global chopped too much from its newspapers, including the Eagle.
“They've cut costs much more aggressively than we ever did," he said. “Sitting in a big office building in New York, they didn't care. We cared. I particularly cared about the Eagle."
Rutberg admits the idea of buying the Eagle was “pollyannaish." He didn't know the newspaper business, had no idea whether Alden Global was interested in selling, and, if it was, didn't have the money. Nonetheless, he started making calls, beginning with Hans Morris, managing partner of the venture capital firm Nyca Partners and a former president of Visa. An inveterate newspaper reader who has owned a house in Stockbridge for 30 years, Morris agreed to meet Rutberg for coffee. The notion of a local owner resuscitating the Eagle intrigued him, but Morris was hesitant to encourage Rutberg.
“It was a noble thing to do," he said. “But I didn't want to get into something that's just going to be a financial mess. I said, 'Let's see if there's any interest in even talking to us.' "
There was, but the two sides were far apart on price. A year later, in 2015, Alden Global came back with a lower number, and Rutberg assembled a group of investors that included Morris; Bob Wilmers, chief executive of Buffalo-based M&T Bank Corp. and a longtime homeowner in the Berkshires; and Stanford Lipsey, former owner of the Sun Newspaper Group in Nebraska and a part-time Berkshires resident.
A deal was struck in May 2016 — the sale price hasn't been disclosed — and in a letter to Eagle readers, Rutberg pledged to invest in the paper. (His group also bought back the Vermont papers formerly owned by the Millers: the Bennington Banner, the Brattleboro Reformer, and the Manchester Journal.)
“The goal is to make the Eagle a part of the finest community newspaper group in America," Rutberg wrote. “Our business plan is simple. By improving the quality and quantity of the content in our publications, we expect to increase our readership which will, in turn, increase our revenues, and ensure the future of these publications."
Three years later, Moran, the Eagle's executive editor, has a staff of 13 reporters, including two in the paper's reopened Great Barrington bureau. One recent hire is Larry Parnass, a longtime reporter and editor at The Daily Hampshire Gazette in Northampton, who is the Eagle's new investigations editor. In September 2017, Parnass wrote a 10,000-word story scrutinizing Van Shields, the former Berkshire Museum director who quarterbacked a controversial plan to sell 22 works of art, including paintings by Norman Rockwell, to raise money for museum renovations. The story generated enormous buzz in the community, and Shields left the museum less than a year later.
But the Eagle's energetic coverage has not been welcomed by everyone. Reporter Amanda Drane, who joined the Eagle in 2017, also from The Daily Hampshire Gazette, said some city officials in Pittsfield had grown unaccustomed to being questioned.
“A lot of what I do is educate prominent people who should know what an active press looks like," said Drane, laughing. “I've made some inroads with the Police Department, but, honestly, they've struggled to keep up with my demands."
Not long after the sale, Wilmers and Lipsey, who were both in their 80s, died. Rutberg declined to say if the business is profitable, but said their deaths have not affected the Eagle's viability. For the past year or so, to promote the paper and boost subscriptions, Rutberg has been hosting “Coffee with the President" events around Berkshire county, and turnout has been good.
“Wherever I go, I hear 'You don't cover south county'; 'You don't cover north county.' But that's great because it shows they want more," he said.
There's some evidence the Eagle is rebounding, albeit slowly: daily circulation is holding at 14,179 and at 16,711 on Sunday, according to the latest figures from Alliance for Audited Media, while digital subscriptions increased to 3,976, as of March, from 2,474 last June.
Former owner Mark Miller said he noted the Eagle's improvement in a recent e-mail to the publisher.
“I told Fred I'd like to lodge a complaint: It's taking me much too long to read the paper now," he said.
Rutberg said it's a challenging time for newspapers, including the Eagle.
“Our print circulation is flat, but I like to say, 'Flat is the new black,' " he said, smiling. “I tell people to read one copy and buy two.
“Look, I'm very conscious that what we're doing is counter to national trends," Rutberg said, “but we're committed to making this the finest community newspaper in the country again."
